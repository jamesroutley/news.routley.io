<li>hey! thanks for being here üíü</li>
<li>scary health thing resolved and it turns out i am fine and so everything in my immediate locus is now being viewed through rose tinted glasses. everything outside of that looks pretty terrifying still so don&#39;t worry the pink glasses still allow perspective ‚ò∫Ô∏è</li>
<li>seriously though, solidarity with all the oppressed peoples of the world living under the boot of capitalist fascism, on and also importantly offline. ‚úäüèø</li>
<li>it&#39;s been really hot this week. i do not enjoy being hotter than 24 degrees (centigrade) so it&#39;s been a trying time but i cracked out the fan and immediately regretted not cracking it out sooner!</li>
<li>i am feeling a little discouraged about learning to cycle, i suspect i&#39;m dyspraxic given other &#34;learning to do [insert physical skill]&#34; tasks being hard but the instructors all say i just need to practice more, so trying to keep the faith so far. reddit keeps pointing to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7GKK3liv8M">tom scott learning to cycle in like 20 minutes</a> as if he didn&#39;t know how to cycle at some point (he forgot?) and as if it&#39;s encouraging to be hours in and see him take to it like a duck to water lol.</li>
<li>on forgetting... my first instructor (you get a certain number of free lessons depending on funding so i&#39;m doing lessons with a charity atm, my local council before that and my work borough too if i make progress!) said that i should keep cycling asap to make sure i don&#39;t forget. i was immediately like &#34;it&#39;s not like riding a bike?&#34; and he said &#34;no, not at first&#34; which i find so funny. i need to check if i said this last time, i thought i must have done. search engine says i didn&#39;t so apologies if i told that funny before in different words!</li>
<li>i started reading <em>time surfing</em> which is about time management, i think i have a lot of time i don&#39;t use particularly well but this book is underlining it&#39;s more energy and motivation management than managing the actual tasks and time i have an issue with. also you will pry listening to music or watching a youtube video whilst doing [insert other activity] out of my cold dead hands, sort of listening to something and doing something else is a joy! it&#39;s the second recommendation he makes i think lol. going to not finish it for now.</li>
<li>i also started reading <em>half-earth socialism</em> and i may have to skip the opening provocation as it pisses me off. it annoys me when authors, who are presumably aware the vast majority of people reading said book are already bloody terrified about the climate, open their thought experiment on how to make things better with how terrible things could get. yes, i know, that&#39;s why i&#39;m here! doesn&#39;t fill me with confidence or will to keep reading in any way, but if you&#39;ve read it and it&#39;s good please tell me so i keep reading!</li>
<li>to be fair i think i do tend towards catastrophising so maybe the book just isn&#39;t for me and that&#39;s okay. it&#39;s part of why i can&#39;t be vegan despite many attempts and a few uni term-time year sprints; even reading about the ethical side makes me feel literally insane and like i shouldn&#39;t eat anything ever again still! if you can relate, stay away for utiliarianism ha ha. if you can&#39;t relate, they probably have a pledge or lifestyle to sell you, but i would also advise staying the hell away from them!</li>
<li>i have never been normal and casual about anything, i repeat to myself for the umpteenth time!</li>
<li>still working on <a href="https://frontendnorth.com/">my talk for FEN</a>, my video on social media for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@oluOnline">YouTube</a>, my next <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=alphabet-superset">alphabet superset post</a>, probably on luddites, and on personal coding projects at some point! i want to make an infinite outliner app with <a href="https://automerge.org/">automerge</a> partly cos fun, partly cos workflowy doesn&#39;t do everything i want, partly to learn how to use automerge, and partly to play around with frontend architectural decisions.</li>
<li>if you&#39;re a coder who learnt outside of university but knows a lot of algorithm stuff, i&#39;d be interested to know how you learnt, especially if you have weak maths and/or are not motivated by puzzles! i&#39;m willing to fill in the gaps maths wise, i know i&#39;m not incapable of learning it, but how is another question so maybe one at a time! i&#39;ve tried going through the top internet recommended books for uni students, <a href="https://csprimer.com/">cs primer</a> and <a href="https://www.0de5.net/">0de5</a>. the former i got stuck on the maths, latter two were too focused on &#34;interesting puzzles&#34; which do not motivate me on their own.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating banoffee ice cream, cream cheese and bacon everything bagels, and tomato, burrata and artichoke salad. i&#39;ve been drinking a lot of fizzy lemonade and lime cordial. i&#39;ve listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sZirWKsOBg">church girl by beyonce</a> (it has an epilepsy flashing light warning at the start so passing that on here!) a lot this week!</li>
<li>see you next week!</li>
