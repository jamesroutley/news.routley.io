    <h1>Music Melee: a high-speed parkour FPS for making beautiful sounds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="Music Melee gameplay screenshot 01" loading="lazy" src="https://gianluca.ai/music-melee/images/music-melee-screenshot-01.png"/></p><p>I recently released <a href="https://music-melee.vercel.app/">Music Melee</a>, a high-speed parkour FPS for making beautiful sounds and high scores in your browser.</p><ul><li>Code: <a href="https://github.com/gianlucatruda/music-melee">github.com/gianlucatruda/music-melee</a></li><li>Play now: <a href="https://music-melee.vercel.app/">music-melee.vercel.app</a></li></ul><p>I’m pretty happy with how it turned out for a few day’s work. I focussed on making it feel, sound, and look deeply satisfying.</p><p><img alt="Music Melee gameplay screenshot 02" loading="lazy" src="https://gianluca.ai/music-melee/images/music-melee-screenshot02.png"/></p><p>The twist? I vibecoded the entire thing for <a href="https://jam.pieter.com/">Vibe Jam 2025</a>. I used <a href="https://aider.chat/">Aider</a> in “architect” mode from my command line – OpenAI’s o3-mini analysed the code and planned how to apply my prompt, then handed the plan to Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 sonnet to execute the changes.</p><p><img alt="Vibecoding Music Melee with Aider" loading="lazy" src="https://gianluca.ai/music-melee/images/music-melee-aider.jpg"/></p><p>I’ve been using LLMs to supercharge coding for over two years now, with <a href="https://gianluca.ai/tags/llm/">mixed results</a>. But this was my first time fully embracing the exponentials. I just pretended the code wasn’t there and only did a few manual tweaks of constants and strings towards the end.</p><p><img alt="Music Melee commits, mostly Aider" loading="lazy" src="https://gianluca.ai/music-melee/images/music-melee-commits.png"/></p><p>I’ve learned a lot about the strengths and limitations of this approach and have lots of thoughts on that – blog post? – but wanted to share this in case anyone is interested in seeing what’s possible or just having fun playing a weird game for 2 minutes.</p><p>It works best on Chrome/Chromium and Safari, but Firefox/Zen has issues. I highly recommend trying it on desktop, but mobile does technically work (although very frustrating and fiddly).</p><p>If you try it, let me know what you love / hate about it!</p><ul><li><a href="https://x.com/gianluca_truda/status/1907827373279498677">Thread on X</a> with gameplay video</li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gianlucatruda.bsky.social/post/3llwby6l6lc2m">Thread on Bluesky</a> with gameplay video</li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43571169">Show HN: Music Melee – High-speed parkour FPS for making beautiful music | Hacker News</a></li></ul><hr/><p>Thanks for checking this out!
