<p>Watch</p>
<ul>
<li>Melissa and I have been on a bit of animated movie kick lately. We watched Shrek, Tangled, and Zootopia. All hold up realy well and are a delight to watch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listen</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT8i4E4NYXs">Chet Faker @ TheLotRadio 01-29-2024</a> is a great set of unreleased music from him. Very chill listening.</li>
<li><a href="https://gastropod.com/can-you-patent-a-pizza/">Can you patent a pizza?</a> is a great episode of Gastropod about the history of stuffed crust pizza and the patenting of food.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24108872/bluesky-ceo-graber-federation-social-media-decoder-interview">Decoder interview with Bluesky CEO Jay Graber</a> is a great interview and made me want to investigate Bluesky and their AT protocol more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read</p>
<ul>
<li>Caught up on my manga this week. Read the latest volumes of <a href="https://www.viz.com/spy-x-family">Spy x Family</a>, <a href="https://www.viz.com/call-of-the-night">Call of the Night</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lock">Blue Lock</a>. They aren&#39;t perfect, but they are all fun reads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_23">F1 23</a> and boy is it terrible. It was free on PlayStation, so I tried it out. Not for me. So for now I&#39;ll continue working on Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Libery and Baulder&#39;s Gate 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you have a great week!</p>
