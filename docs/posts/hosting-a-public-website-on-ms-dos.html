    <h1>Hosting a Public Website on MS-DOS</h1>

							If you can read this, this means that my setup <b>somehow</b> works. If you want to read this article for entertainment purposes, feel free to proceed.
							But if you intend to replicate my setup, please be aware that all DOS-based webservers are prone to a variety of issues:
							
							</p><ul>
								<li>
									You might be able to create dynamic websites with QuickBASIC or something similar. This has already been done and was proven possible, but it will be less comfortable than PHP.
								</li></ul><p>
							
							In order to host a public website on MS-DOS, I have rented a cheap VPS at Hetzner Online and a domain name at IONOS.
							I picked both companies because I&#39;ve been using their services for years, but for no other reason in particular. Any other provider will probably do just as well.
