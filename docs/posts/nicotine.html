          <blockquote>
            <p>In 2011, I became curious about nicotine gum/patches as a possible alternative stimulant to <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/modafinil" id="gwern-modafinil" title="&#39;Modafinil&#39;, Gwern 2009">modafinil</a>: its much shorter half-life makes it more useful for evenings or scenarios like needing a quick alert on a long drive. I looked briefly into the nicotine/tobacco research to see whether there was convincing evidence that nicotine on its own, without any tobacco or smoke-related delivery mechanism, is either more harmful than most stimulants or likely to lead to severe addiction to tobacco as a ‘gateway drug’.</p>
            <p>The psychological effects of nicotine as a stimulant are long established by a scattershot literature, so there are possible benefits.</p>
            <p>Cost-wise, much of the nicotine/tobacco literature willfully conflates the two, leading to misleading attribution of the harm of tobacco to nicotine; many associations with harm are confounded by past or present tobacco use (eg. <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2020-kenkel.pdf" id="kenkel-et-al-2020" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="E-Cigarettes and Respiratory Disease: A Replication, Extension, and Future Directions"><span><span><span title="et al">Kenkel</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2020</span></span></span></a>), but when pure nicotine is examined, as in patch/GUM NRT, the harms appeared minimal: like all stimulants, nicotine may raise blood pressure somewhat, and is addictive to some degree, but the risks do not appear much more strikingly harmful than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#bodyContent">caffeine</a> or modafinil (and certainly appear less than the many commonly-used amphetamines). Animal experiments are, like usual, highly ambiguous, of low quality, and of doubtful relevance to humans. There is little evidence from the NRT literature that ‘never-smokers’ like myself are all that likely to become highly addicted, and minimal epidemiological evidence of harm from NRT use over the past 3 decades it has been available.</p>
            <p>‘Vaping’ is another story: few experiments have been done, and its popularity is recent enough that any harms are poorly understood other than it can’t possibly be remotely as harmful as tobacco smoking, and its delivery mechanism plausibly is much more addictive than gum/patch delivery would be.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am personally comfortable using nicotine gum (but not vaping) once in a while, and have done so since 2011 without any noticeable problems or escalation in usage frequency.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons tobacco became so popular in the 1600s, along with tea &amp; coffee (for their caffeine), was that nicotine is a powerful stimulant. Obvious enough; it affects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Central_nervous_system" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">tons of systems</a>. Less obvious is that nicotine has many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Medical" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">beneficial effects</a> (and these benefits may be related to <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/animal-smoking-studieshtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">anomalous</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/smoking-followuphtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">smoking</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what-anti-smoking-evidencehtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">results</a><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>); the infamous deadliness of smoking would seem to be almost solely from the smoke, not the nicotine. Even less obvious is that nicotine itself may not be especially addictive, and its addictiveness is genetically modulated<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. (If nicotine was all that was going on, why do smokers struggle so much with their transition to NRT en route to quitting entirely? And why do so many people use nicotine gum or patches occasionally for long periods without being addicted, or quitting easily?)</p>
        <p>All of the harm seems to stem from tobacco, and tobacco smoking in particular; this is not necessarily obvious because almost everyone casually conflates tobacco with nicotine (especially public education programs<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>), treating them as a single synonymous evil I dub “nicbacco”. When someone or something says that “nicotine” is harmful and you drill down to the original references for their claims, the references often turn out to actually be talking about tobacco rather than nicotine gums or patches<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Other methodological issues include comparing to current smokers rather than former smokers or failing to control for the subjects being the sort of people who would begin such a societally-disapproved activity like smoking; the studies typically aren’t designed properly even for showing an effect: you need a study which finds deficits in smokers but not in non-smokers <em>or</em> former smokers (eg. <a href="https://www.medlive.cn/uploadfile/2011/1013/20111013114126307.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Smoking-related prospective memory deficits in a real-world task"><span><span><span title="et al">Heffernan</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2011</span></span></span></a> or <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414283" data-link-icon="JAMA" data-link-icon-type="text,sans,quad" title="Smoking History and Cognitive Function in Middle Age From the Whitehall II Study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2008</span></span></span></a>/<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2012-sabia.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Impact of smoking on cognitive decline in early old age: the Whitehall II cohort study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2012</span></span></span></a> although neither enables nicotine inferences since there was no nicotine-only control group). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak#bodyContent">2019 United States outbreak of lung illness linked to vaping products</a> offers a case in point of this prejudice: despite every sign pointing to adulterants added to illegal THC/marijuana vaping fluids by fly-by-night operators rather than nicotine (such as the decades of nicotine vaping by millions of people not causing them to land overnight in hospital ICUs), the outbreak has been used as an excuse to ban <em>legal nicotine</em> vaping fluids instead—which is like banning aspirin as a response to the opiate crisis because they’re both used for pain relief and they both come in pill form, and some OD victims also used aspirin recently, so that makes them pretty much the same thing, right?</p>

But on the other hand, as Le Foll et al comment:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Surprisingly, reinforcing effects of nicotine alone have often been difficult to demonstrate directly in controlled laboratory studies with both animals and humans as experimental subjects. Consequently, there has been continuing controversy in the literature about the validity of previous findings of reinforcing effects of nicotine in experimental animals and human subjects <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/1992-robinson.pdf" id="robinson-pritchard-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;The Role of Nicotine in Tobacco Use&#39;, Robinson &amp; Pritchard 1992">[3]</a>, <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/1992-west.pdf" id="west-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Nicotine addiction: a re-analysis of the arguments&#39;, West 1992">[4]</a>, <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2002-dar.pdf" id="dar-frenk-2002" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Nicotine Self-Administration in Animals: A Reevaluation&#39;, Dar &amp; Frenk 2002">[5]</a>, <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2004-dar.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Do smokers self-administer pure nicotine?

          <p>Or “Brain science, addiction and drugs” 2008:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The results showed that 40% of smokers receiving the [anti-nicotine] vaccine gave up smoking for nearly six months of follow-up; the highest smoking cessation rate (57%) was associated with the highest antibody response. These results are better than those seen in most nicotine replacement trials, but it is interesting that an unusually high proportion (31%) of the smokers receiving placebo also quit smoking for up to six months [Holman J (2005). “Helping patients kick the habit”. American Diabetes Association, DOC News 2, 1-2].</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>My take away is that there is addiction but it’s drastically overestimated by almost everyone and may been conflated with the habit-formation capability; the latter makes nicotine doubly valuable, but the former means we will want to be more careful with the nicotine than with modafinil or caffeine, where the main consequence of carelessness is tolerance rendering the stimulant useless or messing up our sleep for a few days.</p>
          <p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#Health_effects" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#bodyContent">snus</a>, a sort of chewing tobacco, has been studied extensively in Sweden where it is very popular and has been credited with large reductions in the smoking rate<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and with little hard evidence of harm from snus use<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Smokeless tobacco in general is hugely more safe than smoking (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/nov/12/20051112-102753-2328r/">“Smokeout: Not as easy as ABC”</a>, <em>Washington Times</em>):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Modern smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine in addictive doses to satisfy smokers’ cravings. University research has documented that smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco reduce their risk for all smoking-related illnesses, including oral cancer. On average, smokers live 8 years less than those who never used tobacco; smokeless users lose just 15 days. Statistically, smokeless users have about the same risk of dying as automobile users.</p>

            <p>“People are unreasonably afraid of nicotine”, Dr. Shiffman said. “The majority of smokers believe that nicotine causes cancer and is a big player in the harm caused by cigarettes.” In fact, carbon monoxide, tar and the countless toxic particles in cigarette smoke are what promote illness. Although smokers may become dependent on nicotine, it does not appear to raise the risk of cancer, lung disease or heart disease. Early reports that people who smoked cigarettes while wearing a patch stood an increased risk of heart attack proved unfounded years ago.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Dr. Siegel, whose graduate school manuscripts Dr. Glantz used to read, says e-cigarette pessimists are stuck on the idea that anything that looks like smoking is bad. “They are so blinded by this ideology that they are not able to see e-cigarettes objectively,” he said. Dr. Glantz disagrees. “E-cigarettes seem like a good idea,” he said, “but they aren’t.”…Public health experts like to say that people smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar. And the reason e-cigarettes have caused such a stir is that they take the deadly tar out of the equation while offering the nicotine fix and the sensation of smoking. For all that is unknown about the new devices - they have been on the American market for only seven years - most researchers agree that puffing on one is far less harmful than smoking a traditional cigarette…E-cigarette skeptics have also raised concerns about nicotine addiction. But many researchers say that the nicotine by itself is not a serious health hazard. Nicotine-replacement therapies like lozenges and patches have been used for years. Some even argue that nicotine is a lot like caffeine: an addictive substance that stimulates the mind. “Nicotine may have some adverse health effects, but they are relatively minor,” said Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent his career studying the pharmacology of nicotine…“Part of the furniture for us is that the tobacco industry is evil and everything they do has to be opposed,” said John Britton, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham in England, and the director for the U.K. Center for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies. “But one doesn’t want that to get in the way of public health.”</p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p><span>Dozens of studies have assessed the effects of nicotine on cognition in healthy, nicotine-naïve samples including studies of memory (<span><span title="et al">McClernon</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2003</span></span>), attention (<span><span title="et al">Froeliger</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2009</span></span>) and inhibitory control (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). In a recent meta-analysis of 48 studies in which nicotine was administered to non-smokers or only minimally deprived smokers (<span><span title="et al">Heishman</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2010</span></span>), nicotine was shown to have positive effects on multiple domains including attention and working memory. Twenty-nine studies specifically assessed non-smokers and among those, positive effects were observed for reaction time on tests of sustained (or alerting) attention and working memory.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Studies of the effects of nicotine on inhibitory control were not included in the meta-analysis, but a handful of studies suggest potential positive effects of nicotine on this domain. Two small studies have observed acute (<span><span title="et al">Levin</span> <span>et al</span> <span>1998</span></span>) and chronic (<span><span title="et al">McClernon</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2006</span></span>) transdermal nicotine administration to result in trends toward decreases in errors of commission on a CPT task. Moreover, nicotine has been shown to reduce CPT commission errors in nonsmokers with schizophrenia (<span><span title="et al">Barr</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2007</span></span>), non-smokers low in attentiveness (Poltavski and Petros, 2006); and decrease stop signal reaction time in adolescents nonsmokers with ADHD (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). Despite these findings, nicotine was not shown to improve response inhibition in adults with ADHD as measured with a CPT task (<span><span title="et al">Levin</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2001</span></span>).</span></p>

                <p>“Our brains normally make these associations between things that support our existence and environmental cues so that we conduct behaviors leading to successful lives. The brain sends a reward signal when we act in a way that contributes to our well being,” said Dr. John A. Dani, professor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the study. “However, nicotine commandeers this subconscious learning process in the brain so we begin to behave as though smoking is a positive action.” Dani said that environmental events linked with smoking can become cues that prompt the smoking urge. Those cues could include alcohol, a meal with friends, or even the drive home from work. To understand why these associations are so strong, Dani and Dr. Jianrong Tang, instructor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the report, decided to record brain activity of mice as they were exposed to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco.</p>
                <p>…“The brain activity change was just amazing,” Dani said. “Compared to injections of saline, nicotine strengthened neuronal connections-sometimes up to 200 percent. This strengthening of connections underlies new memory formation.”…“We found that nicotine could strengthen neuronal synaptic connections only when the so called reward centers sent a dopamine signal. That was a critical process in creating the memory associations even with bad behavior like smoking.”</p>

                <p>I have had success working around ‘Ugh’ reactions to various activities. I took the direct approach. I (intermittently) use nicotine lozenges as a stimulant while exercising. Apart from boosting physical performance and motivation it also happens to be the most potent substance I am aware of for increasing habit formation in the brain…</p>
                <p>And I do use nicotine for studying at times (usually patches that I have cut into the desired dose). Partly for learning mental habits and partly for enhanced focus and motivation without the agitation that comes (with methamphetamine (at least, for me)). Again, I don’t swear by it but it works…<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
                <p>I have never smoked a cigarette. Nor have I ever had a remote tendency towards addiction to any substance. That is even one of the reasons I gave when describing why this is an effective technique for me personally. I am more at risk of becoming addicted to discussing substances on the Internet than the substances themselves….</p>
                <p>I should note that the role nicotine lozenges are taking here is not primarily as a training reward, like giving the rat electronically stimulated orgasms when it presses the lever. Nicotine isn’t particularly strong in that role compared to alternatives (such as abusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#bodyContent">Ritalin</a>), at least when it is not administered by a massive hit straight into the brain via the lungs. No, the particular potency of nicotine is that it potentates the formation of habits for activities undertaken while under the influence by means more fundamental than a ‘mere’ stimulus-reward mechanism. Habits that are found to be harder to extinct than an impulse to take a drug. This is what makes smoking so notoriously hard to quit even with patches and makes the use of fake cigarettes to suck on useful.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

            <p>The price is not an issue. Nicotine in the US is not as expensive as one might intuitively guess from sky-high cigarette prices &amp; widespread tobacco smuggling; perhaps due to the intrinsic low cost of nicotine or because it is politically unpalatable to tax products which are largely used by people quitting smoking, prices for a 2mg dose of nicotine is easily in the 15-20 cents range:</p>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>2mg may be too much for a non-smoker like me, in which case prices per dose drop further. Nor have I looked hard<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> for low prices; just grabbed random hits on Amazon. You could probably drive it down to the 5-10 cents range with canny shopping and buying in bulk (nicotine is an insecticide, not a perishable foodstuff, so you could buy years’ worth - just like with <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/melatonin" id="gwern-melatonin" title="&#39;Melatonin&#39;, Gwern 2008">melatonin</a>). One difficulty with gum, however, is that it’s hard to subdivide: nicotine evaporates from gum and so cutting up a 4mg piece of gum into 4 1mg pieces forces you to either use them all within a few hours, waste some pieces, or store them in some sort of air-tight wrapper for later use.</p>
            <p>Further, the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette#bodyContent">e-cigarettes</a> which use nicotine dissolved in water means that if you are willing to have the nicotine absorbed quickly (which would seem to slightly increase addiction risks), the price for a 2mg dose plummets even further; consider <a href="https://www.nicvape.com/store/p/48-1-liter-of-100-mg-ml.aspx">one liter</a> of fluid for e-cigarettes (<span data-year-original="2012" data-amount-original="232" data-year-current="2023" data-amount-current="306.11" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $232 in 2012 → real $306.11 in 2023">$306.11<span><sup>$232</sup><sub>2012</sub></span></span> as of 2012, but down to <span data-year-original="2013" data-amount-original="160" data-year-current="2023" data-amount-current="207.99" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $160 in 2013 → real $207.99 in 2023">$207.99<span><sup>$160</sup><sub>2013</sub></span></span> as of October 2013).

                <p>You could become addicted despite everything. Hypothetically, this could then lead to tobacco use with all the attendant ills.</p>
                <p>This is a truly subjective one. Former smokers probably should not be monkeying about with nicotine. Some people are scared this might happen; others aren’t worried at all. Given what I’ve read about nicotine not being addictive but strengthening habits (see previous quotes from Wedrifid), I think this fear might be overblown.</p>

            <p>Nicotine gum or patch use seems to be extremely rare among people who have not previously smoked (“never smokers”), which makes it hard to judge the risk of developing dependence, or the risk of developing dependence and then moving on to tobacco.</p>

              <p>People who were addicted to the nicotine gum could easily find our questionnaire, because it was listed on top of the list in Google. In spite of this effective enrolment strategy, we identified only two never-users of tobacco among daily gum users, which suggests that NRT use in never-users of tobacco is a rare phenomenon. Similarly, a previous survey in people who responded to a newspaper ad that read: “Are you addicted to nicotine gum?” could not enrol any never smoker <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2004-hughes.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Misuse of and dependence on over-the-counter nicotine gum in a volunteer sample&#39;, Hughes et al 2004">[5]</a>.

In two surveys in the USA, 2.7% and 4.6% of school drug counsellors indicated that nicotine patches and gums were abused by adolescents, but these “NRT abusers” were mainly smokers who used NRT while smoking, and only 7% to 16% of these “NRT abusers” were never smokers [<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2005-hyland.pdf" id="hyland-et-al-2005" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Drug Counselor Report of Adolescents Abuse of Nicotine Replacement Therapy&#39;, Hyland et al 2006">27</a>]. The latter study did not report any case of NRT dependence in adolescent never smokers [27].

Therefore, addiction to nicotine gum in never smokers is probably very rare. Furthermore, there may be few adverse consequences of being addicted to the nicotine gum, except for the financial cost and the inconvenience of permanent chewing. In particular, NRT products are safe even in patients with heart disease, [<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199612123352402" id="joseph-et-al-1996" data-link-icon="NEJM" data-link-icon-type="text,quad" title="&#39;The safety of transdermal nicotine as an aid to smoking cessation in patients with cardiac disease&#39;, Joseph et al 1996">31</a>,<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/1997-mahmarian.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Nicotine Patch Therapy in Smoking Cessation Reduces the Extent of Exercise-Induced Myocardial Ischemia&#39;, Mahmarian et al 1997">32</a>] and there was no untoward effect of 5 years of nicotine gum use in the Lung Health Study [<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/1996-murray.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Safety of nicotine polacrilex gum used by 3,094 participants in the Lung Health Study&#39;, Murray et al 1996">33</a>].

About one third of smokers report having ever used NRT products (</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1748084/pdf/v014p00359a.pdf" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cacdd4df20d20420f032a348a1e9026123719754.pdf" title="When California smokers use nicotine replacement therapy, most are trying to quit smoking">Al-Delaimy, Gilpin, &amp; Pierce, 2005</a>). Thus, even if only 1% of users became dependent on the gum, this would still represent tens of thousands of people…Even though some users may be dependent on the gum, it must be emphasized that there is no known adverse consequence of long-term use of NRT, except for the financial cost, and that the potential benefits (ie. prevent late relapse) far outweigh the drawbacks. This is probably why dependence on the nicotine gum has been generally downplayed in the literature (<a href="https://www.hri.global/files/2011/07/13/West_-_Abuse_Liability_-_copyright_refused.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.hri.global/b972f9499e9e5d8846a6c1d9e487d829eff52c5c.pdf" title="A comparison of the abuse liability and dependence potential of nicotine patch, gum, spray and inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">West</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2000</span></span></span></a> [see also <a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/49.full" data-link-icon="bmj" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans" title="A prospective study of off-label use of, abuse of, and dependence on nicotine inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">Hughes</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2005</span></span></span></a>]).</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>About 35% of users reported becoming addicted, but this was heavily dependent upon variety of nicotine. Among users who smoked normal tobacco cigarettes, 65% reported addiction. Among those who smoked e-cigarettes, only 25% reported addiction (and again, since there’s no time data, it’s possible these people switched to e-cigarettes because they were addicted and not vice versa). Among users of nicotine gum and lozenges, only 7% reported addiction, and only 1% reported major addiction. Although cigarettes are a known gigantic health/addiction risk, the nootropic community’s use of isolated nicotine as a stimulant seems from this survey (subject to the above caveat) to be comparatively but not completely safe.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>One approach to estimating addictiveness of nicotine gum or patches is to borrow a strategy from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611984/" id="fagerström-eissenberg-2012" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Dependence on Tobacco and Nicotine Products: a case for product-specific assessment"><span><span><span>Fagerstrom &amp; Eissenberg</span><span>2012</span></span></span></a> in looking at the success of various studies’ control groups (using nicotine gums or patches) in quitting during those studies:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The intention here was not to estimate the effect of the treatment but rather its placebo to determine how difficult it is to stop using a certain form of tobacco/nicotine product. Therefore, the success rate in the placebo group is used as indicators for difficulty abstaining. Table 2 shows that cigarette smokers, independent of treatment, show a success rate of roughly 10% with little variation (range 9.8-11.2). Those seeking to stop ST use have roughly more than double the success rate of cigarette smokers (range 19.1-33.0). In the study (<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2013-tonnesen.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Varenicline to Stop Long-term Nicotine Replacement Use: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial">Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012</a>), where 69 long-term users of pure nicotine mostly in the form of gum, in average seven years, a success rate of 36% was observed. Those who become long-term users of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are recognized as heavy dependent smokers (<a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/1988-hajek.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Long-term use of nicotine chewing gum. Occurrence, determinants, and effect on weight gain">Hajek, Jackson, &amp; Belcher, 1988</a>), which also seemed to be true in this study. Their cigarette consumption before quitting was 24.5 per day and their recalled FTCD score from when they were smoking was a high 6.7. It can be hypothesized that this type of smoker would have had no better success rate in stopping than the 10% seen normally but when coming off long-term NRT, it was 36%. The 36% was obtained from a 1-year follow-up. Several of the smokeless studies reported success rates from 6 months. It is of interest to note that the authors excluded long-term patch users since it would have been unlikely to see a difference between active and placebo treatment due to the ease by which they normally can stop. Moreover, it is much more infrequent to observe long-term patch use (Shiffman, Hughes, Pillitteri, &amp; Burton, 2003). It seems as a patch is not very likely to be able to support a compulsive use pattern due to its little behavioral involvement and or pharmacokinetic nicotine uptake pattern. The data in Table 2 lead us to conclude that quitting cigarette smoking is more difficult than quitting ST (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2997603/" id="fagerström-et-al-2010" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Stopping smokeless tobacco with varenicline: randomized double blind placebo controlled trial">Fagerström, Gilljam, Metcalfe, Tonstad, &amp; Messig, 2010</a>) and, although there is only one study from the NR category, that quitting these products may be easiest (Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>What does this imply for any never-smoker (not predisposed to tobacco use) using nicotine gum/patches judiciously and self-monitoring for signs of dependence, well aware of the dangers of tobacco use? Given the lack of observations despite large datasets, the low rates of dependence in smokers, the ease of quitting nicotine gum, and so on, my personal opinion is that the risk of dependency should be much lower than the smoker risks of 1-20% and then the risk even lower of then progressing to tobacco use. (In considering cost-benefit, it’s worth remembering that tobacco use has been quit successfully by many millions despite the notorious difficulty, and that the health outcomes of quitters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#Health_benefits" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#bodyContent">gradually heal</a> to the baseline of non-smokers.)</p>

          <p>So what’s the upshot?

The negatives universally seem to be long-term negatives, and even if nicotine turns out to be something I haul out only in a crisis or every few weeks, it would still have been worth investigating.</p>

Are they right? I don’t know. As deliciously contrarian as it would be to go around shocking people by seriously advocating tobacco use, it’s not a subject I’m interested in tackling. In philosophy, one is taught to not “try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much#bodyContent">prove too much</a>” (inviting people to <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/modus" id="gwern-modus" title="&#39;One Man’s Modus Ponens&#39;, Branwen 2012"><em>modus tollens</em> your <em>modus ponens</em></a>), to not do more philosophy than one <em>has</em> to; in programming, you learn to not become an “architecture astronaut” solving some hugely abstract version of your actual problem - such overreach invites disaster.</p>
          <p>It’s much easier for me to defend use of nicotine, so that’s all I try to do: nicotine is pretty much harmless, the studies are clear, the relevant areas &amp; studies comprehensible with not <em>too</em> much work, and I feel I can discuss it with a clean conscience. Really, about the worst you can say about pure nicotine use is that it might be a gateway to tobacco or that one’s blood pressure might increase, which are issues that can be easily addressed empirically via additional studies/surveys or by eg. measuring one’s own blood pressure after taking nicotine, respectively.</p>
          <p>But if I wanted to defend tobacco itself, I have abruptly expanded my task by <em>orders of magnitude</em>: now I need to deal with all the anti-smoking correlational studies, I need to defend an idiosyncratic interpretation of how the tobacco industry’s products have evolved over the last century, I need to defend not just nicotine but all the other substances in tobacco which might override its benefits, I need to explain why the nigh-universal consensus against tobacco is wrong and to give a historical account of how such an error could come into exist and then expand to be universal. This is an <em>incredible</em> amount of work; any one of these points represents more work than this entire article and plausibly more work than this entire site. One could (and men have) spent entire careers working on small parts of the puzzle just outlined.</p>
          <p>It’s also bad from the rhetorical point of view: defending tobacco requires me to engage in what looks like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">partisan</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">politics</a> &amp; revisionist history. It is challenging beliefs that are, rightly or wrongly, deeply entrenched. Many people have enough flexibility to think, even if a relative died horribly of lung cancer, that nicotine was only the addictive stimulating agent and the <em>real</em> killer was the smoke or the tar or something, and so are willing to consider that nicotine - on its own - might be useful. They are not willing to consider the whole package.</p>
          <p>You can see the difference in the tasks by comparing this one page to the multiple threads in Imminst alone with <em>scores</em> of pages in each. One is short and clear and easily evaluated on its own terms (I hope), and has met with neutral or positive reactions from everyone I’ve asked to read it; the other comes off as a crank laying out an entire worldview, filled with ad hominems, bad faith, and clearly has not changed anyone’s minds.</p>

              <p>I was reading the Wikipedia nicotine article and thought that the figure cited for estimated American cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#bodyContent">ADHD</a> caused by nicotine - 500,000 - seemed remarkably high and suspected it and the previous sentence were not about nicotine at all, but tobacco.

Sloppy work even for Wikipedia. I don’t think that any malice was involved, just the general assumption that ‘nicbacco’ is harmful and the distinction between nicotine and tobacco unimportant.</p>
              <p>Another example is a breathless media article <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/children-exposed-to-nicotine-in-utero-have-lower-reading-scores/" data-url-archive="/doc/www/scitechdaily.com/7459c763817f10b7b69dafe80664ba9fb85bffff.html">“Children Exposed to Nicotine in Utero Have Lower Reading Scores”</a> on <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/doc/nicotine/2012-cho.pdf" id="cho-et-al-2012" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Prenatal Exposure to Nicotine and Impaired Reading Performance"><span><span><span title="et al">Cho</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2012</span></span></span></a>: here we can’t blame the media or Wikipedia editors because the paper itself (a longitudinal correlational study) has “nicotine” in its title and abstract (a total of 8 times), though the abstract quietly mentions it is <em>actually</em> a study of “maternal smoking”, and so of little interest to anyone interested in nicotine because there are hundreds or thousands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding#bodyContent">confounding</a> substances in tobacco smoke (on top of what smoking while pregnant says about the mothers in the first place, something which is only partially controllable for); the authors construct a sort of nicotine exposure index based on daily cigarette consumption &amp; nicotine-content of brands, but as far as I can tell, they never analyze whether the results based on this index are the same as if they had analyzed it the same way for eg. total cigarettes smoked or total tar content. This is not to say that nicotine has no impact on developing brains (many useful drugs or stimulants are contraindicated for non-adults), but their results do not seem to warrant their description. I was amused in 2013 when a Pubmed alert brought me word of a 2013 paper led by Cho titled “Prenatal Exposure to Nicotine and Impaired Reading Performance”; besides the title, the abstract uses the word “nicotine” 7 times and “maternal smoking” just 1 time - and replicates the above procedure yet again. With research like this, is it any wonder that ‘nicbacco’ is alive and well in phrases like “nicotine-stained”?<a href="#fnref4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

It’s not the general public that annoys me, it’s the scientists. When I tell them about the studies, they should say, ‘Wow.’ But they say, ‘Oh well, that might be true, but I don’t see the point.’ It’s not even ignorance.

                <p>A study involving sixty-seven people with mild cognitive impairment, in which memory is slightly impaired but decision-making and other cognitive abilities remain within normal levels, found “significant nicotine-associated improvements in attention, memory, and psychomotor speed,” with excellent safety and tolerability….”…And we’ve seen absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. There doesn’t seem to be any abuse liability whatsoever in taking nicotine by patch in nonsmokers. That’s reassuring.” That’s not reassuring: it’s totally bizarre. Nicotine has routinely been described in news accounts as among the most addictive sub-stances known. As the New York Times Magazine famously put it in 1987, “nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine or amphetamines, and for most people more addictive than alcohol.” But that’s just wrong. <em>Tobacco</em> may well be as addictive as heroin, crack, alcohol, and Cherry Garcia combined into one giant crazy sundae. But as laboratory scientists know, getting mice or other ani-mals hooked on nicotine all by its lonesome is dauntingly difficult. As a 2007 paper in the journal Neuropharmacology put it, “Tobacco use has one of the highest rates of addiction of any abused drug. Paradoxically, in animal models, nicotine appears to be a weak reinforcer.” That same study, like many others, found that other ingredients in tobacco smoke are necessary to amp up nicotine’s addictiveness. Those other chemical ingredients - things like acetaldehyde, anab-asine, nornicotine, anatabine, cotinine, and myosmine - help to keep people hooked on tobacco. On its own, nicotine isn’t enough.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>Watching TV for an average of six hours a day could shorten the viewer’s life expectancy by almost five years, indicates <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/46/16/1144.2.abstract" data-link-icon="bmj" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans">research published online in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em></a>. The impact rivals that of other well known behavioural risk factors, such as smoking and lack of exercise, the study suggests. Sedentary behaviour - as distinct from too little exercise - is associated with a higher risk of death, particularly from heart attack or stroke. Watching TV accounts for a substantial amount of sedentary activity, but its impact on life expectancy has not been assessed, say the authors. They used previously published data on the relationship between TV viewing time and death from analyses of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), as well as Australian national population and mortality figures for 2008, to construct a lifetime risk framework.</p>
                <p>…Based on these figures, and expected deaths from all causes, the authors calculated that an individual who spends a lifetime average of six hours a day watching TV can expect to live just under five fewer years than someone who does not watch TV. These figures compare with the impact of other well known lifestyle factors on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease after the age of 50, including physical activity and obesity. For example, other research has shown that lifelong smoking is associated with the shortening of life expectancy by more than 4 years after the age of 50, with the average loss of life from one cigarette calculated to be 11 minutes - equivalent to half an hour of TV watching, according to the authors’ risk framework.</p>

              <p>I am generally a skeptic of any claims to boost IQ in healthy adults.

Nicotine, compared to placebo, improved accuracy (P ϭ 0.008) in all active conditions (2%-11%), and had a load-specific effect on latency (P = 0.004; 43.78% decrease at the highest memory load).

                <p>“People with memory loss should not start smoking or using nicotine patches by themselves because there are harmful effects of smoking and a medication such as nicotine should only be used with a doctor’s supervision,” Newhouse said. “But this study provides strong justification for further research into the use of nicotine for people with early signs of memory loss which may help us determine whether benefits persist over long periods of time and provide meaningful improvement.”</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>In human populations, cigarettes and alcohol generally serve as gateway drugs, which people use first before progressing to marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit substances. To understand the biological basis of the gateway sequence of drug use, we developed an animal model in mice and used it to study the effects of nicotine on subsequent responses to cocaine. We found that pretreatment of mice with nicotine increased the response to cocaine, as assessed by addiction-related behaviors and synaptic plasticity in the striatum, a brain region critical for addiction-related reward. Locomotor sensitization was increased by 98%, conditioned place preference was increased by 78%, and cocaine-induced reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by 24%. The responses to cocaine were altered only when nicotine was administered first, and nicotine and cocaine were then administered concurrently. Reversing the order of drug administration was ineffective; cocaine had no effect on nicotine-induced behaviors and synaptic plasticity. Nicotine primed the response to cocaine by enhancing its ability to induce transcriptional activation of the FosB gene through inhibition of histone deacetylase, which caused global histone acetylation in the striatum. We tested this conclusion further and found that a histone deacetylase inhibitor simulated the actions of nicotine by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)#bodyContent">priming</a> the response to cocaine and enhancing FosB gene expression and LTP depression in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, in a genetic mouse model characterized by reduced histone acetylation, the effects of cocaine on LTP were diminished. We achieved a similar effect by infusing a low dose of theophylline, an activator of histone deacetylase, into the nucleus accumbens. These results from mice prompted an analysis of epidemiological data, which indicated that most cocaine users initiate cocaine use after the onset of smoking and while actively still smoking, and that initiating cocaine use after smoking increases the risk of becoming dependent on cocaine, consistent with our data from mice. If our findings in mice apply to humans, a decrease in smoking rates in young people would be expected to lead to a decrease in cocaine addiction.</p>

                <p>The patch was clearly effective as an aid to smoking abstinence. Despite the large number of patients in the analysis, few adverse cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, tachycardia, arrhythmia, angina) were reported, and no excess of these outcomes was detected among patients assigned to nicotine-patch use. The incidences of several minor adverse effects were clearly elevated among the nicotine-patch groups, especially sleep disturbances, nausea or vomiting, localised skin irritation and respiratory symptoms, but the background rates and risk ratios varied considerably across studies. The incidence of nausea or vomiting appeared to be lowest when the patch dose was tapered. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that very large studies would be needed to assess the effect of the patch, if any, on serious, rare outcomes.</p>

              <p>It can be entertaining to read nicotine research papers - the reviews especially resemble a bad-news-good-news comedy sketch where for every couple pieces of good news, there’s bad news. (One rather wonders, if nicotine is doing all these helpful things, what the mortality rate would be for nicotine-<em>free</em> cigarettes.) For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2750958/" id="gahring-rogers-2006" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression and function on nonneuronal cells&#39;, Gahring &amp; Rogers 2006">“Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Expression and Function on Nonneuronal Cells”</a><span>, <span><span>Gahring &amp; Rogers</span><span>2006</span></span>:</span></p>

                <p>Of the thousands of proven carcinogens and toxic agents contained within a cigarette, nicotine, while being the addictive agent, is often viewed as the least harmful of these compounds.</p>
                <p>Subsequent studies<sup>2-4</sup> have suggested that chronic nicotine administration might in fact play a beneficial role in slowing the progression of this disease. While this finding is controversial, there is now ample evidence supporting a therapeutic benefit from nicotine in Parkinson’s<sup>5</sup> disease, and as a neuroprotectant to toxic insults such as excitotoxins<sup>6-10</sup> or Beta-amyloid derived peptides.<sup>10-12</sup> Understanding the mechanistic basis for these and other similarly interesting findings,13 including a cognitive benefit from nicotine,<sup>2</sup> would be of obvious importance….This extended expression of nAChRs is of importance because, in addition to their regulation by endogenous agonists such as acetylcholine, choline, and the exogenous compound nicotine, their impact upon peripheral processes can be quite diverse as exemplified by their ability to in some cases enhance (Crohn’s disease) disease or in other cases diminish (ulcerative colitis) progression.<sup>17-20</sup>…While smoking is a major causative factor for lung cancer, relatively few smokers generate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has an incidence rate of ~20%, even among very heavy and long-term smokers.<sup>61</sup></p>
                <p>…While nicotine has anti-inflammatory properties in this disease, the therapeutic value of nicotine does not exceed that of more conventional treatments such as aminosalicylates.<sup>48</sup></p>
                <p>Therefore, while cells are present that are primed for activation, the immune and inflammatory response may be dampened, as has been observed in many smokers.<sup>62</sup> Expanding upon this possibility, Floto and Smith<sup>64</sup> suggested that the inflammatory response to the stimulatory components of tobacco may be counteracted by the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine, which offers a rational explanation for why few smokers generate pulmonary Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis. It has also been pointed out that there is a significantly lower incidence of sarcoidosis in smokers<sup>65</sup> and decreased incidence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) precipitins that develop during allergic alveolitis as occurs both in humans and guinea pigs.<sup>66,67</sup>…A notable outcome of this effect may be that the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine actually enhance the survival of influenza virus in mice and induce significantly higher titers of virus following infection.<sup>63</sup> Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, is also more frequent in smokers.<sup>90</sup>…While nicotine may inhibit macrophage function to promote pneumonia, it has also been reported that the generation of hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP) is lower in smokers than nonsmokers. HP is caused by inhalation of antigens such as Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, which induces farmer ’s lung (once contracted, however, smoking worsens disease).</p>
