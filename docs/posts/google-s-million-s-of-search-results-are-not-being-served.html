        <p>SerpApi’s Google Search API results serves all the results Google serves to users…But the amount of searches are quite different than what is being told below the search bar.</p>

Those 2 billion search results can’t be gotten through Google’s pagination, and it seems that this number is somewhat arbitrary to the search, or commonality of the keyword.</p><p>I rarely go past the 2nd or 3rd page of Google’s search results for any kind of query anymore, but these rankings of results are big business with Search Engine Optimization. I wanted to do a little case study on the actual amount of searches that get served to users for a couple different searches.</p><figure><img src="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/2.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1388" height="238" srcset="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/2.jpeg 600w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/2.jpeg 1000w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/2.jpeg 1388w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Google Search for “serpapi” with “about” 166,000 search results</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the breakdown of results for “serpapi” page by page until page 15.

I set the <code>num</code> parameter to 100, which is the maximum number of results you can ask on a single Google search HTML page.</p><figure><img src="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/6.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="672" height="62" srcset="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/6.jpeg 600w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/6.jpeg 672w"/><figcaption>URL for “serpapi” for a yield of 100 results</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/7.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1132" height="1180" srcset="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/7.jpeg 600w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/7.jpeg 1000w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/7.jpeg 1132w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>This HTML resulted in just two pages of results. So at maximum, a user could get 200 results. But according to the same kind of response we got to the end of page 15 of the Google Search for “serpapi”. There were 166 results.</p><figure><img src="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/8.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1064" height="900" srcset="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/8.jpeg 600w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/8.jpeg 1000w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/8.jpeg 1064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>End of 2nd page of Google results “serpapi” with a num = 100 urlencoded parameter</figcaption></figure><p>And with the same process previously, I repeated the search with the omitted results and the amount of results changed when I got to the end of the 4th page.</p><figure><img src="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/9.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1152" height="212" srcset="https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/07/9.jpeg 600w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/07/9.jpeg 1000w, https://serpapi.com/blog/content/images/2021/07/9.jpeg 1152w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>There was a total of 392 results with the omitted search function being ran. Which is the most accurate number of “served” results. And quite a difference between the initial “serpapi” with <strong><strong>no</strong></strong> <code>num</code> parameter of 166,000 “results”.</p><p>It is important to note that Google’s initial results without adding extra parameters provides a very large base number of results. And while not all the searches get returned to users, all of these results can get scraped with SerpApi’s Google Search API.</p><p>You can sign-up for SerpApi here: <a href="https://serpapi.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://serpapi.com/</a></p><p>You can find the SerpApi user forum here: <a href="https://forum.serpapi.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://forum.serpapi.com/</a></p><p>You can find the API documentation here: <a href="https://serpapi.com/search-api" rel="noopener nofollow">https://serpapi.com/search-api/</a></p>
