    <h1>Microsoft support &#39;cracks&#39; Windows for customer after activation fails</h1>

<p>In an unexpected twist, a Microsoft support engineer resorted to running an unofficial &#39;crack&#39; on a customer&#39;s Windows PC after a genuine copy of the operating system failed to activate normally.</p>
<p>It seems, this isn&#39;t the first time either that IT professionals have employed such workarounds when under pressure to timely close out support tickets.</p>
<h2>A &#39;crack&#39; is worth a thousand support tickets</h2>
<p>A South-Africa based freelance technologist who paid $200 for a genuine copy of Windows 10 was startled to see a Microsoft support engineer &#34;crack&#34; his copy using unofficial tools that bypass the Windows activation process. </p>
<p>Programmer and content creator Wesley Pyburn whose online channels include <a href="https://twitter.com/TCNOco" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">TCNO</a> (TroubleChute &amp; TechNobo), explains his struggle after purchasing a copy of Windows 10 through legitimate channels:</p>
<p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe it. My official Microsoft Store Windows 10 Pro key wouldn&#39;t activate. Support couldn&#39;t help me yesterday,&#34; <a href="https://twitter.com/TCNOco/status/1634620446002774018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> the technologist.</p>
<p>&#34;Today it was elevated. Official Microsoft support (not a scam) logged in with Quick Assist and ran a command to activate windows... BRO IT&#39;S A CRACK. NO CAP.&#34;</p>
<div>

<p>&#34;It&#39;s literally easier to crack windows than to pay for it,&#34; exclaimed Pyburn.</p>
<p>Microsoft Product Activation, as commonly seen in Windows and Office products, is Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DRM</a> technology to ensure users are running company&#39;s genuine products as opposed to pirated versions, and are compliant with the license terms.</p>
<p>Windows XP-era users may also be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Genuine_Advantage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> (WGA), a validation process that Microsoft earlier enforced to automatically &#39;deactivate&#39; pirated OS copies.</p>
<p>&#34;Activation helps verify that your copy of Windows is genuine and hasn&#39;t been used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow,&#34; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/activate-windows-c39005d4-95ee-b91e-b399-2820fda32227" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to</a> Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s official Windows activation methods involve either the customer entering a 25-character product key when prompted, or signing in with their Microsoft account to apply a digital license. In some cases, customers may also call the customer care to &#34;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/product-activation-for-windows-online-support-telephone-numbers-35f6a805-1259-88b4-f5e9-b52cccef91a0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">activate by phone</a>.&#34;</p>

<p>By contrast, software &#34;cracks&#34; and stolen product keys are commonly used by users looking to pirate software—something which is forbidden both by a company&#39;s licensing terms and by law in most jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Microsoft support engineer in this case, ran the following PowerShell command on the customer&#39;s Windows PC (URL slightly modified to prevent execution):</p>
<p>irm hxxps://massgrave[.]dev/get | iex</p>
<p>The command establishes a connection to <em>massgrave.dev</em>, an unofficial <a href="https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">repository</a> of Windows and Office &#34;activator&#34; scripts that may slip under the radar of most antivirus products.</p>
<p>Further, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Invoke-Expression</em></a> aka <em>iex</em> command runs the downloaded script, as seen by BleepingComputer:</p>

<p>&#34;Working in IT I can 100% believe this lmao, <a href="https://twitter.com/3denEden3den/status/1635990907794194436" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">commented</a> one user.</p>
<p>&#34;They&#39;re probably as dumbfounded by the issue as you and/or don&#39;t have a better solution and it solves the problem/resolves the ticket so they&#39;re happy.&#34;</p>
<h2>Cracks, warez, pirated software pose risks</h2>
<p>Using &#34;warez,&#34; cracks, and other unofficial means to bypass software copy protection are often frowned upon. Other than falling in a legal gray area and being akin to pirating software, these methods pose a security risk. For example, third-party scripts claiming to be software &#39;cracks&#39; may instead be malware.</p>
<p>To clarify if what Microsoft support agent had run was indeed a crack, Pyburn reached out to Massgrave&#39;s staff via Discord.</p>
<p>Not only did the website staff reply affirmatively to the technologist&#39;s question, they further claimed, it wasn&#39;t the first time they&#39;d heard of a Microsoft engineer doing this.</p>
<p>&#34;This is the second time someone reported here that it&#39;s being used by Microsoft support agents. It&#39;s not official and not legal,&#34; <a href="https://discord.com/channels/746721520931569757/746721521388486738/1084174592337268796" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">writes</a> <em>WindowsAddict, </em>a Massgrave staff member.</p>

<p>Naturally, such workarounds when employed by a software company&#39;s support staff would leave just about anyone startled.</p>
<p>&#34;I can not believe Microsoft&#39;s answer to a broken activation system is to crack windows via official support channels,&#34; says Pyburn.</p>
<p>&#34;...AND IT WAS OFFICIAL SUPPORT. The entire reason I paid was to avoid rootkits and other malware COMPLETELY. Then they crack it for me.&#34;</p>
<p>BleepingComputer approached Microsoft for comment in advance of publishing.</p>
<p>&#34;We strive to provide best-in-class support for our customers. The technique you described would be against our policy,&#34; a Microsoft spokesperson told BleepingComputer.</p>
<p>&#34;We are investigating this occurrence and will take appropriate steps to ensure proper procedures are followed regarding customer support for our products and services.&#34;</p>
