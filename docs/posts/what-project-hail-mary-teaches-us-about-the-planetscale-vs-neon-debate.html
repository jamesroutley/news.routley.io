    <h1>What &#39;Project Hail Mary&#39; teaches us about the PlanetScale vs. Neon debate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Lately I have been observing the constant picking of <a href="https://neon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neon</a>, mainly I presume for its performance from <a href="https://x.com/isamlambert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planetscale’s CEO</a>, and the X/Twitter community.</p>
<p>Here are some of the many tweets I have encountered, but I didn’t save them, so a simple search resulted on the following list, just to get the gist of it.</p>


<p>This post is going to be extremely short, and it was just something that struck me when I read this phrase from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Hail Mary</a>, when Stratt, Grace and Redell had a discussion around growing Astrophage at scale:</p>
<p><b>“As a <s>breeder</s> database system it’s horrible,” I said. “Way less efficient
and far lower <s>yield</s> QPS than my system … . But
he didn’t design it for efficiency. He designed it for <u>scalability</u>.”</b></p>
<p>There is profound wisdom in this imaginary discussion, and it is a reminder, there are no free lunches in distributed designs. Both are winners, Planetscale and Neon, in their own niche and for their own use cases.</p>
<p>I know negativity and drama in X/Twitter brings the eyeballs, but its a friendly reminder to my fellow engineers that there is no universal optimal solution.</p>
