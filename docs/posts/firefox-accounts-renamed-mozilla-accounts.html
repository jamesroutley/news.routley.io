    <h1>Firefox accounts renamed Mozilla accounts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="doc-content">
    
      

<p>Over the years, Firefox accounts expanded its role beyond being solely an authentication solution for Firefox Sync. It now serves as Mozilla&#39;s main authentication and account management service for a wide range of products and services, supporting millions of active account customers globally. As such, the original “Firefox” branding no longer accurately reflects the broad scope of Mozilla&#39;s offerings. The renaming is intended to create a more consistent brand experience across all Mozilla surfaces, driving higher awareness of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/products/">portfolio of Mozilla products</a>.
</p>

<p>No, there is no need to take any steps or create a new account. The renaming is essentially a change in the account&#39;s name and branding. You will continue to log in with the same email address and password and retain access to all your account data and subscriptions.
</p>

<p>Your sign-in information, including your username and password, will remain the same. The renaming does not involve any changes to your credentials.
</p>

<p>Yes, Mozilla account customers still have the option to sign in using their Google or Apple credentials.
</p>

<p>Your account data, settings, functionality, and subscriptions will be unaffected during the renaming process.
</p>

<p>We&#39;ve kept the URL <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com">accounts.firefox.com</a> unchanged, even after transitioning to Mozilla accounts, to ensure a smooth and familiar customer experience.
</p>

<p>You will still receive emails from accounts@firefox.com because we continue to use this email address for all communications related to your Mozilla account. This decision ensures consistency and helps you identify official correspondence from us.
</p>

<p>No, there are no substantive changes to the terms of service or privacy policy as a direct result of the renaming.
