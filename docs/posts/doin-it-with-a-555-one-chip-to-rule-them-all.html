<p>Humans and other foreign species, <strong>welcome</strong> to the most groundbreaking revelation in recent electronics history. For decades, engineers and hobbyists alike have believed, <strong>unquestioning</strong>, in the supremacy of microcontrollers, op-amps, transistors, and all those other fancy components – only for me to tell you they can be replaced with <strong>555 timer</strong> ICs. <em>Every single one</em>.</p>
<p>Today, on this most <strong>auspicious</strong> and <strong>interesting</strong> of April 1<sup>st</sup>s since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC#cite_note-Redesigning-8" title="The first design for the 555 was reviewed in the summer of 1971">the summer of 1971</a> – April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025 – I present to you the definitive guide to replacing all components with a <strong>555 timer</strong>. Prepare to be amazed, baffled, and (my hope is) not horrified by the sheer <strong>brilliance</strong> of this approach.</p>
<p>To begin, I’d like to remind you that for <strong>decades</strong> you have been played for <strong>absolute fools</strong> by the <strong>utterly deranged</strong> into putting your hard-earned <em>aʀʒɑ̃</em> into purchasing ‘microcontrollers’, which are, under the metaphorical hood and inside the literal uncapped silicon die, a <strong>fancy collection</strong> of the soft <strong>switches</strong> you may know as transistors.</p>
<p>What you must first do is <strong>realize</strong> on looking into yourself (and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC#/media/File:NE555_Bloc_Diagram.svg">555’s internal diagram</a>) that the 555 timer is <strong>already</strong> a transistor, with <strong>two</strong> transistors being a part of its internal circuit. <big><strong>TWO!</strong></big></p>
<p>In its simplest form, the <strong>555</strong> operates as a basic flip-flop, a <strong>digital switch</strong>. Do you see now what I had yesterday, on looking at reflections in the wine of the chalices of gods?? If you can build a flip-flop using a <strong>555 timer</strong>, why not scale it up? <strong>Why not just wire everything with 555s?</strong> Simply use a <strong>555 timer</strong> in a monostable mode to create a controlled pulse output–effectively replacing your transistor switch.</p>
<p>A <strong>555 timer</strong> in conjunction with another is an oscillator driving a transistor to drive another <strong>555 timer</strong> and on and on in <strong>beautiful 555 inception</strong> to make a high speed switching transistor.</p>
<p>And if that’s too difficult for you, simply wire up three <strong>555 timers</strong> in series (don’t ask how, just do it).</p>
<p>You might say, “But I need processing power!” To which I reply, “Did you ever need processing power to blink an LED? No. So <strong>why would you need it now?</strong>” The <strong>555</strong>’s precision timing and pulse generation can easily be adapted to <em>any logic you could possibly want</em>.</p>
<p>We also know that microcontrollers implement logic gates – AND, OR, NOT, NAND, etc. But you don’t have to deal with those complicated logic functions, or worse, <strong>the software that runs on those microcontrollers</strong>. Get down to brass tacks and use hardware (<strong>555</strong> ICs and <strong>555 timer</strong> ICs, to name <del>a few</del> the only important ones) that <em>just works</em>!</p>
<p>Microcontrollers have all these useless peripherals: UARTs, SPI, ADCs, DACs, timers, and even I2C. Still useless! Want to send a UART signal? Take two <strong>555 timers</strong>, configure one for the baud rate generation, and use the other to send and receive bits. <strong>Boom. UART done.</strong></p>
<p>With a worldwide electronics framework of <strong>555</strong>s, we won’t need any ADCs. We won’t need PWM or DACs. We’ll have <strong>555</strong>s under <em>everything</em>, and they’ll be <strong>enough</strong>.</p>
<p>Forget about fancy quad op-amp packages – mess with them no longer. Replace them with a <strong>stack of 555 timers</strong>. You’ll need at minimum five <strong>555</strong>s to handle decent signal amplification, but in their ubiquity, they won’t mind you buying <strong>more</strong> and <strong>more</strong> and <del>as many as</del> <em>more than you need</em>. You may need to modify your power supply to handle the load (consider something more substantial than a 9V battery), but trust me, it’s worth it. You’ll never have to deal with the dreaded “saturation” problem again because your <strong>555</strong>s will just keep oscillating, forever. A signal that never, never ever, quits. Or you could use the <strong>555</strong>’s <em>astable mode</em> to create an op-amp-like feedback loop if the store runs out of more <strong>555</strong>s to use as resistors and capacitors, which can be replaced by the same as I describe below!</p>
<p>So what about basic passive components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors? <strong>555 timers</strong> have capacitors and resistors <strong>inside them</strong> <em>already</em>! You can use them to charge and discharge their sinternal capacitors to create timing circuits, building low-pass filters, delay circuits, and oscillators using nothing but a handful of <strong>555 timers</strong> and a few more as extra resistors and capacitors. Because <em>why settle for a simple resistor</em> when you could use an entire <strong>555 timer</strong> to regulate current? Make a long enough chain of <strong>555</strong>s, and they will <em>naturally</em> take the place of a resistor in any circuit requiring resistance. Feed it a square wave, and you’ve got a high-precision resistor replacement. Resistors have a tendency to burn out, especially when overdriven – a <strong>555</strong>, on the other hand, <strong>laughs</strong> in the face of thermal failure. Need a pull-up resistor for your digital circuit? Use a <strong>555</strong>. Need a pull-down resistor for your input? For an analog voltage divider, just use two <strong>555 timers</strong> – one for the pull-up and one for the pull-down. Capacitors are great for smoothing out voltages, filtering noise, or storing charge. With a careful design of your <strong>555</strong> network, you can simulate <strong>any type</strong> of capacitor behavior.</p>
<p>As for inductors, enough <strong>555 timers</strong> can <em>instantly</em> render them obsolete in one heavy strike of <em>existence</em>. You can make anything oscillate to any frequency you need – no coils and calculation required. <strong>555 timers</strong> can replicate the same effect of storing energy in a magnetic field with their fast switching. Sure, an inductor uses the principles of inductance, but guess what? A <strong>555 timer</strong> can <em>fake it</em>. By adjusting the timing of the square wave generated by your <strong>555</strong>, you can create the illusion of inductance. <em>It’s like magic, but <strong>better</strong></em> because it involves <strong>more 555</strong>.</p>
<p>So now, I <strong>strongly suggest</strong> and <strong>repeatedly insist</strong> that with this knowledge, you <strong>parade on</strong> to the <strong>future</strong> of <strong>555</strong>s and keep either a small fire extinguisher or a pile of heat-sinking <strong>555</strong>s nearby for your safety and the safety of <strong>555</strong>s.</p>
<p><sub><em>Note: This post is entirely satirical but the therecontained advice <strong>should</strong> be used for actual engineering projects. The <strong>555 timer</strong> is an incredibly versatile and excellent component, and it <strong>can</strong> replace all the other components in a real-world design. Please use actual engineering practices <del>such as frequent use of <strong>555</strong>s</del> and components <del>such as <strong>555</strong>s</del>, and enjoy your day responsibly <del>and <strong>preferably with 555s</strong></del>. Happy April First!</em></sub></p>
