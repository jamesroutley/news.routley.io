<p>A few days ago, I made <a href="https://chaos.social/@interpeer/110740096258668222" title="a social media post" rel="external">a social media post</a> about Google vs.
the Open Web. It received some responses, so I’ll reproduce it below with some
additional comments.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-trying-to-kill-the-open-web">Google is trying to kill the Open Web.</h2>
<p>Using the proposed “Web Environment Integrity” means websites can select on
which devices (browsers) they wish to be displayed, and can refuse service
to other devices. It binds client side software to a website, creating a
silo’d app.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md" title="Web Environment Integrity on GitHub" rel="external">Web Environment Integrity on GitHub</a>
<p>This penalizes platforms on which the preferred client side software is not
available.</p>
<p>This is an issue for accessibility and inclusion, in particular when the reason
the software is not available is tied to the needs of marginalized groups, such
as when poverty makes it impossible to own sufficiently modern devices, etc.</p>
<p>“Web Environment Integrity” is a deeply #antisocial proposal, and goes counter
to the design principles of the web.</p>
<p>In all honesty, this move by Google is hardly surprising. They’ve been trying to
capture the web as their own platform for a long time. This is just the latest
battle.</p>
<p>But it also marks a particularly perverse point, in how the proposal admits it
exists primarily to extract value from people. People mining at its worst.</p>
<p>Remember when their motto was “Don’t be Evil?”</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="analysis-of-the-proposal">Analysis of the Proposal</h2>
<p>Some details on the proposal may help here.</p>
<p>The proposal suggests that websites should be able to request an attestation
from the browser about its “integrity”. Such attestations are to be provided
by external agents, which – presumably – examine the browser and its plugins,
and issue an approval only if those checks pass.</p>
<p>The attestation is sent back to the website, which can now decide to deny
service if the agent did not give approval.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, this is to ensure <em>for the user</em> that the environment has not been
tampered with in any way. The described use cases, however, make fairly clear
that it is <em>for the business</em> that this feature exists.</p>
<p>In particular, the proposal suggests that “Google Play” could provide such
attestations, and also provides an example case which intends to ensure that
ads are served only to legitimate users, not to automated processes.</p>
<p>These two points are not raised together. But put them together, and you find
the following underlying problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advertisers want to reduce costs.</li>
<li>Website owner wishes to display ads.</li>
<li>Google’s ad network charges per <em>impression</em>.</li>
<li>Bots create impressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposal effectively provides a solution for Google’s advertising problem,
and tries to couch it in more user friendly terms. The above scenario is the
closest to a problem they describe outright.</p>
<p>The solution, expressed in the proposal, is to exclude bots via attestations,
such that ads generate impressions only with logged-in Google Play users.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>In general, bots are pretty easy to exclude. They usually advertise themselves
by a user agent string. Yes, that can be faked – but it seems highly unlikely
that bots using faked user agents create such a large number of impressions that
Google has to use this route against them. If I look at my own webserver logs,
it’s very clear which are bot requests <em>just from the log information</em>.</p>
<p>If bots are not the actual problem, then what is?</p>
<p>The agent providing the attestation is free to use whichever means to approve
or disapprove of a browser. That includes examining whether the browser runs
ad blockers.</p>
<p>Given how advertising networks track users, and user tracking is a practice
that comes under increasing criticism, ad blockers are also gaining in
popularity. Security experts regularly recommend the use of ad blockers as
a cyber security measure – as ads can be used to side-load malware into an
otherwise legitimate website.</p>
<p>What Google is really after is ad blockers.</p>
<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>
<p>The downside of this approach is that it opens up a door for arbitrary abuse.
Websites can refuse service unless you install their proprietary data collection
agent. Websites can refuse service if you use the wrong browser – we’d enter
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" title="browser wars" rel="external">browser wars</a>
of the late 90s, with renewed effort.</p>
<p>The day this proposal gets accepted is the day the Open Web is set back by
decades.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300151244/the-future-of-the-internet-and-how-to-stop-it/" title="The Future of the Internet -- And How to Stop It" rel="external">The Future of the Internet -- And How to Stop It</a>,
Jonathan Zittrain lays out, starting with the telephone network, that there
exist “appliances” and “generative systems”.</p>
<p>An “appliance” works like any other household appliance, like a toaster. It
has one primary function, and all other functions it may offer are at best
mild variations of the primary one. It toasts.</p>
<p>Zittrain lists the PC and the internet as examples of generative systems.
Generative systems are not necessarily as complete in functionality as an
appliance – they provide some basic functionality, but with no specific
primary purpose. The purpose is left to the user. Another way of phrasing
this is to call these things tools, or crafting materials.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s worth pointing out the text of the above image at this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Web is a collection of user-developed, non-proprietary frameworks
for building services, emphasizing interoperability and the balance of data
access and ownership between providers and end-users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generative systems are significantly more impactful than appliances precisely
because they leverage the user’s imagination to address their own needs. They
crowdsource meaning at global scale. This is what makes the internet so
powerful.</p>
<p>Attestations from an agent doing arbitrary things effectively turns the web
into an appliance – or, to be more specific, it turns the browser into an
extension of an appliance website.</p>
<p>Of course website owners are free to build appliances. They already are doing
so. But this reduces the usefulness of “the web” step by step, until the
generative open web is lost. We’re already seeing the negative effects of this,
and technology like the proposed would only accelerate the trend.</p>
<p>Google does not need to mind. The inexorable logic of capitalism means that
businesses that managed to build upon a generative system to rise, now have
to turn that same system into an appliance for their own needs, or risk being
open to competition.</p>
<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<p>The reactions to the post were diverse, and it’s worth addressing a few.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>This does not imply accessibility or inclusion issues!</strong> – Yes and no.
No, in principle this technology does not <em>cause</em> accessibility issues. But
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" title="pareto principle" rel="external">pareto principle</a> implies that effort
should be spent on 20% of the browser market because that captures 80% of the
users – and cost effectiveness then mandates that the remaining 20% of users
should be ignored, because they’ll cost too much to support.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Worry about access, not about technology!</strong> – The argument is that good
regulatory frameworks will legally mandate access, so that should be the
focus.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is legitimate for businesses to wish to protect their interests.</strong> –
That is a debatable point. Businesses “protecting their interests” to the
detriment of people is not legitimate. But within the bounds of that, sure,
why not.

<p><strong>2023-07-21</strong>: After raising <a href="https://github.com/w3c/PWETF/issues/306">a code of conduct violation</a>
for the proposal with the W3C’s group responsible for said code, I was
rightly told that they are not responsible (TL;DR, see the link). I then
sent an email to the ombudspeople at W3C which I’ll reproduce here:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>From jens@OBFUSCATED Fri Jul 21 17:23:38 2023
Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2023 17:23:38 +0200
From: &#34;Jens Finkhaeuser&#34; &lt;jens@OBFUSCATED&gt;
To: ombuds@w3.org
Subject: Web Environment Integrity proposal

Dear Ombudspeople of the W3C,

I wish to raise concerns about the behaviour of the people working on
the Web Environment Integrity proposal, as well as the proposal
itself.

https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/

In particular, I would like to draw your attention to isuse #131 in
their working repository:

https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/131

The group working on this claims to adhere to the W3C Code of Ethics
and Professional Conduct. However, as documented in this issue, they
violate said code.

As a bit of background, WEI is a deeply unethical proposal that
suggests to use cryptographic means to permit websites to deny
services to users based on arbitrary user metadata. Such metadata
is to be processed by agents running on the user&#39;s machine, which
provide attestations about the browser environment.

One such proposed service is Google Play, which has access to personal
identifiable information (PII). This turns the proposal into a
technological mechanism for discrimination.

The community has raised and is raising issues about the ethics of
such a proposal, which led me to find the W3C code of ethics.
Unfortunately, as was pointed out to me, the code of ethics does not
concern the content of proposals - merely the conduct of participants.

Unfortunately, some maintainers of the repository have taken to
closing issues raised by the community -- the fourth bullet point in
the &#34;participant&#34; explanation of the code (&#34;Anyone from the Public
partaking in the W3C work environment (e.g. commenting on our specs,
(...)&#34;). This violates several points in section 3.1 of the same
document, whereby use of reasonable means to process diverse views are
required.

It seems to be the case that this proposal has not yet made it to a
W3C group. However, its maintainers already violate the W3C code of
ethics in practice in the run-up to such an activity. In the meantime,
even though the code is not directly applicable to the proposal
contents, it nonetheless violates said code in spirit.

It seems appropriate that W3C does not permit this proposal to go ahead
in any formal fashion.

Kind regards,
  Jens Finkhaeuser

<li>
<p><strong>2023-07-22</strong>: Google has now closed the ability to contribute to the
repository, including by raising or commenting on issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2023-07-26 #1</strong>: Apple has already shipped a similar API for about a year.
As described on the Apple developer blog, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=huqjyh7k">Private Access Tokens</a>
implement pretty much the same mechanism as Google’s WEI.</p>
<p>There are a few notable differences in <em>tone</em>, however. The first is a direct
quote from the above blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: When you send token challenges, don’t block the main page load.
Make sure that any clients that don’t support tokens still can access
your website!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This note is not doing anything in itself, but it <em>does</em> stand in stark
contrast to the motivations documented in WEI. In particular, the proposal
suggests that private access tokens should be used instead of e.g. CAPTCHAs
or other, more disruptive authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>The second important difference is in the actual details of the proposal.
It states that the token issuer is an external web service rather than some
opaque process running on the user’s machine. Suggested are some CDN
providers’ services. The clear message of intent here is that this is
supposed to be a mechanism by which CDNs authenticate a request to the
source.</p>
<p>The protocol by which this is to be done is defined by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/privacypass/about/">IETF PrivacyPass Working Group</a>.
Reading through <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-privacypass-protocol-11.html">the protocol draft</a>,
it furthermore becomes clear that the data the client is supposed to send
to the issuer is… nothing but the challenge sent by the server, in an
obfuscated (hashed) manner.</p>
<p>This leads to two conclusions.</p>
<ol>
<li>No personal data is being leaked.</li>
<li>There is no checking of the “environment”, aka the browser and its plugins,
that can prevent some browsers from receiving an attestation.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Private Access Token attestations can <em>still</em> be used to undermine the
open web simply by forcing browsers to start adopting this or risk exclusion,
this attestation approach <em>could not be more different in its fundamental
function</em> from Google’s WEI if it tried.</p>
<p>Is it still a bad idea? Maybe. But if so, it’s an entirely different, far
friendlier ball game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2023-07-26 #2</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/852#issuecomment-1648820747">Mozilla has taken a stance against WEI</a>
writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mozilla opposes this proposal because it contradicts our principles and
vision for the Web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s something, at least.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2023-07-26 #3</strong>: As a honourable mention, the maintainer of the Google
repository has published a <a href="https://blog.yoav.ws/posts/web_platform_change_you_do_not_like/">personal blog post about their experience</a>,
which contains some fair and some unfair bits.</p>
<p>However, one of the points bears commenting on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t assume a hidden agenda</p>
<p>When thinking about a new proposal, it’s often safe to assume that Occam’s
razor is applicable and the reason it is being proposed is that the team
proposing it is trying to tackle the use cases the proposal handles. While
the full set of organizational motivations behind supporting certain use
cases may not always public (e.g. a new device type not yet announced,
legal obligations, etc), the use cases themselves should give a clear enough
picture of what is being solved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few comments to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given that Apple’s mechanism is undergoing IETF standardization, the only
reason for an opposing mechanism is that the existing approach does not
fulfil Google’s needs.</li>
<li>Google <em>clearly</em> states its needs in its use cases. There is no hidden
agenda that people complain about, but rather the agenda as it is stated
clearly in plain text.</li>
</ol>
<p>This comment actually <em>confirms</em> the community’s worst fears.</p>
