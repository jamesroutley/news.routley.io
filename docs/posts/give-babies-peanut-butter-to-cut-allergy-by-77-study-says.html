At one point, families were once told to avoid peanut until their child was three years old. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, evidence over the last 15 years has turned that on its head. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Instead, eating peanut while the immune system is still developing - and learning to recognise friend from foe - can reduce allergic reactions, experts say. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It also means the body&#39;s first experience of peanut is in the tummy where it is more likely to be recognised as food rather than on the skin, where it may be more likely to be treated as a threat. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Israel, where peanut snacks are common in early life, has much lower rates of allergy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other studies have suggested introducing other foods linked to allergies - such as egg, milk and wheat - early also reduced allergy.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The analysis was conducted by the University of Southampton, King&#39;s College London and the research arm of the NHS - the National Institute for Health and Care Research.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They found the critical period to start was between four and six months, during which the allergy could be cut by 77%.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That is the equivalent of preventing 10,000 out of the roughly 13,000 cases of peanut allergy each year.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Delaying the introduction of peanut-based foods until the child was one-year-old would only cut allergy cases by 33%, according to the research.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For babies with eczema, which is a risk factor for allergy, the investigators recommend starting at four months - as long as the baby is ready. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They say parents should start by offering small amounts of fruit or vegetables. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Then when the baby is comfortable, around three heaped teaspoons of peanut butter a week should be introduced and maintained for years. Peanut butter, which can be quite dry, can be given with breastmilk.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Graham Roberts, from the University of Southampton, said decades of advice to avoid peanut had &#34;understandably led to parental fear&#34; of giving children peanut and shifting rules led to large amounts of confusion from both within medicine and from parents.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, he said this was a &#34;simple, low-cost, safe intervention&#34; that would &#34;deliver vast benefits for future generations&#34;.</p></div><section data-component="related-internet-links"><p><h2>Related Internet Links</h2></p><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><p>The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.</p></section></article></div></div>
