    <h1>The World is Built on Probability (1984)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="descript" itemprop="description"><p>About the book</p><p>This text is divided into two major parts.</p><p>The aim of the first part is to convince the reader that the random world begins directly in his or her own living room because, in fact, all modern life is based on probability. The first part is on the concept of probability and considers making decisions in conflict situations, optimizing queues, games, and the control of various processes, and doing random searches.</p><p>The second part of this text shows how fundamental chance is in nature using the probabilistic laws of modern physics and biology as examples. Elements of quantum mechanics are also involved, and this allows the author to demonstrate how probabilistic laws are basic to microscopic phenomena. The idea is that the reader, passing from the first part of the book to the second one, would see that probability is not only around us but it is at the basis of everything.</p><p>Translated from the Russian by Michael Burov First published 1988</p><p>Revised from the 1984 Russian edition</p><p>This completely digital version typeset in using LaTeX with EB Garamond font by Damitr Mazanav damitr@proton.me</p><p>In this electronic edition all the figures have been reworked in the SVG format using Inkscape for a clearer presentation.</p><p>Released on the web by http://mirtitles.org in 2023.</p><p>Access the LaTeX project files gitlab.com/mirtitles/twibop</p>
