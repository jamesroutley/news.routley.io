    <h1>Notes on clarifying man pages</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! After <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2026/01/08/a-data-model-for-git/">spending some time working on the Git man pages</a> last year,
I&rsquo;ve been thinking a little more about what makes a good man page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time writing cheat sheets for tools (tcpdump, git, dig, etc)
which have a man page as their primary documentation. This is because I often
find the man pages hard to navigate to get the information I want.</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve wondering &ndash; could the man page <em>itself</em> have an amazing cheat sheet
in it? What might make a man page easier to use?
I&rsquo;m still very early in thinking about this but I wanted to write down some quick notes.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/116092583707187579">asked some people on Mastodon</a> for their favourite man pages, and here
are some examples of interesting things I saw on those man pages.</p>
<h3 id="an-options-summary">an OPTIONS SUMMARY</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read a lot of man pages you&rsquo;ve probably seen something like this in
the <code>SYNOPSIS</code>: once you&rsquo;re listing almost the entire alphabet, it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<pre><code>ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,]

grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlMmnOopqRSsUVvwXxZz]
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1">rsync man page</a>
has a solution I&rsquo;ve never seen before: it keeps its SYNOPSIS very terse, like this:</p>
<pre><code> Local:
     rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [DEST]
</code></pre>
<p>and then has an &ldquo;OPTIONS SUMMARY&rdquo; section with a 1-line summary of each option, like this:</p>
<pre><code>--verbose, -v            increase verbosity
--info=FLAGS             fine-grained informational verbosity
--debug=FLAGS            fine-grained debug verbosity
--stderr=e|a|c           change stderr output mode (default: errors)
--quiet, -q              suppress non-error messages
--no-motd                suppress daemon-mode MOTD
</code></pre>
<p>Then later there&rsquo;s the usual OPTIONS section with a full description of each option.</p>
<h3 id="an-options-section-organized-by-category">an OPTIONS section organized by category</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html">strace man page</a>
organizes its options by category (like &ldquo;General&rdquo;, &ldquo;Startup&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tracing&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Filtering&rdquo;, &ldquo;Output Format&rdquo;) instead of alphabetically.</p>
<p>As an experiment I tried to take the <code>grep</code> man page and make an
&ldquo;OPTIONS SUMMARY&rdquo; section grouped by category, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/9f5966633875a4758e0d947a5b4dbdcf">see the results
here</a>. I&rsquo;m not
sure what I think of the results but it was a fun exercise. When I was writing
that I was thinking about how I can never remember the name of the <code>-l</code> grep
option. It always takes me what feels like forever to find it in the man page
and I was trying to think of what structure would make it easier for me to find.
Maybe categories?</p>
<h3 id="a-cheat-sheet">a cheat sheet</h3>
<p>A couple of people pointed me to the suite of Perl man pages (<code>perlfunc</code>, <code>perlre</code>, etc), and one thing I
noticed was <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/perlcheat">man perlcheat</a>, which has
cheat sheet sections like this:</p>
<pre><code> SYNTAX
 foreach (LIST) { }     for (a;b;c) { }
 while   (e) { }        until (e)   { }
 if      (e) { } elsif (e) { } else { }
 unless  (e) { } elsif (e) { } else { }
 given   (e) { when (e) {} default {} }
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is so cool and it makes me wonder if there are other ways to
write condensed ASCII 80-character-wide cheat sheets for use in man pages.</p>
<h3 id="examples-are-very-popular">examples are very popular</h3>
<p>A common comment was something to the effect of &ldquo;I like any man page that has
examples&rdquo;. Someone mentioned the OpenBSD man pages, and the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tail">openbsd tail</a> man page has examples of
the exact 2 ways I use tail at the end.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve most often seen the EXAMPLES section at the
end of the man page, but some man pages (like the <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1">rsync man page</a> from earlier) start with
the examples. When I was working on the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add">git-add</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">git rebase</a>
man pages I put a short example at the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="a-table-of-contents-and-links-between-sections">a table of contents, and links between sections</h3>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a property of the man page itself, but one issue with man pages in
the terminal is it&rsquo;s hard to know what sections the man page has.</p>
<p>When working on the Git man pages, one thing Marie and I did was to
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">add a table of contents</a> to the sidebar of
the HTML versions of the man pages hosted on the Git site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to add more hyperlinks to the HTML versions of the Git man pages
at some point, so that you can click on &ldquo;INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS&rdquo; to get to that
section. It&rsquo;s very easy to add links like this in the Git project since Git&rsquo;s
man pages are generated with AsciiDoc.</p>
<p>I think adding a table of contents and adding internal hyperlinks is kind of a
nice middle ground where we can make some improvements to the man page format
(in the HTML version of the man page at least) without maintaining a totally
different form of documentation. Though for this to work you do need to set up a
toolchain like Git&rsquo;s AsciiDoc system.</p>
<p>It would be amazing if there were some kind of universal system to make it easy
to look up a specific option in a man page (&ldquo;what does -a do?&rdquo;).
The best trick I know is use the man pager to search for something like <code>^ *-a</code>
but I never remember to do it and instead just end up going through
every instance of <code>-a</code> in the man page until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<h3 id="examples-for-every-option">examples for every option</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html">curl man page</a> has examples for every
option, and there&rsquo;s also a table of contents on the HTML version so you can more
easily jump to the option you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>For instance the example for <code>--cert</code> makes it easy to see that you likely also want to pass the <code>--key</code> option, like this:</p>
<pre><code>  curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com
</code></pre>
<p>The way they implement this is that there&rsquo;s [one file for each option](<a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/dc08922a61efe546b318daf964514ffbf41583">https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/dc08922a61efe546b318daf964514ffbf41583</a> 25/docs/cmdline-opts/append.md) and there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Example&rdquo; field in that file.</p>
<h3 id="formatting-data-in-a-table">formatting data in a table</h3>
<p>Quite a few people said that <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html">man ascii</a> was their
favourite man page, which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code> Oct   Dec   Hex   Char                     
 ───────────────────────────────────────────
 000   0     00    NUL '\0' (null character)
 001   1     01    SOH (start of heading)   
 002   2     02    STX (start of text)      
 003   3     03    ETX (end of text)        
 004   4     04    EOT (end of transmission)
 005   5     05    ENQ (enquiry)            
 006   6     06    ACK (acknowledge)        
 007   7     07    BEL '\a' (bell)          
 010   8     08    BS  '\b' (backspace)     
 011   9     09    HT  '\t' (horizontal tab)
 012   10    0A    LF  '\n' (new line)      
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously <code>man ascii</code> is an unusual man page but I think what&rsquo;s cool about this man page (other than the fact that it&rsquo;s always
useful to have an ASCII reference) is it&rsquo;s very easy to scan to find the
information you need because of the table format. It makes me wonder if there
are more opportunities to display information in a &ldquo;table&rdquo; in a man page to make
it easier to scan.</p>
<h3 id="the-gnu-approach">the GNU approach</h3>
<p>When I talk about man
pages it often comes up that the GNU coreutils man pages
(for example <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html">man tail</a>)
don&rsquo;t have examples, unlike the OpenBSD man pages, which <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tail">do have examples</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into this too much because it seems like a fairly political
topic and I definitely can&rsquo;t do it justice here, but here are some things I
believe to be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GNU project prefers to maintain documentation in &ldquo;info&rdquo; manuals instead of man pages. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html">This page</a> says &ldquo;the man pages are no longer being maintained&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There are 3 ways to read &ldquo;info&rdquo; manuals: their HTML version, in Emacs, or with a standalone <code>info</code> tool. I&rsquo;ve heard from some Emacs users that they like the Emacs info browser. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever talked to anyone who uses the standalone <code>info</code> tool.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/tail-invocation.html">info manual entry for tail</a> is linked at the bottom of the man page, and it does have examples</li>
<li>The FSF used to <a href="https://www.fsf.org/gnu-press">sell print books</a> of the GNU software manuals (and maybe they <a href="https://shop.fsf.org/">still do</a> sometimes?)</li>
</ul>
<p>After a certain level of complexity a man page gets really hard to navigate: while I&rsquo;ve never used the coreutils info manual and probably won&rsquo;t, I would almost certainly prefer to use the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html">GNU Bash reference manual</a> or the <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/manual/latest/html_mono/libc.html">The GNU C Library Reference Manual</a> via their HTML documentation rather than through a man page.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-more-man-page-adjacent-things">a few more man-page-adjacent things</h3>
<p>Here are some tools I think are interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fishshell.com/">The fish shell</a> comes with a <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/share/tools/create_manpage_completions.py">Python script</a> to automatically generate tab  completions from man pages</li>
<li><a href="https://tldr.sh">tldr.sh</a> is a community maintained database of examples, for example you can run it as <code>tldr grep</code>. Lots of people have told me they find it useful.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> Mac docs browser has a nice man page viewer in it. I still use the terminal man page viewer but I like that it includes a table of contents, it looks like this:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://jvns.ca/images/dash.webp">
<h3 id="it-s-interesting-to-think-about-a-constrained-format">it&rsquo;s interesting to think about a constrained format</h3>
<p>Man pages are such a constrained format and it&rsquo;s fun to think about what you can
do with such limited formatting options.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m very into writing I&rsquo;ve always had a bad habit of never reading
documentation and so it&rsquo;s a little bit hard for me to think about what I
actually find useful in man pages, I&rsquo;m not sure whether I think most of the
things in this post would improve my experience or not. (Except for examples, I
LOVE examples)</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be interested to hear about other man pages that you think are well
designed and what you like about them,
