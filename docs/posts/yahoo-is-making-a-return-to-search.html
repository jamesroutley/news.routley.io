    <h1>Yahoo is making a return to search</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It seems like Yahoo Search wants to make a comeback in the near future. </p>



<p>Yahoo has been dropping hints over the past couple of weeks related to this return and is also hiring a Principal Product Manager for the Yahoo Search platform to help lead these initiatives.</p>



<p><strong>The job posting. </strong>Yahoo <a href="https://ouryahoo.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/careers/job/United-States-of-America---Remote/Principal-Product-Manager--Yahoo-Search_JR0021973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a job listing</a> for a “Principal Product Manager, Yahoo Search” a few weeks ago. The job posting, in part, reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re looking for a Product Manager for Search at Yahoo. We are looking for folks that are interested in pushing beyond the status quo to change the way folks interact and use search.”</p>



<p>“As a Product Manager for Search, you will help develop our search strategy and roadmap and lead its execution. The ideal candidate will leverage strong organizational skills and deep subject matter expertise to partner with design, science, engineering, and other key cross-functional teams. You will determine what we prioritize for our customers in our search experiences and bring the vision to life. You will also lead the effort to discover and amplify content from across the vast Yahoo ecosystem to create new and innovative search experiences across surfaces and for our Search App. The role is also responsible for identifying and documenting product and business requirements and taking them from concept to production, while working with a broad set of stakeholders that include marketing, sales, legal, editorial, design, UXR, and other teams.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Twitter hints. </strong>Yahoo has reactivated its Twitter account for Yahoo Search, posting <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/yahoo-search-to-make-search-cool-again-34779.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasers</a> throughout the past couple of weeks. Here are some of those:</p>

<p><strong>Yahoo executives. </strong>Brian Provost, SVP &amp; GM, Yahoo, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brianprovost_principal-product-manager-yahoo-search-activity-7024554708702814209-XZ3l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a> about this job listing and wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s going to be so much innovation in Search in the coming years and there aren’t many places where you can immediately have an impact this big. Would love to hear from you if you have a passion for Search and building product experiences.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Karen Chin, Sr. Director of Product Management, Yahoo, also posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7024537040226574336/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>, saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Looking to drive meaningful and innovative experiences for millions of users? We are looking for a seasoned Search Product Manager to take search into the next phase! Share and join us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone took the helm of Yahoo in September 2021. He has deep roots in search. </p>



<p>Lanzone worked at Ask.com for seven years, starting in 2001 as an SVP, Product Management, then in 2004 as the SVP and GM of Ask Jeeves and then taking over as CEO in 2006. </p>



<p>After Ask.com, he became the President and CEO of CBS Interactive, then the CEO at Tinder and now at Yahoo as their CEO. It will be exciting to see what Yahoo Search does under Lanzone’s leadership. He is a creative mind that produced a lot of search innovation at Ask.</p>



<p><strong>Why we care.</strong> I cannot wait to see what Lanzone and his team come up with for Yahoo Search. I am excited to see what new ideas, interfaces, and concepts the team brings to Yahoo Search. Yahoo was a pretty big player in search in the early days. Eventually, Google usurped Yahoo and the company continued to decline. Not even <a href="https://searchengineland.com/report-marissa-mayer-leaving-google-for-yahoo-ceo-role-127752">Google veteran Marissa Mayer</a> could not save the company. </p>



<p>But now Yahoo has a blank slate. It will be exciting to see if Yahoo can compete in search again.</p>



<p><strong>Postscript: </strong>Yahoo’s CEO, Jim Lanzone, replied to us on Twitter saying, “Greg, I think you and Barry know – there are always new ways around the mountain. No reason to go straight at it. But we’re excited to start exploring again…and will be patient figuring it all out.”</p>
