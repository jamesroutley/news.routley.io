1. Explain technical concepts clearly and concisely
2. Show real implementation details, trade-offs, and failures
3. Are well-structured and readable
4. Tie engineering decisions back to business or product outcomes</p><p>Any standout blogs, posts, or platforms you regularly learn from?</p></div></div></div>
