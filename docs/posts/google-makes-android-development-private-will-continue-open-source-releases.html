    <h1>Google makes Android development private, will continue open source releases</h1>

          <p>Google is planning a major change to the way it develops new versions of the Android operating system. Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/10/google-liberates-android-source-code-so-start-developing/">the beginning</a>, large swaths of the software have been developed in public-facing channels, but that will no longer be the case. This does not mean Android is shedding its open source roots, but the process won&#39;t be as transparent.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">has confirmed</a> to Android Authority that all Android development work going forward will take place in Google&#39;s internal branch. This is a shift from the way Google has worked on Android in the past, which featured frequent updates to the public AOSP branch. Anyone can access AOSP, but the internal branches are only available to Google and companies with a Google Mobile Services (GMS) license, like Samsung, Motorola, and others.</p>
<p>According to the company, it is making this change to simplify things, building on a recent change to trunk-based development. As Google works on both public and private branches of Android, the two fall out of sync with respect to features and API support. This forces Google to tediously merge the branches for every release. By focusing on the internal branch, Google claims it can streamline releases and make life easier for everyone.</p>
<p>When new versions of Android are done, Google says it will continue to publish the source code in AOSP as always. Supposedly, this will allow developers to focus on supporting their apps without keeping track of pending changes to the platform in AOSP. Licensed OEMs, meanwhile, can just focus on the lively internal branch as they work on devices that can take a year or more to launch.</p>
