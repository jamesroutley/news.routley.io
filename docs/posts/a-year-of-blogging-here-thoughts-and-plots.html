<p>It has been almost exactly a year since I started publicly sharing
projects and thoughts on this site. I wasn’t sure that I’d want—or
manage—to publish consistently, but here we are, a year and 17—now
18!—blog posts later. Let’s talk about it!</p>
<h2 id="some-plots">Some plots</h2>

<p>My first post, a meta-post on <a href="https://hannahilea.com/site-structure/">setting up
the site itself</a>, was on May 19 last year. Then crickets, for months.
What broke the drought?</p>
<p>The start of <em>actually</em> publishing here on a semi-regular
basis is directly attributable to an early September hang with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cceckman.com/">Charles</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scannedinavian.com/">Shae</a>, who asked a bunch of
questions about my flipdots project and then strongly encouraged me to
write about it. Because I knew exactly who my audience was—them!—the <a href="https://hannahilea.com/clapping-music-for-flip-disc-displays/">write-up itself</a>
came together quickly. Once published, a bunch of other people responded
to it enthusiastically, which was apparently the push I needed to share
other things.</p>
<p>Some stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total word count: ~156k</li>
<li>Longest post: ~16k words, <a href="https://hannahilea.com/cuttle-obsession/">Obsessed
with Cuttle: Parametric CAD for prototyping, producing, and
procrastinating</a> on September 27th.</li>
<li>Shortest post: ~1.8k words, <a href="https://hannahilea.com/yellow-scream-2024/"><em>Yellow Scream (2024)</em></a> on
November 6th.</li>
<li>Most footnotes: 10, in <a href="https://hannahilea.com/botfly-test/">The Botfly Test:
Characterizing parasitic automated behavior in online communities</a> on
March 3rd.</li>
</ul>
<p>What have I been writing about? Good question! I haven’t really
figured out my tag game on this site<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, so this word cloud of
tags from all posts isn’t necessarily a <em>great</em> view, but it is
<em>a</em> view:</p>

</figure>
<p>Ah yes, programming, music, and hardware. Sounds about right!</p>
<p>A more verbose word cloud—all words from all posts:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>“Post” being the most common word is a little unnecessarily meta, but
at least “community” and “fun” are also visible!</p>
</div>
<p>Per-post word clouds, for good measure:</p>

<p>No additional commentary except to say that they make kind of a cool
wallpaper.</p>
<h2 id="some-thoughts">Some thoughts</h2>
<p>Writing for general publication has been <em>fun</em>. I did it a
whole lot when I was younger, then took a bit of a break, and have
really loved getting back to it—both for myself, and as a means of
connection with various parts of my communities.</p>
<p>Parts of my writing process have been less fun; for my own sanity, I
need to tighten up the iteration-and-editing stage.</p>
<p>Other observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A major motivation to continue writing about projects publicly?
Being part of an enthusiastic community of people who are themselves
making things and writing things and hyping up other people who are
making and writing things. Shout-out to a bunch of folks in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse (RC)</a> community, who’ve
provided motivation simply by being present and engaged; I’m
additionally thankful for the kind and responsive crowd that hangs in
RC’s <code>#blogging</code> channel.</p></li>
<li><p>My original goal in the structure of this site was to allow me to
share projects and thoughts with as little infrastructural friction as
possible, and a year in, the site structure and publishing mechanisms I
set up have met that goal. Through a rough vibes assessment—and a glance
at my git history—I’ve managed to follow Charles’s “publish
<em>then</em> program” <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cceckman.com/writing/publish-then-program/">Investment
Blogging Protocol (IBP)</a> fairly effectively. I’m a little surprised,
to be honest!</p></li>
<li><p>Semi-regularly attending the weekly “publication accountability”
group through RC has been lovely, and has kept me <del><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a></del> motivated into make
incremental progress even on weeks without much other free time for
writing.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower the bar I set for any individual post, the greater the
chance I hit publish on it and move on. I have to continually remind
myself of this, and then lower that bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Originally, I planned to retroactively write up all projects <a href="https://hannahilea.com/projects/">shared here on my site</a>. Only, it turns out
that digging out of project backlog hell is…kinda hellish. I no longer
plan to retroactively make posts for all projects shared here on my
site!</p></li>
<li><p>I have written a lot more words than I have published. This is
neither good nor bad, but it is something I’m thinking about.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a dedicated draft-reader and thumbs-up-giver has been
key—shout-out to AF, who has done a final read on most posts, flagged
obvious errors, and provided confirmation that at least one other person
(her!) finds the thing worth reading. Bonus points for often doing this
last pass at stupid-o’clock, after I’d promised to be done hours
earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>The existence of this site has let me shift my project mindset
from a regularly negative cycle of “think up project, do project,
abandon project in weird state, feel guilty about not completing
project, avoid it, etc” and shift to more of a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ntietz.com/blog/making-progress-with-content-driven-development">content-driven
development</a> mindset—as in, I can decide I’m done with a project at
any point, and “writing about it” is as good an end point as meeting
some arbitrary perfectionist bar that I haven’t even clarified for
myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I still really struggle with exactly how candid to be here, and
about which parts of my life and thoughts about the world to share.
Focusing on the tech projects has helped set a bit of a boundary, but
it’s still hazy. I’m not quite as personally open as some of the tech
and art writers I most admire, and I’m not sure if or when that will
change. At heart I’m still a livejournal kid, with a fully-locked-down
journal, and it feels weird to not know exactly who is reading any of
this.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven’t quite figured out a consistent tone, or level of
appropriate wordiness, or a specific audience and level of detail for
any given set of tech steps. I think that’s okay, and expect it to be an
emergent property, but I do think about it semi-regularly when I write
here, and once it has settled I think my writing-to-publishing process
will feel smoother and involve less angsting.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a post hit the top of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com">The Orange Site</a> felt great.</p>

<p>While I’ve since determined that HN is a mixed-blessing of a
validator<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, it sure provided some nice dopamine
at the time! My favorite response to <a href="https://hannahilea.com/cuttle-obsession/">that
post</a>, though, was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>really fun to see! and then about 15min later after i read it, my dad
sent it to me, apparently thinking so too having seen it on hn :P</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the <em>real</em> win in broader readership—having written
something that someone thinks is worth sending to their kid, without
them knowing me or knowing that said kid knows me. :D</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>I have <em>way</em> more ideas for things I want to write about
than I have time to write about those things. Maybe it’s time for <a href="https://hannahilea.com/future-blog-posts/">another</a> post-on-future-posts?</p></li>
<li><p>My refusal to use statistical word salad machines for any part of
my process—writing or otherwise—has only strengthened over the year.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I like making bulleted lists. Turning those lists into paragraphs
is hard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I never publish anything else to this site, I feel good about
how much I’ve done this year alone.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> My “write publicly”
experiment was a personal win, and I encourage everyone to try it for
themselves. (Not sure how to start? I recommend <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hannahilea.com/blog/www.tinylogger.com">tinylogger</a>!<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>)</p>

you, for reading!</em></strong></p>
