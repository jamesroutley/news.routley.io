Instead he reportedly memorised the entire French Scrabble dictionary in nine weeks.</p><p>“He doesn’t speak French at all – he just learned the words,” his friend Liz Fagerlund <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11484662" data-link-name="in body link">told the New Zealand Herald</a> at the time. “He won’t know what they mean, wouldn’t be able to carry out a conversation in French, I wouldn’t think.”</p><p>In 2018 he again <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/29/new-zealander-wins-record-fourth-world-scrabble-title" data-link-name="in body link">won</a> the francophone tournament, casting off any suggestion that his French title had been a one-off.</p><p>After nearly three decades of playing Scrabble competitively, Richards is widely viewed as the best player of all time, with some <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/3778594/A-way-with-words" data-link-name="in body link">chalking up</a> his skills to his photographic memory and ability to quickly calculate mathematical probabilities. Intensely private and swift to turn down interviews, very little is known about his personal life.</p><p>His reclusive nature – along with his decades of Scrabble conquests and coups – have turned him into a legend of sorts for some.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“Just mentioning his name makes me tingle; he’s a phenomenon,” Eric Salvador Tchouyo, a world champion Scrabble player from Cameroon, <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/es/europa/20241122-nigel-richards-el-indiscutible-campe%C3%B3n-del-scrabble-en-ingl%C3%A9s-franc%C3%A9s-y-espa%C3%B1ol" data-link-name="in body link">told Radio France Internationale</a>.</p><p>“I often say he would make a good doctoral thesis topic for students in medicine because it’s incomprehensible that someone could have such memory capacity in a language he doesn’t speak.”</p><p>Describing Richards, 57, as an “exceptional” person, he noted that whenever Richards turned up at a tournament, the other players knew they were playing for second place at best.</p><p>“When Nigel Richards sits at a table, everyone loses their nerves, even the biggest champions,” he said. “Playing against Nigel Richards is like playing against a computer.”</p></div></div></div>
