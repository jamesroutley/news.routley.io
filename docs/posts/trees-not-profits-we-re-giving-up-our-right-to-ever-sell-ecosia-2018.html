    <h1>Trees not profits: we&#39;re giving up our right to ever sell Ecosia (2018)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When I founded Ecosia a few years ago, I made <strong>two promises</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="1iwillneversellecosia">1. I will never sell Ecosia.</h3>
<h3 id="2iwillnevertakeprofitsoutofthecompany">2. I will never take profits out of the company.</h3>
<p>I made these promises because my goal for Ecosia has always been to make the world a greener, better place – not to get rich. I also wanted to prove that there is a more ethical way of doing business.</p>
<p>Since then, Ecosia has grown into something way bigger than myself: we’re not just planting millions of trees every month, we’re also becoming one of the largest environmental movements in the world.</p>
<p>And so I find it important to renew my commitment to my two promises by turning Ecosia into a so-called “steward-owned company”. This model imposes two <em>legally binding and irreversible</em> restrictions on us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shares can’t be sold at a profit or owned by people outside of the company.</li>
<li>No profits can be taken out of the company.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two restrictions sound like a <em>terrible</em> idea to most traditional entrepreneurs. But Ecosia isn’t traditional. We’re not interested in maximizing profits, we’re interested in maximizing the amount of trees we plant.</p>
<p>I hope that many other businesses will follow suit. I truly believe that the world would be a better place if more businesses were driven by a meaningful cause instead of shareholder value maximization.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>P.S.: Being a “steward-owned company” means that it will be impossible for me – or anyone else – to sell Ecosia at a profit or take money out of the company. This obviously also applies to the former co-owner of Ecosia, <a href="https://www.schumacher.me/">Tim</a>, an experienced entrepreneur I met a few years ago. He invested in Ecosia at a time when no one knew if this crazy project would ever work out. Tim, I cannot overstate how grateful I am that you agree to turn Ecosia into a non-profit company, effectively waiving your right to get any of your investment back.</p>
