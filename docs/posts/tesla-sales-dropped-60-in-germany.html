<p>Tesla’s sales have dropped nearly 60% in January in Germany compared to the same period last year. The same thing is happening throughout Europe.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, we reported that <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/03/tesla-tsla-sales-are-dropping-like-a-rock-in-europe-but-its-not-just-because-of-elon-musk/">Tesla’s sales crashed throughout all European markets in January</a>.</p>



<p>The two main reasons are believed to be the introduction of the new Model Y and the disapproval of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his meddling in politics, which is especially not appreciated in Europe.</p>



<p>At the time, we didn’t have the number from Germany, but now we do.</p>	
	



<p>Reuters reported that Tesla’s sales were down 59.5% in January:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>German road traffic agency KBA’s website on Wednesday showed the number of newly registered Tesla cars fell 59.5% to 1,277 in January, while the overall German market was down just 2.8% at slightly more than 207,000 vehicles during the month.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is undoubtedly a Tesla problem because the German auto market was down just 2.8% in January, and the battery-electric market was up 53.5% during the period.</p>



<p>These are now Tesla’s sales in Europe in 2025 compared to 2024:</p>

<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This is pretty nuts. Obviously, Tesla will use the Model Y transition as an excuse, and there’s some truth to it. However, Tesla was transitioning the Model 3 around the same time last year, which also negatively affected 2024 sales.</p>




	<p>Now, it’s true that Model Y is more impactful than Model 3, but I think it’s also clear that the Musk effect is at play too, it’s just impossible to tell by how much.</p>



<p>But I do think it will be quite disastrous, especially considering the Model Y refresh is not significant enough to convince people who are on the fence.</p>



<p>It feels like the negative sentiment toward Tesla is still gaining momentum rather than slowing down.</p>



<p>That’s not good for the EV industry. At least they have more options in Europe. It will hit even harder if we start seeing a similar impact on Tesla in the US.</p>
