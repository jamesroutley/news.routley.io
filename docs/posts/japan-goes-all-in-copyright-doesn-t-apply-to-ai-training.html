    <h1>Japan Goes All In: Copyright Doesn&#39;t Apply to AI Training</h1>

									<p><span>In a surprising move, Japan’s government recently reaffirmed that it will not enforce copyrights on data used in AI training. The policy allows AI to use any data <a href="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-e1687193572247.jpg"><img decoding="async" alt="" width="165" height="220" data-src="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-225x300.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></a>“regardless of whether it is for non-profit or commercial purposes, whether it is an act other than reproduction, or whether it is content obtained from illegal sites or otherwise.” <strong>Keiko Nagaoka, Japanese Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</strong>, <a href="https://go2senkyo.com/seijika/122181/posts/685617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the bold stance to local meeting, saying that Japan’s laws won’t protect copyrighted materials used in AI datasets.</span></p>
<h2><span>Japan, AI, and Copyright</span></h2>
<p><span>English language coverage of the situation is sparse. It seems the Japanese government believes copyright worries, particularly those linked to anime and other visual media, have held back the nation’s progress in AI technology. In response, Japan is going all-in, opting for a no-copyright approach to remain competitive.</span></p>
<p><span>This news is part of Japan’s ambitious plan to become a leader in AI technology. Rapidus, a local tech firm known for its advanced 2nm chip technology, is stepping into the spotlight as a serious contender in the world of AI chips. With Taiwan’s political situation looking unstable, Japanese chip manufacturing could be a safer bet. Japan is also stepping up to help shape the global rules for AI systems within the G-7.</span></p>
<h2><span>Artists vs. Business (Artists Lost)</span></h2>
<p><span>Not everyone in Japan is on board with this decision. Many anime and graphic art creators are concerned that AI could lower the value of their work. But in contrast, the academic and business sectors are pressing the government to use the nation’s relaxed data laws to propel Japan to global AI dominance.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite having the world’s third-largest economy, Japan’s economic growth has been sluggish since the 1990s. Japan has the lowest per-capita income in the G-7. With the effective implementation of AI, it could potentially boost the nation’s GDP by 50% or more in a short time. For Japan, which has been experiencing years of low growth, this is an exciting prospect.</span></p>
<h2><span>It’s All About The Data</span></h2>
<p><span>Western data access is also key to Japan’s AI ambitions. The more high-quality training data available, the better the AI model. While Japan boasts a long-standing literary tradition, the amount of Japanese language training data is significantly less than the English language resources available in the West. However, Japan is home to a wealth of anime content, which is popular globally. It seems Japan’s stance is clear – if the West uses Japanese culture for AI training, Western literary resources should also be available for Japanese AI.</span></p>
<h2><span>What This Means For The World</span></h2>
<p><span><strong>On a global scale, Japan’s move adds a twist to the regulation debate</strong>. Current discussions have focused on a “rogue nation” scenario where a less developed country might disregard a global framework to gain an advantage. But with Japan, we see a different dynamic. <strong>The world’s third-largest economy is saying it won’t hinder AI research and development. Plus, it’s prepared to leverage this new technology to compete directly with the West</strong>.</span></p>
