<p>&#34;<b>The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet</b>&#34; (also known as &#34;<b>Like the Wind</b>&#34;, &#34;<b>Blind the Wind</b>&#34;, &#34;<b>Check It In, Check It Out</b>&#34; or &#34;<b>Take It In, Take It Out</b>&#34; after lines in fan-interpreted lyrics; acronymed as <b>TMMSOTI</b> or <b>TMS</b>) is the nickname given to an unidentified song recording, most likely composed in the 1980s.
</p><p>The song was reportedly recorded from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norddeutscher_Rundfunk" title="Norddeutscher Rundfunk">Norddeutscher Rundfunk</a> (NDR) broadcast sometime in the mid-1980s, likely during or after 1984.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown2019_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Brown2019-1">[1]</a></sup> Since 2019, this song has been the subject of a viral Internet phenomenon, with many users of sites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit" title="Reddit">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)" title="Discord (software)">Discord</a> involved in a collaborative effort to search for the origins of the song.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown2019_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Brown2019-1">[1]</a></sup> Through the search, other unknown songs were discovered. Users have coined the term &#34;Lostwave&#34; to describe songs of this nature.

<p>A man named Darius S. recorded the song from a radio program that he listened to on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_German" title="West German">West German</a> public radio station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norddeutscher_Rundfunk" title="Norddeutscher Rundfunk">NDR</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown2019_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-Brown2019-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> Darius recorded the song on a cassette tape, which also included songs from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTC" title="XTC">XTC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure" title="The Cure">The Cure</a>. It has been speculated that the song was recorded in 1984, since most of the songs on the cassette recording were also released around 1984. Further evidence that supports this as being the earliest possible airing date was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_(brand)" title="Technics (brand)">Technics</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_deck" title="Tape deck">tape deck</a> that he most likely used to record the song, which was manufactured in 1984 as well.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown2019_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-Brown2019-1">[1]</a></sup> To get clean recordings of songs, Darius purposely removed dialogue from radio hosts, which is likely why the exact airplay date and the title are unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-Reeve2020_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Reeve2020-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1985, Darius created a playlist consisting of the unidentified songs in his personal collection; he eventually digitized it in 2004, saving the songs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Interchange_File_Format" title="Audio Interchange File Format">.aiff</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14" title="MPEG-4 Part 14">.m4a</a> files. Then, Darius&#39;s older sister, Lydia H., gave Darius a website domain as a birthday present, which he used to raise awareness of his playlist.<sup id="cite_ref-Spontis_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Spontis-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>On March 18, 2007, Lydia brought the search to the internet, in an attempt to identify the song. Going under the pseudonym &#34;Anton Riedel&#34;, her search originally began on de.rec.musik.recherche, but she eventually migrated to websites with song identification tools, upon the request of user Andreas Eibach. Lydia posted a digital snippet of the song to best-of-80s.de, a German fansite devoted to eighties synth-pop and to spiritofradio.ca, a website dedicated to the Canadian radio station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFNY-FM" title="CFNY-FM">102.1 The Edge</a>, under the pseudonym &#34;bluuue&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown2019_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-Brown2019-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>The mystery of the unidentified song gained viral popularity in 2019, when a Brazilian teenager named Gabriel da Silva Vieira began searching for the song&#39;s origin, after being informed about it by Nicolas Zuniga of the Spanish record label Dead Wax Records. Gabriel uploaded the circulated snippet of the song to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> and many music-related Reddit communities, and eventually founded r/TheMysteriousSong.<sup id="cite_ref-vibe_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-vibe-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>On May 27, 2019, Australian website Tone Deaf wrote the earliest article focusing on the song, with author Tyler Jenke discussing the preliminary stages of the search for the track, and noting that the search was similar to a 2013 search for a song which was ultimately identified as &#34;Up On The Roof&#34; by Swedish musician Johan Lindell.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>On July 9, 2019, American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber" title="YouTuber">YouTuber</a> Justin Whang posted an episode of <i>Tales from the Internet</i> discussing the song, and the progress of the search up to that point. The video&#39;s release further galvanized Internet users to contribute to the effort to identify the song.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-vibe_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-vibe-5">[5]</a></sup> After the release of Whang&#39;s video, Reddit user u/johnnymetoo posted the complete version of the song, which he obtained from a link on one of Lydia&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> posts before deletion.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Searchers made contact with individuals potentially pertinent to the search, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baskerville" title="Paul Baskerville">Paul Baskerville</a>, one of the <i>Musik FÃ¼r Junge Leute</i> hosts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEMA_(German_organization)" title="GEMA (German organization)">GEMA</a>, a German government and performance rights organization, and a YouTube channel named &#34;80zforever&#34;, which posts obscure music.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown2019_1-5"><a href="#cite_note-Brown2019-1">[1]</a></sup> Baskerville agreed to play the song on Nachtclub, his then-current radio show, on July 21, 2019.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-:1-8">[8]</a></sup> Although no new leads came of it, it did make Lydia and Darius S. aware of the new wave of investigation, and Lydia subsequently became involved with the Reddit community in August.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_8-1"><a href="#cite_note-:1-8">[8]</a></sup> 
</p><p>On July 9, 2020, Reddit user u/FlexxonMobil acquired the complete list of songs Baskerville had played on <i>Musik FÃ¼r Junge Leute</i> (Music for Young People) in 1984 and published it on the site.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> After some searching, users concluded that the song was not in that list, effectively ruling out the theory that Baskerville had played the song.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The remaining <i>Musik FÃ¼r Junge Leute</i> playlists eventually arrived in December 2020, and after an extensive search, users concluded that the song was not played on <i>Musik FÃ¼r Junge Leute.</i> In January 2021, the community received <i>Der Club</i> and <i>Nachtclub</i> playlists from October and November 1984, and found several songs that Darius and Lydia had taped, including those from the BASF 4|1 tape, leading users to believe the song will show up within the remaining playlists.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>In late 2020 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord" title="Discord">Discord</a> user Fliere analysed the tape recording of the song and found a 10Â kHz line, which was also present on the other BASF 4|1 songs and some songs on BASF 4|2. This line was discovered to be present on virtually all NDR radio broadcasts at the time, but not on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPO_3FM" title="NPO 3FM">Hilversum</a> radio broadcasts, effectively ruling out the possibility of the song being aired on any station other than NDR.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>On November 2, 2021, Lydia posted on Reddit that one of her sons found a box full of tapes that were mostly labeled as &#34;Alles mÃ¶gliche&#34; (private labeling for all of mixtapes from radios) while renovating in two rooms of her apartment. On one of the tapes, she found a higher quality version of the song. The list of the tape with The Most Mysterious Song was different than previous ones, though it is speculated it&#39;s made from the same recording, hearing the same artifacts as the first tape.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

<p>Searchers generally agree that the singer has some sort of European accent, but the specific type is unclear.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> Some users have theorized that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7" title="Yamaha DX7">Yamaha DX7</a> synthesizer, which was released in late 1983, was used in the leads.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_8-2"><a href="#cite_note-:1-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
