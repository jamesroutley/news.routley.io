    <h1>18 Months with a Framework 13</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I&#39;ve been using a Framework 13 laptop as my main/only computer for a little over 18 months now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/bench-sample.webp"><img alt="Framework laptop on my work bench" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/bench-sample.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/bench-sample.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/bench-sample.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/bench-sample.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>Someone asked me about it the other day, and I remembered that I&#39;ve been meaning to write up my experiences.</p>
<p>This is essentially a very personal review. I&#39;ve broken it down into a summary of <a href="#my-framework">My Framework</a>, a short <a href="#laptop-autobiography">Laptop Autobiography</a>, then <a href="#the-good">The Good</a>, <a href="#the-bad">The Bad</a>, <a href="#the-ugly">The Ugly</a>, and <a href="#the-rest">The Rest</a>. If you&#39;re impatient then skip to the end with the <a href="#bottom-line">Bottom Line</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-framework">My Framework</h2>
<p>I bought a Framework 13 &#34;12th Gen Intel&#34; model. This is Framework&#39;s second generation mainboard. The company has subsequently released an AMD Ryzen 7040 mainboard, an Intel 13th Gen mainboard, a whole bigger &#34;Framework 16&#34; model, and announced an Intel Ultra 1 mainboard. Phew!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/shed-sample.webp"><img alt="Framework laptop in my shed" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/shed-sample.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/shed-sample.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/shed-sample.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/shed-sample.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p><small>(Note: A lot of the random Framework photos in this post are ones I&#39;d already taken while working on my <a href="https://www.projectgus.com/tag/ev-conversion-project.html">EV conversion project</a>.)</small></p>
<p>Mine is the &#34;DIY edition&#34; with i5-1240P CPU and 32GB of RAM supplied by Framework. I sourced an SSD myself (2TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus). Not picking from <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/what-storage-ssd-parts-are-compatible-with-the-framework-laptop-rJOOeHU0_">Framework&#39;s list of compatible SSDs</a> probably carried a small risk, but it&#39;s been fine for me. Going off-list for RAM might have been a bigger risk (although probably also fine).</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t go overboard buying expansion cards for ports: mine has one USB-C and one USB-A port on each side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/ports.webp"><img alt="Close up of the side of my closed Framework" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/ports.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/ports.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/ports.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/ports.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<h2 id="laptop-autobiography">Laptop Autobiography</h2>
<p>Given the <em>personal</em> nature of personal computing, I want to briefly explain my own laptop history and expectations. If my experiences are useful for anyone at all, it&#39;s most likely for folks whose computer usage and values overlap my own.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>I generally run Linux (previously macOS, but migrated to the penguin over a decade ago). I&#39;m a <a href="https://redyak.com.au">self-employed</a> professional software developer who specialises in embedded systems. As such, this review is probably only relevant for developers and/or Linux users.</p>
<p>Software development means I generally don&#39;t care about graphics performance. The laptop workload is mostly light (browser, editor, terminal), punctuated by brief excursions to maximum CPU load (compiling, opening modern web pages).</p>
<p>About 80% of the time my laptop is sitting on a monitor laptop stand, connected to a Thunderbolt 4 (aka USB 4) dock with an additional external monitor and a pile of USB hubs and devices:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/desk-sample2.webp"><img alt="Photo of my desk with Framework in its laptop stand" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/desk-sample2.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/desk-sample2.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/desk-sample2.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/desk-sample2.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>Maybe 10% of the time I&#39;m using it on the couch, the dining room table, on my electronics bench or out in the shed. The remaining 10% of the time I&#39;m using it out and about somewhere (cafes, trains, meeting rooms).</p>
<p>As shown in the photo above, working with embedded systems means my laptop often has a <em>lot</em> of random USB devices attached to it.</p>
<h3 id="favourites">Favourites</h3>
<p>My all-time favourite laptop is the ThinkPad X60, released in 2006. I still have mine:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/x60.webp"><img alt="ThinkPad X60 on my bench" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/x60.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/x60.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/x60.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/x60.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s an amazing combination of sturdiness and portability, with a really good keyboard. When I upgraded to a ThinkPad X230 I kept treating it the same as I&#39;d treated the X60 for years. The newer laptop&#39;s case cracked almost immediately.</p>
<p>From 2016 to 2023, my laptop was a Dell XPS 13 (model 9350) with a sixth gen Intel CPU. Sometimes this was supplemented with a work laptop (also XPS 13), and later a desktop computer. I reckon if it hadn&#39;t been for the Spectre and Meltdown workarounds reducing performance<sup id="fnref:rust"><a href="#fn:rust">1</a></sup> then I could have kept using that XPS 13 for a few more years. A solid and well supported laptop for Linux.</p>
<p>Framework is not my first &#34;DIY friendly&#34; laptop. I have a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/novena">Kosagi Novena</a> as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/novena.webp"><img alt="Kosagi Novena on my bench" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/novena.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/novena.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/novena.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/novena.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>A groundbreaking open source hardware project, although I never found a way to use it regularly.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>Before ordering a Framework I considered some other options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Another Dell XPS 13. I almost went for this, but I don&#39;t like a few minor things with the later XPS models. For example, no power indicator light. I guess Dell aspires to a future where users don&#39;t have to care if their laptop is on, suspended, or shut down. This is sadly still relevant for Linux users, at least until the Year of Linux on the Desktop rolls around.</li>
<li>ThinkPad X1 Carbon. I&#39;ve never owned one but they seem pretty good.</li>
<li><a href="https://mntre.com/reform.html">MNT Reform</a>. Left-field choice as I would notice the reduced performance sometimes, but I did think about pairing one with a desktop computer. MNT feels like a spiritual evolution of the Novena concept, but in a more conventional form. However, I also value the convenience of keeping everything in one computer system.</li>
<li>Some kind of MacBook. I&#39;m not in a hurry to go back to macOS, but it&#39;s clear that Apple&#39;s current laptop hardware combines performance, battery life, and physical portability to a uniquely high standard. For me, the trade-off would be the more limited OS, and the difficulty of repair if something breaks.<sup id="fnref:apple-repair"><a href="#fn:apple-repair">2</a></sup> I looked hard at <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a> too, but until Thunderbolt support lands I think the docking experience would annoy me a little too much.<sup id="fnref:nitpick"><a href="#fn:nitpick">3</a></sup> Plus, running Linux wouldn&#39;t address the repairability issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, I also really want Framework to succeed. I recognise that my values sit at the exact intersection of <em>hyper-technical weirdo</em> and <em>repair-focused anti-disposable-tech consumer</em> that they best cater for.</p>
<p>Alright, enough laptop reminiscence. Time to talk about my experience with this Framework laptop. Here it comes, out of the box:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/out-of-box.webp"><img alt="Framework laptop in original packaging" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/out-of-box.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/out-of-box.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/out-of-box.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/out-of-box.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="good-setup-and-repairability">Good: Setup and repairability</h3>
<p>I&#39;d seen Framework&#39;s marketing about how modular and repairable their laptop was, but wasn&#39;t truly prepared for <em>how easy</em> they make it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/inside-case.webp"><img alt="Framework laptop with the case open" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/inside-case.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/inside-case.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/inside-case.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/inside-case.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>Clearly labelled screws, many captive so you can&#39;t lose them or mix them up. Labels everywhere and QR codes linking to documentation.</p>
<p>They&#39;ve planned the &#34;out of box experience&#34; in detail, all the way into the case. Full points.</p>
<h3 id="good-sturdiness">Good: Sturdiness</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve seen internet armchair critics saying Framework sacrificed repairability or durability to make this laptop thin. I don&#39;t see how: everything comes apart really well, and feels really solid. I&#39;d feel more confident repairing this laptop than almost any laptop made in the last decade.</p>
<p>Yes, I would love a slightly thicker laptop with a &#34;real&#34; keyboard like an old ThinkPad, but that&#39;s asking a lot in 2024.<sup id="fnref:mnt"><a href="#fn:mnt">4</a></sup> The chiclet keyboard on the Framework has decent travel and the case is solid with basically zero flex while typing. I would like a touch more key resistance, but I reckon it&#39;s as good or better than 95% of the competition.</p>
<p>With one flimsy exception (see below), I&#39;m as confident carting around the Framework 13 as any laptop I&#39;ve ever owned. Apart from the tank ThinkPad X60, but even it&#39;s not that far ahead.</p>
<h3 id="good-display">Good: Display</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/shed-sample2.webp"><img alt="Framework laptop in my shed, display in foreground" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/shed-sample2.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/shed-sample2.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/shed-sample2.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/shed-sample2.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of reviewers mentioned this when it came out. It&#39;s a really nice display, good resolution, not ridiculously glossy, and the 4:3 aspect ratio is great in this size.</p>
<p>The physical power switches for Mic and Camera are appreciated, if a little aesthetically jarring. I wouldn&#39;t change them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/mic-camera.webp"><img alt="Close up of mic and camera switches" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/mic-camera.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/mic-camera.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/mic-camera.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/mic-camera.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<h3 id="good-modular-ports">Good: Modular ports</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/expansion.webp"><img alt="Framework upside down with one expansion card removed" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/expansion.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/expansion.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/expansion.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/expansion.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>I think the swappable &#34;Expansion Cards&#34; for ports (and other functions) are a great idea, and I like that you can reconfigure your laptop on the fly (for example, to temporarily have an HDMI port while at a conference). The open source nerd in me appreciates that they&#39;ve published the specs, and people have designed and made custom expansions.</p>
<h3 id="good-enough-battery-life">Good enough: Battery life</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t know if any x86 laptop does <em>that</em> well on battery life. Apple is, for better or worse, kind of in their own league here.</p>
<p>Recently I took a 12 hour train ride from Melbourne to Sydney and tried to do a day&#39;s work on my Framework. There&#39;s no Wi-Fi on the train (because Australia), very patchy mobile reception (because Australia), so I had Wi-Fi disabled and only enabled Bluetooth about 40% of the time to tether my phone. I enjoyed close to seven hours of use before it threatened to Hibernate at 5% battery. Probably this would be closer to five hours with Wi-Fi enabled and more web browsing, or maybe eight hours if I&#39;d also left Bluetooth off and only ran my editor.</p>
<p>The laptop is also prone to occasionally cooking itself in a bag and discharging the battery while &#34;suspended&#34;. This might be a Linux problem not a Framework problem: I&#39;m not certain my Framework is worse than other x86 laptops running Linux, but my gut feeling is that it happens a bit more than average on Framework. I&#39;ve taken to hibernating if I definitely need to preserve battery, which is an annoying workaround.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<h3 id="bad-flimsy-default-hinges">Bad: Flimsy default hinges</h3>
<p>This part comes with a whole backstory. As I <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/explainer-lid-rigidity-hinge-force-the-cnc-top-cover-and-the-new-4-0kg-hinge-kit/19157">understand it</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>So users could open the laptop with one hand, Framework specified nominal 3.3kg strength lid hinges.</li>
<li>For some period in 2022 (before I bought mine), their supplier shipped even lighter hinges and on some laptops the lid wouldn&#39;t stay up by itself.</li>
<li>They fixed that, and also introduced a 4kg &#34;heavy&#34; hinge option - although it&#39;s not a build-time configuration choice but a separate item to order and install yourself.</li>
<li>According to random forum posts the tolerance on the hinge strength remains +/-0.5kg, so some laptops have significantly lighter hinges than others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Behold, me picking up my open laptop and putting it back down:</p>
<video controls="" width="80%">
<source src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/hinges.webm" type="video/webm"/>
</video>
<p>Multiple people have commented to me about my floppy laptop screen. It&#39;s the only random comment that I&#39;ve received more than once about this laptop, and probably not the first impression that Framework want to make!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a daily annoyance to pick the laptop up with the screen open, walk somewhere, put it back down and find it&#39;s flopped fully open or closed in the process. The hard jolt at the end when it falls all the way open in free air is also unsettling, although I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any long-term risk of damage.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how much lighter or heavier than average my individual laptop&#39;s hinges are, but that&#39;s essentially the problem - I&#39;ve never had to think about laptop hinge force and acceptable manufacturing tolerance before!</p>
<p>I have not yet ordered the heavy hinge kit. In part because I&#39;m worried about this +/-0.5kg variation. If I&#39;m on the &#34;light&#34; side of the bell curve now, but I land on the &#34;heavy&#34; side with the new hinge kit then they might be far too stiff. In part I also haven&#39;t ordered them because of shipping cost (see below).</p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em> Someone has kindly pointed out to me that in March 2023 Framework announced <a href="https://frame.work/au/en/products/hinge-kit-2nd-gen-3-5kg">&#34;Gen 2&#34; hinges</a> with 3.5kg nominal weight. By all accounts these are what I want, and what everyone will have received by default since (I guess) mid 2023. I had missed that these existed, for example I don&#39;t see them mentioned in the <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/explainer-lid-rigidity-hinge-force-the-cnc-top-cover-and-the-new-4-0kg-hinge-kit/19157">&#34;Explainer&#34; forum thread</a> that I&#39;d assumed was the best available source of official hinge technical information (at least, I don&#39;t know of a better source...)</p>
<h3 id="bad-flimsy-usb-a-ports">Bad: Flimsy USB-A ports</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve found that if I &#34;hang&#34; a cable or a small device in free air from the USB-A port then it bends the &#34;tongue&#34; inside the port down and before long the port will stop working:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/hanging-cable.webp"><img alt="Close up of the left side of my laptop with a cable hanging out" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/hanging-cable.webp" srcset="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/1x/hanging-cable.webp 1x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/2x/hanging-cable.webp 2x, https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/derivatives/article/4x/hanging-cable.webp 4x"/></a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve had temporary success bending it back, but it seems to be permanently weakened. One of my USB-A cards has already been replaced under warranty, and the other one failed shortly after the official warranty period ended. I assume the replaced card will fail again soon if I&#39;m not very careful, as it seems to be the same hardware revision. Others have reported <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/usb-a-ports-seem-weak-cheap-ish/22593">similar things</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never had a USB-A port fail on any other laptop, so I don&#39;t think this is exactly my fault even though my usage may be harsher than average. I think either the actual USB-A socket part or the mechanical design is unusually weak for a portable computer.</p>
<p>It&#39;d be nice to migrate entirely to USB-C some day, but electronics designers <em>love</em> USB-A cables for development boards and tools.</p>
<h3 id="bad-shipping-cost-to-australia">Bad: Shipping cost to Australia</h3>
<p>I guess I should be glad that Framework ship to Australia at all, but multiple times I&#39;ve gone to order additional expansion cards and changed my mind when the shipping doubles the price:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of checkout showing $30AU shipping on a $30AU order" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/checkout.png"/></p>
<p>(OK, I&#39;m a cheapskate, I get it.)</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure &#34;improve global logistics&#34; is somewhere on Framework&#39;s strategic to-do list, and I can&#39;t wait for the day they get to it.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<h3 id="ugly-biosfirmware">Ugly: BIOS/Firmware</h3>
<p>The BIOS/Firmware situation for Framework is currently not good, and it&#39;s particularly bad for Intel models on Linux. I could write a whole blog post about this, but I&#39;ll try to summarise my understanding here.</p>
<p>Framework have contracted with a third party company to develop their main UEFI firmware (aka BIOS). Until earlier this year there was no stable BIOS update for my laptop at all, despite it having first shipped in 2022. As of September 2024, the only update for &#34;12th Gen&#34; Linux users is still a pre-release (currently &#34;3.08d&#34;, previously &#34;3.08a&#34;, &#34;3.08b&#34;, &#34;3.08c&#34;).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-08-release/43244">forum thread where the update was released</a> has 597 posts as of today, and it&#39;s a wild ride. Stories include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-08-release/43244/230">Someone</a>&#39;s laptop stopped booting until they removed half the RAM.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-08-release/43244/213">Someone else</a> applied the update successfully but now it &#34;soft bricks&#34; on every suspend.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-08-release/43244/400">Someone</a> was manually editing the update script after it failed to find all of the components.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-08-release/43244/408">Problems</a> with charging after the update.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-08-release/43244/417">Someone</a> analysed the 3.08b update release and claimed it would <em>never have applied 100% successfully</em> due to containing an incorrect component GUID. 🙃</li>
<li>People in the thread swapping SSDs and temporarily installing Windows so they can upgrade that way.</li>
</ul>
<p>... plus literally hundreds more posts, I haven&#39;t kept up with the whole thread.</p>
<p>In Framework&#39;s defence, posts from the last couple of weeks are mostly reporting successful updates. However, that&#39;s come after months of reported failures and four pre-release update revisions!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been a software professional for long enough to feel (but not know) that this resembles a systemic organisational failure of QA and release processes.<sup id="fnref:systemic"><a href="#fn:systemic">5</a></sup> It was hard to watch it unfold. Despite having relevant skills I have not yet been confident enough to apply this update myself - this laptop is the one tool which has to work in order for me to earn a living.</p>
<p>To Framework&#39;s credit, back in April they <a href="https://frame.work/au/en/blog/enabling-software-longevity">blogged about planned changes to their firmware development</a> - including bringing more of it in-house. Sounds great, but as a user it&#39;s hard to know when to expect definitive quality improvements - especially for &#34;older&#34; products like mine.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-need-secure-boot">Do you need Secure Boot?</h3>
<p>Why label this situation &#34;Ugly&#34; and not &#34;Bad&#34;? Well, until now it mostly only matters if you need robust Secure Boot. If the specific threat models that Secure Boot helps protect against matter for you or your organisation then I <em>strongly recommend not buying a Framework</em> until you see evidence of improvements. For everyone else, sticking with an older BIOS version is hopefully an option.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogoFAIL">LogoFAIL vulnerability</a> went public in December 2023, and the major manufacturers had patches ready on that date. Framework shipped their fix for 12th Gen models a month later, but today (nine months later) it&#39;s still beta for Linux users. AMD Framework models got a beta fix in April that went final in May (six months after public disclosure). I was also disappointed that no one from Framework updated their forum&#39;s <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/logofail-firmware-attack-with-link-to-insydes-security-advisory/41534">LogoFAIL discussion thread</a>, after the CEO posted some updates there early on.</p>
<p>Thing is, AFAIK if you don&#39;t enable Secure Boot then this type of vulnerability doesn&#39;t change much. If an attacker is able to mount this kind of attack and you don&#39;t have Secure Boot then they can already overwrite your BIOS.</p>
<p>Until now I&#39;m not sure the lack of BIOS updates otherwise makes that much of a difference. There are a few reported issues (i.e. the battery drain) that might be firmware/ACPI bugs, but there seem to be similar issues reported by people running the newest firmware so you&#39;re gambling either way 😬. Other issues I have run into so far were relatively minor and turned out to be fixed in Linux kernel updates. So, I don&#39;t know if the day to day experience is especially worse than the average x86 laptop. Although that&#39;s a fairly low bar, and I&#39;d love to see Framework do better.</p>

<p><small>(A very scaled down screenshot of an <a href="https://github.com/amanusk/s-tui">s-tui</a> stress test. CPU temps stabilise about 80C, frequencies at max non-turbo 2600MHz P-Cores and 2400MHz E-Cores.)</small></p>
<p>Framework made a decision that I really respect, which is not to aggressively thermally limit the total design power (TDP) of the laptop CPU. If you need it, the CPU will ramp up to maximum power for an indefinite period and the laptop will keep it cool enough. A lot of small modern laptops aren&#39;t designed for this kind of long term excursion to full power.</p>
<p>When the laptop is working hard, but not 100% on all cores, the controller will continuously vary the fan speed in a way I personally find a bit distracting, the sound reminds me of holding a seashell to my ear. If I was tuning that control loop then I&#39;d probably make it a bit less responsive!</p>
<p>The workaround I&#39;ve settled on is to manually downgrade the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/power-profiles-daemon">power profile</a> to Balanced or Power Save when I don&#39;t want to hear the fans (i.e. on most video calls):</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the KDE power profile status bar controls" src="https://www.projectgus.com/images/2024-09/power-profiles.png"/></p>
<p>This works pretty well. I reckon there&#39;s an even better theoretical solution where a switch limits temperature instead of total power, so the laptop can still Turbo Boost briefly but stays silent. However, I don&#39;t think any Intel-based laptop does better (at least on Linux).<sup id="fnref:thermald"><a href="#fn:thermald">6</a></sup></p>
<p>(Apple users have totally given up on us by this point...)</p>

<p>Framework has a large and active community, especially on their <a href="https://community.frame.work">discussion forum</a>. My experience is that this is simultaneously awesome and annoying.</p>
<p>It&#39;s awesome because there&#39;s a bunch of interesting enthusiastic people doing a bunch of interesting enthusiastic stuff. <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/honeywell-ptm7950-phase-change-thermal-pads-sheets-application-tips-and-results/20245">Want to improve the laptop heatsink performance?</a> - tons of useful info and technical detail. <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/thinkpad-701c-with-a-framework-brain-transplant-work-in-progress/27409">Like to put a Framework mainboard into a classic ThinkPad?</a> - boom, there you go!</p>
<p>It&#39;s annoying for a couple of reasons. First, even though there&#39;s a lot of information available in these forum threads it&#39;s often the <em>only</em> place that important information is available. A lot of the threads are hundreds of posts long, contain varying levels of signal to noise, and can take hours to read through.</p>
<p>The second thing that irks me about the forum is the inconsistent engagement from Framework itself. A good example is the <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/logofail-firmware-attack-with-link-to-insydes-security-advisory/41534/19">LogoFAIL thread</a> I already mentioned: the CEO posted some early updates saying that they were working on it, and then no one from the company ever replied again. It&#39;s great to have direct communication with employees ranging from engineering to senior management, but it&#39;s annoying to subscribe to a forum thread (containing updates literally from the CEO) and then realise you&#39;ve not been kept in the loop.</p>
<p>Some level of technical communications between &#34;semi-monthly marketing-oriented blog posts&#34; and &#34;inconsistent firehouse of random discussion forum threads&#34; would be ideal, I think.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>
<p>So, if my Framework 13 vanished tomorrow then what would I do?</p>
<p>Probably I&#39;d double check the &#34;Thunderbolt: TBA&#34; entries on the <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/M2-Series-Feature-Support">Asahi Linux wiki</a>, and then I&#39;d buy another Framework - probably the AMD-based Framework 13. Despite the downsides, I like what this company is doing. I admire that they&#39;re seriously competing with giants like Dell and Lenovo who are many times their size. More importantly, I still really like using my Framework laptop.</p>
<p>Where I&#39;m critical of Framework in this post it&#39;s not because I want them to fail. They&#39;re a hardware startup that&#39;s proven their ability to ship good products, and I know how crushingly tough that is. I&#39;m hopeful that they&#39;ll continue to grow into a mature hardware company with a strong maintenance track record, and demonstrated mature in-house development processes. I hope in a few years to write a follow-up post with even more &#34;Good&#34; points and barely a concern.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#39;d encourage almost everyone to consider a Framework for their next laptop - but first read up on whatever features matter most <em>for you</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe order that &#34;heavy&#34; hinge kit too, just in case...</p>
