				<p>I&#39;m familiar with HTTP and FTP. I worked in the mobile industry, so knew that <code>tel:+44...</code> could be used to launch a dialer.</p>
				<p>But DICT?!?!?!</p>
				<p>It turns out that, lurking on the Internet are <em>Dictionary Servers</em>! They exist to allow you to query dictionaries over a network.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>For many years, the Internet community has relied on the &#34;webster&#34; protocol for access to natural language definitions. [â€¦] In recent years, the number of publicly available webster servers on the Internet has dramatically decreased. Fortunately, several freely-distributable dictionaries and lexicons have recently become available on the Internet. However, these freely-distributable databases are not accessible via a uniform interface, and are not accessible from a single site.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2229">The (informal) standard was published in 1997</a> but has kept a relatively low profile since then. You can understand why it was invented - in an age of low-size disk drives and expensive software, looking up data over a dedicated protocol seems like a nifty<sup id="fnref:nifty"><a href="#fn:nifty" role="doc-noteref" title="nifty \nifty\ adj. 1. Very good; excellent; -- an informal term meaning about the same as {groovy}, sense 1. [informal, 1960&#39;s]">2</a></sup> idea.</p>
				<p>Then disk size exploded, databases became cheap, and search engines made it easy to look up words.</p>
				<h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2>
				<p>You can try it out today!</p>
				<p>Run this command in your terminal:</p>
				<p><code>curl dict://dict.org/d:Internet</code></p>
				<p>That will bring back the definition from the server&#39;s default dictionary. If you want to look up a word in a <em>specific</em> dictionary - like The Jargon File - you can run:</p>
				<p><code>curl dict://dict.org/d:Internet:jargon</code></p>
				<p>You can even use it for simple translation tasks. For example, to translate English to Japanese:</p>
				<p><code>curl dict://dict.org/d:Internet:fd-eng-jpn</code></p>
				<h2 id="what-else"><a href="#what-else">What Else?</a></h2>
				<p>Perhaps the easiest way to explore the protocol and server is to use telnet:</p>
				<p><code>telnet dict.org dict</code></p>
				<p>Type the command <code>HELP</code> and help ye shall receive:</p>
<!-- WP-Geshi _ -->
				<pre itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode"><code itemprop="text">113 help text follows</code></pre>
				<p>That will allow you to see all the dictionaries available - in a variety of languages - and the various commands you can use with them.</p>
				<h2 id="unanswered-questions"><a href="#unanswered-questions">Unanswered Questions</a></h2>
				<ol start="0">
					<li>Are there any other Dictionary Servers still available on the Internet?</li>
					<li>Did the Webster Protocol get specified outside of <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~bruncott/elisp/webster19-alpha.el">obscure source code</a>?
					</li>
					<li>Is there something interesting and modern one could do with a DICT server?</li>
