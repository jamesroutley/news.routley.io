    <h1>The washing machine in my ear, and an empty boat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over a period of about six months in 2022, I was nearing the brink of insanity; I would go to bed every single evening and hear a washing machine running in a neighbouring apartment.</p>
<p>My partner couldn’t hear anything, and I didn’t want to point it out in fear of ruining her sleep, so it was up to me to pinpoint where it came from. This turned out to be difficult, since the sound would disappear when I stood up, leading me to believe that it had just finished a cycle.</p>
<p>Was it the above apartment, the one below, or even one of the apartments across the hall? I didn’t know how well vibration from a washing machine running its most intense cycles could carry through floors, ceilings or walls.</p>
<p>Part of what kept me awake, in addition to the sound itself, was the sheer inconsideration of someone doing something like this every night, not caring how their habits could affect neighbours.</p>
<p>The more days, weeks and months that passed, the more sleep deprived, irritated and angry I became. The more countermeasures that failed , the more desperate I became too.</p>
<p>One evening while sitting up late with two good friends at one of their places, I also heard a washing machine, and commented on this. They thought it strange, probed as to what direction I heard it, and told me to say when I heard it. They, like myself, enjoy solving problems, and after listening in silence for a while the conclusion was that none of them could hear anything.</p>
<p>This is when one of them recalled having heard of a thing called “Low Frequency Tinnitus”, and the description from the <a href="https://audienhearing.com/blogs/tinnitus/low-frequency-tinnitus">first article I found about it</a>, made all the pieces fall into place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low-frequency tinnitus noises sound like the two lowest octaves on a piano. It’s often perceived as a deep droning, murmuring, or rumbling noise.</p>
<p>Because of the way its sounds and the uncertainty of the noise’s origins, it’s one of the tinnitus with the strongest effect on tinnitus patients.</p>
<p>Low-frequency tinnitus isn’t just annoying; some tinnitus patients have described it as a noise that can drive someone crazy or even make them question their sanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This became a real turning point, as knowing that there wasn’t any malicious or inconsiderate neighbour, and that the sound was just in my head, I stopped expecting to hear it, and my sleep went back to normal. Knowledge helped, where every single countermeasure had failed.</p>
<p>It’s ironic, because I’ve been aware of, and often referenced the 2nd paragraph of <a href="https://thedailyzen.org/2015/05/27/the-empty-boat-by-chuang-tzu/">“The Empty Boat” by Chuang Tzu</a> for many years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a man is crossing a river</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet for all my anger, annoyance, and sleep depravity, the boat I had been shouting at truly was empty.</p>
