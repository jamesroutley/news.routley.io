    <h1>People are pretending to be laid-off Twitter employees carrying boxes outside HQ</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In videos circulating on Twitter Friday morning, two men carrying boxes are seen standing near the entrance to Twitter’s San Francisco building, claiming to have been laid off by Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">who officially took over the company Thursday evening</a>. </p><p>There are plenty of problems with what these two men say to reporters. The most glaring is that one man identifies himself as a software engineer named “Rahul Ligma.” <em>The Verge </em>has confirmed that name does not exist in Twitter’s Slack or email system. There is also no evidence that the employee exists on LinkedIn.</p><p>“Ligma” is, of course, also an internet hoax designed to elicit the response “lick my balls” from people who are in on the joke. That didn’t stop multiple outlets, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/28/departing-twitter-employees-say-layoffs-have-started-as-elon-musk-takes-over.html">including <em>CNBC</em></a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-28/musk-starts-cutting-jobs-at-twitter-staff-leave-with-boxes?srnd=premium&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">and <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, from running headlines Friday saying that laid-off Twitter employees were leaving the building carrying boxes.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23184519/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-deal-complete-agreement">Musk fired many of Twitter’s top execs Thursday evening</a> and has signaled that he will in fact lay off employees. But Ligma is not one of them. A spokesperson for Twitter didn’t respond to a request for comment. </p></div><p>Since we’re doing this, here are some other ridiculous things said by Ligma and his box-bearing associate:</p><div><ul><li>“It makes me worry about the future of our democracy... the future of celebrity conservatorship. I mean, when Britney [Spears] happened...”</li><li>“Michelle Obama wouldn’t have happened if Elon Musk owned Twitter. Obama in 2008 wouldn’t have happened without Elon Musk owning Twitter.”</li><li>“I even own a Tesla, man. I’m a big fan of clean energy, climate change, even free speech too.”</li></ul></div><div><p>And here’s a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjVEoD5WZWU&amp;t=9304s">of the exchange</a>:</p></div></div></div></div>
