    <h1>The invention of a new pasta shape (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>For the past three years, Dan Pashman of <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/">The Sporkful podcast</a> has been on something of a mission: to invent a new pasta shape. All of Pashman&#39;s hard work has paid off with the debut of cascatelli pasta, <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">available for sale from Sfoglini</a>.</p>

<p>Pashman and Sfoglini engineered the new shape to maximize the amount of sauce that sticks to it, make it easier to get your fork on it, and have it feel good when you bite into it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cascatelli is designed to maximize the three qualities by which Dan believes all pasta shapes should be judged:</p>

<p>Sauceability: How readily sauce adheres to the shape</p></blockquote>

<p>Pashman documented the invention of cascatelli in a 5-part series on The Sporkful podcast — <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/mission-impastable-1-spaghetti-sucks/">you can listen to the first episode here</a> — and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYzOTA1ODY2NDgzOTY0?igshid=fvqxwa81z7nc&amp;story_media_id=2517176903157538890">on Instagram</a>. You can <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">order some cascatelli</a> to try it out at home, but it looks like they are currently sold out of everything aside from 5-lb bulk bags.</p>
