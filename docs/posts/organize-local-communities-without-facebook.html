    <h1>Ask HN: Organize local communities without Facebook?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I want to move our local communities off Facebook and onto our own platform. Is there a off-the-shelf solution or any collaborators I can join to move something along?</p><p>EDIT: I live in a more rural community (moved from a big city). We have 5-6 small (~50k people) towns, all well connected. Everything happens on Facebook. I would like to move to a different platforms. Plus points for self-hosted, federated.</p></div></div></div>
