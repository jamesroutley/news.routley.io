    <h1>M4 Mac mini&#39;s efficiency is incredible</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had to pause some of my work getting <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/680">a current-gen AMD graphics card running on the Pi 5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/52">testing a 192-core AmpereOne server</a> to quickly post on the M4&#39;s efficiency.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/m4-mac-mini-on-desk.jpg" alt="M4 Mac mini on desk"/></p>

<p>I expected M4 to be better than M1/M2 (I haven&#39;t personally tested M3), and I hoped it would at least match the previous total-system-power efficiency king, a tiny arm SBC with an RK3588 SoC... but I didn&#39;t expect it to jump forward <em>32%</em>. Efficiency gains on the Arm systems I test typically look like 2-5% year over year.</p>

<p>The M4 mini I just bought reaches <strong>6.74 Gflops/W</strong> on the HPL benchmark.</p>

<p>I can get 283 Gflops at 42W, versus 264 at 66W on my M1 Max Mac Studio (for a round 4.00 Gflops/W).</p>

<p>The chip isn&#39;t the <em>fastest</em> at everything, but it&#39;s certainly the most <em>efficient</em> CPU I&#39;ve ever tested. And that scales down to idle power, too—it hovers between 3-4W at idle—which is about the same as a <em>Raspberry Pi</em>.</p>

<p>This is total system power draw, too—not just the CPU.</p>

<p>And the system I bought includes 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 32 GB of RAM; most systems I&#39;ve used consume 4-6W just <em>running the 10 GbE controller</em>!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.myelectronics.nl/us/19-inch-125u-rack-mount-for-3x-mac-mini-2024.html">1.25U of rack space</a>, you could run three Mac minis, idling around 10W, giving almost a teraflop of CPU performance. (Not to mention there&#39;s a fast GPU/NPU, 10 GbE, and tons of high speed Thunderbolt IO in the back.)</p>

<p><em>If only they didn&#39;t put the power button on the bottom.</em></p>

<p>You can check out all my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/top500-benchmark">top500-benchmark results</a> on GitHub, and follow my progress <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/57">testing out the M4 mini here</a>.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t tested an M4 Pro Mac mini yet, so I&#39;m not sure if the efficiency is any better or worse.</p></div></div>
