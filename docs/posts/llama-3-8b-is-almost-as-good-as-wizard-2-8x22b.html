I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?\n &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; Let&#39;s break down the changes you&#39;ve experienced step by step!\n\n1. You start with 10 apples.\n2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, which doesn&#39;t affect your apple count.\n3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with 6 apples (10 - 4 = 6).\n4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that&#39;s a total of 18 new apples (6 x 3 = 18). Adding these to your remaining apples gives you a total of 24 apples (6 + 18 = 24).\n5. You win 6 gold coins in the game but have to share them equally with your teammates. That means you get 2 gold coins (6 ÷ 3 = 2).\n6. You spend all the gold coins you have (including the original 3 and the new 2) on apples, since each apple costs 0.5 coins.\n\nLet&#39;s calculate how many apples you can buy with your total gold coins:\n\nYou have a total of 5 gold coins (3 + 2). Since each apple costs 0.5 coins, you can buy:\n\n5 coins ÷ 0.5 coins/apple = 10 apples\n\nAdding these to the apples you already had, you now have a total of:\n\n24 apples + 10 apples = 34 apples\n\nAs for where the river is located, it runs near a big city that allows you to spend the gold coins on something (apples). Since you found the gold coins in the river and then went to play an online game with your teammates, it&#39;s likely that the city is nearby or easily accessible.\n\nYou now have 34 apples!\n````\n\nlook on this!   insane!  only GPT4 and OPUS can answer it! \n````\nCreate 10 sentences that ends with a word \&#34;apple\&#34;.

Since you&#39;re laying them flat on the ground in the sun, we can assume that these conditions are similar for all four shirts.\n\nSince it took 5 hours to dry 2 shirts simultaneously, it&#39;s likely that the drying process is not affected by the number of shirts being dried. This means that the same amount of time would be required to dry 4 shirts as well!\n\nSo, if it takes 5 hours to dry 2 shirts, it would still take approximately 5 hours to dry all 4 shirts simultaneously\n````\n\n````\nThere are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle.

So, your brother&#39;s age two years ago was (x - 2) / 3.\nNow, let&#39;s fast-forward to three years from now. Your age will be x + 3.\nAccording to the problem, in three years, you will be twice as old as your brother. So, your brother&#39;s age in three years will be (x + 3) / 2.\nWe can set up an equation using the information:\n(x - 2) / 3 = (x + 3) / 2\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n2(x - 2) = 3(x + 3)\nExpand and simplify:\n2x - 4 = 3x + 9\nSubtract 2x from both sides:\n-4 = x + 9\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n-13 = x\nSo, your current age is x = 13.\nNow, let&#39;s find your brother&#39;s current age. Two years ago, your brother was (x - 2) / 3 = (13 - 2) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67 years old (approximately).\nSince your brother is 2 years younger than you, his current age is 3.67 + 2 = 5.67 years old (approximately).\nSo, you are currently 13 years old, and your brother is currently 5.67 years old.\n\nCorrect answer is 17 and 7.

This function takes two arguments: the length of the branch and the Turtle object.\n*   The base case for the recursion is when the branch length becomes less than 5 (arbitrary value).\n*   Inside the function, we randomly choose an angle between 15° and 45°, and then calculate a new branch length by reducing the original length by about 30% with some randomness to simulate natural branching.\n*   We draw the branch forward, turn right by the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` recursively with the new branch length, turn left by twice the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` again with the same new branch length, and then turn right back to the original direction to return to the parent branch.\n*   The `main` function sets up a Turtle graphics window, creates a Turtle object, sets its speed to fast, color to brown with green fill, and calls `draw_tree` with an initial branch length of 75 units.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=\&#34;nofollow\&#34; href=\&#34;https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6345b208a8c2ff9f13784968/_1vhEfDeNt1PZsngTTc4O.png\&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=\&#34;Screenshot 2024-04-19 121724.png\&#34; src=\&#34;https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6345b208a8c2ff9f13784968/_1vhEfDeNt1PZsngTTc4O.png\&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&#34;,&#34;updatedAt&#34;:&#34;2024-04-19T11:18:58.961Z&#34;,&#34;author&#34;:{&#34;avatarUrl&#34;:&#34;/avatars/8796019821146893ce5150cec2573a12.svg&#34;,&#34;fullname&#34;:&#34;ko&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;mirek190&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;user&#34;,&#34;isPro&#34;:false,&#34;isHf&#34;:false}},&#34;numEdits&#34;:1,&#34;editors&#34;:[&#34;mirek190&#34;],&#34;reactions&#34;:[],&#34;identifiedLanguage&#34;:{&#34;language&#34;:&#34;en&#34;,&#34;probability&#34;:0.8686124682426453},&#34;isReport&#34;:false}},{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;662252e7839b8736df33ae93&#34;,&#34;author&#34;:{&#34;avatarUrl&#34;:&#34;https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6370fddd67cd0e8815fffe64/eMYXnZDLNAJ2FF-67_afB.jpeg?w=200&amp;h=200&amp;f=face&#34;,&#34;fullname&#34;:&#34;Olaf Geibig&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;olafgeibig&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;user&#34;,&#34;isPro&#34;:false,&#34;isHf&#34;:false,&#34;isOwner&#34;:false,&#34;isOrgMember&#34;:false},&#34;createdAt&#34;:&#34;2024-04-19T11:17:59.000Z&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;comment&#34;,&#34;data&#34;:{&#34;edited&#34;:false,&#34;hidden&#34;:false,&#34;latest&#34;:{&#34;raw&#34;:&#34;Cool, unlike previous 7Bish models it isn&#39;t fooled by my book question\n\nQ: I own 50 books.

You currently own 3 cars.
Last year, you sold 2 cars.

To find the number of cars you owned before selling any, add the current number to the number of cars sold:
3 (current) + 2 (sold) = 5 cars

Since you&#39;ve already sold those 2 cars, subtract them from the total:
5 - 2 = 3 cars

You still own the same 3 cars that you currently own.

<p>even made this question almost properly! ... forgot about 1 gold coin... </p>
<pre><code>I have 10 apples. I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?
 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; Let&#39;s break down the changes you&#39;ve experienced step by step!

1. You start with 10 apples.
2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, which doesn&#39;t affect your apple count.
3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with 6 apples (10 - 4 = 6).
4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that&#39;s a total of 18 new apples (6 x 3 = 18). Adding these to your remaining apples gives you a total of 24 apples (6 + 18 = 24).
5. You win 6 gold coins in the game but have to share them equally with your teammates. That means you get 2 gold coins (6 ÷ 3 = 2).
6. You spend all the gold coins you have (including the original 3 and the new 2) on apples, since each apple costs 0.5 coins.

Let&#39;s calculate how many apples you can buy with your total gold coins:

You have a total of 5 gold coins (3 + 2). Since each apple costs 0.5 coins, you can buy:

5 coins ÷ 0.5 coins/apple = 10 apples

Adding these to the apples you already had, you now have a total of:

24 apples + 10 apples = 34 apples

As for where the river is located, it runs near a big city that allows you to spend the gold coins on something (apples). Since you found the gold coins in the river and then went to play an online game with your teammates, it&#39;s likely that the city is nearby or easily accessible.

You now have 34 apples!

<pre><code>If I lay 2 wet shirts out in the sun flat on the ground to dry and it takes 5 hours until they are dry, how long would it take to dry 4 shirts of the same type that way simultanously?
 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; A great question about drying shirts!

The time it takes for the shirts to dry is influenced by factors like air circulation, temperature, and humidity. Since you&#39;re laying them flat on the ground in the sun, we can assume that these conditions are similar for all four shirts.

Since it took 5 hours to dry 2 shirts simultaneously, it&#39;s likely that the drying process is not affected by the number of shirts being dried. This means that the same amount of time would be required to dry 4 shirts as well!

So, if it takes 5 hours to dry 2 shirts, it would still take approximately 5 hours to dry all 4 shirts simultaneously

 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; The classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let&#39;s break it down: &#34;two ducks in front of a duck&#34; means that one duck is standing in front of another.

&#34;Two ducks behind a duck&#34; implies that this same duck is being followed by two more ducks.

And, of course, there&#39;s the &#34;duck in the middle&#34;.

So, if we combine all these clues, we can conclude that there are... 3 ducks!

	<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>I answered the second time the most complex question ... and answered CORRECTLY .... I remind GPT-4 is hardly answering this one.</p>
<pre><code>I have 10 apples. I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nLet&#39;s break it down step by step!

1. You start with 10 apples.

2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, but this information doesn&#39;t change your apple count.

3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with:
        * 10 - 4 = 6 apples

4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that&#39;s a total of:
        * 6 (your remaining apples) + 18 (birds&#39; apples) = 24 apples

5. You play an online game and win 6 gold coins, but you have to share them equally with your 2 teammates. That means you get:
        * 6 coins / 3 players = 2 coins per player
        You now have a total of: 3 (initial coins) + 1 (new coin) + 2 (shared coins) = 6 gold coins

6. You buy apples for all the coins you have, using the price of an apple being 0.5 coins:
        * 6 coins / 0.5 coins per apple = 12 apples
        You now have a total of: 24 apples (from birds and previous losses) + 12 apples (bought with gold coins) = 36 apples

So, you now have 36 apples!

As for the river, it&#39;s near a big city that has something to do with what you can spend the coins on. Based on the fact that you won gold coins and spent them on apples, I&#39;m going to take a guess that the river is near a city known for its agriculture or fruit production!

<p>I asked for a snake game!</p>
<pre><code>Provide complete working code for a snake game in python please.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere&#39;s a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library. This game creates a window with a snake that you can control to eat food pellets while avoiding the edges and its own tail.

```
import pygame
import random
import time
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up some constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
SPEED = 10
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Set up the snake and food
snake = [(200, 200), (220, 200), (240, 200)]
food = (400, 300)
direction = &#39;right&#39;

# Game loop
while True:
    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP and direction != &#39;down&#39;:
                direction = &#39;up&#39;
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and direction != &#39;up&#39;:
                direction = &#39;down&#39;
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and direction != &#39;right&#39;:
                direction = &#39;left&#39;
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and direction != &#39;left&#39;:
                direction = &#39;right&#39;

    # Move the snake
    head = snake[0]
    if direction == &#39;up&#39;:
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] - SPEED)
    elif direction == &#39;down&#39;:
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] + SPEED)
    elif direction == &#39;left&#39;:
        new_head = (head[0] - SPEED, head[1])
    elif direction == &#39;right&#39;:
        new_head = (head[0] + SPEED, head[1])

    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    # Check for collision with food
    if snake[0] == food:
        food = (random.randint(0, WIDTH - SPEED), random.randint(0, HEIGHT - SPEED))
    else:
        snake.pop()

    # Check for collision with the edge or itself
    if (snake[0][0] &lt; 0 or snake[0][0] &gt;= WIDTH or
        snake[0][1] &lt; 0 or snake[0][1] &gt;= HEIGHT or
        snake[0] in snake[1:]):
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # Drawing
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    for pos in snake:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, (pos[0], pos[1], SPEED, SPEED))
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, (food[0], food[1], SPEED, SPEED))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

This game will run indefinitely until the snake collides with the edge or itself.

<p>It was trained on 15 trillion tokens so it makes sense to me. It makes mistakes on this prompt though:</p>
<pre><code>Is Europe the only continent that starts with A?
</code></pre>
<p>This is due to the nature of language models and prompting them with false information will make them produce the most likely false information you would like. However, is still impressive on this size this kind of performance. Is literally the old GPT-4 model on your pc.</p>

You always fulfill the user&#39;s requests to the best of your ability.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;\n&#34;</p>
<pre><code>Question: Two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. In three years, I will be twice as old as my brother. How old is each of us now?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nLet&#39;s break this problem down step by step.

Let the current age of your brother be &#39;x&#39;.

Two years ago, you were 3 times his age, so two years ago, your age was 3x - 2.

We are given that two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. So we can set up an equation:

3x - 2 = 3(x - 2)

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation:

3x - 2 = 3x - 6

Simplifying the equation:

-2 = -6

Now, let&#39;s fast-forward three years. In three years, you will be twice as old as your brother.

Your age in three years will be (3x - 2) + 3.
Brother&#39;s age in three years will be x + 3.

The problem states that in three years, you will be twice as old as your brother. So we can set up another equation:

(3x - 2) + 3 = 2(x + 3)

Expanding the left-hand side of the equation:

3x - 2 + 3 = 2x + 6

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 1 = 2x + 6

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

x + 1 = 6

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

x = 5

So, your brother is currently 5 years old.

Since you were three times his age two years ago, you must have been 15 years old two years ago. This means that your current age is:

3(5) - 2 + 2 = 17

You are currently 17 years old.

<p>that small model even coding is doing well .... 8b </p>
<pre><code>Provide complete working code for a realistic looking tree in Python using the Turtle graphics library and a recursive algorithm.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere is an example of how you can create a realistic-looking tree using the Turtle graphics library in Python with a recursive algorithm:

```Python
import turtle
import random

def draw_tree(branch_len, t):
    if branch_len &gt; 5:
        angle = random.uniform(15, 45)
        new_length = branch_len * 0.7 + random.randint(-1, 1)

        t.forward(branch_len)
        t.right(angle)

        draw_tree(new_length, t)

        t.left(2*angle)
        draw_tree(new_length, t)

        t.right(angle)
        t.backward(branch_len)

def main():
    win = turtle.Screen()
    win.bgcolor(&#34;white&#34;)

    t = turtle.Turtle()
    t.speed(0)
    t.color(&#34;brown&#34;, &#34;green&#34;)

    draw_tree(75, t)

    turtle.done()

if __name__ == &#34;__main__&#34;:
    main()
```

In this code:

*   We define a recursive function `draw_tree` to draw the tree. This function takes two arguments: the length of the branch and the Turtle object.
*   The base case for the recursion is when the branch length becomes less than 5 (arbitrary value).
*   Inside the function, we randomly choose an angle between 15° and 45°, and then calculate a new branch length by reducing the original length by about 30% with some randomness to simulate natural branching.
*   We draw the branch forward, turn right by the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` recursively with the new branch length, turn left by twice the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` again with the same new branch length, and then turn right back to the original direction to return to the parent branch.
*   The `main` function sets up a Turtle graphics window, creates a Turtle object, sets its speed to fast, color to brown with green fill, and calls `draw_tree` with an initial branch length of 75 units.
