				<p>This site is dedicated to helping you start your own Internet Service Provider. Specifically this guide is about building a Wireless ISP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Internet_service_provider">WISP</a>).</p>
<p>This guide is focused on the very earliest stages of starting a WISP - determining feasibility up through connecting the first few customers. There are many challenges that will come up at 100, 1,000 or 10,000 customers that are not (yet) covered in this guide.</p>
