        <p>Last Monday’s <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> word was LIGHT. Lots of people had trouble with this one because their guesses led them to it from the back end, and they got caught up trying FIGHT/MIGHT/NIGHT/RIGHT/SIGHT. All of which are perfectly reasonable words, but there are so many of them.</p>

<p>I managed to get it in two, mainly because of a lucky first guess.</p>

<p><img width="60%" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2022/20220205-Wordle%20LIGHT.jpg" alt="Wordle LIGHT" title="Wordle LIGHT"/></p>

<p>Later that day, I started to think that LIGHT might have been the <em>only</em> possible solution, given Wordle’s grading of LATER. And I figured I could prove—or disprove—that by using <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/grep.html"><code>grep</code></a> and the list of five-letter Scrabble words I wrote about in <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2022/01/wordle-letters/">my earlier Wordle post</a>. Here’s how I built up my grep pattern, one slot at a time. I’m using <code>egrep</code> because I can never remember what needs to be escaped in “basic” regular expressions.<sup id="fnref:ack"><a href="#fn:ack" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Obviously, I start with L:</p>

<pre><code>egrep l
</code></pre>

<p>I figured the second letter had to be a vowel. Although LLAMA is a legitimate word, I refused to believe Wordle would be so evil as to have <em>two</em> repeated letters. And even if it were, the A had already been eliminated. So that set the second slot:</p>

<pre><code>egrep l[iouy]
</code></pre>

<p>The third slot couldn’t be a T or any of the eliminated letters:</p>

<pre><code>egrep l[iouy][^aert]
</code></pre>

<p>Now I was faced with the T being in either the fourth or fifth position. Instead of trying to come up with a complicated pattern that handled both cases, I decided to use two simple patterns: one with the T in the fourth spot and one with it in the fifth. With the T in fourth spot the full command was</p>

<pre><code>egrep l[iouy][^taer]t[^aers] scrabble5.txt
</code></pre>

<p>where you’ll notice that I didn’t allow S in the last spot. This is because, despite <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2022/01/wordle-letters/">what I said</a> about the prevalence of plurals in Scrabble words, a month of playing Wordle has led me to believe that plurals aren’t used. They’re allowed in guesses, of course, but I’ve never seen a plural solution.<sup id="fnref:source"><a href="#fn:source" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The output was</p>

<pre><code>linty
lofty
lusty
</code></pre>

<p>I doubt that Wordle would use LINTY, but LOFTY and LUSTY are pretty good words. So I’d already disproved my hypothesis about LIGHT. Continuing on with the pattern that had T in the final position,</p>

<pre><code>egrep l[iouy][^taer][^aer]t scrabble5.txt
</code></pre>

<p>the output was</p>

<pre><code>licht
licit
light
limit
</code></pre>

<p>LICHT is beyond the pale, and I had my doubts about Wordle using LICIT, but LIMIT is a perfectly good word. So that’s three or four words other than LIGHT that could have been the solution. I just wasn’t thinking straight when I convinced myself that my first guess had locked in LIGHT.</p>

<p>On Thursday I got my comeuppance, as I flailed around trying to get the letter in the fifth spot:</p>

<p><img width="60%" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2022/20220205-Wordle%20SHARD.jpg" alt="Wordle SHARD" title="Wordle SHARD"/></p>

<p>Lucky for me there aren’t as many SHAR_ words as there are _IGHT words.</p>

<p>By the way, I decided to check if LLAMA truly is the only five-letter word that starts with L and another consonant. Turns out I was wrong about that, too.</p>

<pre><code>egrep l[^aeiouy]... scrabble5.txt
</code></pre>

<p>gives</p>

<pre><code>llama
llano
lweis
</code></pre>

<p>Although I can’t believe <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/llano">LLANO</a> or <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/lwei">LWEIS</a> would ever be a solution. And not just because LWEIS is plural.</p>
