The intention was to build a lightweight “action transformer” that could help automate simple and repetitive tasks to the user by leveraging the power of LLMs.</p><p>From our official GitHub repo:</p><blockquote><p>Our project is a grounded action transformer that uses language models to decompose complex tasks into simple instructions. We were inspired by recent developments in action transformers and action generation, but noticed a lack of open-source options. We chose to use natural language as the medium for communicating tasks to the model. Our website is built using Node.js, Puppeteer, Express, and a vanilla frontend. We use GPT-3/OpenAI API for our prompts. We are proud of the ability for our product to work out of the box for a limited set of tasks and look forward to the potential for community-created tasks to expand the set of actions.</p></blockquote><video width="100%" controls="" autoplay="">

We then used Puppeteer to execute these instructions in the browser once these tasks were handled individually by GPT itself or custom-built adapters.</p><figure><img src="https://nikhilthota.com/article_images/browser-bot/browserbot-architecture.jpeg"/></figure></article></div>
