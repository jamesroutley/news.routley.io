Basically, it&#39;s what makes your device start up and run the way you&#39;re used to.</p> <p>Motorola has done the work to make sure your device has a fully optimized, certified and tested version of Android.</p> <p>Unlocking the bootloader will allow you to customize your device, but keep the following in mind:</p> <ul> <li> <b>Unlocking your bootloader is not for the faint of heart.</b> Unlocking your device and installing your own software might cause the device to stop working, disable important features and functionality, and even make the device unsafe to the point of causing you harm. Neither Motorola, nor your wireless carrier or retailer from whom you purchased the device, will be responsible for such damage, so please do not unlock or load any software unless you know what you are doing. </li> <li> <b>You have only yourself to blame.</b> Once you get the unlock code, your device is no longer covered by the Motorola warranty; in other words, please don&#39;t blame us if things go wrong, even if they appear unrelated to unlocking the bootloader. </li> <li> <b>The law still applies.</b> You still need to operate your device in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations prescribed by the FCC, and any other governmental agency for that matter. </li> <li> <b>And now a word from our lawyers.</b> Finally, in order to unlock your device, you need to agree to important <a href="https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/89425" target="new"> <u>legal terms</u> </a> , which can be found on the next page. Agreeing creates a binding legal agreement, so be sure to read them carefully. </li> </ul>  <h3>STILL INTERESTED IN UNLOCKING THE BOOTLOADER?</h3> <p> <b>First, confirm that your device can be unlocked</b> </p> <ul> <li>Currently, the Photon Q 4G LTE, DROID RAZR M(Developer Edition), DROID RAZR HD(Developer Edition CDMA-LTE), MOTOROLA RAZR HD (Rest of World -UMTS/LTE), MOTOROLA RAZR HD (Rogers Canada - UMTS/LTE) and MOTOROLA RAZR i are supported by the Bootloader Unlock site.</li> <li>For a complete list of supported devices, see <a href="https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/87215" target="new"> <u>What devices are supported by the Bootloader unlock program?</u> </a> </li> </ul> <h3>Review all the warnings and make sure you completely understand the implications</h3> <ul> <li>Once you get the unlock code, your device is no longer covered by the Motorola warranty; in other words, please don&#39;t blame us if things go wrong, even if they appear unrelated to unlocking the bootloader.</li> <li>Unlocking your device and installing your own software might cause the device to stop working, disable important features and functionality, and even make the device unsafe to the point of causing you harm. Neither Motorola, nor your wireless carrier or retailer from whom you purchased the device, will be responsible for such damage, so please do not unlock or load any software unless you know what you are doing.</li> <li>You still need to operate your device in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations prescribed by the FCC, and any other governmental agency for that matter.</li> <li>Your wireless carrier may prohibit unlocked devices from operating on their network.</li> <li>Finally, in order to unlock your device, you need to agree to important <a href="https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/89425" target="new"> <u>legal terms</u> </a> located on the next page. This creates a binding legal agreement, so be sure to read them carefully. </li> </ul> <h3>HOW UNLOCKING YOUR BOOTLOADER COULD IMPACT YOUR DEVICE</h3> <ul> <li>You will lose all media and content on your device and will need to reinstall all applications downloaded from Google Play.</li> <li>You will not be able to watch any movies you downloaded.</li> <li>Applications may not work anymore.</li> <li>You may lose encryption support.</li> <li>You may lose some key functions like telephone, radio, and audio playback.</li> <li>You could cause permanent/physical damage to your device.</li> <li>Unlocking your bootloader will not change your device subsidy lock status</li> </ul> <hr/> <p> <strong>If you don&#39;t understand any of the above risks or warnings, we suggest that you do not continue to unlock your device&#39;s bootloader.</strong> </p> <p>If, however, you are ready to accept all the implications of unlocking the bootloader, which includes completely voiding your device&#39;s warranty, continue on to receive a bootloader unlock code.</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> You will need to sign in to proceed. </p> </div> </div> </div>        </section>
