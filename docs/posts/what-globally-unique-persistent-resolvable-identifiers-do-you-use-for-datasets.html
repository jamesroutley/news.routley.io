<p>What globally unique, persistent, resolvable identifiers do you use for datasets?
I want to know about either (a) a challenge you‚Äôre facing, and what you‚Äôve tried; or (2) a choice you recently made, and how it‚Äôs going.</p>
<p>Context: For each question of the <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology">FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) Ontology</a>, I want to collect and discuss folks&#39; choices and challenges on my podcast, <a href="https://podcast.polyneme.xyz/">Machine-Centric Science</a>.</p>
<p>Please email me at <a href="mailto:podcast@polyneme.xyz">podcast@polyneme.xyz</a> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>an email <em>subject</em> of either (a) ‚ÄúFIP F1-D challenge‚Äù or (b) ‚ÄúFIP F1-D choice‚Äù,</li>
<li>(preferred) an email <em>attachment</em> of a one-minute-max audio recording so that you can asynchronously mini-guest on the podcast üôÇ,</li>
<li>an email <em>body</em> that at minimum says either (a) ‚Äú<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a>‚Äù or (b) ‚Äú<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a> ‚Ä¶‚Äù, where ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù is how you wish to be attributed (e.g. your name, your name and location, your name and affiliation, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also write out your challenge or choice in the email body, in which case I will read it
aloud. If you choose a CC0 license, I will by default keep you anonymous unless you give me attribution info.</p>
<p>Extra credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an <a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCiD)</a> for your attribution info. Obtaining one is free.</li>
<li>If applicable, give me an <a href="https://vocabs.ardc.edu.au/viewById/316#browse-tree">ANZSRC-2020-FoR code</a> (the browsable tree takes a second or two to load) for your typical field of research, whether two-digit (most broad), four-digit (narrower), or six-digit (narrowest in this scheme).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you really want to send me multiple choices and/or challenges, please send them as separate emails. Also, feel free to spread this message far and wide. Thanks!</p>
