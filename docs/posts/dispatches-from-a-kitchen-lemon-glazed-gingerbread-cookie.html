    <h1>Dispatches from a kitchen: Lemon Glazed Gingerbread Cookie</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --> <h2 id="recipe" data-svelte-h="svelte-y4b7g2"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#recipe"><span></span></a>Recipe</h2> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-16rmtq4"><li><a href="https://www.food.com/recipe/tartines-soft-glazed-gingerbread-491511" rel="nofollow">https://www.food.com/recipe/tartines-soft-glazed-gingerbread-491511</a></li></ul>    <p data-svelte-h="svelte-11kx6q3">In one of the comments on the recipe page, someone suggested using a lemon glaze instead of the confectioner sugar glaze they recommend in the recipes.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-97o3h">I browsed the web for a simple glaze recipe and I came across this lemony granulated sugar glaze recipe from this <a href="https://www.ehow.com/how_7646167_make-glaze-granulated-sugar.html" rel="nofollow">eHow page</a>. I looked at a bunch the general consensus with the glaze is that it is 2-to-1 ratio of sugar to liquid. Instead of just using water, which most plain glaze recipes suggest, I subbed in lemon juice like this one suggested.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vh4d3p">I ran out of granulated sugar lol, so I used some brown sugar as a substitute. For the glaze for 2 dozen cookies, I used a 8 tablespoons of sugar (4 granulated and 4 brown) and 4 tablespoons of lemon juice. You really only need one lemon for this. I thought I would need more so I cut two lemons but it yielded 12 tablespoons lol ðŸ˜…
I zested one whole lemon and added it. I tend to like a lemony taste and since this glaze is sweet, I mean it really is just sugar for peteâ€™s sake, I added it all.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-2jdr3w">I liked the smell of making the glaze and it went on pretty easily. I used a rubber spatula to apply it to the cookies.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5rghsq">So I just tested one and I am not sure how I feel about the recipe. One, this is different more like bread than cookie. I shouldâ€™ve known that from the amount of flour being used. I do like the spices. I feel like since it is more bready that it really needs the glaze to make it more cookie-like.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-766unr">I will try them again once theyâ€™ve cooled down and the icing has solidified.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-w1lykn">I also think I made them a bit too thick.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div> </article></div>
