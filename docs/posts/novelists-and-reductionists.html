    <h1>Novelists and Reductionists</h1>

<p>Some like to focus on the new. They like to invent theories.</p>
<p>Some are adamant about reducing to what has come before. This has worked remarkably well for the core of physics.</p>
<p>These inclinations are not incompatible given some kind of “leveling”, with discipline about connections. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that.</p>
<p>Much of apparent “novelty” may be reducible to the structured annotation and (re-)configuration of core mechanism. Like how various organisms’ genetic inheritances have been modded over millennia.</p>
<p>Linked Data may be framed as a way to get novelists and reductionists to sit at the table of FAIR together.</p>
