    <h1>I found the perfect yearly calendar (for me)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The new year has started and I was once again looking for a simple calendar to do some yearly planning. I&#39;ve tried to find something for this use case for <a href="https://x.com/tehwey/status/1614201251356463106">a while now</a> and all the apps or templates I&#39;ve tried didn&#39;t have all the features I wanted:</p>
<ol>
<li>See every day of the year, with enough space to add something</li>
<li>Make it easy to mark &#34;ranges&#34; for periods where I might want to stay abroad or go on vacation</li>
<li>See important calendar events like birthdays</li>
<li>See public holidays / weekends</li>
</ol>
<p>A digital solution mostly compromised on visibility. In Apple Calendar it&#39;s not possible to see the full year, and still have some visibility into which events are happening on the individual days. You&#39;d only see that there&#39;s <em>something</em> happening.</p>
<p>Analog, paper based calendars or dedicated yearly planners didn&#39;t have my personal calendar events, unless I&#39;d manually transcribe all birthdays or other important events every year.</p>          </div><div>
            <p>A few days ago I finally found a way to do that through a small company from Norway called <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/company/">Time and Date</a>. They check all the boxes. The &#34;Multi Month&#34; calendar without their logo requires a small fee of 15$ / year for their <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/services/supporter.html">Supporter</a> plan.</p>
<p>After I configured everything I noticed one small but important missing feature. While they offer a way to add multiple lists of events (For example for yourself, and another one for a partner), they don&#39;t offer an ics (Calendar files, like you can export from Calendar.app) import. Without that you&#39;d need to enter all events one by one through their web interface.</p>
<p>After observing some requests on their website on doing some digging into their internal API I gave that task to Claude and within 15 minutes I had a working userscript that I could use with <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=safari&amp;locale=en">Tampermonkey</a> in Safari to quickly import all birthdays I&#39;ve exported from Calendar.app on my Mac with one click.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the script, it&#39;s all here and should work out of the box: <a href="https://github.com/dewey/userscript-timeanddate-ics-importer">https://github.com/dewey/userscript-timeanddate-ics-importer</a></p>
<p>I then generated the calendar with the settings I wanted and downloaded the PDF. A quick stop at my local copy shop where I printed it in A2 and I had a nice calendar to tape to my door.</p>
<p>During the year I&#39;ll add additional birthdays and events I forgot, and transcribe them into my digital calendar at the end of the year, to be imported again on the 2027 version.</p>          </div></div>
