    <h1>Praying Well</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>For a long time I have been interested in the intersection of spirit and technology.  Spirit and technology are not opposed to one another, we can have spiritual tech. I worked on an audible prayer wheel that created mantras when spun, I have worked on a prayer coin, a cryptocurrency project to rethink exchange and money.    But these days when I think of praying well – I think of language – another technology. </p>



<p>One of my herbalism teachers once said that she wanted to pray well. This intention has really stayed with me.  What does it mean to pray well! </p>



<p>I often think that the language of prayer is poetry. These days I think the language of prayer is clarity. I feel at a loss for words when I open my mouth to pray – like I have to remember that  language – the language of the birds, the plants  – or perhaps the language of the wind – the language of unseen forces. </p>



<p>My love talks a lot about unseen forces, our goal is to remove unseen forces from our relationship so that we can engage with eachother fully and with out veils or projections.  We use the language of psychoanalysis to talk about unseen forces in this way. </p>



<p>But there are other unseen forces, nonmaterial non local – like that discussed in the new telepathy tapes podcast: <a href="https://thetelepathytapes.com/">https://thetelepathytapes.com/</a>.</p>



<p>Prayer is one way to communicate with the unseen. </p>



<p>Prayer is related to position. How do I stand when I pray, how do I hold my arms, my legs.  In my yoga ego eradication pose postrue I sit crosslegged and hold my harms out so they make 60 degree angles. </p>



<p>One of my favorite prayers is to the directions. </p>



<p>Tonight it is the new moon and the lunar new year.  I am thinking about cycles and directions and language and the feeling for me of what it is like to be alive right now – amidst all sorts of events that could use prayer. </p>



<p>As I look outside right now it is black. It is the new moon. I wanted to write a prayer to honor the moon. But the moon is unseen unseen forces.</p>



<p>I honor the unseen world. </p>



<p>the invisible fields, radio waves, the solar flares, </p>



<p>the ocean currents, the hidden sun </p>



<p>eclipsed, the hidden moon, </p>



<p>the thoughts that dont become words, </p>



<p>the heartbeats that dont become songs, </p>



<p>the force that changes earth to fire wind to water </p>



<p>i honor my forgotten dreams </p>



<p>my distant memories </p>



<p>my ancestors </p>



<p>the footsteps of everyone who has stood where I stand</p>
