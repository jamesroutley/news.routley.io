<p>Watch</p>
<ul>
<li>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(TV_series)">3 Body Problem</a> and it was really thrilling. Excited for the next season. Great Science Fiction with a lot of unique ideas.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_House_(2024_film)">Roadhouse</a> remake was a fun and engaging romp and action film. People get punched and stuff blows up. Escalation ensues.</li>
<li>I also watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Ritchie%27s_The_Covenant">The Covenant</a>. It&#39;s mostly just a good military action movie, and beats you over the head with the theme &#34;don&#39;t abandon your coworkers.&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Listen</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121448/why-nintendo-sued-a-game-emulator-out-of-existence-and-what-might-happen-next">Why Nintendo sued a game emulator out of existence â€” and what might happen next</a> was an interesting deep dive on video game emulation and how it&#39;s affected by law.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/03/1197958583/japan-lost-decade">Japan&#39;s Lost Decade</a> by Planet Money was an interesting history of the economy of Japan in the last thirty years.</li>

<li>I enjoyed GQ&#39;s profile on <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/trent-reznor-atticus-ross-interview-2024">Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play</p>
<ul>
<li>I discovered <a href="https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/">Convert Wiki Tables to CSV</a>. I&#39;ve wanted a tool like this forever. Saved me a bunch of time this week.</li>
<li>I moved my Plex server to a new machine with higher processing power, which worked really well. Over the next week I&#39;ll be moving this website and other websites I run to the old machine! Lower cloud costs here I come.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you have a great week!</p>
