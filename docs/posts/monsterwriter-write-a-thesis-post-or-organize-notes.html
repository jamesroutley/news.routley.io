    <h1>Show HN: MonsterWriter â€“ Write a thesis, post, or organize notes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN,</p><p>in 2017 I started a project that would become MonsterWriter. First envisioned as a semi-structured wiki it became a writing application specialized for scientific content. It is a perfect tool if you write your thesis. While it is focused on technical content, you can still see the knowledge management spirit in it.</p><p>One or two years ago, my wife joined me in my efforts and redesigned the whole project and we recently released it as MonsterWriter2.</p><p>To celebrate this milestone we are giving away free lifetime licenses for the Desktop version (till Apr 28). Just use the promo code &#34;gu0ho4q&#34; for a 100% discount. You can find detailed instructions here:</p><p><a href="https://www.monsterwriter.app/promotion.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.monsterwriter.app/promotion.html</a></p><p>You can also find a short introduction video to the app on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR8i-EY_UBk" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR8i-EY_UBk</a></p><p>We are happy to receive any kind of feedback!</p></div></div></div>
