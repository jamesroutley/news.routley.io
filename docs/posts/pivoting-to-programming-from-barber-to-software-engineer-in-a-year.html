    <h1>Pivoting to Programming: From Barber to Software Engineer in a year</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div><div><div data-rce-version="9.3.6"><div dir="ltr" data-id="rich-content-viewer"><div><p id="viewer-77gnm"><span><span>Covid-19 forced me to end my 9-year-long cosmetology career when California&#39;s shelter-in-place took effect. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-adqmt"><span><span>Although I had a part-time marketing role at a small business, it was a massive loss of immediate income. Leaving the cosmetology world was also mentally and physically a tremendous challenge. It was a space that gave me comfort. After spending years, and hours behind the chair - I could give someone a straight razor shave without even thinking - it was second nature. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-1r2kt"><span><span> Like most people stuck at home during the pandemic, I tried to re-frame my fear of change and begin to think about what was next - which meant wrapping up my B.A. in Technical Communication and leaving cosmetology behind. I spent most of 2020 solidifying my knowledge (getting certified in project management, digital marketing, and technical writing) with the hopes that I would land my first corporate job in technical communication (before securing my degree). </span></span></p><p id="viewer-a7bcs"><span><span>After countless rejections from companies all over the Bay Area, I was offered another marketing role for a small Black-owned food start-up in Seattle. However, as much as I enjoyed what I was doing creatively, it didn&#39;t fulfill me, and I knew I needed a change professionally. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-ce1na"><span><span>Months later, I was offered a remote position at a digital media holdings company in Charlotte, NC (after randomly replying to a recruiter on LinkedIn, ha!). At that point in my interviewing journey, I was desperate to accept <em>any</em> opportunity at a larger organization, so I took the offer and started working as a campaign analyst. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-1v6dn"><span><span>It was nothing like I expected. My day-to-day consisted of launching advertising campaigns, dealing with salespeople and gaming clients, and being responsible directly for nearly 10k$ -100k$ of profit every day. I knew ad operations wasn&#39;t for me, but fortunately, I was at a company where I had hundreds of other internal opportunities, so I poked around. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-dqdc"><span><span>Initially, I found a job change program for employees that wanted to switch from their current career to a data-analyst path. I thought about it heavily, mainly because the one critique I received from recruiters during my rejection spree was that I had creative skills but needed more extensive analytical abilities. Yet when I thought about it, I didn&#39;t have any passion for analytics or marketing, and I wanted my next career to be something I could immerse myself in. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-501i3"><span><span>So I turned to the next program, the Internal Tech Academy, or ITA for short - which directed employees to self-teach themselves to code (using a pre-built curriculum) in the hopes of landing an internal entry-level software engineering job after eight months. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-bnv2k"><span><span>Engineering had always been that &#34;if only in another life&#34; career for me. During undergrad, I found a deep interest in Ethical AI, the impact of technology segregation in Black communities, and the sheer power of programming. While in digital marketing, web development was also a space that piqued my interest. At most, I thought I could become a technical writer or project manager and work closely with the software, but I never imagined the opportunity to become an engineer in less than a year - but <strong>I did</strong>. I completed the long, arduous, mentally-draining program and became a professional software engineer. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-dmpsf"><span><span>Now, what exactly happened in those eight months? That&#39;s a story for another post - this one here. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-76f2i"><span><span>Happy reading. :)</span></span></p><div id="viewer-2ov59"><p><img role="img" aria-label="gif" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/xUA7b30ZcgPDlxmxLq/giphy.gif?cid=e2a3cbdedin2kqywufboxfncntcfcdg3fcv78i3xuixgedyo&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="gif"/></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>
