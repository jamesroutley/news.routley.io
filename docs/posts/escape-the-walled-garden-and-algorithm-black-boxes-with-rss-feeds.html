    <h1>Escape the walled garden and algorithm black boxes with RSS feeds</h1>

Often, these algorithms are a black box where you don’t know why certain content is being promoted, let alone have full control over the content you consume. The incentives and needs of those controlling the algorithms are different from your own. Platforms may seek to politically influence you or sell you something you don’t need. Platforms may change hands, changing the influence they wish to have on their users. The good news is RSS and Atom offer a decentralized alternative.</p>
<p>Decentralization is becoming more popular as people are growing increasingly frustrated with centralized social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook and Reddit. Protocols such as ActivityPub and Bluesky’s AtProto give people more control over their data, identity, and content feeds. Allowing people to consume the content that they want to consume, in a way that works for them.</p>

<p>RSS and Atom are feed formats used to subscribe to content on the web.
They are decentralized by nature. A feed allows publishers to publish the content on their website for others to consume, using any client they wish to use. The producer of content doesn’t get to dictate how you consume it. Want to filter out content matching certain keywords? You can do that. Want to choose which content has priority over other content? You can do that. By using an open and decentralized standard, you can take back control over what content you consume and how you consume it.</p>
<h3 id="feed-readers">Feed readers</h3>
<p>To consume the content on an RSS or Atom feed, you need a client. There are many different options available. Web applications you can self-host like Miniflux and FreshRSS. And native clients like NetNewsWire for macOS and iOS and Feeder for Android. There are even command line clients like Newsboat for those who like to live in their terminal.</p>
<p>And while I would recommend, in the spirit of owning your data, self-hosting your own reader, FreshRSS has hosted instances you can use if you don’t know how to setup and host your own application.</p>
<h2 id="finding-feeds">Finding feeds</h2>
<p>Many websites will include an HTML tag linking to their feed.</p>
<p><code>&lt;link rel=&#34;alternate&#34; type=&#34;application/rss+xml&#34; href=&#34;/feeds/rss/all.xml&#34; /&gt;</code></p>
<p>You can find these by looking at the source code of a page. Some RSS/Atom clients can do this for you. Or you can use a tool like <a href="https://www.rsslookup.com/" target="_blank">RSS Lookup</a>.</p>
<h3 id="meetups-and-events">Meetups and events</h3>
<p>I like using RSS to stay up to date with meetups and events happening in my area.</p>
<p>Meetup.com doesn’t link to their feed, but there is an RSS feed you can find on the events page by adding <code>/rss</code> to the path. E.g. <code>https://www.meetup.com/MEETUP-NAME/events/rss</code>.</p>
<h3 id="youtube-and-peertube-channels">YouTube and PeerTube channels</h3>
<p>You can get notified of new videos without having a YouTube account or subscribing.</p>
<p>You can follow YouTube channels with this endpoint:</p>
<p><code>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID</code></p>
<p>And you can also subscribe to YouTube playlists:</p>
<p><code>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLAYLIST_ID</code></p>
<p>Peertube has a “Subscribe via RSS” option behind the subscribe button on channel pages.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Postcasts use RSS to distribute episodes. You can find links to a podcast’s feed on the podcast website or on directory sites like <a href="https://podcastindex.org/" target="_blank">podcastindex.org</a>.</p>
<h3 id="social-media-and-fediverse-accounts">Social media and Fediverse accounts</h3>
<p>You can follow Bluesky accounts with RSS. You can also subscribe to communities on Reddit or the Fediverse. Lemmy has a link to the feed for a community on the community overview page where you can even set the sorting of a feed, e.g. by sorting by active or controversial posts.</p>
<p>For Reddit, you can add <code>.rss</code> to the community name. E.g. <code>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted.rss</code></p>
<!-- Todo add my bluesky -->
<h3 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h3>
<p>If you want to subscribe to a newsletter without cluttering your inbox or without sharing your e-mail address, you can use
<a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com" target="_blank">Kill the Newsletter</a>. It allows you to create an email address you then use to sign up to newsletters with. It will turn the incoming e-mails into an RSS feed.</p>
<h3 id="blogs-and-website-posts">Blogs and website posts</h3>
<p>Many websites offer a feed with their latest posts. I have a page with the <a href="https://www.johnwalker.nl/feeds">feeds</a> on this website.</p>
<h3 id="websites-without-a-feed">Websites without a feed</h3>
<p>For websites without a feed, you can use <a href="https://politepol.com" target="_blank">PolitePol</a> to scrape the website and generate a feed. Or you can reach out to the owner of the website and ask them to implement a feed.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-new-content">Discovering new content</h2>
<p>One of the trade-offs of avoiding proprietary algorithms and going with a decentralized alternative is that it can be harder to discover content. I hope feed readers will get smarter and start including technology that will optimize and curate your feeds in a way that is beneficial to you. There are still a lot of opportunities for recommendation and personalization algorithms in this space.</p>
<p>I’ll share some ways I use to find new websites to subscribe to.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>If you know what kind of content you’re looking for, search is a great way to find it. <a href="https://marginalia-search.com/" target="_blank">Marginalia search</a> focuses on results that are non-commercial. And <a href="https://aboutideasnow.com/" target="_blank">aboutideasnow.com</a> crawls the <a href="https://www.johnwalker.nl/about">/about</a>, the <code>/ideas</code>, and the <code>/now</code> pages of over 3000 personal websites.</p>
<!-- Todo link to ideas page -->
<h3 id="curation-and-recommendation">Curation and recommendation</h3>
<p>Some people have a blogroll on their website curating the feeds that are interesting to them. You can follow communities that post stuff related to your interests. Or you can follow people on Mastodon or Bluesky.</p>
<p>Directories like <a href="https://1mb.club" target="_blank">1mb.club</a>, <a href="https://512kb.club" target="_blank">512kb.club</a>, and <a href="https://ooh.director" target="_blank">ooh.directory</a> are great ways to find new personal websites to subscribe to. And they all publish a feed with recently added sites.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Break free from walled gardens and opaque recommendation algorithms. Use RSS to have more control and be more intentional with your media consumption. If you publish content, make sure to also publish a feed so people can discover your content without relying on third parties. Let’s build decentralized systems together so we can break the cycle of enshittification on platforms we don’t own.</p>
