FREE!ship Plus in Lazarus is further development of the FREE!ship Plus (by <a href="http://www.hydronship.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.hydronship.net</a> ) 
Windows program with free source code FREE!ship v3.x under license GNU GPL. 
This FREE!ship Plus application is migrated into free open source Lazarus / Free Pascal environment 
to promote further development in various platforms and for various platforms (OS and architectures).

FREE!ship Plus is designed for the full parametric analysis of resistance and power prediction for 
a ship and other calculations of hydrodynamics of vessels and underwater vehicles. FREE!ship Plus 
allows the designer to simulate and analyze condition of balance of a complex completely hull - 
rudders - keels - engine - propellers in different regimes and of service conditions of a ship. 
The analyzable system includes a hull, appendages, a propeller and the engine (i.e. resistance, 
power, a thrust and a torque), and also various service conditions (heaving, a wind, a shallow-water 
effect, a regime of tow / pushing, etc...) refer to <a href="http://www.hydronship.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.hydronship.net</a> for full description.
