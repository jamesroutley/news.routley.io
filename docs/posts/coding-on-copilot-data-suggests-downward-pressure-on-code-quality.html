<p>Including 2024 projections for specific code reuse</p>
<p>
GitHub and other sources have reported more than 50% of developers
adopting AI Assisted-development during 2023. What these sources haven&#39;t reported is
how the composition of code changes when AI is used.
</p>
<p>
We examine 4 years worth of data, encompassing more than 150m changed lines of
code, to determine how AI Assistants influence the quality of code being written. We find a significant
uptick in churn code, and a concerning decrease in code reuse.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
2023 marked the coming out party for GitHub Copilot. In less than two
years&#39; time, the AI programming assistant shot from “prototype” to
“cornerstone,” used by millions of developers across hundreds of
thousands of businesses. Its unprecedented growth defines a new era
in “how code gets written.”
</p>
<p>
GitHub has published several insightful pieces of research on the growth and impact
of AI on software development. Among their findings is that developers
write code “55% faster” when using Copilot. This profusion of
LLM-generated code begs the question: how does the code quality and
maintainability compare to what would have been written by a human? Is
it more similar to the careful, refined contributions of a Senior Developer, or
more akin to the disjointed work of a short-term contractor?
</p>
<p>
To investigate, GitClear analyzed approximately 153 million changed lines of code,
authored between January 2020 and December 2023 [A1]. This is the
largest known database of highly structured code change data that has
been used to evaluate code quality differences [A2].
We find disconcerting trends for maintainability. Code churn -- the
percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after
being authored -- is projected to double in 2024 compared to its 2021,
pre-AI baseline. We further find that the percentage of &#34;added code&#34; and
&#34;copy/pasted code&#34; is increasing in proportion to “updated,” “deleted,” and
“moved” code. In this regard, code generated during 2023 more resembles an itinerant
contributor, prone to violate the DRY-ness of the repos visited.
</p>
<p>
We conclude with suggestions for managers seeking to maintain high code
quality in spite of the forces currently opposing it.
