            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown strong capability in reconstructing and rendering photorealistic
                3D scenes with high efficiency.
                However, extending 3DGS to synthesize large-scale or infinite terrains from a single captured
                exemplar—remains an open challenge.
                In this paper, we propose a tile-based framework that addresses this problem. Our method builds on Wang
                Tiles, where each tile encodes a local field of Gaussians with boundary constraints to ensure seamless
                transitions. This enables stochastic yet continuous tiling of Gaussian fields over arbitrary surfaces,
                allowing for procedural generation of expansive terrains with high spatial diversity. Furthermore, we
                introduce several rendering optimizations tailored to the unique characteristics of 3DGS Wang tiles,
                achieving real-time rendering of large-scale 3DGS terrains.

              <p>
                Given multi-view images of an exemplar scene, our goal is to construct Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles
                (GSWT) that can be tiled on arbitrary surfaces and rendered in real time with our novel GSWT
                renderer.
                An overview of the entire pipeline is illustrated below. We begin by
                reconstructing the 3DGS exemplar at multiple LODs. For each level, we generate a set of Wang Tiles by
                sampling the edge and center patches and applying a semantic-aware graph cut algorithm. Prior to
                rendering, we pre-sort each tile for efficient sort-free splatting, and during runtime, we perform
                tiling on the fly, allowing efficient GSWT-based terrain synthesis and rendering.

                (LOD). </p>
