    <h1>Run it XOR use it, part two</h1>

If you read back through some of my posts from 2021, you might discover 
<a href="/w/2021/05/26/irc/">something</a>
which basically says "run an IRC network or get involved with the 
chatting on it, but try not to do both".  This was a reflection on 
my own youthful stupidity, and a plea to others to not make the same 
mistakes (as many of my posts tend to be).

Imagine my surprise when I got to thinking about some of the recent bits 
of the tech / politics / malignant narcissist news cycle of late, and 
realized that it could apply there too.
