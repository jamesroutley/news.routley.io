Feel free to suggest improvements by creating an issue or a pull request.</p></div></section><section id="browsers-work-with-urls" data-section-id="browsers-work-with-urls"><h2>Browsers work with URLs</h2><div><p>You can type literally anything in the address bar. But under the hood, browsers work with URLs:</p><ul><li>A random text like<!-- --> <span>pizza</span> will be transformed into a &#34;search&#34; URL like<!-- --> <span>https://google.com/search?q=pizza</span> <!-- -->(or<!-- --> <span>https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pizza</span> <!-- -->depending on your preferences).</li><li>A domain name like<!-- --> <span>example.com</span> will be normalized as a full URL:<!-- --> <span>https://example.com</span></li></ul><p>To see how this works in practice, type something in the address bar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or click the &#34;Go&#34; button):</p><div><div><p>Try “pizza” or “example.com”.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="turning-a-url-into-an-http-request" data-section-id="turning-a-url-into-an-http-request"><h2>Turning a URL into an HTTP request</h2><div><p>Once we know the exact URL we want to visit, we can send a request to the server to fetch the resource and display it in the browser. Browsers communicate with servers using the HTTP protocol.</p><p>To see how a URL is translated into an HTTP request format, enter a full URL like https://example.com and press<!-- --> <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or click the &#34;Go&#34; button):</p><div><div><p>Enter a full URL like https://example.com.</p></div></div><p>HTTP requests have headers in the format like:</p><pre><code>Host: example.com
Accept: text/html
</code></pre><p>One of the headers is the host header. It is used to identify the server to which the request is sent:<!-- --> <span>example.com</span>.</p></div></section><section id="resolving-the-server-address" data-section-id="resolving-the-server-address"><h2>Resolving the server address</h2><div><p>Browsers can&#39;t send requests to names like<!-- --> <span>example.com</span>.</p><p>Computers talk to IP addresses, so the browser first asks the DNS system to resolve the domain name into an IP address before it can connect to the server and send the HTTP request.</p><p>Type a domain name in the input and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to resolve it into an IP address:</p></div></section><section id="establishing-the-tcp-connection" data-section-id="establishing-the-tcp-connection"><h2>Establishing the TCP connection</h2><div><p>After DNS gives the browser an IP address, it still needs a reliable connection to the server. TCP is the protocol that sets up this connection before any HTTP data is sent.</p><p>TCP establishes the connection using a three-step handshake that confirms both sides are ready to send and receive data.</p><div><div><div><div><p>1</p><!-- --><p>. </p><!-- --><p>SYN: Client sends its sequence number (seq=1000) to open a connection.</p></div><div><p>2</p><!-- --><p>. </p><!-- --><p>SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges the packet by adding its own sequence number (seq=5000) and acknowledging the client sequence number by incrementing it by 1 (ack=1001).</p></div><div><p>3</p><!-- --><p>. </p><!-- --><p>ACK: Client confirms the server number by incrementing it by 1 (ack=5001) and the connection is ready.</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Packets travel over the network</p></div></div></div></div></div><p>These numbers are how the client and the server keep track of the conversation. They count bytes, so both sides agree on where the data stream starts and what should come next. If some data doesn&#39;t arrive, the sender can see the gap and retransmit the missing bytes. This is how TCP keeps data ordered and reliable once the connection is established.</p><p>Start sending packets and try to disrupt the network to see what happens.</p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Packets travel over the network</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="http-request-and-response" data-section-id="http-request-and-response"><h2>HTTP requests and responses</h2><div><p>Once the TCP connection is established, the browser can send an HTTP request to the server.</p><p>Click the &#34;Go&#34; button to watch the HTTP request travel to the server and the HTTP response return to the browser:</p><div><div><div><p><span></span><span>Ready to send</span></p><p>Watch the packets move between the browser and the server.</p></div><div><div><div><p>Browser (Client)</p><div><p>Client Browser</p><p>User agent</p><div><p>Response</p><p>Waiting for response...</p></div><p>Waiting for the server.</p></div></div><div><p>Server</p><div><p>example.com</p><p>Port 80 - HTTP</p><div><p>Request</p><p>Waiting for request...</p></div><div><p>Response</p><p>Waiting to respond...</p></div><p>Listening for requests.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>When the HTTP response arrives, the browser reads the raw HTTP response and starts rendering the HTML content.</p></div></section><section id="parsing-html" data-section-id="parsing-html"><h2>Parsing HTML to build the DOM tree</h2><div><p>After the HTTP response arrives, the browser separates the headers from the body and feeds the HTML bytes into the parser. The parser turns tags like<!-- --> <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> into tokens and builds a <span>DOM</span> tree.</p><p>Click the &#34;Parse&#34; button to watch the HTML stream being parsed into the DOM tree:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>The HTML stream</span></p><pre><code><span>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span><span>&lt;html&gt;</span><span>  &lt;head&gt;</span><span>    &lt;title&gt;Example Domain&lt;/title&gt;</span><span>  &lt;/head&gt;</span><span>  &lt;body&gt;</span><span>    &lt;main&gt;</span><span>      &lt;h1 style=&#34;color: red;&#34;&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;</span><span>      &lt;p&gt;An example paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>      &lt;p&gt;

When a<!-- --> <span>&lt;script&gt;</span> tag appears, parsing may pause so the script can run.</p><p>The DOM tree then combines with CSS to produce the render tree that layout and paint use to draw pixels.</p></div></section><section id="dom-importance" data-section-id="dom-importance"><h2>On the importance of the DOM</h2><div><p>The <span>DOM</span> is the browser&#39;s in-memory model of the document. It is the shared contract between the HTML parser, CSS selector engine, and JavaScript runtime, so changes to it immediately affect layout, styling, and what users can interact with.</p><p>The DOM powers everything from query selection to dynamic styling and event handling. Try editing the script and watch how the DOM changes on the right.</p></div></section><section id="layout-paint-composite" data-section-id="layout-paint-composite"><h2>Layout, Paint, and Composite</h2><div><p>Once the DOM and CSS are ready, the browser runs the rendering pipeline: <span>Layout</span> (reflow) to calculate sizes and positions,<span>Paint</span> to fill pixels, then <span>Composite</span> to stitch layers together on the GPU.</p><p>Not every change reruns every stage. Changing colors usually repaints, while changing sizes forces layout and paint to recompute.</p><div><div><div><p>Click a change to see which stages rerun.</p><div><div><p>Layout</p><p>Reflow sizes + positions</p></div><div><p>Paint</p><p>Fill pixels into layers</p></div><div><p>Composite</p><p>Stitch layers on the GPU</p></div></div><p>Composite always blends layers into the final frame.</p></div></div></div><p>This is why layout-heavy pages feel slower: more work needs to happen before the next frame can be shown.</p></div></section><section id="summary" data-section-id="summary"><h2>Summary</h2><div><p>That is it!
