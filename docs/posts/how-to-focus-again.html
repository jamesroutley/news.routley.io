    <h1>Ask HN: How to Focus Again?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Forgive the throwaway but I&#39;m opening up for the first time about this...</p><p>I used to be able to set myself a task and focus on it until I finished. I could imagine a product and build an MVP in a weekend, flesh it out in a month and launch it. Now I can&#39;t focus on my tasks for more than a few minutes, I&#39;m constantly context switching, procrastination is killing all productivity even for tasks that I was looking forward to. Today I wanted to really knuckle down and make some real progress on my side project. I&#39;ve updated my iPad, fixed the leg on a tripod, cut the grass, cleaned the mower, scrubbed the driveway. Guess how much progress I made on the side project?</p><p>I talked to my GP - she said it could be undiagnosed ADHD, I filled in a quiz she gave me but she said it will take 2 years to get diagnosed(!) I can&#39;t wait that long.</p><p>How do I get back to how I used to be? Focused, driven, talented?  I feel like part of me has rotted away and I want it back!</p></div></div></div>
