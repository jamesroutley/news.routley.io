    <h1>Social engineering GoDaddy (2007)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div> <p>Back in 2007 my buddy [redacted] wanted to buy the domain name f*cktube.com as we were adult webmasters at the time. He was out of luck. A quick WHOIS search revealed that &#34;f*cktube.com&#34; had already been registered on GoDaddy. This was at a time when adult tube websites were getting big and independent website owners could still make untold sums of money — and he really wanted the domain.</p>

<p>He wanted to make the owner an offer but there was a problem. The owner&#39;s email address was hidden by GoDaddy&#39;s WHOIS protection. This.. simply wouldn&#39;t do.</p>
<p>We decided to hop on a call and 3way GoDaddy. He was to play the role of the baffled customer trying to retrieve only his email address so that he could reset his password — as he&#39;d forgotten what name, address and email address he&#39;d used when registering f*cktube.com.</p>
<p>I listened in for a few minutes of agonizing guff. They were getting nowhere. The support representative sounded like he wanted to help, but just couldn&#39;t because of QA restrictions. </p>
<p>Silent until that point — I decided to employ the trusty <a href="http://textfiles.com/uploads/line-interruption.txt" target="_blank">line interruption method</a>.</p>
<p>To begin, I sent 2 touch tones from my phone. *beep boop*</p>
<p>&#34;Hey Bob, how are ya? Do you mind if I place the caller on a brief hold?&#34;</p>
<p>I convinced the GoDaddy employee, &#34;Bob,&#34; that I was a supervisor and that I&#39;d monitored and interrupted his call with my accomplice to have a private conversation with him. I reassured him that I was monitoring the call and simultaneously doing research on the caller. I told Bob that he was clear to reveal the email address to the caller, and that I would now reconnect the call.</p>
<p>It worked. The GoDaddy employee spilled the email address of the domain owner to my accomplice.</p>

<p>If we wanted to be more malicious, I could have authorized the employee to update the email address and password on the account. We could have gone as far as stealing 2 and 3 character .com domain names all night, transferring them through a web of foreign registrars and ultimately selling them. I could have convinced the phone representatives to download trojans that gave us access to GoDaddy internal networks and ultimately tools. Hell, these days we&#39;d just sell the domains we stole on ogusers for Monero — but we&#39;re too old for that now, and we were too cautious even then.</p>
<p>[redacted] emailed the owner of f*cktube.com and lowballed him. The plan worked. He developed it into a thriving adult tube site and made a fortune. Social engineering paid off.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
