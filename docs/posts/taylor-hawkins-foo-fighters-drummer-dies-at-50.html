Jaffee and Nate Mendel of the Foo Fighters at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2021.</p><p>(Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)</p> </div>  </figure></div><p>A member of Foo Fighters since 1997, Hawkins joined the band after touring with Alanis Morissette for her hit album “Jagged Little Pill.” Unhappy with the Foo Fighters’ original touring drummer, leader Dave Grohl reached out to his friend Hawkins to get his opinion on a replacement. Grohl, who previously played drums with Nirvana, was surprised when Hawkins recommended himself.</p><p>“We knew we’d get along,” Hawkins told the OC Weekly not long after he joined, adding that “being in the Foo has changed my drumming style because I had to adapt.” He added, “I was a little nervous at first, but I got over that … No one can play better than Dave Grohl. He just has this vision in his head.” </p><p>Said Grohl of Hawkins in an interview with radio station KLOS-FM last year, “Our musical relationship — the foundation of that is our friendship, and that’s why when we jump up on stage and play, we’re so connected, because we’re like best friends.”</p><p>That chemistry was apparent. Though guitarist Pat Smear, bassist Nate Mendel, guitarist Chris Schiflett and keyboardist Rami Jaffee have been in the band for well over a decade, Hawkins was the best known Foo Fighter besides Grohl. Those who saw him drum understood why.</p><p>“I think in a rock band it’s important to have a drummer who is fun to watch,” Hawkins told Drum magazine in 2007. When he was a teen, he said, he was “more of a showboat than a good drummer,” adding that his philosophy at growing up was, “Play as fast and as busy as you can, all the time.”</p><div data-align-center="" data-click="enhancement"><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" data-lazy-load="true" data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e340d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/320x229!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/99d0732/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/568x407!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0f54f43/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/768x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d3327d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/840x602!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 840w" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-sizes="100vw"/>     <img alt="A man with long blond hair sings onstage" data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a1132a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/320x229!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea6a8ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/568x407!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/801812c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/768x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/379a884/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/840x602!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg 840w" data-sizes="100vw" width="840" height="602" data-src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/379a884/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7575x5431+0+0/resize/840x602!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F8a%2F820662734f9f8be508ecfd8780b9%2Fet-taylor-hawkins-06.jpg" data-lazy-load="true" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/>  </picture>   <div> <p>Taylor Hawkins performing in Redondo Beach in 2019.<br/></p><p>(Scott Dudelson / Getty Images)</p> </div>  </figure></div><p>Born Feb. 17, 1972 in Fort Worth, Texas, Oliver Taylor Hawkins moved with his parents and two siblings to Laguna Beach when he was in grade school, and attended Laguna Beach High School.</p><p>Opting to pursue drumming instead of 9-to-5 employment, he joined Sylvia, a Huntington Beach progressive metal trio who eventually signed to record label Roadrunner. By then, Hawkins had joined Morissette’s backing band. </p><p>Possessed with wrist-snap power that pushed snare drum heads to their limits, the drummer was known for his singular patterns, which flew off in odd directions after building enough repetitive energy to power the whole of whichever arena the band was playing. On the Foo Fighters 2005 hit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_L4Rixya64&amp;ab_channel=foofightersVEVO" target="_blank">The Best of You</a>,” he beats his snare drum as if his whole intention is to splinter his sticks, the drum head and his hands. </p><p>As the band moved from the post-grunge alt-rock scene and into the mainstream, Hawkins embraced the success while pursuing musical projects of his own. Founded in 2006, Taylor Hawkins &amp; the Coattail Riders featured members of Morissette’s touring band Sexual Chocolate and released three albums. Its most recent, “Get the Money” (2019), featured Grohl, Yes singer Jon Davison and Perry Ferrell of Jane’s Addiction.</p><p>In addition to music, Hawkins portrayed rocker Iggy Pop in the 2013 movie “CBGB” and himself in the Foo Fighters’ recently released horror film “Studio 666.” During shooting, Grohl playfully complained that his bandmate hadn’t even bothered to learn his lines. </p><p>“It’s not that I’m difficult, it’s that I’m lazy and I’m not much for book learning,” Hawkins replied.</p><p>During his tenure with the Foo Fighters, the band won 12 Grammy Awards. His final performance was during the Foo Fighters Lollapalooza Argentina headlining show on March 20. </p><p>Asked about his surfer-dude approach absorbed through his decades living on the Pacific Coast, Hawkins said that despite appearances, the beach wasn’t for him. Saying that he hadn’t surfed in a few years, he confessed, “I was never that great, anyway, because I was always in the garage, smoking cigarettes and playing drums.”</p><p>Hawkins is survived by his wife, Alison, and their three children: Oliver Shane, Annabelle and Everleigh.</p></div></div> </div></div>
