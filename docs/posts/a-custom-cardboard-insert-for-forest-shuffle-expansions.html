    <h1>A custom cardboard insert for Forest Shuffle &#43; expansions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>The latest board game obsession in my household is <a href="https://www.lookout-spiele.de/en/games/forrestshuffle.html">Forest Shuffle</a>. It’s an extremely cute game that’s just the <em>right</em> amount of competitive; if you like <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/">Wingspan</a>, you’ll probably like this (I think it’s easier to pick up, and less <a href="https://www.tabletopgaming.co.uk/features/what-is-engine-building-in-games/">engine-building</a>-y).</p><p>Since it first came out, the developers have released two expansion packs which make the game even better (and also, one of them is mountain-themed, and it makes my heart sing). There’s just one problem: the expansions don’t fit in the original box! There’s plenty of space in the box itself… but the cardboard insert on the inside doesn’t have enough room for the extra 72 cards from the expansion.</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/forest-shuffle-expansions-custom-insert/original_hu_8505ac1b87dc9874.jpg,

Here it is:</p><h2 id="heres-what-youll-need">Here’s what you’ll need</h2><ul><li>The <strong>pattern</strong> (above)</li><li>A <strong>piece of cardboard</strong> at least 35x35cm (note that this is <em>bigger</em> than A3, I am sorry)</li><li>A <strong>sharp knife and a cutting mat</strong>, and a hard edge to run the knife along (a <strong>30cm+ ruler</strong> would work great)</li><li>Glue, or another way to attach the printout to the cardboard</li><li>For best results, a bit of patience. I reckon it’d take about 45 minutes for assembly.</li></ul><p>You could probably save yourself a bunch of time if you had something that could print A2, especially onto cardboard. Or a laser cutter.</p><h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2><p><strong>One:</strong> Print the pattern. If you’re using the A4 version, you’ll need to stitch it together. There’s a 2cm overlap between the sheets – use the rulers at the top and bottom to check alignment and scaling. You’ll need to trim the inside edge on the sheets that go on top (a total of 4 edges, two horizontal, two vertical). You’re going to invest a lot of time and energy based on this pattern, so check your work after this step!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><figure><img srcset="/posts/forest-shuffle-expansions-custom-insert/stitched_hu_a49f1a8a2f1c3685.jpg,

My printer has a 5mm dead zone around the edge of the page, you can see the trimmings in the top right corner of the photo (and also that my knife wasn’t sharp enough and tore the page).</p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Three:</strong> Transfer the markings onto the cardboard. My favourite way to do this is by glueing the <em>outside edges</em> of the pattern to the cardboard. You have to work a little carefully after you’ve cut most of the lines (the pattern might slip?), but I found that it was manageable. Then, you can measure the few remaining fold lines and draw them on.</p><p>If you’re not feeling confident doing that, you can just glue the whole thing and peel it off again afterwards. It does leave some evidence <em>but</em> you can make that the back-side of the insert so you won’t be able to see it in the finished result:</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/forest-shuffle-expansions-custom-insert/bits_hu_4f5ad0f4bcde9aeb.jpg,

When folding, you’ll get crisper lines if you fold along the edge of a ruler. Note that the pattern doesn’t specify fold direction, but you can figure it out from the photos here :)</p><h2 id="i-designed-this-with-freecad">I designed this with FreeCad</h2><p>I made the initial prototype for this insert by hand, and then re-did it in <a href="https://www.freecad.org">FreeCad</a>’s sketch tool. FreeCad is mostly for 3D designs, but it was <em>super</em> fun for this – FreeCad is a parametric design tool, which means that I could specify a bunch of design parameters in a spreadsheet, like this:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/forest-shuffle-expansions-custom-insert/spreadsheet.png" alt="Good enough?"/><figcaption><p>Good enough?</p></figcaption></figure><p>…and then if you modify one of those values, it’ll update everything automatically (assuming you’ve designed it right and the changes aren’t <em>too</em> big). This turned out to be <em>great</em> for iterating: an early prototype was too wide and had finger-holes that were too narrow for my chunky fingers:</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/forest-shuffle-expansions-custom-insert/amendments_hu_646dae1a03529ff7.jpg,

It’s great except I forgot to add the long flaps, which add loads of structural stability first CAD prototype, also adds side-holes so that you can lift stacks of cards out easily. I accidentally added extra stability flaps to this one. what was supposed to be the final version, but I messed up sticking the sheets together and it’s a centimeter too wide 🥲 Final version. The green looked much better, but I used my last green cardboard on Iteration 5, and it’s Sunday so all the stores are closed. Tja.
