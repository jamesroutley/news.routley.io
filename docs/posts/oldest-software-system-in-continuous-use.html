    <h1>Oldest software system in continuous use</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="ltr">
<p>The oldest software system in use is hard to identify with absolute certainty, but it is likely either the SABRE Airline Reservation System (introduced in 1960), or the IRS Individual Master File and Business Master File (introduced in 1962â€“63). The uncertainty lies in the difficulty in proving continuity from the earliest versions of these programs to their present-day equivalents. The IRS system is slightly newer, but is also less likely to have been stripped of all its 1960s legacy code, making it perhaps the more probable candidate.</p></div></div>
