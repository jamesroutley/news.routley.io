    <h1>I got OpenAI o1 to play the boardgame Codenames and it&#39;s super good</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span></span>I got OpenAI o1 to play codenames and results were suprisingly good.</p><img alt="codenames" fetchpriority="high" width="600" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://suveenellawela.com/thoughts/codenames/cover.png"/><p>[o1 playing against o1]</p><p>Links:<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/SuveenE/codenames-ai" target="_blank">Github Repo</a><a href="https://codenames.suveenellawela.com" target="_blank">Main website</a></p><p>I got two teams of<!-- --> <a href="https://openai.com/o1/" target="_blank">OpenAI&#39;s o1 models</a> <!-- -->to play the boardgame,<!-- --> <a href="https://www.codenamesgame.com/" target="_blank">Codenames</a>, and they didn&#39;t disappoint.</p><p>Over 20 games were played with o1, with each clue giver and guesser carefully reasoning out the best possible clues and guesses. Their performance was consistently impressive.</p><p>Some of the interesting observations.</p><p>1. o1 is definietely more knowledgeable than the average human.</p><p>Winning at Codenames often comes down to how well the clue giver and guesser share a strong general knowledge. I remember a time when a friend gave the clue<!-- --> <span>&#34;Sputnik&#34;</span> to link the words <span>&#34;Russia&#34;</span> and<!-- --> <span>&#34;Satellite&#34;</span>. Unfortunately for him, none of the guessers had any idea what Sputnik was, and the clue fell flat.</p><p>In the games o1 played againse o1, in multiple times, I saw instances where o1&#39;s general knowledge came to help. Here&#39;s two such instances. Look at the reasonings!</p><p><img alt="codenames" fetchpriority="high" width="400" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://suveenellawela.com/thoughts/codenames/advanced.png"/><img alt="codenames" fetchpriority="high" width="400" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://suveenellawela.com/thoughts/codenames/advanced(2).png"/></p><p>2. It gave &#34;007&#34; as a clue.</p><p>Anyone familiar with the James Bond series knows that 007 is the code name for the famous secret agent. My challenge in this scenario was figuring out if this was a valid clue. I had not included the game rules in the prompt, so my first assumption was o1 did something that&#39;s against the rules.</p><p>I read through<!-- --> <a href="https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf" target="_blank">codenames official rules</a> <!-- -->to see if using <span>&#34;007&#34;</span> <!-- -->as a clue was allowed, and it turns out it is! To my surprise, I even came across a<!-- --> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/fzoobh/there_is_strife_in_my_household_is_007_a_valid/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> <!-- -->where people were discussing and justifying why this clue fits perfectly within the rules.</p><p><img alt="codenames" fetchpriority="high" width="400" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://suveenellawela.com/thoughts/codenames/007(2).png"/><img alt="codenames" fetchpriority="high" width="600" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://suveenellawela.com/thoughts/codenames/007.png"/></p><p>3. It connected MAIL, LAWYER, LINE and LOG with a single word.</p><p>OpenAI o1 nailed it by linking<!-- --> <span>&#34;Mail&#34;</span>,<!-- --> <span>&#34;Lawyer&#34;</span>,<!-- --> <span>&#34;Line&#34;</span>, and<!-- --> <span>&#34;Log&#34;</span> with just the clue <span>&#34;Paper&#34;</span>. Look at the reasonings!</p><p>It&#39;s impressive because even a regular player might not think to tie all these words together so seamlessly. After all, a clue is only successful if the guessers can connect all the words, and o1 guesser did perfectly.</p><p><img alt="codenames" fetchpriority="high" width="400" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://suveenellawela.com/thoughts/codenames/paper.png"/><img alt="codenames" fetchpriority="high" width="600" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://suveenellawela.com/thoughts/codenames/paper(2).png"/></p><p>You can get AI to play your own games at<!-- --> <a href="https://codenames.suveenellawela.com" target="_blank">codenames.suveenellawela.com</a></p></div></div>
