    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><nav></nav><p>Hello. This is <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com">Matthew Butterick</a>. I’m a writer, designer, pro­gram­mer, and law­yer.

Copi­lot is a plu­gin for <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Stu­dio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">other IDEs</a> that pro­duces what Microsoft calls <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart">“sug­ges­tions”</a> based on what you type into the edi­tor.</p><p>What makes Copi­lot dif­fer­ent from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense">tra­di­tional auto­com­plete</a>? Copi­lot is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/24/copilot-githubs-ai-powered-coding-tool-will-become-generally-available-this-summer/">pow­ered</a> by <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/">Codex</a>, an AI sys­tem cre­ated by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/codex-apps/">licensed</a> to Microsoft. (Though Microsoft <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-to-expect-from-openais-codex-api/">has also been called</a> “the unof­fi­cial owner of OpenAI”.) Copi­lot offers sug­ges­tions based on text prompts typed by the user. Copi­lot can be used for small sug­ges­tions—say, to the end of a line—but Microsoft has empha­sized Copi­lot’s abil­ity to sug­gest <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">larger blocks</a> of code, like the entire body of a func­tion. (I demon­strated Copi­lot in an ear­lier piece called <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/this-copilot-is-stupid-and-wants-to-kill-me.html">This copi­lot is stu­pid and wants to kill me</a>.)</p><p>But how was Codex, the under­ly­ing AI sys­tem, trained? Accord­ing to OpenAI, Codex <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5480054-understanding-codex-training-data-and-outputs">was trained</a> on “tens of mil­lions of pub­lic repos­i­to­ries” includ­ing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374">code on GitHub</a>. Microsoft itself <a href="https://github.blog/2021-06-30-github-copilot-research-recitation/">has vaguely described</a> the train­ing mate­r­ial as “bil­lions of lines of pub­lic code”. But Copi­lot researcher <a href="https://eaftan.github.io/about/">Eddie Aftandil­ian</a> con­firmed in a <a href="https://www.se-radio.net/2022/10/episode-533-eddie-aftandilian-on-github-copilot/">recent pod­cast</a> (@ 36:40) that Copi­lot is “train[ed] on pub­lic repos on GitHub”.</p><h2 id="whats-wrong-with-copilot" id="whats-wrong-with-copilot"><a href="#whats-wrong-with-copilot">What’s wrong with Copi­lot?</a></h2><p>What we know about Copi­lot raises legal ques­tions relat­ing to both the <strong>train­ing</strong> of the sys­tem and the <strong>use</strong> of the sys­tem.</p><h3 id="on-the-training-of-the-system"><a href="#on-the-training-of-the-system">On the train­ing of the sys­tem</a></h3><p><a href="https://opensource.org/osd">The vast major­ity</a> of open-source soft­ware pack­ages are released <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">under licenses</a> that grant users cer­tain rights and impose cer­tain oblig­a­tions (e.g., pre­serv­ing accu­rate attri­bu­tion of the source code). These licenses are made pos­si­ble legally by soft­ware authors assert­ing their copy­right in their code.</p><p>Thus, those who wish to use open-source soft­ware have a choice. They must either:</p><ol><li><p>com­ply with the oblig­a­tions imposed by the license, or</p></li><li><p>use the code sub­ject to a license excep­tion—e.g., <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/">fair use</a> under copy­right law.</p></li></ol><p>Microsoft and OpenAI <a href="#what-is-github-copilot">have con­ceded</a> that Copi­lot &amp; Codex are trained on open-source soft­ware in pub­lic repos on GitHub. So which choice did they make?</p><p>If Microsoft and OpenAI chose to use these repos sub­ject to their respec­tive open-source licenses, Microsoft and OpenAI would’ve needed to pub­lish a lot of attri­bu­tions, because this is a min­i­mal require­ment of <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">pretty much every</a> open-source license. Yet no attri­bu­tions are appar­ent.</p><p>There­fore, Microsoft and OpenAI must be rely­ing on a fair-use argu­ment. In fact we know this is so, because for­mer GitHub CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385">Nat Fried­man claimed</a> dur­ing the Copi­lot tech­ni­cal pre­view that “train­ing [machine-learn­ing] sys­tems on pub­lic data is fair use”.</p><p>Well—is it? The answer isn’t a mat­ter of opin­ion; it’s a mat­ter of law. Nat­u­rally, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexjc/status/1410524416660889607">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5480054-understanding-codex-training-data-and-outputs">OpenAI</a>, and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy/article/copyright-in-generative-deep-learning/C401539FDF79A6AC6CEE8C5256508B5E">other researchers</a> have been pro­mot­ing the fair-use argu­ment. Nat Fried­man <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27677177">fur­ther asserted</a> that there is “jurispru­dence” on fair use that is “broadly relied upon by the machine[-]learn­ing com­mu­nity”. But <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Soft­ware Free­dom Con­ser­vancy</a> dis­agreed, and pressed Microsoft for evi­dence to sup­port its posi­tion. <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/feb/03/github-copilot-copyleft-gpl/">Accord­ing to</a> SFC direc­tor Bradley Kuhn—</p><blockquote>[W]e inquired pri­vately with Fried­man and other Microsoft and GitHub rep­re­sen­ta­tives in June 2021, ask­ing for solid legal ref­er­ences for GitHub’s pub­lic legal posi­tions … <span>They pro­vided none.</span></blockquote><p>Why couldn’t Microsoft pro­duce any legal author­ity for its posi­tion? Because SFC is cor­rect: there isn’t any. Though some courts have con­sid­ered related issues, there is no US case squarely resolv­ing the fair-use ram­i­fi­ca­tions of AI train­ing.</p><p>Fur­ther­more, cases that turn on fair use bal­ance <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/">mul­ti­ple fac­tors</a>. Even if a court ulti­mately rules that cer­tain kinds of AI train­ing are fair use—which seems pos­si­ble—it may also rule out oth­ers. As of today, we have no idea where Copi­lot or Codex sits on that spec­trum. Nei­ther does Microsoft nor OpenAI.</p><h3 id="on-the-use-of-the-system"><a href="#on-the-use-of-the-system">On the use of the sys­tem</a></h3><p>We can’t yet say how fair use will end up being applied to AI train­ing. But we know that find­ing won’t affect Copi­lot users at all. Why? Because they’re just using Copi­lot to emit code. So what’s the copy­right and licens­ing sta­tus of that emit­ted code?</p><p>Here again we find Microsoft get­ting hand­wavy. In 2021, <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385">Nat Fried­man claimed</a> that Copi­lot’s “out­put belongs to the oper­a­tor, just like with a com­piler.” But this is a mis­chie­vous anal­ogy, because Copi­lot lays new traps for the unwary.</p><p>Microsoft char­ac­ter­izes the out­put of Copi­lot as a series of code <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features#github-copilot">“sug­ges­tions”</a>. Microsoft <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features#github-copilot">“does not claim any rights”</a> in these sug­ges­tions. But nei­ther does Microsoft make any guar­an­tees about the cor­rect­ness, secu­rity, or exten­u­at­ing intel­lec­tual-prop­erty entan­gle­ments of the code so pro­duced. Once you accept a Copi­lot sug­ges­tion, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot#using-github-copilot">all that becomes your prob­lem</a>:</p><p><em>“You are respon­si­ble for ensur­ing the secu­rity and qual­ity of your code. We rec­om­mend you take the same pre­cau­tions when using code gen­er­ated by GitHub Copi­lot that you would when using any code you didn’t write your­self. These pre­cau­tions include rig­or­ous test­ing, IP [(= intel­lec­tual prop­erty)] scan­ning, and track­ing for secu­rity vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.”</em></p><p>What entan­gle­ments might arise? Copi­lot users—<a href="https://twitter.com/stefankarpinski/status/1410971061181681674">here’s one exam­ple</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisGr93091552/status/1539731632931803137">and another</a>—have shown that Copi­lot can be induced to emit ver­ba­tim code from iden­ti­fi­able repos­i­to­ries. Just this week, Texas A&amp;M pro­fes­sor <a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html">Tim Davis</a> gave <a href="https://twitter.com/DocSparse/status/1581461734665367554?cxt=HHwWhMDRibPEvfIrAAAA">numer­ous exam­ples</a> of large chunks of his code being copied ver­ba­tim by Copi­lot, includ­ing when he prompted Copi­lot <a href="https://twitter.com/DocSparse/status/1581637250927906816">with the com­ment</a> <code>/* sparse matrix trans­pose in the style of Tim Davis */</code>.</p><p>Use of this code plainly cre­ates an oblig­a­tion to com­ply with its license. But as a side effect of Copi­lot’s design, infor­ma­tion about the code’s ori­gin—author, license, etc.—is stripped away. How can Copi­lot users com­ply with the license if they don’t even know it exists?</p><p>Copi­lot’s whizzy code-retrieval meth­ods are a smoke­screen intended to con­ceal a grubby truth: Copi­lot is merely a con­ve­nient alter­na­tive inter­face to a large cor­pus of open-source code. There­fore, Copi­lot users may incur licens­ing oblig­a­tions to the authors of the under­ly­ing code. Against that back­drop, <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385">Nat Fried­man’s claim</a> that Copi­lot oper­ates “just like … a com­piler” is rather dubi­ous—com­pil­ers change the form of code, but they don’t inject new intel­lec­tual-prop­erty entan­gle­ments. To be fair, Microsoft doesn’t really dis­pute this. They just <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot#using-github-copilot">bury it</a> in the fine print.</p><h2 id="what-does-copilot-mean-for-open-source-communities" id="what-does-copilot-mean-for-open-source-communities"><a href="#what-does-copilot-mean-for-open-source-communities">What does Copi­lot mean for open-source com­mu­ni­ties?</a></h2><p>By offer­ing Copi­lot as an alter­na­tive inter­face to a large body of open-source code, Microsoft is doing more than sev­er­ing the legal rela­tion­ship between open-source authors and users. Arguably, Microsoft is cre­at­ing a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">walled gar­den</a> that will inhibit pro­gram­mers from dis­cov­er­ing tra­di­tional open-source com­mu­ni­ties. Or at the very least, remove any incen­tive to do so. Over time, this process will starve these com­mu­ni­ties. User atten­tion and engage­ment will be shifted into the walled gar­den of Copi­lot and away from the open-source projects them­selves—away from their source repos, their issue track­ers, their mail­ing lists, their dis­cus­sion boards. This shift in energy will be a painful, per­ma­nent loss to open source.</p><p>Don’t take my word for it. Microsoft cloud-com­put­ing exec­u­tive Scott Guthrie <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/microsoft-github-relying-more-on-azure-cloud-services-scott-guthrie.html">recently admit­ted</a> that despite Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s rosy pledge at the time of the GitHub acqui­si­tion that <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/">“GitHub will remain an open plat­form”</a>, Microsoft has been nudg­ing more GitHub ser­vices—includ­ing Copi­lot—onto its <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> cloud plat­form.</p><p>Obvi­ously, open-source devel­op­ers—<a href="https://git.matthewbutterick.com/mbutterick/">me included</a>—don’t do it for the money, because no money changes hands. But we don’t do it for noth­ing, either. A big ben­e­fit of releas­ing open-source soft­ware is the peo­ple: the com­mu­nity of users, testers, and con­trib­u­tors that coa­lesces around our work. Our com­mu­ni­ties help us make our soft­ware bet­ter in ways we couldn’t on our own. This makes the work fun and col­lab­o­ra­tive in ways it wouldn’t be oth­er­wise.</p><p>Copi­lot intro­duces what we might call a more self­ish inter­face to open-source soft­ware: <strong>just give me what I want!</strong> With Copi­lot, open-source users never have to know who made their soft­ware. They never have to inter­act with a com­mu­nity. They never have to con­tribute.</p><p>Mean­while, we open-source authors have to watch as our work is stashed in a big code library in the sky called Copi­lot. The user feed­back &amp; con­tri­bu­tions we were get­ting? Soon, all gone. Like Neo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwhB5uCaj3Y">plugged into the Matrix</a>, or a cow on a farm, Copi­lot wants to con­vert us into noth­ing more than pro­duc­ers of a resource to be extracted. (Well, until we can be dis­posed of entirely.)</p><p>And for what? Even the cows get food &amp; shel­ter out of the deal. Copi­lot con­tributes noth­ing to our indi­vid­ual projects. And noth­ing to open source broadly.</p><p>The walled gar­den of Copi­lot is anti­thet­i­cal—and poi­so­nous—to open source. It’s there­fore also a betrayal of <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html">every­thing GitHub stood for</a> before being acquired by Microsoft. If you were born before 2005, you remem­ber that GitHub <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/">built its rep­u­ta­tion</a> on its good­ies for open-source devel­op­ers and <a href="https://github.com/open-source">fos­ter­ing that com­mu­nity</a>. Copi­lot, by con­trast, is the <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness">Mul­ti­verse-of-Mad­ness</a> inver­sion of this idea.</p><p>“Dude, it’s cool. I took <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/">SFC’s advice</a> and moved my code off GitHub.” <a href="https://git.matthewbutterick.com">So did I.</a> Guess what? It doesn’t mat­ter. By claim­ing that <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385">AI train­ing is fair use</a>, Microsoft is con­struct­ing a jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for train­ing on pub­lic code <em>any­where</em> on the inter­net, not just GitHub. If we take this idea to its nat­ural end­point, we can pre­dict that for end users, Copi­lot will become not just a sub­sti­tute for open-source code on GitHub, but open-source code every­where.</p><p>On the other hand, maybe you’re a fan of Copi­lot who thinks that AI is the future and I’m just yelling at clouds. First, the objec­tion here is not to AI-assisted cod­ing tools gen­er­ally, but to Microsoft’s spe­cific choices with Copi­lot. We can eas­ily imag­ine a ver­sion of Copi­lot that’s friend­lier to open-source devel­op­ers—for instance, where par­tic­i­pa­tion is vol­un­tary, or where coders are paid to con­tribute to the train­ing cor­pus. Despite its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-github-we-are-all-in-on-open-source.html">pro­fessed love</a> for open source, Microsoft chose none of these options. Sec­ond, if you find Copi­lot valu­able, it’s largely because of the qual­ity of the under­ly­ing open-source train­ing data. As Copi­lot sucks the life from open-source projects, the prox­i­mate effect will be to make Copi­lot ever worse—a spi­ral­ing ouroboros of <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/this-copilot-is-stupid-and-wants-to-kill-me.html">garbage code</a>.</p><p>When I <a href="https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/this-copilot-is-stupid-and-wants-to-kill-me.html">first wrote</a> about Copi­lot, I said “I’m not wor­ried about its effects on open source.” In the short term, I’m still not wor­ried. But as I reflected on my own jour­ney through open source—nearly 25 years—I real­ized that I was miss­ing the big­ger pic­ture. After all, open source isn’t a fixed group of peo­ple. It’s an ever-grow­ing, ever-chang­ing col­lec­tive intel­li­gence, con­tin­u­ally being renewed by fresh minds. We set new stan­dards and chal­lenges for each other, and thereby raise our expec­ta­tions for what we can accom­plish.</p><p>Amidst this grand alchemy, Copi­lot inter­lopes. Its goal is to arro­gate the energy of open-source to itself. We needn’t delve into Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ex-windows-chief-heres-why-microsoft-waged-war-on-open-source/">very check­ered his­tory</a> with open source to see Copi­lot for what it is: a par­a­site.</p><p>The legal­ity of Copi­lot must be tested before the dam­age to open source becomes irrepara­ble. That’s why I’m suit­ing up.</p><h2 id="help-us-investigate" id="help-us-investigate"><a href="#help-us-investigate">Help us inves­ti­gate.</a></h2><p>I’m cur­rently work­ing with the <a href="https://www.saverilawfirm.com/">Joseph Saveri Law Firm</a> to <a href="https://www.saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/github-copilot-intellectual-property-investigation">inves­ti­gate</a> a poten­tial law­suit against GitHub Copi­lot.
