    <h1>The letter ℘: name and origin? (2017)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>My own answer, about the name of the letter $\wp$. Mostly in <em>computing</em>, with little math. (Lengthy)</p>



<p>In computing, the letter $\wp$ has been plagued with a plethora of inappropriate names. I guess &#34;Weierstrass p&#34; is one of such  names that some standard created, and has been copied without much scrutiny. I suspect that ISO-8879 in 1986 was the root of all evil.</p>

<p>Names and references that survive in latest standards are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>\wp</code>: TeX</li>
<li><code>script capital p</code> (wrong) and <code>weierstrass elliptic function</code> (alias): Unicode</li>
<li><code>&amp;weierp;</code>: HTML (and XML?)</li>
</ul>



<p>Unicode is not directly related to my question, but it is important behind the scenes, so a good point to start.</p>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>In Unicode the letter $\wp$ is given the codepoint U+2118 in the block &#34;letterlike symbols&#34;, named &#34;script capital p&#34;. But in fact it&#39;s lowercase. There&#39;s also an official alias &#34;weierstrass elliptic function&#34;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn27/" rel="noreferrer">Unicode Technical Note #27</a> regrets this misnomer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should have been called <em>calligraphic small p</em> or <em>Weierstrass elliptic function symbol</em>, which is what it is used for. It is not a capital &#34;P&#34; at all. A formal alias correcting this to WEIERSTRASS ELLIPTIC FUNCTION has been defined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn27/tn27-1.html" rel="noreferrer">The first version</a> of Technical Note #27 in 2006 was a bit more emphatic</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should have been called <em>calligraphic small p</em> or <strong>perhaps even</strong> <em>Weierstrass elliptic function symbol</em>, which is what it is used for. It&#39;s not a capital &#34;P&#34; at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Boldification is done by me.)</p>

<h3>Unicode 1.0 (1991)</h3>

<p>Unicode 1.0 (1991) defined the letter, and the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/reconstructed/1.0.0/UnicodeData.txt" rel="noreferrer">name was</a> &#34;script p&#34;. It was also called &#34;weierstrass elliptic function&#34;. (See Footnote)</p>

<h3>Unicode 2 (1996) screwed it up</h3>

<p>They gave wrong names. <em>As seen later, this change matters for us.</em> From the file <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.0-Update/NamesList-1.txt" rel="noreferrer">Nameslist</a>:</p>

<pre><code>2118  SCRIPT CAPITAL P
      = per
      = power set
      = Weierstrass elliptic function
</code></pre>

<p>(All of them were legitimate names. See also the file <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.0-Update/Index-1.txt" rel="noreferrer">index</a>.) </p>

<p>Teminology note: The file &#34;NamesList&#34; maps from the codepoint (letter itself) to their names, the main one and aliases, if any. &#34;Index&#34; is the inverse mapping.</p>

<p>(Paranoiac detail: In Unicode 2.1, they changed its writing direction from &#34;Other neutral&#34; to &#34;Left-to-right&#34; See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.1-Update2/diff212v214.txt" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. For writing directionos see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.1-Update2/diff212v214.txt." rel="noreferrer">this</a>.</p>

<h3>Unicode 3.0 (1999)</h3>

<p>In 3.0, two wrong names &#34;per&#34; and &#34;power set&#34; can&#39;t be seen in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.0-Update/NamesList-3.0.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Nameslist</a>, but they still exist in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.0-Update/Index-3.0.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Index</a>. Wow. They still remained in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/" rel="noreferrer">3.2 Index</a></p>

<p>But not sure if this removal was officially announced</p>

<p>Unicode never changes the main names once they are given, so &#34;script capital p&#34; will stay for ever.</p>

<h3>Unicode 4.0 (2003)</h3>

<p>In Unicode <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/4.0-Update/" rel="noreferrer">4.0</a>, it seems the index file was abolished. So it&#39;s finally settled to be &#34;script capital p&#34; and &#34;weierstrass elliptic function&#34;.</p>

<h3>Unicode 6.1 (2012)</h3>

<p>Finally in Unicode <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/" rel="noreferrer">6.1</a>, the meaning of aliases were clarified. &#34;weierstrass elliptic function&#34; of U+2118 was <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.1.0/ucd/NameAliases.txt" rel="noreferrer">defined</a> to be &#34;correction&#34;.</p>



<p><em>Computer Modern Typeface</em> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CwdUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=weierstrass+isbn:0201134462&amp;dq=weierstrass+isbn:0201134462&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;" rel="noreferrer">(google books link)</a> by Don Knuth was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In p 26, there&#39;s a line <em>there are special symbols like Weierstrass&#39;s ‘p’ (℘)</em>. However, in the index in p 580, there&#39;s only the entry &#34;Weierstrass, Karl Theodor Wilhelm&#34;, pointing to pp 26, 233 and 235, and the entry &#34;Weierstrass&#39;p&#34; is not there. So I guess Knuth did <strong>not</strong> mean that &#34;Weierstrass&#39;p&#34; was the name of the symbol.</p>



<p>Section summary: &#34;Weierstrass p&#34; was introduced sometime, but not sure exactly when. It has becoming obsolete, but not completely yet.</p>

<p>In HTML, you can write $\wp$ by escaping as <code>&amp;weierp;</code>. Dunno other markup languages.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/toc.html" rel="noreferrer">MathML 1.01 specification</a> (1998), $\wp$ is given the name &#34;weierp&#34;, of which description is <strong>&#34;Weierstrass p&#34;</strong> and the alias &#34;wp&#34;. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chap6/ISOAMSOe1.html" rel="noreferrer">See here</a>. The letter derived from &#34;ISOamso&#34;, but I can&#39;t be sure if the name came from ISOamso, too. The status of the latest MathML, 3.0, will be stated at the end of this section.</p>

<p>ISOamso (&#34;Added Math Symbols: Ordinary&#34;, has nothing to do with AMS :)
is a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8879" rel="noreferrer">SGML = ISO 8879:1986</a> in 1986, according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/isoamso.ent" rel="noreferrer">this</a>.
When the first MathML was under construction, ISO 10646 (roughly speaking Unicode itself, but its counterpart in ISO) were apparently not there. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chapter6.html#sec6.2.2" rel="noreferrer">See this</a>. They had to gather letters from various standards.</p>

<p>HTML is worse: I couldn&#39;t find any entity specification about $\wp$ in HTML 1 - 3. (In very rough translation, entity = letter. See <a href="http://www.landofcode.com/html-tutorials/html-entities.php" rel="noreferrer">this intro</a>) In HTML4 (1999), it is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html#h-24.3" rel="noreferrer">defined as</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;!ENTITY weierp   CDATA &#34;&amp;#8472;&#34; -- script capital P = power set = Weierstrass p, U+2118 ISOamso --&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because HTML4 has been used so long (it&#39;s still in use), this wrong sepcification has spreaded widely. See below.</p>

<p>In HTML5 (2014), the word &#34;entity&#34; was abolished. &#34;Character entity references&#34; was change to &#34;Character references&#34;, and the term &#34;Named entities&#34; was replaced with &#34;Named character references&#34;. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-pubnotes/" rel="noreferrer">See this</a>. &#34;Weierp&#34; seems to have lost peculiarity up to HTML4; it&#39;s simply U+2118, and that&#39;s all. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#character-references" rel="noreferrer">See this</a> (Work on HTML5 started back in 2004, but it took long time until final publication.)</p>

<p>There&#39;s also &#34;XML entity definitions&#34;. Although XML is rather old, the official  specification of entities seems to have had been lacking for long.
In its latest version <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/" rel="noreferrer">(2nd ed)</a> in 2014, $\wp$ is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/htmlmathml-f.ent" rel="noreferrer">nothing but &#34;weierp&#34;</a>. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/#sets" rel="noreferrer">chap 2</a>. ISOamso is now <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/#legacysets" rel="noreferrer">one of legacy entity sets</a>.  In its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xml-entity-names-20100401/" rel="noreferrer">first version</a> in 2010 however, it&#39;s classified as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xml-entity-names-20100401/isoamso.html" rel="noreferrer">ISOamso</a></p>

<p>Anyway in ISOamso pages (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/isoamso.html" rel="noreferrer">ver 2</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xml-entity-names-20100401/isoamso.html" rel="noreferrer">ver 1</a>) its description is &#34;/wp - Weierstrass p&#34;, with the alias &#34;wp&#34;. It seems the slash in &#34;/wp&#34; corresponds to LaTex <em>backslash</em>. (Cf. /hbar, /ell, /Re etc)</p>

<p>Unfortunately in MathML 3.0, (the latest, released in 2010) it still depends on XML&#39;s &#34;legacy&#34; entity sets, and it <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-MathML3-20101021/chapter7.html" rel="noreferrer">refers to</a> ISOamso. &#34;Weierstrass&#39;p&#34; is not yet dead.</p>



<p>The word &#34;Weierstrass p&#34; appears in e.g. <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=ja&amp;q=isbn%3A9780895886286+%22Weierstrass+p%22" rel="noreferrer">Encyclopedia Machintosh</a> (1990), <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIVVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22weierstrass+p%22+letter&amp;dq=%22weierstrass+p%22+letter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiexquyr7rVAhXI7hoKHbBWCH04HhDoAQglMAA" rel="noreferrer">MacUser magazine</a> (1992)</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22weierstrass%27s+p%22+-%22weierstrass%27s+p-function%22&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A1%2F1%2F1986&amp;tbm=" rel="noreferrer">googled for</a> <code>&#34;weierstrass&#39;s p&#34; - &#34;weierstrass&#39;s p function&#34;</code> limiting to pre-1986 instances. There had not been any to mean the symbol $\wp$. The result of dropping &#34;&#39;s&#34; is similar. Date limitation in Google search is not so reliable thus it does not prove anything.</p>

<p>Wrong HTML4&#39;s specification is now popular. Microsoft&#39;s document <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa212305(v=office.11).aspx" rel="noreferrer">HTML Character sets</a> reads &#34;Office 2003&#34;, although its exact date and scope are not clear. It says $\wp$ is: &#34;script capital P, =power set, =Weierstrass p, U2118 ISOamso&#34;. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=V4o9Tcf2YRoC&amp;pg=PA544&amp;dq=%22Script+capital+P,+power+set,+Weierstrass+p%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Script%20capital%20P%2C%20power%20set%2C%20Weierstrass%20p%22&amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer">XML in a Nutshell</a> (2002) and <a href="https://books.google.hu/books?id=vOZLwYJHymQC&amp;pg=PA760&amp;lpg=PA760&amp;dq=Weierstrass+p&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WtbhJZ9sV2&amp;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=weierstrass&amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer">Beginning HTML, XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a> (2011) say Weierp is &#34;Script capital P, power set, Weierstrass p&#34;</p>



<p>The books &#34;Encyclopedia Machintosh&#34;, &#34;MacUser magazine&#34;, &#34;Computer Modern Typeface&#34; and &#34;XML in a Nutshell&#34; were pointed out in Wikipedia Users <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Weierstrass_p#Cleanup" rel="noreferrer">Momotaro</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Man_in_Question" rel="noreferrer">The Man in Question</a>. I thank them.</p>



<p>In Unicode 1.0.0 (1991), it was <strong>NOT</strong> &#34;script capital p&#34;, the current name. In <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode1.0.0/Index1.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Unicode Name Index</a> (pdf), names  &#34;script p&#34; and &#34;weierstrass elliptic function&#34;  are found. See pdf pages 22 and 27. This did not change in Unicode 1.0.1 (1992).</p>

<p>It seems that in Unicode 1.1 (1993) the name was changed to &#34;script <em>capital</em> p&#34; See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/1.1-Update/UnicodeData-1.1.5.txt" rel="noreferrer">UnicodeData-1.1.5</a></p>
