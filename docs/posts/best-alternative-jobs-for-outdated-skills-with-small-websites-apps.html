    <h1>Ask HN: Best alternative jobs for “outdated” skills with small websites/apps?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I am a software engineer who is self-taught, and after graduation I took local jobs for small web shops for dev work.<p>Here&#39;s a brief description of my timeline from beginning to present:</p><p>- 1.5 years contract-to-hire SWE (W2 never actually happened)</p><p>- 3 months full-time W2 work, followed by 6 months unemployed</p><p>- 10 years independent contract work (freelancing)</p><p>- 2.5 years of no work, and a lot of job searching</p><p>The last 5 years of independent contract work have been very sporadic. During this time I typically made under $10k every year. I don&#39;t really know how to &#34;put myself out there&#34; as a freelancer, and after 10 years of doing it, I just want to go back to W2 as a FT employee.</p><p>My tech job skills include, PHP, MySQL, vanilla JS and jQuery. I don&#39;t know testing, cloud, or CI/CD practices. Jobs involve building small scale websites- at first only WordPress and eCommerce sites but around year 5 become more much web app SaaS-focused.</p><p>I have spent a very long time without work because I don&#39;t really know how to fit myself into other places with such a skill set. I get interviews and then get rejected for not being good enough. But these are the skills I have the most experience in by far. I don&#39;t have any other job skills that come close. I don&#39;t have close friends and relatives who have a good pulse on the tech industry. I do have a Github portfolio- it&#39;s not very &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;trendy&#34; tech but just things I do them because I enjoy doing them.</p><p>What other good options do I have? It doesn&#39;t have to be highly relevant to work I&#39;ve done in the past. Anyone have any ideas of what I can or should do?</p><p>A side note: I&#39;ve been working remote since 2013 (may explain a lot about my how my career has went) and am pretty good with maintaining a schedule and discipline around WFH.</p></div></div>
