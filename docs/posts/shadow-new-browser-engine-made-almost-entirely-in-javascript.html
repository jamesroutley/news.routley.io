    <h1>Shadow: New browser engine made almost entirely in JavaScript</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>&lt;shadow&gt; is a new novel browser engine made almost entirely in JS</h3></div></div><section><p>So I started making a browser engine (for fun) a few days ago, it felt kind of inevitable so here we are. Here’s a short rundown. <a href="https://github.com/canadahonk/shadow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source code too!</a></p><h4 id="screenshot-of-ltshadowgts-welcome-page-running-inside-ltshadowgt-as-of-writing">Screenshot of <em><strong>&lt;shadow&gt;</strong></em>’s welcome page running inside <em><strong>&lt;shadow&gt;</strong></em> (as of writing)</h4><p><img src="https://github.com/CanadaHonk/shadow/assets/19228318/9431b624-94aa-4209-87c9-60d2478badf6" alt="Screenshot of shadow&amp;rsquo;s welcome page in shadow"/></p><h3 id="what">What?</h3><p>A browser(/web) engine essentially takes in a URL(/etc) and gives you it rendered into a window for you to view and interact with. <em><strong>&lt;shadow&gt;</strong></em> does this too, almost entirely from scratch, made in JS. It runs in your browser! Node backend soon™ too? The host browser(/etc) is only used for networking (<code>fetch</code>) and renderer backend (<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>).</p><h4 id="components-of-ltshadowgt">Components of <em><strong>&lt;shadow&gt;</strong></em></h4><p><img src="https://mermaid.ink/svg/pako:eNpVkT1vhDAMhv8KygxVaTuB1Kljp96axSLukQtJUByK0N399zogFJAyOI_f1x_yXXReoWjENcDYF98_rXRF0YH7A6peqs_eU0zEYZx9MNpdj5R6UH6uGEQ7jBAIwwlnV8LKW2YdUVZmH2c4vzbfBYwGWPwUszn_t4hRQKcwbOX2-KQ8wG2vBGcgmzahUXPSemdwOXKjkXDIjR9-jJV2j9vqvlEed42TTbp1Lu3MJS4DFq9lXdb83gqKwRtsAqr2LKnfy_pjT_MFllaUwvI8oBXf5J7UUsQeLUrRcKggGCmke7IOpugvi-tEE8OEpZhGBRG_NHAhK5pfGAif_zYlpas?bgColor=101418" alt="Component flowchart"/>
(red = external/not me)</p><h3 id="why-make-it">Why make it?</h3><p>It’s just for fun, no really. Learning too. It will probably never work with 90% of websites, and that’s okay. <del>Also it’s funny to see people react in many forms of “wtf?&#34;</del></p><h3 id="screenshot-of-serenityosorg-running-inside-ltshadowgt-left-vs-firefox-right">Screenshot of serenityos.org running inside <em><strong>&lt;shadow&gt;</strong></em> (left) vs Firefox (right)</h3><p>Pretty spot on! No list markers yet. Colors are different as UA/browser defined.</p><h3 id="name">Name</h3><p>As with all my recent projects, the name is because I thought it was kind of funny at the time. <em><strong>&lt;shadow&gt;</strong></em> is named after the defunct &lt;shadow&gt; element. I mostly stole this idea from Blink (was it intentional to name it after a dead HTML element at the time?). Also it sounds spooky and mysterious so that’s a bonus I guess? (It’s also stylized as <em><strong>&lt;shadow&gt;</strong></em> because of this.)</p><h3 id="it-supports-javascript">It supports JavaScript??!</h3><p>Yes, kind of. This is quite complicated (as you can probably imagine), so I’ll do it in a separate future dedicated post if you’re interested (DM/reply me on twitter).</p><h3 id="why-publish-it">Why publish it?</h3><p>Why not? If someone can learn something or just find what I make fun/interesting, that makes me happy :)</p><h3 id="but-making-a-new-browser-engine-is-impossible">But making a new browser engine is impossible!</h3><p><a href="https://ladybird.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No</a>. <a href="https://servo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It</a>. <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isn’t</a>! <em>(Also I don’t really care how possible/feasible something is.)</em></p></section></div>
