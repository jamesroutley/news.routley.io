<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--googleon: all-->
<p>In this text I will expand directly upon the generative art methods
introduced in <a href="https://inconvergent.net/2016/shepherding-random-numbers/">Shepherding Random
Numbers</a> and <a href="https://inconvergent.net/2016/shepherding-random-grids/">Shepherding Random
Grids</a>. Most notably I will be using <a href="https://inconvergent.net/2016/shepherding-random-grids/#introduction">random
walks</a>.</p>
<h2>Splines</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)">Splines</a>
is a mathematical concept used to draw smooth lines between points. There
is an extensive literature about splines, and there are multiple types.
The details aren&#39;t too important, unless you will be implementing this yourself,
but in this text we will consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">quadratic
Bézier</a> curves. That means that a curve is controlled by two end
points (●) and a mid point (๐).</p>
<p>You can think of it as a string which is connected to two points. Then
the midpoint is used to stretch (or bend) the string in a certain
direction. To get an idea you can have a look at the illustration below.
</p>
<p><em>This text relies on Javascript animations (Canvas). They should work
on most devices, but please let me know if you experience any
issues.</em></p>
<p><em>You can click or tap all animations to restart them.</em></p>

<div id="multiple-nodes">
<h2>Multiple Nodes</h2>
<p>We can then introduce more nodes. Below all the nodes used to control
the spline move independently around at random. (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7054272/how-to-draw-smooth-curve-through-n-points-using-javascript-html5-canvas">Here</a>
is a neat trick for drawing splines with multiple points in Javascript
Canvas.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div id="even-more-nodes">
<h2>Even More Nodes</h2>
<p>It is generally difficult to strike a nice balance between detail and
simplicity. Often you will get more chaotic behaviour when you increase the
level of detail. In this case the level of detail corresponds to the number
of nodes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div id="expose">
<h2>Expose</h2>
<p>By drawing transparent dots along the length of a spline we can get a
nice smoke-like effect. This is exactly the same method that was used <a href="https://inconvergent.net/2016/shepherding-random-grids/#strokes">previously</a> on
straight lines.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div id="varying-noise">
<h2>Varying Noise</h2>
<p>We can change the amount of noise applied to each node individually.
For instance we can increase the amount of noise—randomness—as
we get further to the right.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div id="lines">
<h2>Lines</h2>
<p>In addition to changing the amount of applied noise, we can change the
number of points in the spline. Different configurations result in
different results. Below we apply these parameters at random to a number of
different splines.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div id="circle">
<h2>Circle</h2>
<p>You can pretty much distribute these splines any way you like. Here are
multiple splines, with varying number of points, distributed evenly along
the circumference of a circle.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div id="circles">
<h2>Circles</h2>
<p>What can I say, I really like circles.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div id="end">
<h2>End</h2>
<p>You can make quite nice things if you scale this technique up a little.
One of the challenges of doing this in the browser is the that we are
limited by relatively low resolution, and low color depth. The latter
becomes important when gradually combining transparent strokes like we do
above. Solving this challenge is outside the scope of this brief
introduction.</p>
<p>Hopefully you enjoyed this guide, and you can see a few more images <a href="">here</a>
and <a href="">here</a>.
I&#39;ve also written about this method previously in my essay <a href="https://inconvergent.net/generative/">On Generative Algorithms</a> in the section
called <a href="https://inconvergent.net/generative/sand-spline/">Sand Spline</a>.</p>
