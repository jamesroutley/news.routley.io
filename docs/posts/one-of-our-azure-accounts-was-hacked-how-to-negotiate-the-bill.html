    <h1>Ask HN: One of our Azure accounts was hacked â€“ how to negotiate the bill?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Usually our monthly fee won&#39;t exceed 1,000 dollars.  We discovered last month&#39;s bill is almost 3,000, and for this month up till now it&#39;s already over 200,000.</p><p>We collected the evidences and filed police report.  The bill is paid through a distributor, anything we ask about the reduction of payment, the distributor just passes it on to Microsoft.  I feel if we don&#39;t find a way to talk to Microsoft, we will just end up paying the whole thing.</p><p>Many of you might think we screwed up, we pay up, but I think it&#39;s more like a stolen credit card situation, we can negotiate with the bank.  How do I go about this?</p></div></div></div>
