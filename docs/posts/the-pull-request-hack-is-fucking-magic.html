    <h1>The Pull Request Hack Is Fucking Magic</h1>

<p>I don&#39;t have time to keep up with all the daft Open Source projects I release. I wish my skill and my energy was as wide as my ambition.</p><p>Several years ago, I came across <a href="https://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack/">Felix Geisend√∂rfer&#39;s Pull Request Hack</a>. The premise is simple - if people are making decent Pull Requests to your project then you should give them commit access.</p><p>It sounds <em>mad</em>, I know. But it has worked really well in my case.  I launched <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2017/11/super-tiny-website-logos-in-svg/">Super Tiny Icons six years ago</a>. It was surprisingly popular and lots of people seemed to enjoy using them - and a few even contributed.</p><p>So I gave them Commit access. That means they are able to push directly to my codebase. They can also approve other people&#39;s Pull Requests.</p><p>Like I say, totally mad and irresponsible.</p><p>But people are, by and large, lovely.</p><p>Over the years, I&#39;ve added about 20 random people as collaborators. Some have been more active than others. A few have refused to take on the responsibility. But several are still there - saving me dozens of hours, and helping even more people contribute.</p><p>What&#39;s the worst that could happen?</p><p>OK. Lots of things. The Pull Request Hack probably isn&#39;t suitable if you&#39;re running big projects. And it is almost certainly a stupid idea if you write code which is actively used by multiple downstream projects. And if your stuff has even the slightest chance of compromising security then you&#39;re better off sticking to trusted members.</p><p>But if you&#39;re just farting around with some scrappy code and you want a quick way to build an ad-hoc team? I don&#39;t want to go full &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">Cathedral and Bazaar</a>&#34;, but it is pretty fucking magic.</p><p>And it gives me a modicum of hope that some of my work might continue after I&#39;m gone. Sorry, that&#39;s a bit morbid.</p><p>So a huge thank you to <a href="https://github.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons/">everyone who has contributed</a>.</p></div></article></div>
