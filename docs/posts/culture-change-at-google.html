    <h1>Culture Change at Google</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Disclaimer: this post is solely based on my lived experience of
working at Google for 18 years.  I don&#39;t actually know the reasoning
of the company&#39;s highest leaders, so all I can do is share my personal
hypotheses.</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to write this essay three times over the past couple of
months; it&#39;s tricky.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always trendy and click-baity to attack big targets, especially
when those targets are full of hubris like Silicon Valley tech
companies.  People love &#34;fall from grace&#34; stories.  But my goal isn&#39;t
to throw dirt; Google is still a great place to work -- far better
than most companies -- and still doing amazing things.  My goal here
is to call out a unique, beautiful thing that happened... put it out
into the universe, with the hope that it can come back again someday,
somewhere.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no doubt that the early days of Google were &#34;over the top&#34;.  I
deliberately <a href="https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2005-09-25-FirstWeekAtGoogle/">saved this
email</a>
for 18 years, waiting for the day I left the company, because I knew
it would be a fascinating time-capsule comparison.  But the email
mostly focuses on <em>superficial</em> differentiators, like free gourmet
food.  In truth, that&#39;s not why Googlers come to work.  I want to talk
about a deeper, more substantive aspect of the culture.</p>
<p>When Ian Hickson -- another old-timer -- left Google last fall, he
wrote a <a href="https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373">blog post</a> talking
about the shift in the types of decisions being made.  I generally
agree with him, but I won&#39;t repeat it all here -- I&#39;m going to talk
about a different shift.</p>
<p>The most incredible and unusual thing that struck me about Google&#39;s
early culture was the <strong>tendency to value employees above all else</strong>.
I had worked in other companies, and never seen anything like this
before.  This culture lasted for at least my first decade at the
company, perhaps longer.</p>
<p>Let me explain.  In a typical company, when priorities shift, you
&#34;downsize&#34; (or cancel) a project, and then use the money to add people
to a different, more important project.  The common way to do this is
fire people from the first project, then rehire a bunch of new people
in the second project.  It&#39;s easy, it&#39;s simple, it&#39;s expected.</p>
<p>Google, however, had a different approach: they had an absolutely
intense hiring process to find talented people who were also
<em>generalists</em> -- that is, were able to thrive in a whole number of
roles.  The interviews were grueling for both applicants and
interviewers, often taking months.  But in the end, Google was
convinced that it was worth the effort: they believed they had hired
the best, brightest, and most flexible.</p>
<p>And so, when priorities would change, Google <strong>did not fire people</strong>,
but rather <em>moved</em> them carefully between projects.  The unstated
cultural principle was: &#34;products come and go, but we worked <em>so hard</em>
to get our employees... so we should preserve them at all costs. They
are our most precious resource.&#34;  And so a tremendous amount of energy
was put into high-touch resettlement of each employee into new
projects.  They were generalists.  We knew they&#39;d thrive, and that
Google would continue to make use of their talent in new ways.</p>
<p>As I moved up into leadership over the years, I became ever more
involved in this process.  In the early days as an individual
contributor, I experienced re-orgs directly and got &#34;re-homed&#34; into
new projects.  As a leader, I got involved in <em>finding</em> new homes for
teams during re-orgs. Eventually I wrote an internal handbook for
other directors on how to gracefully execute these re-orgs.  One of my
fondest memories is getting a peer-bonus from an engineer whose own
team re-org I had personally instigated -- he was much happier working
on the new &#34;more important&#34; project!</p>
<p>But things change.  In my first month at Google, I remember a
co-worker whispering to me, &#34;the day Google revenue stops growing
without bound, is also the day all of this will change.&#34;  The change
was very gradual for a long time -- but then things accelerated during
the pandemic.  Revenue began to slow, and now, coming out of the
pandemic, we&#39;re seeing waves of layoffs.  Yes, we knew things would
change, but we didn&#39;t expect it would accelerate <em>this quickly</em>, in
the span of just a couple of years.  The academic founders are gone,
much of the C-suite is now former Wall Street execs; combine that with
revenue flattening toward a stable horizontal asymptote, and the
obvious, expected thing happens: the company suddenly moves from a
&#34;culture of infinite abundance&#34; to a standard &#34;culture of limited
resources.&#34;  It&#39;s a predictable regression toward becoming a &#39;normal&#39;
company.</p>
<p>So what does a culture of &#34;limited resources&#34; mean?  It means the
execs start thinking about financial efficiency like every other
company.  You begin by trimming the more superficial perks: less fancy
food, limiting travel budgets, no more swag, smaller and fewer
internal parties and events, no more onsite dry cleaning or daycare.
But again, these things weren&#39;t the reasons Googlers came to work.  No
big deal.</p>
<p>But then you begin to cut costs further by changing the ornate hiring
and promotion processes to become &#34;traditional&#34;.  Hiring changes from
a laborious global process (of checks and balances) to a localized one
within divisions that can tightly control their labor costs.
Meanwhile, internal promotion processes change from &#34;competing against
yourself&#34; to &#34;competing against your co-workers for limited
positions.&#34;  In the early days, titles were attached to <em>people</em>, but
now they&#39;re increasingly attached to <em>roles</em>, and the number of roles
(for any given title) can be limited to save cost.</p>
<p>Finally, it comes time to do large re-orgs of projects around new
urgent priorities (like AI, for example).  But gone is the high-touch
re-homing of employees. Instead, we see waves of impersonal layoffs,
followed by (modest) rehiring in the newer projects that matter.  In
other words: doing what a normal company does.</p>
<p>Is Google evil here?  Of course not.  As I mentioned in a prior post,
<a href="https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2024-01-10-GoogleExitLetter/">Google is not a
person</a>.
And -- whether or not one agrees with it -- its leaders are trying to
be fiscally responsible and efficient, just as all public companies
are pressured to do when resources become finite.</p>
<p>But, coming back to my first decade at Google, it was incredible to
see <strong>employees</strong> valued above everything else.  Perhaps this is a
privilege only possible in a culture of infinite abundance.  Or maybe
not?  Maybe it&#39;s possible in a limited-resource culture too, but only
if the company is small.  It leaves me wondering if the sheer size of
Google (170,000+ employees) simply makes high-touch re-orgs
intractable.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is this: we should all learn from early-Google&#39;s
example.  When employees feel truly valued (which is rare!), it
creates psychological safety, high morale, productivity, and
creativity.  Early employees would often encourage each other to &#34;fail
fast&#34; as a means to innovation, but that&#39;s no longer easy in an
environment where failure implies a layoff.  If you&#39;re someone
building a company, challenge yourself to value employees above all
else, then watch and be amazed at the ROI.</p>
