<p>Tribler is a Bittorrent-compatible alternative to Youtube.
It is designed to protect your privacy, build a web-of-trust, be attack-resilient, and
reward content creators directly.
We are building a micro-economy without banks, without advertisers,
and without any government.
Together <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/08/creating-a-computer-currency/" rel="nofollow">with Harvard University</a>, the Tribler team deployed one of the first
fully distributed ledgers in August 2007, see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6971904.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC News coverge</a> and a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12565-bandwidth-could-be-a-new-global-currency.html" rel="nofollow">New Scientist article</a>.
In coming years we will further expand our micro-economy based on <em>bandwidth tokens</em>.
We aim to become the key place where audiences find their torrents, creative talents
get discovered, and artists get financial rewards from their fans.
Tribler is the place where 100 percent of the money goes to artists and the people that run the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our mission: <em>re-inventing media and money</em>.</p>
<p>Over 2 million people have used Tribler over the years.
The Tribler project was started in 2005 at Delft University of Technology
and over 100+ developers contributed code to it.
We are continuously improving it and further expanding the scientific developers team.</p>
<p>Technical foundations of Tribler are the Bittorrent protocol,
an overlay for P2P communication across NAT/firewalls,
gradual building of trust in public keys with Bittorrent seeding,
and our token economy with incentives for Tor-like relaying and hidden seeding.
For 12 years we have been building a very robust self-organising Peer-to-Peer system.
Today Tribler is robust: &#34;the only way to take Tribler down is to take The Internet down&#34; (but a single software bug could end everything).</p>

<p>Social media today is obsessed with profit, filled with advertisements,
overflowing with falsehoods, and infested with fake news.
We&#39;re trying to fix these hard problems in a unique way: by building trust.
Our audacious ambition is a clean-slate re-creation of The Internet itself with
foundations of trust.
Craiglist and eBay showed us in 1995 that trustworthy trade was possible online.
Uber, Etsy, and AirBnB show that entire industries can be disrupted by
a single platform with a natural monopoly.</p>
<p>For the past 18 years we have build and deployed platforms to create trust.
Before Wikipedia and Youtube existed we studied the mechanisms behind trust and user-generated content on a small scale.
Several years before Wikipedia emerged we <a href="https://static.usenix.org/events/usenix2000/freenix/full_papers/pouwelse/pouwelse.pdf" rel="nofollow">deployed a music encyclopedia with unconstrained write access</a>, it never became popular because we focused too much on software, instead community growth.</p>
<p>Today we keep a narrow focus and continuously expand Tribler with trustworthy
decentralized technology. We launched sub-second keyword search for
Bittorrent swarms without any server back in 2010 (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXWMhreGiAU" rel="nofollow">our old Google Tech Talk</a> on this topic). One of our operational trust browsing prototypes:

Covers eight months of the BitTorrent/Suprnova.org file sharing ecosystem. In particular, we show measurement results of the popularity and the availability of BitTorrent, of its download performance, of the content lifetime, and of the structure of the community responsible for verifying uploaded content.</li>

<p>Tribler supports torrent search without websites, anonymous downloading, torrent streaming, channels of torrents, and sharing content for tokens. <a href="http://sigmm.org/records/records1201/featured03.html" rel="nofollow">Overview of Tribler (.html 5 pages)</a>.
All Tribler features are implemented in a completely distributed manner, not relying on any centralized component.
Still, Tribler manages to remain fully backwards compatible with BitTorrent. <a href="http://iptps06.cs.ucsb.edu/papers/Pouw-Tribler06.pdf" rel="nofollow">The 2006 overview of Tribler (.pdf 6 pages)</a> featuring taste groups, friends, friends-of-friends and faster downloads by donating bandwidth to friends (<a href="http://svn.tribler.org/bt2-design/coop-download/trunk/note.tex" rel="nofollow">protocol spec</a> of friend boosting).
Note that <a href="http://svn.tribler.org/bt2-design/proto-spec-unified/trunk/proto-spec-current.pdf" rel="nofollow">the 2006-2009 Tribler protocol specification (.pdf 47 pages)</a> is now mostly outdated, as we switched to our new synchronization protocol called Dispersy (see below).</p>
<p>Trust in social media content is essential for a sustainable ecosystem.
We introduced channels of Bittorrent swarms <a href="https://www.tribler.org/LivePlaylists/" rel="nofollow">in 2009</a> with the Tribler 4.x release.
Each user can vote on channels to increase their visibility and tell everybody the
channel owner is not a spammer and not spreading fake items.
The reputation of both the voters and channel owner are important.</p>
<p>Tribler protects your privacy by not storing anything on any server.
To protect your privacy even more, we have prototyped search algorithms
based on homomorphic cryptography.
We presented a <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/files/1649968/privacy_overlay.pdf">new algorithm system for privacy-respecting
scalable Gnutella-like search</a> in 2014.
Our approach to scalability is a similarity function in the encrypted domain (homomorphic), enabling semantic clustering with privacy.</p>
<p>Back in 2006 we introduced long-lived identities to separate trustworthy peers from
freeriders and spammers (<a href="https://www.tribler.org/PermID/" rel="nofollow">PermID</a>). To protect your
privacy further we also devised an alternative to onion routing which potentially
could have stronger security guarantees (correlation attack).

<p>We deployed one of the worlds first fully distributed ledgers in August of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6971904.stm" rel="nofollow">2007</a>.
For over a decade we meticulously measured, analysed, improved, and enhanced this live system.
Today it defines the state-of-the-art in blockchain research, but in the early days it barely functioned at all.
A total of five Ph.D. students of Delft contributed key parts and upgrades.</p>
<p>At launch we called our initiative &#34;<em>bandwidth-as-a-currency</em>&#34;. Today we have specific terminology for what we did: a token economy.
We are making Internet bandwidth a tradable commodity without any middleman or need for any centralised governance.
Our efforts span over a decade, making us the veterans in the field.
Our ledger provides an incentive for Bittorrent seeding and Tor-like relaying.
For numerous years the tit-for-tat algorithm provided the only incentive for contributions in Bittorrent.
No incentive for seeding existed, except when central servers kept track of your uploads and downloads.
We measured closed invite-only communities for numerous years and mathematically showed their rich-get-richer properties. For details see <a href="http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/2509/1/SRE-p2p11-final-version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fast download but eternal seeding: the reward and punishment of sharing ratio enforcement</a> and our measurement paper <a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/iptps10/tech/full_papers/Meulpolder.pdf" rel="nofollow">understanding bandwidth economics and ratio enforcement (.pdf 5 pages)</a>.
We measured 508,269 peers in 444 swarms within five BitTorrent communities, ranging from public to highly elite. We observe download performance, connectability, seeder/leecher ratios, seeding duration, and statistics regarding the resource supply.</p>
<p>We got inspiration for a novel blockchain design based on operating our own ledger and studying token economies.
Our current work is called Trustchain, a unique design from 2012 where all participants have their own personal blockchain and create their own genesis block.
Our older work used a graph-based approach and graph-based reputation algorithms.
Trustchain records transactions in a tamper-proof and scalable manner.
It does not require mining and does not try to solve the double spending problem.
Our primitive 2007 ledger pre-dates Bitcoin, additionally our 2012 DAG-based approach pre-dates IOTA and the Texas DAG patents.</p>
<p>We are fans of Bitcoin, but also showed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141218123940/http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/~victor/bitcoin.html" rel="nofollow">an early analysis</a> the flaws in this concept.
Our approach to digital signatures is the essential difference which sets us apart from others.
Mono-signatures form the foundation of all other projects we have seen in the past decade.
Meaning, in systems such as Bitcoin a transaction is already valid with a single signature.
Our Trustchain design does not permit transactions with merely a single signature.
Trustchain only supports multi-party agreement recording, others are not valid.
We believe that we created a more powerful system by removing single-signature transactions.
Only time can tell the usefullness of this academically-pure and minimal design.</p>
<p>The foundation of our approach is making repeated successful interactions between actors explicit and durable.
Cryptographically signed records of successful encounters serve as proof-of-work certificates.
The validity and value of these certificates is determined by a trust and reputation system.
Relaying for anonymity and seeding in Tribler constitutes work which is rewarded with a signed certificate.
Helping others and uploading in Bittorrent swarms is rewarded with bandwidth tokens (e.g. signed certificates).
Mining in our system becomes download parts of a swarm and uploading them to multiple interested parties.
In 2013 we got the credit mining part of our system operational in early Beta.
The screenshot below from November 2013 shows the boosting of various swarms.
Note the investment yields of &#34;struck gold&#34; and &#34;poor&#34; in the right column.</p>

<p>For our narrow focus of a Bittorrent client we are exploring the fundamentals of
identity, trust, and trade. With over 1 billion users of Youtube and Bittorrent we know there
is a mass audience ready for something better.</p>
<p>Our approach has very boring foundations, when compared to newer and more sexy work, like IPFS, FileCoin, or Storj.
We first measured Bittorrent in 2002, it is a flourishing mature ecosystem and ready for an upgrade.
Bootstrapping an ecosystem is hard, we designed and deployed a superior alternative to Bittorrent.
It became an official <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7574/" rel="nofollow">IETF Internet Standard</a>, but completely flopped.
This formed our preference for simplicity, elegance and our allergy for bloatware, clean-slate work, and over-engineering.
Numerous other projects try to create a generic approach using an ICO for funding and
promising the early adopters a dazzling return-on-investment.
Tribler is different. <em>rant warning</em>. We are non-profit academics.
We do not want to replace the old elite with a new crypto-currency elite.
What is changed if we replace backroom deals, lobbyists, middleman, and legal monopolies with the tools of the new elite:
algorithms, early investor rewards, proof-of-dominating-stake, and smart contracts?
Replacing the analog world and breading digital-native inequality does not make the world a better place.
We are creating a micro-economy based on fairness, trust, equality, and self-governance.
By design we banish rent-seeking. Critical infrastructure rarely makes profit. We are trying to build critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>As of December 2014 Tribler has a build-in version of a Tor-like anonymity system. This is completely disconnected from &#39;The&#39; Tor network. It is still ongoing work. It gives you probably superior protection than a VPN, but no protection against resourceful spying agencies.</p>
<p>We have implemented the <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/blob/v6.3.1/Tribler/community/tunnel/community.py#L271">main parts of the Tor wire protocol within Tribler</a>.
Instead of the TCP protocol that &#39;the&#39; Tor network uses, we use UDP.
The enables us to do NAT puncturing and traversal.
We have created our own network using this Tor variant, our code is not compatible with normal Tor.
Work started as a <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues/119">small trial</a> in December 2013 with anonymous Bittorrent downloading.
Essential part of our work is that everybody who downloads anonymously also becomes a relay.
This brings the Bittorrent tit-for-tat idea to darknets.
With this ongoing work we aim to offer in 2018 with Tribler V7.0 proxied downloading for any Bittorrent swarm.</p>

<p>The current foundation of Tribler is the Dispersy overlay. Dispersy functionality includes: making connections, sending messages, puncturing NAT boxes, and distributed database synchronization. Every 5 seconds Dispersy sends out a message to establish a new connection or re-connect to a known peer.
Note that <a href="https://github.com/qstokkink/py-ipv8">we are transitioning to a new overlay</a> for the durations of 2018.</p>
<p>Overlay communication, peer discovery and content discovery (keyword search) are essential building blocks of a peer-to-peer system. Tribler preserves the content and peers it discovered in the past. Every Tribler client runs a full SQL database engine. Several times per second each Tribler peer sends and receives updates for this database. Our protocol for distributed database synchronization is called Dispersy.
See a simple messaging client written with just a few lines of code as <a href="https://github.com/jarradh/DispersyExample">a simple tutorial example</a>; <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/dispersy/blob/devel/doc/tutorial-part1.org">outdated broken tutorial</a>.</p>

Key features of Dispersy are stateless synchronization using Bloomfilters, decentralized NAT traversal, and data bundle selection algorithms that allow the system to scale over 100,000 bundles in the presence of high churn and high-load scenario&#39;s.</p>
<p>Dispersy uses a simple database schema, with the <em>sync</em> table containing the data bundles to synchronise across peers in the <em>packet</em> field.

<p>The following work is ongoing. We have an <a href="https://github.com/AlexKolpa/AndroidStealth/issues?state=open">operational Android app</a> that can spread itself via NFC. The app can spread viral via friends, even if it is blocked from a central app store.</p>
<p>Original student assignment: <em>The aim is to create an Open Source Android smartphone app to help bypass restrictions by non-democratic governments.  The Arab Spring showed the importance of video recording of mass protests. However, possession of a video recording on your phone of human rights violations and mass uprisings brings grave danger. The idea is to make this app “check-point-proof”, meaning that a somewhat knowledgeable person will not detect the presence of the app and will not discover any video content. The app itself should be hidden, you can make a “stealth” app by somehow removing the app icon from your app list (sadly it simply still shows up in the uninstall app list). The app is activated simply by “dialing” a secret telephone number or other method your deem secure. Starting point for your work can be found here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5921071/how-to-create-a-stealth-like-android-app" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5921071/how-to-create-a-stealth-like-android-app</a>.
Your Stealth app need to be able to virally spread and be able to bypass an government restrictions on the official app store. Include the feature for NFC and direct-wifi transfer of the .apk with an easy on-screen manual and steps. Thus users can pass your app along to their friends.</em></p>

<p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks work on the presumption that all nodes in the network are connectable. However, NAT boxes and firewalls prevent connections to many nodes on the Internet.
We created a method to puncture NATs which does not require a server. Our method is therefore a simple no-server-needed alternative to the complex STUN, TURN and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245" rel="nofollow">ICE</a> approaches.
<a href="https://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/networking/networking2011-2/HalkesP11.pdf" rel="nofollow">We conducted one of the largest measurements of NAT/Firewall behavior and puncture efficiency in the wild</a>. Our method is a UDP hole-punching technique. We measured the success rate using volunteers running Tribler. Number of users in our trials are 907 and 1531 people. Our results show that UDP hole punching is an effective method to increase the connectability of peers on the Internet: approximately 64% of all peers are behind a NAT box or firewall. More than 80% of hole punching attempts between these peers succeed.</p>

<p>As Tribler scientists and engineer we are actively trying to make a better world.
Our micro-economy is our living lab for experimenting with alternative models for capitalism.
We aim to re-invent money by creating the first sustainable economy without
any moral hazards from bankers, politicians, and megacorporation.
Citizens and only the citizens are in control with self-governance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQiLaKdzD0E" rel="nofollow">Our grand vision in a 1+ hour lecture given at Stanford University, via their Youtube channel</a></strong>.
We want to do more then be a Youtube alternative.
Our grand vision is liberating both media and money.
See the talk <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/120530.html" rel="nofollow">Abstract</a> and <a href="http://www.tribler.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/P2P-Collective/EE380_Tribler_talk_Stanford__Pouwelse_Delft_University.pdf" rel="nofollow">slides (.pdf 78 pages)</a>. Keywords: transform money, “Bank-of-Bits”, global financial meltdown isolation. Use cooperation&amp;stability, not volatility&amp;greed.
Alter the essence of capitalism (rich get richer) by abolishing compound interest rate and facilitation of safe zero-cost money transfers &amp; lending.
We aim for a direct assault on the essence of capitalism, aiming even further then the Bitcoin accomplishment (bypassing the central bank).</p>
