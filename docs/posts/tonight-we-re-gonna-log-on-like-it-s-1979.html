Teletypes may have killed a lot of forests by emitting every line to hard copy instead of a screen, but there&#39;s something to be said for the permanence of paper, especially when people hang onto it for some reason. While getting duff units to build a functional <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/02/refurb-weekend-texas-instruments-silent.html">Silent 700 Model 765 ASR teletype</a>, which will of course be a future article, one of them was more interesting for what <em>else</em> it came with: a set of teletype transcripts of several users logging onto The Source, one of the earliest online services, and a complete photocopy of the service&#39;s user manual. So get out your copy of Pink Floyd&#39;s <i>The Wall</i>, start blasting &#34;In The Flesh,&#34; and let&#39;s head back to 1979 and 1980 when these transcripts were printed. We&#39;ll talk a little bit about the service generally and then log on exactly as these people did — because the Silent 700 transcripts indeed show exactly what transpired and how they used them.

The Source was notable as one of the first online services to be oriented to the general public — billed as an &#34;information utility&#34; — and anticipating later operations like Prodigy, Delphi and QuantumLink by years. (Although CompuServe as a company already existed by this time, the consumer service it became better known for wasn&#39;t established until 1979.) The original concept as founded in 1978 was to send E-mail over FM radio subcarriers, but the technology proved unreliable. Pivoting to telephony instead, the company forged a deal with time-sharing provider Dialcom to use their &#34;excess&#34; minicomputer time overnight and weekends for the same concept. Dialcom already provided business-oriented services such as word processing and customer relationship management, and in 1978 developed the world&#39;s first commercial E-mail service, which they later offered internationally and controlled virtually the entire market for a time outside the United States. Since the cost of procuring and maintaining the minicomputers was more or less constant regardless of their utilization, the new endeavour gave Dialcom an additional revenue stream while enabling The Source&#39;s parent company, by that time christened the Telecomputing Corporation of America (TCA), to offer substantially lower rates during those underused periods. (Off-peak and on-peak rates were ubiquitous among early services for similar reasons, most of which were also minicomputer-based at that time; my parents banned me from QuantumLink, then running on Stratus hardware, when they got the very first bill.)
</p><p>
TCA launched The Source at COMDEX in June 1979. The one-time $100 subscription fee deterred all but the determined, and even off peak it was $2.75 an hour billed to the minute rounded up (in 2022 dollars, that was $391 to start, and $10.75 a pop). Off-peak was defined as 6pm to 7am Eastern time, and all day on weekends and selected holidays. If you were foolish or desperate, or rich, I guess, enough to use it during business hours, that was $15 an hour (about $59 today).
</p><p>
Dialcom used Prime minicomputers, Prime being at one time the 6th largest vendor of such systems. The earliest Prime systems from 1972 were upwardly compatible with the 16-bit Honeywell Series-16 machines, which their developers had originally worked on at NASA, but were 32-bit. Because of this engineering-centric background early Primes were designed to run Fortran and their operating system PRIMOS (or, for a time, &#34;PR1MOS&#34;) in those days was mostly written in it. The transcripts here all give the system version as 2.x, so the Dialcom systems in use at the time were Prime 200 machines, which ran that particular version.
</p><p>
Dialcom&#39;s servers were located in the Washington, D.C. area, where many of their customers were also located (including a large number of U.S. Representatives); The Source was in nearby McLean, Virginia. Accessing Dialcom from D.C. was merely a matter of dialing a local number, connecting you directly to the server as a terminal. 

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEKcZJEeIKCPPPZGSqOeVYBlgXXFEZZhxsRtSCX7E7gCZPVDo0SoCLi2jHZuRW8BgYPjVThIA5oAwHU7ZuiGPK-Pgnygn92d5g1oV4g4CVNWpjFMssNFtRSmYJacyWbLKStB5MXk4Y9-nV8TOsq9RNmelo550ONmGk69UbhJG4j8Dc5H8Fh9QJ4Ult/s3308/localogon.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3308" data-original-width="2525" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEKcZJEeIKCPPPZGSqOeVYBlgXXFEZZhxsRtSCX7E7gCZPVDo0SoCLi2jHZuRW8BgYPjVThIA5oAwHU7ZuiGPK-Pgnygn92d5g1oV4g4CVNWpjFMssNFtRSmYJacyWbLKStB5MXk4Y9-nV8TOsq9RNmelo550ONmGk69UbhJG4j8Dc5H8Fh9QJ4Ult/s320/localogon.jpg"/></a></p><p>

The Source accounts were simply Dialcom accounts, like any other Dialcom client users&#39;, except they all started with the letters </p><tt>TCA</tt><p> (followed by some number of digits, in those days three). To avoid passwords being printed out on teletypes, the passwords were entered as control characters, i.e., with the CONTROL key held down, which didn&#39;t echo to the printer. Thus, at the </p><tt>PLEASE LOG IN</tt><p> prompt, a user might log in with </p><tt>ID TCA999 XXX</tt><p>, XXX actually being three CTRL-X characters. Helpfully the original operator of this system scribbled down all of the accounts they had along with their passwords and all of them were just three letters. Given that you had to have the hardware, the account number, a telephone line and a modem to even get this far, password security wasn&#39;t really a major consideration. The nearly universal usage of acoustic couplers for telecommunication limited the throughput to 300 baud; only later in the service&#39;s lifetime was 1200 baud service an option, and at extra cost.
</p><p>
In a like fashion, since the whole idea was low-cost (or at least low<em>er</em>-cost) access, TCA did not substantially customize the user environment and much of what The Source offered in terms of actual programs was simply what was already there. As they were Dialcom accounts like any other, they had command line access and a place to store files, charged by the &#34;storage block.&#34; In July 1979, the manual listed these commands as valid (by no means exhaustive):

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8GaRxca_Zdbo4Yot-XkxfXnE5M0pRfiIlyw3pYyWyPFhgzXyYqzBoCx-oGZYO1QhvgJPReGz8GmlnSbvQRuGSxL7bIxdggphzxA0UqgjbWuKxt83oz91QwKoi9jbRmKKkD9VMsTq9YmFp3ClTbv8oTAfeSY6KdOxXzM65Uhcg_Xr3sI4JWHBu-ez3/s3304/comm.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3304" data-original-width="2525" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8GaRxca_Zdbo4Yot-XkxfXnE5M0pRfiIlyw3pYyWyPFhgzXyYqzBoCx-oGZYO1QhvgJPReGz8GmlnSbvQRuGSxL7bIxdggphzxA0UqgjbWuKxt83oz91QwKoi9jbRmKKkD9VMsTq9YmFp3ClTbv8oTAfeSY6KdOxXzM65Uhcg_Xr3sI4JWHBu-ez3/s320/comm.jpg"/></a></p><p>

The E-mail facility was powered by Dialcom&#39;s pioneering E-mail service and made available to The Source subscribers, as was user-to-user chat. However, modern users might be surprised to see a BASIC interpreter on this list, plus a Fortran development environment complete with compiler and debugger (the </p><tt>RUN</tt><p> command ran a compiled Fortran program, demonstrating it was the first-class language on the machine), all part of PRIMOS. The manual warns that &#34;[u]sers writing BASIC programs requiring the use of virtual memory must apply for a special account number and will be charged $15 per hour regardless of the time of day.&#34; RPG II, COBOL and statistical packages were also available, making The Source appealing as a low-cost time-shared large computer &#34;for rent&#34; to a certain class of user. The Source even obliquely solicited users to write their own programs and would include particularly useful or high-quality ones in their public offerings under a revenue-sharing agreement.
</p><p>
The majority of subscribers, however, used it for E-mail, chat and bulletin boards, some games, various small applications (personal finance, education, math) and its extensive databases. This was where TCA put most of its effort. Besides allowing users to create their own small databases for calendars and contacts, including automatic E-mailed reminders, The Source offered an impressive amount of partner content including stock and bond prices, travel, reviews, headline news, classifieds and weather. Here were some of them from that time:

We&#39;ll see this in action momentarily.
</p><p>
If you didn&#39;t live in the D.C. region, or didn&#39;t want to run up the long-distance tab from hell, Dialcom systems could be accessed remotely through the Telenet (not Telnet) packet switched network. Telenet was the first such network, established in 1975. Like Dialcom they used Prime minicomputers to manage their network, and their system initially used them for switching as well, but the second generation in use by The Source&#39;s genesis had moved to smaller switches powered by our old friend the MOS 6502 CPU. Users dialed up a port on their local Telenet Access Concentrator (TAC) to make outbound connections, which fed into one of the switches and from there out to the larger network.
</p><p>
Telenet offered nationwide local access numbers for TACs in most of the then-existing area codes; this manual had four pages of them in the back. While Telenet had the capability to bill you directly for your usage, The Source&#39;s system was set up for &#34;collect calls,&#34; effectively rolling the Telenet charges into the $2.75 off-peak/$15 peak rate The Source charged you (in addition to your phone bill). This was a convenience to you for billing, but also to The Source as they didn&#39;t have to manage user logins on the Telenet network as well. Telenet had peak and off-peak rates just like everyone else. In those days it too was largely limited to 300 baud, though 1200 baud service was becoming increasingly available on many TAC ports.
</p><p>
While Telenet&#39;s routing could be much more complex, to an American customer it appeared divided more or less into familiar North American Numbering Plan telephone area codes, with end nodes hanging off these subnetworks. The Source&#39;s machine at Dialcom was on network 301 (this was the area code for Maryland at that time), node 24, so at the <tt>@</tt> prompt you told Telenet to connect like so:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzfLxsY91m7EOy2JZBzaj2WEOoJgo4FRvTATDeBSf9o4ZrPg_B4t-dFVdYh8EIzgzADqEet8yml-VXJICF9GYtGj5s1yfHq7gkQxpqWPgkFamFBn7o2H3H9kLJBZ9Ib9nj7mXF6rVz-wFAGsgoCyrDRQZUuVrEbczm2agZ9rRE6uXkJDpFkVaQsQT1/s3304/telenet.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3304" data-original-width="2529" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzfLxsY91m7EOy2JZBzaj2WEOoJgo4FRvTATDeBSf9o4ZrPg_B4t-dFVdYh8EIzgzADqEet8yml-VXJICF9GYtGj5s1yfHq7gkQxpqWPgkFamFBn7o2H3H9kLJBZ9Ib9nj7mXF6rVz-wFAGsgoCyrDRQZUuVrEbczm2agZ9rRE6uXkJDpFkVaQsQT1/s320/telenet.jpg"/></a></p><p>

The </p><tt>C 301 24</tt><p> command connected you to Dialcom as if you&#39;d locally dialed it (specifically Dialcom&#39;s system 10, where The Source lived). It was possible to use Telenet to connect to other systems, even by <a href="https://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/underground/hacking/telenet2.txt">trying random node numbers and seeing what you got</a>, as long as they also permitted collect connections. Many did, but for the others there weren&#39;t a lot of places you could go without a Telenet ID of your own. If you did have one, however, it was possible to even connect <a href="https://preterhuman.net/docs/The_Basics_of_TELENET">to other packet-switched networks</a> and hop internationally, all from a local telephone call.
</p><p>
Enough introduction: let&#39;s now see what a typical session looked like. These transcripts are all transcribed by hand (they&#39;d probably OCR very nicely, but they are long continuous strips of thermal paper without breaks, and my flatbed scanner doesn&#39;t like that very much). I have tried to duplicate the spacing exactly and type everything as shown, including any errors by the user or the remote system. That said, any <em>actual</em> mistakes you see are probably mine, and I apologize in advance, except for areas marked <tt>[sic]</tt> on text that seems odd or was obviously erroneous as written. I have preserved account numbers since they are meaningless today, and I have kept all of the service-generated database data, but I have elided or completely suppressed messages that appear to contain proprietary or private content.
</p><p>
I dithered over how to best represent these wide lines of preformatted text in the Blogger template. Images would be precisely formatted, but wouldn&#39;t flow well, and wouldn&#39;t be nice to people with screen readers. Eventually I simply decided to break them up into individual HTML <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt>s, some of which will horizontally scroll if they are too wide for the column. The nice thing is that the text is reproduced in a fashion you can search for or read, and it doesn&#39;t bunch up on the page.
</p><p>
For illustrative purposes I&#39;m going to start slightly out of order, with this transcript from September 27, 1979.</p><div><pre>TELENET

The TAC this user has dialed is in the 303 area code (at that time the state of Colorado), port <tt>8A</tt>. Telenet had varying support for many terminal types but most systems used <tt>D1</tt>, a generic dumb terminal. This is what you&#39;d want for a simple TTY, so the user just pressed RETURN, which apparently is interpreted as a generic dumb terminal too. The <tt>XY*X</tt> line doesn&#39;t look like an actual Telenet command and appears to be line noise either from a disconnect or something else. It is immediately followed by the TAC&#39;s banner again.

Dialcom&#39;s mail system supported aliases, which were heavily used by The Source&#39;s customer support (these accounts apparently all started with <tt>0</tt>). For example, The Source had a support mailbox called <tt>MAILBOX</tt> that mapped to <tt>TCA088</tt>. This message came from <tt>TCA010</tt>, or <tt>ORACLE</tt>, apparently in reply to a query this user had sent. Mail headers were strictly functional: source box, date, Dialcom system number (for The Source, always 10) and the number of lines in the reply.
</p><p>
To determine if you wanted to waste paper and time on a reply you already knew you didn&#39;t want to read (right now or ever), in <tt>READ</tt> mode the E-mail client immediately went into a pager before even displaying any part of the message. You pressed RETURN by itself (or typed <tt>YES</tt>) to read it, or <tt>QUIT</tt>. We&#39;ll say more about E-mail when this user reads their message at the end.

This first (second) article was stock quotes; <tt>AED=</tt> appears to be a timezone indicator. The Silent 700 (particularly in all-uppercase mode, as this unit appears to be set to) strictly uses ASCII 1963. However, UPI seems to use a few of these characters for other purposes which the teletype cannot display: <tt>_</tt> serves as an em-dash, and <tt>{ \</tt> probably represent fractions (if we go with the Viewdata extension to ISO 646, { would be ¼, \ would be ½ and } would be ¾).

BY ROBERT STRAND
   OAKLAND, CALIF. (UPI) _ STATE JUDGE PAUL N. HALVONIK AND HIS WIFE
WERE ARRAIGNED TODAY ON DRUG CHARGES, BUT HE DELAYED ENTERING A PLEA
UNTIL OCT. 2.
   HIS WIFE, DEBORAH, PLEADED INNOCENT TO CHARGES OF CULTIVATION OF
MARIJUANA, POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA AND POSSESSION OF COCAINE.
   THE COUPLE, WHO WERE ARRESTED AT THEIR HOME IN A POSH OAKLAND HILLS
NEIGHBORHOOD WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN POLICE WITH A SEARCH WARRANT FOUND 323
MARIJUANA PLANTS AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF COCAINE, APPEARED IN A GOOD MOOD
AS THEY ENTERED THE COURTROOM OF OAKLAND MUNICIPAL JUDGE RODERIC
DUNCAN.
   THEY STOOD WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS BEFORE THE JUDGE DURING THE BRIEF
PROCEEDING.
   THE CORRIDOR OURSIDE THE THIRD-FLOOR COURTROOM WAS PACKED WITH
REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS.
   AFTER THE ARRAIGNMENT, HALVONIK, A JUSTICE OF THE STATE DISTRICT
COURT OF APPEAL AND CONFIDANT OF GOV. EDMUND G. BROWN JR., TOLD
REPORTERS HIS ATTORNEY HAD ADVISED HIM NOT TO MAKE A STATEMENT.
   HOWEVER, HE SAID,  &#34;I THINK IT&#39;S IMPORTANT THAT I MAKE A
STATEMENT,&#34;  AND HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE ONE LATER IN THE DAY.
   THE ARREST OF HALVONIK, DESCRIBED AS A  &#34;BRILLIANT MAN,&#34; STUNNED
HIS COLLEAGUES.
    &#34;I AM SHOCKED,&#34;  SAID A COLLEAGUE ON THE 1ST DISTRICT COURT BENCH
IN SAN FRANCISCO.  &#34;JUSTICE HALVONIK IS A BRILLIANT MAN. I CAN ONLY HOPE
THIS IS A MISTAKE.&#34;
   HALVONIK, 40, A FORMER PROFESSIONAL JAZZ PIANIST WHO STILL PLAYS IN
HIS SPARE TIME, HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT. HE AND HIS WIFE, DEBORAH, A
LAWYER, WERE TO BE ARRAIGNED TODAY IN OAKLAND-PIEDMONT MUNICIPAL COURT
ON CHARGES OF POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA FOR SALE, CULTIVATION OF MARIJUANA
AND SUSPICION OF COCAINE POSSESSION.
   THE HALVONIKS WERE ARRESTED AT THEIR OAKLAND HOME WEDNESDAY NIGHT
WHEN A SQUAD OF EIGHT VICE OFFICERS ARRIVED WITH A SEARCH WARRANT. THEY
WERE RELEASED ON THEIR OWN RECOGNIZANCE IN WHAT WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE
FIRST DRUG CASE INVOLVING A CALIFORNIA JUSTICE.
   IF CONVICTED ON THE FELONY NARCOTICS CHARGES, EACH COULD BE
DISBARRED AND THE JUDGE REMOVED FROM HIS $65,050-A-YEAR POST BY THE
STATE SUPREME COURT.
   HALVONIK, A FORMER LEGAL DIRECTOR OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, HAS A LONG RECORD IN
CIVIL LIBERTIES AND LITIGATION. HE JOINED BROWN IN 1975 AS THE
GOVERNOR&#39;S LIAISON WITH THE STATE ASSEMBLY. A YEAR LATER, HE BECAME THE
STATE&#39;S FIRST PUBLIC DEFENDER.
   BEFORE JOINING THE ACLU, HALVONIK WAS A DEPUTY STATE ATTORNEY
GENERAL AND A MEMBER OF PUBLIC ADVOCATES, INC. HIS WIFE, DEBORAH HINKEL
HALVONIK, 37, IS A FORMER ACLU STAFF LAWYER NOW IN PRIVATE PRACTICE.
   THOUGH JUDGES WERE RELUCTANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ARRESTS, ONE
PROMINENT JURIST SAID:  &#34;INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ARE VERY TRAGIC FOR THE
JUDICIARY. I&#39;VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. HE IS A VERY BRIGHT GUY, BUT
HE IS A LOOSE GUY.&#34;
   DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF TOM DONOHUE SAID THE ARRESTS FOLLOWED A
THREE-DAY INVESTIGATION BY POLICE AFTER AN OFFICER SPOTTED WHAT LOOKED
LIKE A MARIJUANA PLANT IN THE HALVONIK HOME. POLICE WERE THERE BECAUSE
MRS. HALVONIK REPORTED A BLURGLARY ON MONDAY OF A TELEVISION SET AND SOME
OTHER ITEMS.
   NARCOTICS SERGEANT LARRY RODRIQUE [sic] SAID HE AND OTHER OFFICERS USED
BINOCULARS TO CHECK OUT THE REPORT OF NARIJUANA PLANTS AND SPOTTED THEM
GROWING  &#34;IN PLAIN VIEW&#34;  ON THE SECOND FLOOR BALCONY OF THE HALVONIK
HOME.
   AFTER OBTAINING A WARRANT, OFFICERS WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND
REPORTED FINDING 323 MARIJUANA PLANTS, $100 WORTH OF COCAINE, AND TWO
1-OUNCE BAGS OF HIGH-GRADE PROCESSED MARIJUANA.
   HALVONIK&#39;S APPOINTMENT TO THE BENCH WAS DEBATED FOR FOUR HOURS BY
THE STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS IN 1978 BECAUSE OF AN
ALLEGATION HE POSSESSED A MARIJUANA CIGARETTE FOUR YEARS EARLIER WHILE
WAITING TO SEE A CLIENT IN SAN QUENTIN PRISON.
   ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES, GUARDS FOUND WHAT APPEARED TO BE A JOINT
IN A PACK OF CIGARETTES WHEN HALVONIK WAS ASKED TO EMPTY HIS POCKETS
BEFORE ENTERING THE PRISON ON JULY 18, 1974.

How much did this 24-minute-and-a-few-seconds call cost our intrepid user? Because they connected during business hours, they got hit with the full $15/hr charge. Assuming a 25 minute billing, that would have been $6.25, or today (2022) about $24.42.

Our next session is from January 25, 1980. PRIMOS had been updated to 2.9E. <tt>TCA875</tt> is logging in again but notice that lower case has been enabled (unfortunately the Silent 700 Model 765 still does lower case as &#34;little upper case&#34; letters, but we&#39;ll use conventional lowercase here). The TAC banner is area code 305, which would have been most of southern Florida. Given where we&#39;ve seen them connect from so far and the fact this is another on-peak access, I suspect our friends were quite mobile and I doubt very much they were actually paying the subscriptions themselves (probably a corporate account).

Now they&#39;ll send a message to one of the other users in our little clique. Messages to a single user were free, but every subsequent recipient of a message was a 15-cent ($0.59 in 2022) surcharge per message, per recipient. (Imagine the impact that would have had on spam and unsolicited commercial E-mail.) The E-mail system allowed you to send saved messages, create mailing lists and send message lists with &#34;return receipt requested.&#34; An interesting, and possibly annoying, feature was &#34;reply requested,&#34; which actually <em>required</em> the recipient to reply to you immediately. 
</p><p>
In addition to the E-mail system, TCA had access to the Datapost service. For 75 cents ($2.93) you could send a message using a special client (this didn&#39;t go through the Dialcom mailer) which was turned into a <em>printed</em> letter, and sent next-day mail to anyone in the continental United States. This was not unlike the later United States Postal Service <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-COM">E-COM hybrid mail</a> feature, but E-COM wasn&#39;t a thing until 1982.
</p><p>
But wait, there&#39;s more! For a $1.25 ($4.88) charge, there was even <em>voice</em> E-mail. Someone wanting to send you a message, who didn&#39;t even have to be a subscriber, called a special 800 number (or a 703 number in Virginia), provided the account number, and then a message of up to 100 words. Transcriptionists between 8am and 11pm Eastern would convert the voice message to an E-mail within 30 minutes. &#34;And you&#39;ll save money too,&#34; brags the manual, &#34;because the cost per voicegram is only $1.25 plus regular connect time, about half that of a regular credit card or collect telephone call.&#34; That was true because you really got reamed on those. However, one could also imagine a very irked ex-partner or vengeful child could really cost you a lot of money in a hurry with this service ...
</p><p>
Anyway, they&#39;re sending a message. This appears to be proprietary, so I have snipped it.

Good to see the care with which they treated that message.
</p><p>
An incomplete transcript from February 6, 1980 of yet another user and from yet another machine shows that The Source was also trying to get into tax services. This is particularly interesting given that rival CompuServe got bought by tax prep conglomerate H&amp;R Block in 1980. Also notice that the user actually specified a terminal type (<tt>TI65</tt>), even though this probably wouldn&#39;t have made any difference, and is sending themselves a test message.

The last transcript was still in the teletype when it arrived, in the photograph at the beginning of this entry. The last login I have, from November 11, 1980, shows PRIMOS now at 2.9H.

The Source was expensive, but especially for the time offered users quite a lot of value for money. Unfortunately, that also meant it was very expensive to operate and it quickly ran up a large amount of debt. In 1980, Reader&#39;s Digest bought a controlling stake in the company from co-founder Jack Taub. (This infuriated original founder Bill von Meister, who successfully sued for $1 million and rolled it into a new company called Control Video Corporation. CVC&#39;s initial product, an on-demand game service for the Atari 2600, was similarly unsuccessful. Out of its ashes was formed Quantum Computer Services, who built QuantumLink out of the old Commodore 64 PlayNET service and freaked out my parents, and later became America On-Line.) Reader&#39;s Digest expected big things from its new acquisition and set up its own bank of Prime minicomputers especially to run it, divorcing the service from Dialcom (sold to ITT in 1982); it also increased the staff by more than double and expanded remote access options through the newer Tymnet network to reach more potential subscribers.
</p><p>
The new management&#39;s efforts may have made it more attractive as a service, but it made it even pricier to run, and in 1982 the off-peak rate jumped to $5.75/hr ($16.91) and the on-peak rate to a whopping $29.75/hr ($87.47). This made it uncompetitive compared to CompuServe, who by now were running on their corporate parent H&amp;R Block&#39;s own DEC-based financial hardware, and therefore had much lower operating costs (whereas the higher peak rates caused Reader&#39;s Digest&#39;s Primes to sit idle during the most profitable periods). Additionally, with both trying to appeal to the same class of well-heeled user, H&amp;R&#39;s close financial connections made it cheaper to provide the same desirable content Reader&#39;s Digest had to pay publishers more for. By summer 1982, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/26/business/digest-s-disappointing-source.html">New York Times reported</a> that it had barely achieved 20,000 users, just a third of its goal, while CompuServe had 27,000.

Short on capital, Reader&#39;s Digest brought Control Data Corporation on as a co-investor in 1983 (the server room picture above is from Infoworld, 1984). The Source was rebranded as an &#34;information <em>network</em>&#34; and the initial fee was slashed to $49.95, but the $10 minimum monthly charge irked consumers, and rates continued to climb to a base off-peak rate of $7.75/hr and as high as $44.75/hr. In 1987, when CDC wanted out, CompuServe had 380,000 users; The Source had just 80,000. In 1989, CompuServe itself acquired the service and shut it down, having reportedly never turned a profit.
