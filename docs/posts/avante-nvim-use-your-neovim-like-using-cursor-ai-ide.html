<p>I think leetcode is helpful. I believe it has helped me grow a ton as a programmer, will continue to aid my growth as a programmer, and this is true for all programmers. I also think that, if approached in certain ways, leetcode can be powerfully destructive. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZW7TuY_yo">The first 12 minutes of this 18 minute video by Leetcode.IO really supported my experience<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>and helped me to process a lot of my thoughts about leetcode into a really simple premise; leetcode is <em>mostly</em> about practice.</p>
<p>A common critique of leetcode that it isn’t what coding at a job is like at all, and although I think this is true and a helpful point to make, I don’t totally agree that this disqualifies leetcode as a helpful method for becoming a better programmer.</p>
<p>Leetcode taught me that even in a language that I have been using for more than five years, Javascript, there are still many basic things I either don’t know, or have <em>known</em> briefly but failed to internalize, and the true cost of that ignorance.</p>
<p>In other words, leetcode has been a powerful tool for teaching me what I didn’t know I didn’t know.</p>
<p>It also provided me with the soft skill of working under pressure - this can be accomplished in other ways, but one of the tricky things about leetcode is that it represents an (arguably) inexhaustible source of pressure and mindfuckery, which is exactly the on-tap kind of resource you need to continually practice coding under pressure.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of some of the things I learned from leetcod3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write code too fast and you make mistakes that slow you down in the long run</li>
<li>Code too <em>slowly</em> and you lose valuable time to refine <em>actual code</em></li>
<li>Pseudocode can be really helpful</li>
<li>If considering alternate approaches only takes 40 seconds, it might be worth stepping back and sacrificing a couple minutes from your thirty allotted minutes.</li>
<li>Committing to any direction is always better than “hmm, what’s a better way to do this”</li>
<li>when to use <code>for...in</code> and when to use <code>for...of</code></li>
<li>When to use <code>Object.entries()</code>, vs <code>Object.keys()</code></li>
<li>This fuzzy strategy of how if you <em>save</em> information as you iterate, it can prevent you from needing to iterate a second time, i.e. <a href="https://elijer.github.io/garden/devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/3)-Stock-Profits" data-slug="devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/3)-Stock-Profits">3) Stock Profits</a></li>
<li>How time complexity really works (50% of the way there at least if we’re being honest)</li>
<li>That math notation exists (and can be used to neatly define time complexity, thanks <a href="https://404wolf.com/">Wolf<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>)</li>
<li>What <em>space</em> complexity is</li>
<li>How trees can be helpful when doing various spatial lookups, like for a game</li>
<li>How <code>const</code> really can help prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot sometimes - maybe a better way to say this is, in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaseemabid/?originalSubdomain=uk">Jaseem<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>’s words, is that avoiding mutation is a great way to avoid mistakes.</li>
<li>How typing, when it comes to handling nulls, is one of the easiest ways to prevent unexpected errors</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it’s cool how these lessons range from really technical, language-specific insights to much broader insights about weak-spots in my process.</p>
<p>I also happen to be someone who has built a <em>lot</em> of personal projects from the ground up, so I suppose I’m pretty experience in just hacking things together and learning what makes sense in an ecosystem on my own. That’s probably why leetcode is so good for me - I’ve spent a lot of time just doing what <em>works</em> rather than really heads-down learning the best practices for syntax and algorithms, since I can usually borrow those form someone when shit really hits the fan.</p>
<p>What I <em>didn’t</em> realize was that the cost of sub-par code throughout my repos, in terms of the details, really slows me down.</p></article><hr/></div></div></div>
