Schwartz, acknowledged recently that he had used the artificial intelligence program as part of his research for the brief.</p><p>“I simply had no idea that ChatGPT was capable of fabricating entire case citations or judicial opinions, especially in a manner that appeared authentic,” Mr. Schwartz said in a<span>  </span>declaration filed on Tuesday with the judge, P. Kevin Castel of Federal District Court.</p><p>Mr. Schwartz said in the declaration that he had learned about ChatGPT from his college-aged children and from articles he had read, but that he had never used it professionally until now. He also cited the explosion of news coverage and the ensuing public ridicule endured by him and his law firm, Levidow, Levidow &amp; Oberman.</p></div></div><div><div><p>“This has been deeply embarrassing on both a personal and professional level as these articles will be available for years to come,” Mr. Schwartz wrote.</p><p>The episode, which arose in an otherwise obscure lawsuit, has riveted the tech world, where there has been a growing debate about the dangers — even a potential existential threat to humanity — posed by artificial intelligence. It has also transfixed lawyers and judges, who first depended on musty old law books and then on online databases to provide the arguments and precedents they needed.</p><p>“This case has reverberated throughout the entire legal profession,” said David Lat, a legal commentator. “It is a little bit like looking at a car wreck. But it is also a valuable object lesson about the perils of relying upon A.I. tools in legal practice.”</p><p>The case involved a man named Roberto Mata, who had sued the airline Avianca claiming he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his knee during an August 2019 flight from El Salvador to Kennedy International Airport in New York.</p><p>Avianca asked Judge Castel to dismiss the lawsuit because the statute of limitations had expired. Mr. Mata’s lawyers responded with a 10-page brief citing more than half a dozen court decisions, with names like Martinez v. Delta Air Lines, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines and Varghese v. China Southern Airlines, in support of their argument that the suit should be allowed to proceed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But after Avianca’s lawyers said they were unable to locate the cases, Judge Castel ordered Mr. Mata’s lawyers to provide the court with copies of the opinions. They submitted a compendium of eight of the decisions.</p><p>It turned out the cases were not real.</p><p>Mr. Schwartz, in a court filing this week, apologized and said he had made a “deeply regrettable mistake.”</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Schwartz and his law firm asked the judge in a court filing on Tuesday not to impose sanctions on the lawyer or the firm.</p><p>“Sanctions would serve no useful purpose,” the lawyers wrote. “Mr. Schwartz and the firm have already become the poster children for the perils of dabbling with new technology; their lesson has been learned.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>Benjamin Weiser is a reporter covering the Manhattan federal courts.
