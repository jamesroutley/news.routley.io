      <h2>Programmable Ink</h2>
      
      <p>With pen and paper, anyone can write a journal entry, draw a diagram, perform a calculation, or sketch a cartoon. Digital tablets like the iPad or reMarkable can adapt pen and paper into the world of digital media. In doing so, they trade away some of paper’s advantages like cheapness and tangibility. In exchange, we get new computational powers like nondestructive editing and ease of transmission. But they have yet to achieve the greatest computational capability of all: the ability to define entirely new computational behaviors—to <em>program</em>.</p>
<p>The success of spreadsheets demonstrates that users can make effective use of open-ended programmability—to speed computations, explore what-if scenarios, and have thoughts they wouldn’t have had using their analog predecessor (a paper grid and manual calculations).</p>
<p><strong>What would be possible if hand-drawn sketches were programmable like spreadsheets?</strong></p>

      <h2 id="programmable-sketchbooks"><a href="#programmable-sketchbooks">Programmable sketchbooks</a></h2><h3 id="success-of-spreadsheets"><a href="#success-of-spreadsheets">Success of spreadsheets</a></h3><p>Making <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/">end-user programming</a> powerful and ubiquitous is a central goal within our lab’s broader vision of making better tools for thought. Spreadsheets are a widely successful end-user programming tool, and in particular we are inspired by their support of <em>gradual enrichment</em> and <em>programming in the moment.</em></p>

<p>Spreadsheets support <em>gradual enrichment</em> by allowing you to quickly put text and numbers in arbitrary boxes as if using a pen and graph paper, do basic math as if using a calculator, move things into neat rows and columns when you find yourself making comparisons, and add more formula-driven cells and labels if/when necessary as your model evolves—incrementally building dynamic complexity over time. You might eventually polish the formatting, clearly label input cells, and turn the model into a reusable piece of <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/technology/2004-03-30-shirky-situatedsoftware.html">situated software</a>. Each bit of effort to refine the model is a small investment made in a moment when the payoff is immediate.</p>

<p>When software allows adding dynamic behavior as part of <em>gradual enrichment</em>, it supports <em>programming in the moment</em>. Spreadsheets support dynamic behavior with live, reactive, declarative formulas you can place anywhere you would otherwise have data. They treat data and formulas equally: where they appear in the interface, how they are edited, and how they reference each other. This interchangeability supports <em>programming in the moment</em> by allowing you to keep working with the same tools, in the same mindset—thinking only about the specific thing you are modeling—even though you have switched to programming. They don’t force you to stop and switch to your <em>programmer hat</em>.</p>


<p>Through this lens, spreadsheets stand out as one of the more successful and prevalent instances of end-user programming. They give a broad range of users access to computational power while maintaining flexibility through the use of the familiar and adaptable grid—what Bonnie Nardi calls a <em>visual formalism</em>.</p>

		  Bonnie Nardi&#39;s classic book “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/small-matter-programming">A Small Matter of Programming</a>” calls attention to the spreadsheet as a remarkably successful end-user programming environment and insightfully breaks down the factors that make it work.

<p>Spreadsheets are immensely popular for uses that fit neatly within a grid of cells (and have been <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-fun-weird-things-can-create-microsoft-excel/">creatively misused</a> enough to prove their flexibility), but they are not the end of the road for end-user-programmable media.</p>
<p>Despite the spreadsheet’s computational advantages, most people don’t reach for a spreadsheet the moment they want to think through a problem or communicate an idea.</p>
<h3 id="enduring-value-of-pen-and-paper"><a href="#enduring-value-of-pen-and-paper">Enduring value of pen and paper</a></h3><p>Despite an overabundance of other tools, many people still turn first to pen and paper for ideating, note taking, sketching, and more.</p>
<p>There is something special that happens in the brain when making marks by hand, and a large body of research suggests it has various advantages, whether for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25541600/">learning and psychological development</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24760141/">retention of material</a>, or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28536546/">activating more pathways in the brain</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What the hand does, the mind remembers.</p>

<p>We believe these attributes contribute to pen and paper’s staying power:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Flexible &amp; free-form</strong> </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Immediate</strong> </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Intimate and tangible</strong> </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Informal &amp; “sketchy”</strong> </li>
	<li>
		<strong>Connected with human life</strong> </li>
</ul>


<p>Digital pen and paper, in the form of tablet/stylus interfaces, have extended the power of their traditional counterparts with sophisticated editing interactions like copy-paste, undo, and infinite zoom, while trying to keep some of paper’s unique charms.</p>
<figure>
<p><strong>Shortcomings of digital paper</strong></p>
<p>We should be thoughtful about basic advantages of paper that we can lose when moving to a digital tablet/stylus. For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>spread papers out over a table, or across a wall</li>
<li>thumb through a stack of papers, re-sort them, put them in different folders</li>
<li>pass papers to a colleague and not worry whether the contents have synced across the network yet</li>
<li>cut a piece of paper, rearrange it, and glue it to another</li>
<li>use different tools (straight edge, compass, highlighter) mixed and matched all on the same paper without the designers of those tools needing to know about each other</li>
<li>operate pens with remarkably low latency</li>
<li>work with sheets of paper without irrelevant pop-up notifications, running out of batteries, or system crashes</li>
<li>purchase sheets of paper extremely cheaply</li>
</ul>

<p>We want a digital pen and paper that maintain as many of the above attributes as possible, but with all the benefits of a <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Kay1977.pdf">dynamic digital medium</a>. The most important being programmability—describing new behaviors for a sketchbook to take on, automating and processing and simulating.</p>
