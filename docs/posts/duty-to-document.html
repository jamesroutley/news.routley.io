        <p>If you learn something the hard way, share your findings with others. You have blazed a new trail; now you must mark it for your fellow travellers. Sharing knowledge is an unreasonably effective way of helping others.</p>

<p>I owe a debt of gratitude to those whose knowledge helped me debug software, repair bicycles, choose camping gear, start a business, and deal with anything life throws at me.</p>
<p>I repay that debt by marking my own trails. When I think “it should not have been this hard to find out”, I make it easier to find out. Over the years, I have documented everything from <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/ffmpeg-extract-subtitles">ffmpeg incantations</a> to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/72463537">Uzbek petrol stations</a>, and made a career out of <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/projects/all-about-berlin">documenting German bureaucracy</a>.</p>
<p>I figure that if you have knowledge that could benefit thousands of people, and it costs you next to nothing to share that knowledge, it’s your duty to do it.</p>
