          <section><p>It’s well-documented phenomenon that many Americans will balk at a public spending measure that costs over a trillion dollars but are totally <span>OK</span> with that if it is for the military. Adam Tooze discusses this in a <a href="https://chartable.com/podcasts/ones-and-tooze/episodes/145999477-trillion-dollar-sticker-shock-lets-all-get-over-it">recent episode</a> of his podcast. If it’s for the military, then it it’s essential and maybe even exciting, like the F-35 or the Manhattan Project.</p>

<p>Trump may not need help capturing all the right-leaning votes in the <span>US</span>, but a tact that could work for him is to pick up some disgraced physicist and push for a <strong>Manhattan Project 2</strong>. It would be <em>just like</em> the original Manhattan Project, except they’d really do it in Manhattan this time, in some Trump hotel’s spacious event space.</p>
<p>The other difference would be that the new bomb could wipe out <em>all of China</em>. (<strong>“<span>CHI</span>-na!”</strong> said with a sneer, of course.) This bomb would cost trillions, maybe a quadrillion.</p>
<p>Trump would “be frank with you” and say “that’s a lotta money” but it would make us <strong>safe from China</strong> and put <strong>America</strong> <em>back on top</em>.</p>
<p>What if it turned out you couldn’t actually make a bomb like that, and some pedantic wonk pointed it out?</p>
<p>Well, what of it? Trump would just ask Dr. Scientist if we could really make the Superbomb, and Dr. Scientist would say yes, but the science <em>deep state</em> is <strong>holding back</strong>. Then, Trump would chant <strong><span>BUILD</span>! THE! BOMB!</strong> and so would half of America.</p>

<p>But what if it turned out that you <em>could</em> build a bomb like that?</p>
