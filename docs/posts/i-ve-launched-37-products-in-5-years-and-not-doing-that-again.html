    <h1>I&#39;ve launched 37 products in 5 years and not doing that again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!---->          <div id="ember1499555">    <p>After launching 37 different products over the last few years, I’ve had one go viral and almost all the others struggle to get any traction at all.</p>
<p>Like many indie makers, I used to think the best strategy was to just keep launching, make more bets, and hope one finally catches fire.</p>
<p>But here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virality is rare and nearly impossible to predict</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of my launches that failed didn’t actually fail, they just grew much slower than I expected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My current project, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://refgrow.com?ref=IH">Refgrow</a>, took over 6 months to get the first paying customer, but now it’s growing slowly and steadily with almost no marketing budget</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sticking with one project and improving it, even when growth is painfully slow, seems to produce more consistent results than chasing the next hit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m curious, for those of you who have been building for a while:</p>
<p>Did you find success by focusing on one project and giving it time, or by making lots of new bets?</p>
<p>Has &#34;slow growth&#34; ever paid off for you?</p>
<p>If you had to start over, would you pick patience or a high volume of launches?</p>
<p>Would love to hear stories, lessons, or any advice from other indie founders in the same boat.</p>
