    <h1>Ask HN: GPT-3 reveals my full name to anybody who asks. Can I do anything?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Alternatively: What&#39;s the current status of Personally Identifying Information and language models?<p>I try to hide my real name whenever possible, out of an abundance of caution. You can still find it if you search carefully, but in today&#39;s hostile internet I see this kind of soft pseudonymity as my digital personal space, and expect to have it respected.</p><p>When playing around in GPT-3 I tried making sentences with my username. Imagine my surprise when I see it spitting out my (globally unique, unusual) full name!</p><p>Looking around, I found a paper that says language models spitting out personal information is a problem[1], a Google blog post that says there&#39;s not much that can be done[2], and an article that says OpenAI might automatically replace phone numbers in the future but other types of PII are harder to remove[3]. But nothing on what is <i>actually</i> being done.</p><p>If I had found my personal information on Google search results, or Facebook, I could ask the information to be removed, but GPT-3 seems to have no such support. Are we supposed to accept that large language models may reveal private information, with no recourse?</p><p>I don&#39;t care much about my <i>name</i> being public, but I don&#39;t know what else it might have memorized (political affiliations? Sexual preferences? Posts from 13-year old me?). In the age of GDPR this feels like an enormous regression in privacy.</p><p>[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805</p><p>[2]: https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/12/privacy-considerations-in-large.html</p><p>[3]: https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/18/openai_gpt3_data/</p></div></div>
