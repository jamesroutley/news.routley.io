    <h1>Bayer hit with $332M judgement in Roundup cancer trial</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content"><div><div data-cy="articleContent"><p>A California jury has awarded $332 million to a man who sued chemical giant Monsanto Co. contending that his cancer was related to decades of using its Roundup weedkiller.</p><div>



<p>A San Diego Superior Court jury awarded damages Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by Mike Dennis, 57, of Carlsbad. He was diagnosed in 2020 with a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>



<p>His lawsuit contended that his illness was related to Roundup’s active ingredient, glyphosate.</p>



<p>Dennis had treatment and has been in remission for nearly three years but there is no cure, Adam Peavy, one of his attorneys, told <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/san-diego-county-jury-reaches-332m-verdict-in-trial-claiming-roundup-caused-carlsbad-mans-cancer/3343895/" target="_self" rel="">KNSD-TV.</a></p>



<p>“His doctors have told him it’s going to come back and we’re just waiting to see if that happens,” Peavy said.</p>



<p>The jury found that Monsanto, which is now a division of <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/10/shareholders-are-forcing-bayers-ceo-out-what-do-they-expect-from-his-replacement/" target="_self" rel="">pharmaceutical and biotechnology giant Bayer</a>, failed to provide warnings of Roundup’s risks. But jurors also ruled partially in Bayer’s favor by finding the product design wasn’t defective and the company wasn’t negligent.</p>



<p>Dennis was awarded $7 million in compensatory damages and $325 million in punitive damages.</p>



<p>In a statement to KNSD-TV, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/bayer/" target="_blank" rel="">Bayer</a> said it believes “we have strong arguments on appeal to get this unfounded verdict overturned and the unconstitutionally excessive damage award eliminated or reduced.”</p>



<p>“There were significant and reversible legal and evidentiary errors made during this trial,” Bayer added.</p>



<p>Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018 and has been trying to deal with thousands of claims and lawsuits related to Roundup. In 2020, Bayer <a href="https://apnews.com/article/a12603a80c8238d1f7af3705cfec610a" target="_self" rel="">announced</a> it would pay up to $10.9 billion to settle some 125,000 filed and unfiled claims.</p></div><p><em>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</em></p></div></div></div></div>
