				<p id="speakable-summary">Brave Software, the maker of Brave Browser and Search, confirmed that it has laid off 9% of its staff across departments.</p>
<p>The company didn’t specify how many people were affected, but it corroborated the development and said the decision was driven by the tough economic climate.</p>
<p>“Brave eliminated some positions as part of our cost management in this challenging economic environment. Several departments were affected, amounting to 9% of our staff,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p>The company has been taking steps to bolster its revenue sources this year. In April, Brave Search ditched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/brave-search-doesnt-use-bings-index-anymore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing Index to start relying on its own indexing solution</a>. In May, the company released its <a href="https://brave.com/search-api-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own search API</a> for clients with plans starting from $3 per 1,000 queries. The API also offers different plans for AI data model training, data with storage rights, spellcheck, and autosuggest. Last month, Brave introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/privacy-focused-brave-search-launches-its-own-image-and-video-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image, news, and video results</a> as a part of its Search API.</p>
<p>Brave has also been testing a native AI assistant called Leo for its browser. While it plans to make it available to all users, Brave said that Leo will have<a href="https://brave.com/leo-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a premium tier</a> with features like higher rate limits and access to more conversation models. The company noted that this will help it pay for the cost of API access and hosting.</p>
