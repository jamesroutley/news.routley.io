<p>If you ever wished you could bring the accessibility, simplicity and power of the Arduino ecosystem into your work environment, you’re not alone. </p>
<p>Whether you’re a Gen Z or a Millennial engineer, developer or entrepreneur, and whether you’re beginning your first job, founding a startup or progressing in your career, you’re bringing to the table a wide range of skills previous generations were never taught or encouraged to explore. What’s more, <strong>you likely have a whole different approach to work, change and innovation</strong>. At Arduino, we like to think we might have had a little something to do with that.</p>
<p>As you probably know, Arduino was born in Italy at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, as an easy-to-use tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students with no background in electronics or programming. The platform was meant to enable creatives through technology. Little did we know we’d fire up the maker movement, and soon expand to offer tools for education and professionals as well.</p>
<p><strong>We were, and always will be, champions of open-source solutions</strong>. Because they’re conducive to accessibility, because we believe in ground-up innovation, and because it’s the right thing to do in a world that’s riddled with inequalities. </p>
<p>Thanks to this philosophy, we’ve been able to grow into a global brand offering hardware, software, connectivity and developer tools to millions of active users that include artists, hobbyists, engineers and inventors; a community we’re proud of, and grateful for.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Engineers in [Gen Z and Millennial] generations grew up using Arduino boards in STEM programs around the world, and they’ve become accustomed to the accessibility, simplicity and power of the company’s open-source hardware, software and cloud services. They’re now taking those demands into the enterprise as they enter the labor force.”</em></p><cite><em>Massimo Banzi, co-founder, Chairman and CMO of Arduino</em></cite></blockquote>
<p>Listening to our users’ needs, seeing the potential they’re ready to fulfill and the challenges and opportunities they face in today’s market, we’re ready to step up with them. </p>
<p>So today, we <strong>dial up our vision for universal innovation with a clear strategy to expand our portfolio for professionals</strong>, supported by a Series B funding round of $32 million led by the global deep tech investor <a href="https://www.rbvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Bosch Venture Capital</a> (RBVC), joined by <a href="https://www.renesas.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Renesas</a>, <a href="https://anzupartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anzu Partners</a>, and <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arm</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The way corporations solve contemporary challenges and identify new business opportunities is quickly evolving as a new generation of engineers moves into the workforce in larger numbers. With this investment we’re developing and delivering a new range of dedicated enterprise solutions to ignite this transformation.” </em></p><cite><em>Fabio Violante, CEO of Arduino</em></cite></blockquote>
<p>Going forward, our goal is to empower not only makers and students, but also <strong>a new generation of professional engineers with enterprise-scale applications</strong>. Curious? These are some of the specific offerings we will be working on:</p>
<ul><li>Delivering specialized, low-code cloud services to accelerate the development and deployment of IoT applications to meet industry needs.</li><li>Offering new solutions for intelligent edge design, including new system modules. </li><li>Creating and integrating new AI capabilities for designers.</li><li>Enhancing global prototype-to-production capabilities by expanding its existing Systems Integrators Partner Program.</li></ul>
<p>The driving force behind these developments will continue to be the final user experience. Arduino will autonomously select its vendors and partnerships. Decisions will always be based upon what is most appropriate to create the innovative tools we’re producing for the customer, thereby maintaining the agnostic approach to technology that has always been a defining principle.</p>
<p>Charting this new strategic course, we strive to focus on larger organizations while maintaining our commitment to deliver the industry’s most innovative tools for makers and students. We’ll always be there at the side of future innovators.</p>
