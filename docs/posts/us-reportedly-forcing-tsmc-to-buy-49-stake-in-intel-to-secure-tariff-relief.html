	<p>The current US administration, led by President Donald Trump, has employed trade tariffs as the primary way to reduce the US&#39;s trade deficit with partner countries. However, the US tariff policy has been erratic and unpredictable. These tariffs have also affected Taiwan, one of the US’s biggest trading partners.</p><p>Currently standing at 20%, the US trade tariff on Taiwan is more than that of countries like Japan, which pays a baseline tariff of 15%. Unsurprisingly, a 20% levy on Taiwanese exports to the US will hurt Taiwanese businesses quite a bit, which is why the country needs to negotiate further with the US to bring the tariffs down or downright eliminate then. However, according to a new report out of Taiwan, US President Trump has presented Taiwan with two conditions for tariff relief, both of which are quite stringent.</p><p><a href="https://www.mnews.tw/story/mm-20250804fin003" target="_blank">Per the Taiwanese outlet mnews.tw</a>, an industry source told the publication that President Donald Trump has mandated TSMC fulfill two conditions if Taiwan is to see any tariff reduction:</p><div><ol><li>Buy a 49% stake in Intel</li><li>Invest a further $400 billion in the US</li></ol></div><p>While ignoring the industrial ramifications of TSMC owning 49% of Intel, these are humongous financial commitments. <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/TSMC-s-second-Kumamoto-fab-reportedly-slips-to-2029-as-attention-shifts-to-U-S-expansion.1069608.0.html" target="_self">TSMC is already investing a ton of money in the US</a>, with one of the company’s fabs achieving volume production in 2024. The Taiwanese giant is on its way to building two more fabs at its Arizona facility, alongside an R&amp;D Center and a packaging facility. Overall, TSMC has planned to invest a total of $165 billion in the US.</p><p>So, President Trump’s alleged condition of investing a further $400 billion in the US alongside buying a stake in Intel seems improbable from a purely financial standpoint.</p><p><h2>The US is trying to save Intel from collapse</h2></p><p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-is-absolutely-hammering-Intel-in-CPU-sales-as-even-old-AM4-chips-outsold-latest-Arrow-Lake-CPUs-last-week.1063493.0.html" target="_self">Intel is on the decline</a>. From the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-now-reportedly-focusing-on-14A-production-as-18A-proves-to-be-a-billion-dollar-failure.1049302.0.html" target="_self">company’s fab operations</a> to consumer products, virtually every Intel department is taking a hit. This has shown in the company’s reported annual revenue figure, which has come down from a high of $79 billion in 2021 to $53 billion in 2024, is a massive 33% reduction.</p><p>Intel is a vital part of the US’s plans regarding domestic semiconductor manufacturing. As such, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/intel-has-already-received-2-2b-in-federal-grants-for-chip-production/" target="_blank">the company has already received billions in federal grants</a>. However, this funding has not solved Intel’s troubles, as the company has delayed its Ohio fab from an initial target of 2025 to 2030/31. A primary reason for this delay seems to be Intel’s efforts to preserve capital resources amidst a lack of significant help from the US CHIPS Act and outside partners.</p><div><p>In short, the US administration seems to be pressuring TSMC to acquire a considerable stake in Intel to inject some much-needed capital into the company and keep the US government&#39;s plans of a domestic chip supply chain afloat. However, TSMC is unlikely to agree to this proposal.

<p>It&#39;d be interesting to see what happens to Intel the coming months. Intel has a few exciting products in the works with <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-Panther-Lake-could-take-handheld-gaming-to-the-next-level.1072173.0.html" target="_self">Panther Lake</a> and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-Nova-Lake-based-Ryzen-X3D-equivalent-to-launch-with-28-CPU-cores.1066983.0.html" target="_self">Nova Lake CPUs</a>. So, things could improve for Team Blue if these products deliver.</p></div></div><div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" rel="author"><div><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Notebookcheck-Team.212978.0.html?&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=316"><picture><source srcset="fileadmin/_processed_/6/1/csm_IMG_1224_1_162133c8b0.jpg 1x, fileadmin/_processed_/6/1/csm_IMG_1224_1_c8771969bf.jpg 2x"/><img src="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/6/1/csm_IMG_1224_1_162133c8b0.jpg" loading="lazy" width="120" height="120" alt="Fawad Murtaza"/></picture></a></div><p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Notebookcheck-Team.212978.0.html?&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Bmode%5D=show&amp;tx_nbc2journalist_pi1%5Buid%5D=316">Fawad Murtaza</a> - Senior Tech Writer <span title="1302 "> - 1302 articles published on Notebookcheck</span> since 2021</p><p>I am Fawad, a fellow tech nerd.
