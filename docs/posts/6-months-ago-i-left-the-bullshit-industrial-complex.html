    <h1>6 months ago, I left the bullshit industrial complex</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to be good at spinning stories. Give me a half-baked startup idea, a semi-charismatic founder and a fistful of VC dollars, and I could write a story compelling enough it barely mattered whether there was an ounce of truth in it.</p><p>I was running a profitable tech PR agency. It looked impressive enough on LinkedIn. It paid for fancy dinners and weekend getaways. I had the clients, the connections, and a couple of shiny awards gathering dust on my bookshelf. My phone buzzed constantly.</p><p>But something was starting to unravel.</p><p>Like a loose thread on a comfortable sweater. You know you shouldn&#39;t pull on it, but you can&#39;t help yourself.</p><p>A nagging doubt. An odd moment of <em>&#34;Jesus, what the hell am I doing?&#34;</em></p><p>I would lie awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling. My life was slipping away, and I had nothing to show for it but a series of cynical half truths paid for by shit shovelling wannabe billionaires hell bent on leaving the world worse off than they found it. I knew I was a part of something poisonous. It had been years since I&#39;d displayed a shred of journalistic integrity. </p><p>The thread kept unraveling.</p><p>One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release touting yet another &#34;game-changing&#34; startup that had raised - yet another - $25 million. And I realized I couldn&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;d written something I believed in. The words that used to flow felt like trying to squeeze ancient toothpaste from an empty tube.</p><p>That was the day I cracked.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t about the individual startups or the overhyped products. It was the whole damn ecosystem—if we can call it that. The inflated valuations, cult-like frat house “culture,” and the relentless, mindless pursuit of growth that comfortably glossed over the human cost of &#34;disruption.&#34;</p><p>Somewhere along the way, I&#39;d allowed my writing—the thing that used to give me purpose—to be co-opted by the bullshit industrial complex. I&#39;d convinced myself that I was part of something bigger, something world-changing. But deep down, in the quiet moments between pitch meetings and product launches, I knew better.</p><p>It was a slow-building wave, gathering momentum with every story I was hired to spin, every tone-deaf founder I media-trained to sidestep hard questions, every time I was asked to massage the numbers and make a struggling startup look like a unicorn in waiting.</p><p>Going back to my roots as a writer felt like coming up for air after a long, deep dive in a river of shit. The first few months were disorienting as hell. It&#39;s tough adjusting to life outside the echo chamber. I&#39;ve had to relearn how to write without an agenda, how to ask questions without anticipating the &#34;right&#34; answers, how to look at the tech industry with clear eyes.</p><p>There are days when I question my decision—when I gather up the courage to look at my dwindling bank account, for example. Tech has a way of tempting you back, whispering sweet nothings about stock options and catered lunches.</p><p>Well-meaning friends in the industry have texted, called, emailed. They&#39;ve told me that I&#39;m burning bridges, that a critical stance will make me unemployable in tech circles. They&#39;ve advised me to soften my tone, to find a middle ground that won&#39;t alienate potential future employers or clients.</p><p>I get it. I do. In an industry built on network effects, taking a stand can feel like career suicide. The pressure to conform, to go along with the prevailing narrative, is immense. Trust me, I know.</p><p>But then I sit down to write, and I remember why the fuck I&#39;m doing this. I write about the human cost of gig economy apps that treat workers as disposable resources. I write about the venture capital industry that repeatedly and stubbornly fails to invest in anyone who doesn&#39;t look like Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s clone.</p><p>I can&#39;t go back to writing comforting VC pandering fictions. I won&#39;t do it, no matter how many zeroes are dangled in front of me.</p><p>This isn&#39;t to say that I&#39;ve become an anti-tech fanatic, railing against all notions of progress. Technology has potential when it&#39;s guided by ethical considerations and a genuine desire to improve the human condition. I&#39;ve spent the last 6 months interviewing founders who are building companies without following the VC playbook, without setting fire to the world around them.</p><p>But I have zero faith in the idea that unfettered vulture capitalism and a blind pursuit of &#34;disruption&#34; will lead us to a better world.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen how perverse incentives and boiler room pressure to deliver exponential growth can warp even the most idealistic founders&#39; vision. I&#39;ve watched brilliant minds get sucked into the vortex of funding rounds and vanity metrics, losing sight of why they started their companies in the first place.</p><p>I&#39;m reminded of a quote attributed to Upton Sinclair: &#34;It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.&#34; For years, my salary—and my sense of self-worth—depended on not understanding the deeper implications of my work. I can&#39;t keep faking blameless ignorance.</p><p>I don&#39;t know where this will lead me. The tech industry has a long memory.</p><p>So it goes.</p><p>At least I have my integrity. The machine may grind on, but I&#39;m glad to have stepped off the treadmill.</p><p>Howard Zinn said: &#34;You can&#39;t be neutral on a moving train.&#34; Tech is an out-of-control locomotive with no fucking brakes, and I&#39;ve chosen where I stand. It may not be a comfortable or lucrative position, but it&#39;s one I can live with.</p><p>And for the first time in years, when I look in the mirror, I can recognize the person looking back. That&#39;s worth all the stock options in the world.</p></div></div>
