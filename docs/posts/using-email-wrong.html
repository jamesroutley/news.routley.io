  <p>You probably don’t like email, not a lot of people do.
That’s because you’re using it wrong.</p>
<p>Chances are that if you look at your inbox, it’s full of unsolicited marketing 
emails, log-in notifications or spam.
Or you’re doing inbox zero and all that trash lives in your archive.</p>
<p>As everything else, email is subject (hah) to entropy.
If you’re not careful, chaos will take over and your email inbox will look like
the screenshot above.</p>
<h2 id="a-different-concept">A different concept</h2>
<p>As controversial as the company behind <a href="https://www.hey.com">HEY</a> is, the
concept that they introduced with their mail app has fundamentally changed how I 
think about email.
I adapted the part that resonated with me to my <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a>
account like this:</p>
<h3 id="inbox">Inbox</h3>
<p>This is where all emails sent by humans end up.
That’s it.</p>
<h3 id="papertrail">Papertrail</h3>
<p>Notifications, invoices, everything that you don’t want to delete but are not
really interested in.
This folder has about 1.6k unread emails right now.
They’re not meant to be read, but if I need to look something up, I know where
to look.</p>
<h3 id="newsfeed">Newsfeed</h3>
<p>I’m subscribed to over 20 newsletters and all of them end up in here.
If I have time, I’ll read the newsletters and add the articles I want to read to
<a href="https://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re looking for something to add to your newsfeed, check out
<a href="https://arnesweekly.email">Arne’s Weekly</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>I’m using Fastmail with a custom domain and have aliases with rules for the 
different destinations, for example <code>papertrail@example.org</code> or 
<code>newsfeed@example.org</code>.</p>
<p>This way, if I sign up for a new service or subscribe to a newsletter, instead 
of having to adapt existing rules, I can use the proper email address and 
everything will go where it should.</p>
<p>This is not Fastmail specific, you can do the same with most providers.
For example, if you have <code>hikingfan@gmail.com</code>, you could set a rule for
<code>hikingfan+papertrail@gmail.com</code> and one for <code>hikingfan+newsfeed@gmail.com</code> and
use those email addresses when signing up.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-factor">The human factor</h2>
<p>If I look at my inbox, it’s a joy.
Feedback to blog posts, articles and personal messages from people I care about.
Sticking with this strategy made email about humans, not about machines.</p>
<p>I encourage you to try it!</p>
