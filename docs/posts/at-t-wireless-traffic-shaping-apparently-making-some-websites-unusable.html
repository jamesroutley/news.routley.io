<p>When I’m living in my RV, wireless service providers are my primary source of connectivity. So when either AT&amp;T or Verizon make major changes, I take notice.</p>
<p>I recently noticed that multiple websites are quite slow when browsing with my AT&amp;T business plan, listed in AT&amp;T Premier (business account management UI) as “Wireless Broadband Ultra for Router or Hotspt (sic)”. This is an “unlimited” <strong>100Mbit</strong> plan with 50GB for Business Fast Track (prioritized) data. Being that I was far below the 50GB of monthly Fast Track data, my data should have had top priority, so I became suspicious. To be honest, I’ve never noticed a discernible difference between Fast Track and non-Fast Track data rates. This is all to say that I have no reason to believe that I’m being deprioritized due to usage.</p>
<p>Naturally, the first hing I did was conduct a speed test. I already knew from previous experience that for some reason, AT&amp;T traffic to <a href="https://fast.com">fast.com</a> is throttled. Why AT&amp;T wants bandwidth to appear lower than reality is a mystery to me, but I digress. Linode.com has speed tests that AT&amp;T has no special treatment for, and the <a href="http://speedtest.fremont.linode.com/">nearest one to me</a> was in Fremont, CA.</p>
<p>The speedtest revealed <strong>21Mbps</strong> down and <strong>4.5Mbps</strong> up – pretty reasonable in a relatively rural area like Durango, CO. Latency was ~<strong>130ms</strong>. That speed certainly wouldn’t explain why it took anywhere between 15 seconds and 2 minutes to load <code>strava.com</code>.</p>
<p>So I opened up the “Network” tab in Firefox and could clearly see that dozens of resources from <code>cloudfront.com</code> were taking multiple seconds to load. The problem clearly has <em>something</em> to do with Cloudfront.</p>
<p>

<label for="zoomCheck-0c93c">
  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://adriano.fyi/img/att_traffic_shaping_network_tab.png" alt="Firefox network tab loading strava.com" title="Firefox network tab loading strava.com"/>
</label>
</p>
<p>Is Cloudfront having problems? That’s easy enough to verify; my <a href="https://www.sierrawireless.com/router-solutions/rv55/">Sierra Wireless RV55 CAT-12 LTE-A router</a> also contains an unlimited Verizon Business SIM card that I can use to conduct tests on Cloudfront, independent of AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>I noticed that one of Strava’s javascript resources clocked in at <strong>1.68MB</strong>, making it a nice test subject for speed tests (<a href="https://web-assets.strava.com/assets/federated/find-and-invite-friends/827.js">https://web-assets.strava.com/assets/federated/find-and-invite-friends/827.js</a>). At the time of writing <code>web-assets.strava.com</code> resolves to <code>dgpcy4fyk1eox.cloudfront.net</code>, so rest assured, we are dealing with Cloudfront.</p>
<p>After switching to Verizon, I could see that Cloudfront was having no problems. Our friend <code>827.js</code> downloaded in just over 1 second at <strong>1.4MB/s</strong>. I clearly saw earlier in the Firefox network tab that this resource took nearly 1 minute to load on AT&amp;T.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While <code>wget</code> is not my goto for command line HTTP fetching, it displays transfer rates in a human friendly format by default, so I used the following as my test case: <code>wget -O /dev/null -q --show-progress https://web-assets.strava.com/assets/federated/find-and-invite-friends/827.js</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the problem isn’t Cloudfront, because Verizon was fast enough. It wasn’t blazing fast by any means, but I also didn’t have to wait 2 minutes to learn whether Strava awarded me King of the Moutain on a local trail (I wasn’t).</p>
<p>Maybe this is a global AT&amp;T problem. That’s easy to test as well – my iPhone is also on the same AT&amp;T business account as my data-only plan, so I turned on the iPhone hotspot and made it the router’s WAN device to make sure we’re changing a single variable at a time. I conducted another speed test, revealing <strong>23Mbps</strong> down and <strong>3Mbps</strong> up. Nothing surprising there – normal bandwidth fluctuations for a wireless device. How about our <code>wget</code> test? <strong>1.7MB/s</strong>. The problem is clearly not <em>all</em> of AT&amp;T wireless.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the original configuration: connect directly to my AT&amp;T data-only plan with my router and re-run the <code>wget</code> test. Maybe I was imagining things. I’m somewhat surprised to see the <code>wget</code> test with a transfer rate of <strong>~30KB/s</strong>. I believe this rules out AT&amp;T with a souring peering agreement somewhere between me and Cloudfront. My phone traffic to Cloudfront is unaffected; it’s only my data-only plan that is affected.</p>
<p>I now have a pretty clear picture of what is likely happening. Good old-fashion traffic shaping. Now that the router is connected directly to AT&amp;T, the true test of traffic shaping is transfer rates while connected to a VPN. I’ll let the image speak for itself.</p>

<p>As of the time of writing, I’m unsure what is causing such a significant slowdown. It has rendered some websites effectively useless. Everything in this writeup indicates, to me, that AT&amp;T is engaged in extremely aggressive traffic shaping for some plans, rendering many websites nearly unusable.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas how to diagnose this problem further? Do you know the best way engage AT&amp;T’s technical folks to take this seriously? Write me at <code>att-traffic-shaping @ this domain</code>. I’ll add updates here if anything changes, or I get a response on <a href="https://bizcommunity.att.com">https://bizcommunity.att.com</a>.</p>

<p>Hello reader, I’m another HN member trying to help get to the bottom of this! I’ve analyzed all the data provided and feel confident there is some kind of manipulation / throttling happening with Adriano’s AT&amp;T business plan, but if anyone wants to correct my interpretation or provide other insights feel free to reach out to me on my <a href="https://rasbora.dev/">blog</a>!</p>
<p>We start by analyzing the packet capture from the throttled connection. There are a few takeaways from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP segment &amp; window sizes have normal values.</li>
<li>There are almost no retransmissions or lost packets.</li>
<li>There appears to be ample room for the TCP stream to scale up to a much faster speed.</li>
<li>The TCP stream starts scaling up to 800Kbps before dramatically going down.</li>
<li>The TCP stream regularly blocks for 50-200ms intervals waiting for new data to arrive from cloudfront.</li>
<li>These blocks coincide with throughput scaling up to ~350Kbps.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</label>
</p>
<p>All of the spikes in round trip time correspond to a segment of the stream where the client acknowladges receipt of new data and is forced to wait 50-200ms for any new data to arrive. This happens at a regular cadence that appears artificial in nature (i.e not regular network congestion) because the throughput chart stays within a well defined boundary.</p>
<p>If this were a problem with AT&amp;T’s network or a side effect of LTE networks being inherently high latency we would expect to observe similair patterns over the iphone connection:</p>
<p>

<label for="zoomCheck-07ed4">
  <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://adriano.fyi/img/iphone_rtt.png" alt="iphone RTT" title="iphone RTT"/>
</label>
</p>
<p>We can draw a few conclusions from these charts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The iphone AT&amp;T connection doesn’t exhibit the same RTT or throughput pattern despite having similair latency &amp; network routing.</li>
<li>The throughput chart is indicative of a healthy TCP stream that slowly scales up the total bandwidth to make the most out of available network resources.</li>
<li>We are never waiting very long for fresh data to arrive.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion these patterns rule out any extraneous factors affecting the network and are indicative of intentional manipulation of the TCP stream. If AT&amp;T were to occasionaly drop an incoming packet than the client would never send an acknowledgement to cloudfront and after a little while cloudfront would automatically retransmit that packet, on our client side packet capture we would observe this as a packet coming in with a big delay, if we were being rate limited we would expect to see these delayed packets coming in regularly around the time when we were starting to hit a threshold, it seems likely AT&amp;T is dropping certain inbound packets once the incoming rate reaches around ~350Kbps.</p>

<p>URL (was public): <a href="https://bizcommunity.att.com/conversations/the-break-room/im-apparently-experiencing-extremely-aggressive-att-traffic-shaping/643c3d81aba4c269accb1a2b">https://bizcommunity.att.com/conversations/the-break-room/im-apparently-experiencing-extremely-aggressive-att-traffic-shaping/643c3d81aba4c269accb1a2b</a></p>
<p>The short of it is that I’m experiencing what appears to be aggressive traffic shaping by AT&amp;T. Many sites are affected, because Cloudflare is one content delivery network for which AT&amp;T is apparently shaping my traffic.</p>
<p>This is a business account.  I have both cell phone devices and a data-only plan “Wireless Broadband Ultra for Router or Hotspt  (sic)” on the account. Only the data-only plan is affected.</p>
<p>Because Cloudflare is such a large content delivery network, this affects millions of websites. A large percentage of the websites I’ve accessed over the last few days have been affected, forcing me to use a VPN to subvert the problem.</p>
<p>I’ve added more concrete data in a writeup on my personal website: <a href="https://adriano.fyi/post/2023/2023-04-16-att-traffic-shaping-makes-websites-unusable">https://adriano.fyi/post/2023/2023-04-16-att-traffic-shaping-makes-websites-unusable</a></p>
<p>The data paint a fairly clear picture of traffic shaping.</p>
<p>[ GIF IMAGE FROM ABOVE HERE ]
[ NOTE: web-assets.strava.com resolves to Cloudflare, see the writeup on my site for details ]</p>
<p>I’d love to get a response from AT&amp;T on the matter because this is a major performance degradation to the point that many websites are unusable. Is anyone else experiencing similar issues?</p>

<p>This ended with the least satisfying end one could expect. Over on Hacker News <code>kevin_nisbet</code> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35595891">recommended changing the APN</a> on the device to see if there were any routing differences. I changed the APN to <code>NXTGENPHONE</code>, which I figured would work as a “generic LTE device”, per <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1062162/">https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1062162/</a>. However, the router was not able to authenticate with the <code>NXTGENPHONE</code> APN, so I switched back to <code>broadband</code>.</p>
<p>After switching back and re-authenticating with the <code>broadband</code> APN, I’m no longer being throttled.</p>
<p>I’ll keep monitoring for future throttling and add any responses from the <code>bizcommunity</code> admins.</p>
<p>For now, we’re done here.</p>

I’m not sure that this new host list is in any way related to this being “post-incident”. Cloudflare runs a lot of POPs, and I’m not about to try to understand the interplay between my resolver <code>1.1.1.1</code> and Cloudflare’s global DNS. It’s notable, in any case.</p>

<p>For reference, these are the host from “during the incident”. I can’t say with 100% certainty, but I believe I was using <code>1.1.1.1</code> as a resolver at the time, and whether I was connected via iphone tether or LTE router, I received the same host list:</p>
