    <h1>Setting the Business Expertise Series Free</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/06/setting_business_expertise_series_free.jpg" alt="Setting the Business Expertise Series Free"><p>I have two announcements today.</p><p>The first requires a wee bit of setup. About two years ago, I stumbled onto Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) researcher Lia DiBello&#x2019;s work on the expertise of business. A summary of her findings was tucked away in a chapter of <em><a href="https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/34285">The Oxford Handbook of Expertise</a></em>, which I&#x2019;d bought on a lark. And what DiBello and her collaborators had discovered was extremely compelling: all good businesspeople, regardless of industry, <em>share the same mental model of business</em>. Sure, the specifics of this model vary from industry to industry, but the structure of the expertise <em>remains the same</em>.</p><p>For anyone who is familiar with the NDM approach to expertise, this should set off alarm bells in your head. Having an explicated model of expertise is <em>extremely</em> useful: for starters, it means that you may use the model as a guide for training, or perhaps for self improvement. (NDM researchers routinely use extracted tacit models of expertise to construct simulations, in order to <a href="https://commoncog.com/accelerated-expertise/">accelerate expertise</a>). But the model is useful in other ways: for instance, if you know what business expertise <em>looks like</em>, you can recognise when someone is good at business, and perhaps identify when they are not.</p><p>I dug into the majority of her work in the members-only <a href="https://commoncog.com/business-expertise-series/">Business Expertise Series</a> over the course of 2021. I reserved that writing for members, mostly because I thought it was such a powerful tool. But as of yesterday, I&#x2019;ve removed the paywall; the series is now free for everyone to read.</p><p>Why did I do so? The short answer is that I want to organise much of Commoncog around DiBello&#x2019;s model of business expertise; in order to do so I need readers to be familiar with the model. This leads me to my second announcement.</p><p>Commoncog has two new &#x2018;topic overview&#x2019; pages: one for <a href="https://commoncog.com/business-expertise/">Business Expertise</a>, and one for <a href="https://commoncog.com/expertise/">Expertise</a> in general. The Business Expertise page explains DiBello&#x2019;s findings, and then links out to the three legs of the business expertise triad: <a href="https://commoncog.com/supply/">Supply</a>, <a href="https://commoncog.com/demand/">Demand</a> and <a href="https://commoncog.com/capital/">Capital</a>. You may visualise it somewhat with the following hierarchy:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class="topic-container">
    <h3 id="bexpertise-hdr"><a href="https://commoncog.com/business-expertise" class="tpheader tpheader__general">Business Expertise&#x2192;</a></h3>
    <p>Commoncog&apos;s approach to business expertise is built on a extracted mental model of business expertise. Read on to learn what that means.</p>
    
    <div class="topic-container">
    <h3 id="supply-hdr"><a href="https://commoncog.com/supply" class="tpheader tpheader__supply">Supply&#x2192;</a></h3>
    <p>Articles related to running your business better. This broadly covers org design, better management, operational rigour, becoming data driven and related topics.</p>

    <p>Commoncog&apos;s approach to expertise acceleration is to look at the best research methods known to us today, and then to test these methods through in practice.</p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>With this redesign, Commoncog&#x2019;s site organisation is hopefully more coherent; you should be able to see the site&#x2019;s themes the way I see it when I&#x2019;m writing or investigating particular aspects of business expertise. I also plan to update the topic overviews over time. This way, readers should always be able to reorient themselves in the topic landscape when catching up on Commoncog&#x2019;s latest posts (or so I hope!)</p><p>There is one minor, final change. Individual Commoncog posts will now have a banner up top, indicating which topic cluster the article belongs to. Not every article will have a banner, mind &#x2014; most of Commoncog&#x2019;s early essays do not belong to any of the above topic clusters. But nearly all recent publications belong to one or more of the above topics; you should see a variety of colours as you browse.</p><p>Why is this so important to highlight? The truth is that DiBello&#x2019;s work has been a huge influence on this blog. Discovering her work and researching that series changed the direction of my writing over the course of 2021. About a year later, at the end of 2022, I <a href="https://commoncog.com/2022-commoncog-recap/">wrote</a> that Commoncog&#x2019;s writing has now solidified around a) business expertise, and b) training methods to <em>accelerate</em> the acquisition of that expertise. And indeed this has been the case. You can sort of squint and see the direction of my obsession with my summary of <em><a href="https://commoncog.com/accelerated-expertise/">Accelerated Expertise</a></em>, which in turn led to my digging into <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-hard-thing-about-learning-from-experience/">Cognitive Transformation Theory</a> (how experts learn from trial and error), and more recently my deep dive into <a href="https://commoncog.com/learning-ill-structured-domains-series/">Cognitive Flexibility Theory</a> (why experts in ill-structured domains reason from cases instead of abstract frameworks). DiBello&#x2019;s work has also indirectly resulted in my experiments with the <a href="https://commoncog.com/caselib/">Commoncog Case Library</a>, and has played a small part in my <a href="https://commoncog.com/expertise-acceleration-experiment-judo/">experiments with deliberate practice</a>. Finally, nearly everything I&#x2019;ve written about business in the past two years has slotted in neatly with DiBello&#x2019;s <a href="https://commoncog.com/business-expertise/#the-triad">triad mental model</a> of business expertise.</p><p>So it&#x2019;s time to set that original series free.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll have more updates to announce regarding Commoncog&#x2019;s offerings soon. But as a short teaser:</p><ul><li>I&#x2019;m wrapping up the <a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/">Becoming Data Driven Series</a> &#x2014; before going into an enforced break as I put the ideas in the series to practice.</li><li>I&#x2019;m starting work on the next phase of the <a href="https://commoncog.com/caselib/">Commoncog Case Library</a>.</li><li>I&#x2019;ll spend a small amount of time writing on the conglomerates question that I promised in my <a href="https://commoncog.com/2022-commoncog-recap/">2022 recap</a>.</li></ul><p>See you soon.</p>
