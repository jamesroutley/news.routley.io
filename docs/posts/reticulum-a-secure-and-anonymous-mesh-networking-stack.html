<p dir="auto"><em>This repository is <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/blob/master/MIRROR.md">a public mirror</a>. All development is happening elsewhere.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">To understand the foundational philosophy and goals of this system, read the <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/blob/master/Zen%20of%20Reticulum.md">Zen of Reticulum</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reticulum is the cryptography-based networking stack for building local and wide-area
networks with readily available hardware. It can operate even with very high latency
and extremely low bandwidth. Reticulum allows you to build wide-area networks
with off-the-shelf tools, and offers end-to-end encryption and connectivity,
initiator anonymity, autoconfiguring cryptographically backed multi-hop
transport, efficient addressing, unforgeable delivery acknowledgements and
more.</p>
<p dir="auto">The vision of Reticulum is to allow anyone to be their own network operator,
and to make it cheap and easy to cover vast areas with a myriad of independent,
inter-connectable and autonomous networks. Reticulum <strong>is not</strong> <em>one</em> network.
It is <strong>a tool</strong> for building <em>thousands of networks</em>. Networks without
kill-switches, surveillance, censorship and control. Networks that can freely
interoperate, associate and disassociate with each other, and require no
central oversight. Networks for human beings. <em>Networks for the people</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reticulum is a complete networking stack, and does not rely on IP or higher
layers, but it is possible to use IP as the underlying carrier for Reticulum.
It is therefore trivial to tunnel Reticulum over the Internet or private IP
networks.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having no dependencies on traditional networking stacks frees up overhead that
has been used to implement a networking stack built directly on cryptographic
principles, allowing resilience and stable functionality, even in open and
trustless networks.</p>
<p dir="auto">No kernel modules or drivers are required. Reticulum runs completely in
userland, and can run on practically any system that runs Python 3.</p>

<p dir="auto">The full documentation for Reticulum is available at <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/" rel="nofollow">markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Python code in this repository is the Reference Implementation of Reticulum.
The Reticulum Protocol is defined entirely and authoritatively by this reference
implementation, and its associated manual. It is maintained by Mark Qvist,
identified by the Reticulum Identity <code>&lt;bc7291552be7a58f361522990465165c&gt;</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compatibility with the Reticulum Protocol is defined as having full interoperability,
and sufficient functional parity with this reference implementation. Any specific protocol
implementation that achieves this is Reticulum. Any that does not is not Reticulum.</p>
<p dir="auto">The reference implementation is licensed under the Reticulum License.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Reticulum Protocol was dedicated to the Public Domain in 2016.</p>

<p dir="auto">Over practically any medium that can support at least a half-duplex channel
with greater throughput than 5 bits per second, and an MTU of 500 bytes. Data radios,
modems, LoRa radios, serial lines, AX.25 TNCs, amateur radio digital modes,
WiFi and Ethernet devices, free-space optical links, and similar systems are
all examples of the types of physical devices Reticulum can use.</p>
<p dir="auto">An open-source LoRa-based interface called
<a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/hardware.html#rnode" rel="nofollow">RNode</a> has
been designed specifically for use with Reticulum. It is possible to build
yourself, or it can be purchased as a complete transceiver that just needs a
USB connection to the host.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reticulum can also be encapsulated over existing IP networks, so there&#39;s
nothing stopping you from using it over wired Ethernet, your local WiFi network
or the Internet, where it&#39;ll work just as well. In fact, one of the strengths
of Reticulum is how easily it allows you to connect different mediums into a
self-configuring, resilient and encrypted mesh, using any available mixture of
available infrastructure.</p>
<p dir="auto">As an example, it&#39;s possible to set up a Raspberry Pi connected to both a LoRa
radio, a packet radio TNC and a WiFi network. Once the interfaces are
configured, Reticulum will take care of the rest, and any device on the WiFi
network can communicate with nodes on the LoRa and packet radio sides of the
network, and vice versa.</p>

<p dir="auto">The best way to get started with the Reticulum Network Stack depends on what
you want to do. For full details and examples, have a look at the
<a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/gettingstartedfast.html" rel="nofollow">Getting Started Fast</a>
section of the <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/" rel="nofollow">Reticulum Manual</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To simply install Reticulum and related utilities on your system, the easiest way is via <code>pip</code>.
You can then start any program that uses Reticulum, or start Reticulum as a system service with
<a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/using.html#the-rnsd-utility" rel="nofollow">the rnsd utility</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you are using an operating system that blocks normal user package installation via <code>pip</code>,
you can return <code>pip</code> to normal behaviour by editing the <code>~/.config/pip/pip.conf</code> file,
and adding the following directive in the <code>[global]</code> section:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[global]
break-system-packages = true"><pre lang="text"><code>[global]
break-system-packages = true
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can use the <code>pipx</code> tool to install Reticulum in an isolated environment:</p>

<p dir="auto">When first started, Reticulum will create a default configuration file,
providing basic connectivity to other Reticulum peers that might be locally
reachable. The default config file contains a few examples, and references for
creating a more complex configuration.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have an old version of <code>pip</code> on your system, you may need to upgrade it first with <code>pip install pip --upgrade</code>. If you no not already have <code>pip</code> installed, you can install it using the package manager of your system with <code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code> or similar.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more detailed examples on how to expand communication over many mediums such
as packet radio or LoRa, serial ports, or over fast IP links and the Internet using
the UDP and TCP interfaces, take a look at the <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/interfaces.html" rel="nofollow">Supported Interfaces</a>
section of the <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/" rel="nofollow">Reticulum Manual</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Reticulum includes a range of useful utilities for managing your networks,
viewing status and information, and other tasks. You can read more about these
programs in the <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/using.html#included-utility-programs" rel="nofollow">Included Utility Programs</a>
section of the <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/" rel="nofollow">Reticulum Manual</a>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The system daemon <code>rnsd</code> for running Reticulum as an always-available service</li>
<li>An interface status utility called <code>rnstatus</code>, that displays information about interfaces</li>
<li>The path lookup and management tool <code>rnpath</code> letting you view and modify path tables</li>
<li>A diagnostics tool called <code>rnprobe</code> for checking connectivity to destinations</li>
<li>A simple file transfer program called <code>rncp</code> making it easy to transfer files between systems</li>
<li>The identity management and encryption utility <code>rnid</code> let&#39;s you manage Identities and encrypt/decrypt files</li>
<li>The remote command execution program <code>rnx</code> let&#39;s you run commands and
programs and retrieve output from remote systems</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All tools, including <code>rnx</code> and <code>rncp</code>, work reliably and well even over very
low-bandwidth links like LoRa or Packet Radio. For full-featured remote shells
over Reticulum, also have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/acehoss/rnsh">rnsh</a>
program.</p>

<p dir="auto">Reticulum implements a range of generalised interface types that covers most of
the communications hardware that Reticulum can run over. If your hardware is
not supported, it&#39;s <a href="https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/interfaces.html#custom-interfaces" rel="nofollow">simple to implement a custom interface module</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Pull requests for custom interfaces are gratefully accepted, provided they are
generally useful and well-tested in real-world usage.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, the following built-in interfaces are supported:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Any Ethernet device</li>
<li>LoRa using <a href="https://unsigned.io/rnode/" rel="nofollow">RNode</a></li>
<li>Packet Radio TNCs (with or without AX.25)</li>
<li>KISS-compatible hardware and software modems</li>
<li>Any device with a serial port</li>
<li>TCP over IP networks</li>
<li>UDP over IP networks</li>
<li>External programs via stdio or pipes</li>
<li>Custom hardware via stdio or pipes</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Reticulum targets a <em>very</em> wide usable performance envelope, but prioritises
functionality and performance on low-bandwidth mediums. The goal is to
provide a dynamic performance envelope from 250 bits per second, to 1 gigabit
per second on normal hardware.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, the usable performance envelope is approximately 150 bits per second
to 500 megabits per second, with physical mediums faster than that not being
saturated. Performance beyond the current level is intended for future
upgrades, but not highly prioritised at this point in time.</p>

<p dir="auto">All core protocol features are implemented and functioning, but additions will
probably occur as real-world use is explored and understood. The API and wire-format
can be considered stable.</p>

<p dir="auto">The installation of the default <code>rns</code> package requires the dependencies listed
below. Almost all systems and distributions have readily available packages for
these dependencies, and when the <code>rns</code> package is installed with <code>pip</code>, they
will be downloaded and installed as well.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography">PyCA/cryptography</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial">pyserial</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On more unusual systems, and in some rare cases, it might not be possible to
install or even compile one or more of the above modules. In such situations,
you can use the <code>rnspure</code> package instead, which require no external
dependencies for installation. Please note that the contents of the <code>rns</code> and
<code>rnspure</code> packages are <em>identical</em>. The only difference is that the <code>rnspure</code>
package lists no dependencies required for installation.</p>
<p dir="auto">No matter how Reticulum is installed and started, it will load external
dependencies only if they are <em>needed</em> and <em>available</em>. If for example you want
to use Reticulum on a system that cannot support
<a href="https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial">pyserial</a>, it is perfectly possible to
do so using the <code>rnspure</code> package, but Reticulum will not be able to use
serial-based interfaces. All other available modules will still be loaded when
needed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please Note!</strong> If you use the <code>rnspure</code> package to run Reticulum on systems
that do not support <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography">PyCA/cryptography</a>,
it is important that you read and understand the <a href="#cryptographic-primitives">Cryptographic
Primitives</a> section of this document.</p>

<p dir="auto">Reticulum is not a service you subscribe to, nor is it a single global network you &#34;join&#34;.
Reticulum itself provides functionality for discovering available public interfaces
over the network itself, and the broader community has provided various directories
of publicly available entrypoints to bootstrap connectivity.</p>
<p dir="auto">To learn how to establish initial connectivity over Reticulum, read the <a href="https://reticulum.network/manual/gettingstartedfast.html#bootstrapping-connectivity" rel="nofollow">Bootstrapping Connectivity</a> section of the manual.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you already have a general idea of how this works, you can use community-run
sites such as <a href="https://directory.rns.recipes/" rel="nofollow">directory.rns.recipes</a> and <a href="https://rmap.world" rel="nofollow">rmap.world</a>
to find interface definitions for initial connectivity to the global distributed Reticulum backbone.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Important!</strong> Historically, a developer-targeted testnet was made available by the Reticulum project itself. As the amount of global Reticulum nodes and entrypoints have grown to a substantial quantity, this public testnet, including the Amsterdam Testnet entrypoint, is slated for de-commisioning in the first quarter of 2026. If your own instances rely on this entrypoint for connectivity, it is high time to start configuring alternatives. Reticulum now includes a full on-network interface discovery and connectivity bootstrapping system. Read the <a href="https://reticulum.network/manual/gettingstartedfast.html#bootstrapping-connectivity" rel="nofollow">Bootstrapping Connectivity</a> section of the manual for pointers.</em></p>

<p dir="auto">Reticulum uses a simple suite of efficient, strong and well-tested cryptographic
primitives, with widely available implementations that can be used both on
general-purpose CPUs and on microcontrollers.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the primary considerations for choosing this particular set of primitives is
that they can be implemented <em>safely</em> with relatively few pitfalls, on practically
all current computing platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">The primitives listed here <strong>are authoritative</strong>. Anything claiming to be Reticulum,
but not using these exact primitives <strong>is not</strong> Reticulum, and possibly an
intentionally compromised or weakened clone. The utilised primitives are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Reticulum Identity Keys are 512-bit Curve25519 keysets
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A 256-bit Ed25519 key for signatures</li>
<li>A 256-bit X22519 key for ECDH key exchanges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HKDF for key derivation</li>
<li>Encrypted tokens are based on the <a href="https://github.com/fernet/spec/">Fernet spec</a>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Ephemeral keys derived from an ECDH key exchange on Curve25519</li>
<li>HMAC using SHA256 for message authentication</li>
<li>IVs must be generated through <code>os.urandom()</code> or better</li>
<li>AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding</li>
<li>No Fernet version and timestamp metadata fields</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SHA-256</li>
<li>SHA-512</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In the default installation configuration, the <code>X25519</code>, <code>Ed25519</code>,
and <code>AES-256-CBC</code> primitives are provided by <a href="https://www.openssl.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenSSL</a>
(via the <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography">PyCA/cryptography</a> package).
The hashing functions <code>SHA-256</code> and <code>SHA-512</code> are provided by the standard
Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html" rel="nofollow">hashlib</a>. The <code>HKDF</code>,
<code>HMAC</code>, <code>Token</code> primitives, and the <code>PKCS7</code> padding function are always
provided by the following internal implementations:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/blob/master/RNS/Cryptography/HKDF.py">HKDF.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/blob/master/RNS/Cryptography/HMAC.py">HMAC.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/blob/master/RNS/Cryptography/Token.py">Token.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/blob/master/RNS/Cryptography/PKCS7.py">PKCS7.py</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Reticulum also includes a complete implementation of all necessary primitives
in pure Python. If OpenSSL and PyCA are not available on the system when
Reticulum is started, Reticulum will instead use the internal pure-python
primitives. A trivial consequence of this is performance, with the OpenSSL
backend being <em>much</em> faster. The most important consequence however, is the
potential loss of security by using primitives that has not seen the same
amount of scrutiny, testing and review as those from OpenSSL.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that by default, installing Reticulum will <strong>require</strong> OpenSSL and
PyCA to also be automatically installed if not already available. It is only
possible to use the pure-python primitives if this requirement is specifically
overridden by the user, for example by installing the <code>rnspure</code> package instead
of the normal <code>rns</code> package, or by running directly from local source-code.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use the internal pure-python primitives, it is <strong>highly
advisable</strong> that you have a good understanding of the risks that this pose, and
make an informed decision on whether those risks are acceptable to you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reticulum is relatively young software, and should be considered as such. While
it has been built with cryptography best-practices very foremost in mind, it
<em>has not</em> been externally security audited, and there could very well be
privacy or security breaking bugs. If you want to help out, or help sponsor an
audit, please do get in touch.</p>

<p dir="auto">Reticulum can only exist because of the mountain of Open Source work it was
built on top of, the contributions of everyone involved, and everyone that has
supported the project through the years. To everyone who has helped, thank you
so much.</p>
<p dir="auto">A number of other modules and projects are either part of, or used by
Reticulum. Sincere thanks to the authors and contributors of the following
