    <h1>Chinese Tech Terms Explained in English</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>
              Chinese tech companies like ByteDance and Tencent are setting up
              engineering offices outside China. Local hires in these global
              offices are becoming a norm.
            </p>
            <p>
              These locally hired engineers typically have limited Chinese
              language proficiency. It is a challenge for them to understand the
              Chinese tech terms used in their daily work, and to communicate
              with their Chinese colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are 5 common Chinese tech terms, along with explanations and
              examples of usage in a sentence.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Huidu is a widely used Chinese technical term in companies like
              Tencent and Alibaba. Huidu means rolling out experimental new
              features to a small subset of users for testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The implication of huidu is that the new feature may be launched
              officially (at a later date), or scrapped if it did not have the
              desired outcome.
            </p>
            <h2 id="huidu-in-english">Huidu in English</h2>
            <p>
              The literal translation of huidu is “grayscale”. Intuitively,
              huidu represents the transition state between black and white.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that huidu can be used to describe product features,
              functionalities, or code deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When describing a product feature, the close equivalent would be
              <strong>beta release</strong> or
              <strong>phased rollout</strong> in English.
            </p>
            <p>
              When used for describe code deployment,
              <strong>canary release</strong> is also an accurate translation.

            </p>
            <p>
              Lunzi describes tools, libraries or frameworks that have been
              invented or reinvented multiple times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically it is used for new things that are created to solve a
              specific problem, but bear resemblance to something existing.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lunzi-in-english">Lunzi in English</h2>
            <p>
              The literal translation for lunzi is “wheel”, and the origin of
              the word is likely from the English phrase “reinvent the wheel”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the apparent origin from English, lunzi as a word has no
              equivalent translation in English.
            </p>
            <p>
              The literal translation “<strong>wheel</strong>” might be the best
              candidate.

            </p>
            <p>
              Chendian is not a technical term, but it is commonly used in
              Chinese tech companies. It means consolidating learnings from past
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also implies coming up with a systematic solution to a
              recurring problem.
            </p>
            <h2 id="chendian-in-english">Chendian in English</h2>
            <p>
              The literal translation for chendian is “chemical precipitation”,
              drawing from the intuition that things are consolidated from
              liquid form to solid state.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the beginning, things are messy and fluid. But as you learn and
              progress, they because more clear and structured.
            </p>
            <p>
              There seems to be no equivalent term in English to describe this
              concept.

            </p>
            <p>
              In Chinese tech companies, dapan is used to describe dashboards
              with various charts, where you can monitor key system metrics or
              business metrics in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is especially important for e-commerce companies like Alibaba
              and JD who run big sales events like double 11.

            <h2 id="dapan-in-english">Dapan in English</h2>
            <p>
              Dapan originally refers to the big screens in stock exchanges
              showing market data.
            </p>
            <p>
              The close equivalent of dapan in English would be “<strong>monitoring dashboard</strong>”.

              <img src="https://16x.engineer/public/post-images/optimized/chinese-maidian.webp" alt="Maidian in English example screenshot"/>
            </p>
            <p>
              In Chinese companies, maidian refers to embedding of tracking code
              to monitor and analyse user behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is typically required by product and data analytics teams,
              and the tracking code is embedded in the product by front-end
              engineers.
            </p>
            <h2 id="maidian-in-english">Maidian in English</h2>
            <p>
              As individual characters, “mai” means burying, and “dian” means
              points. The phrase “maidian” literally means “embedding points” or
              “burying seeds”.
            </p>
            <p>
              The intuition is that by “embedding” the “seed” in the product,
              the user journey can be mapped out later.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can be translated into <strong>tracking</strong>,
              <strong>tagging</strong> or
              <strong>user data analytics</strong> depending on the context.
            </p>
