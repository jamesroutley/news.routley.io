Can you tell me a bit about your experience working with Elon and your thoughts on him as a person and a leader?”</p><p>“<strong>It’s definitely been an interesting experience working with Elon</strong>, he’s definitely a very intelligent and driven person and he has a lot of great ideas and insights, he’s definitely someone who is always thinking about the future and how to make the world a better place and I really respect that about him,” the fake Altman responds.</p><p>“At the same time, he’s also someone who is very passionate about his beliefs and ideals and he’s not afraid to speak his mind and challenge the status quo. That can definitely be both a strength and a weakness depending on the situation,” the AI-generated Altman continues.</p></div><p>Loading...</p></div>
