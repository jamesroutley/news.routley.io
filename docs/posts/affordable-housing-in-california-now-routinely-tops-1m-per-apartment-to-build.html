When completed, they will provide homes for more than 600 families.</p><p>But their exorbitant price tags mean that taxpayers are subsidizing fewer apartments than they otherwise could <a href="https://nlihc.org/housing-needs-by-state/california" target="_blank">while waiting lists of renters needing affordable housing continue to grow</a>. </p><p>“That is untenable,” said Assemblyman Tim Grayson (D-Concord), who is writing legislation aimed at simplifying state affordable housing financing. “That is not a sustainable model. We have got to do something to reduce the cost.”</p><p>A key driver of the increases is labor and material prices, which have soared because of  inflation, supply-chain problems and worker shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The complex has a two-level underground parking garage and the highest level of environmental certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, and developers will pay construction workers union-level wages. San Jose officials also wanted commercial space included in the project, which required more parking and a separate elevator, Morgan said.</p><p>The project additionally struggled to get financing through the state’s affordable housing system and is relying on six government funding sources to pay for its construction.</p><p>The Terner Center <u><a href="https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/LIHTC_Construction_Costs_March_2020.pdf" target="_blank">study on the cost to build low-income housing</a></u> found that projects paying union-level wages to construction workers could cost $50,000 more per apartment and those built to stricter environmental standards cost $17,000 more per apartment than those that aren’t.

This year’s budget includes a record $17 billion for housing and homelessness programs, including $1.75 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds to finance proposed low-income developments that had stalled before breaking ground. Five of the 27 developments funded so far through that program are among those that cost more than $1 million per apartment to build. </p><p>The governor’s office declined an interview request.

In response to written questions from The Times, Ma said she opposed Grayson’s bill, which would diminish her power over the financing process, calling the effort “overly simplistic.”</p><p>“Bureaucratic structures are the least of California’s problems,” Ma said. “Streamlining local government land-use approvals and federal tax law constraints is the more effective approach.”</p><p>Ma said that the agencies under her control prioritize cost concerns when handing out funding and that land values and inflation have driven recent increases. </p><p>During the pandemic, developers have had to contend with historic surges in material and labor prices. Those costs have gone up nearly 30% since February 2020, according to <u><a href="https://www.dgs.ca.gov/RESD/Resources/Page-Content/Real-Estate-Services-Division-Resources-List-Folder/DGS-California-Construction-Cost-Index-CCCI" target="_blank">the state’s California Construction Cost Index</a></u>. Last year’s 13.4% annual increase was the highest since the index began tracking costs more than a quarter-century ago. This year’s cost escalations are on pace to exceed that amount.</p><p>“What really hit people was in the beginning of the year, all of a sudden within a few months, we had a 15% increase,” said Morgan, the developer in San Jose. “That was crazy. I’ve never seen that in my career, and I’ve been doing this for over 20 years.”</p><p>Others blame high building costs on the historic lack of investment in low-income housing. </p><p>The three San Francisco projects costing more than $1 million per apartment will rebuild 310 units from the city’s public housing stock, which has deteriorated over decades. Included in the total are the millions developers must spend to temporarily relocate existing tenants during construction. So is the value of the existing properties, even though, in these cases, they’re publicly owned. </p><p>But the projects’ price tags also encompass layers of city requirements for affordable housing that go beyond the state’s, such as some mandates to include public art, increase access for people with disabilities and hire local construction workers, including those from disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p><p>“Each of these issues has its own constituency and has its own advocacy and its own social benefit,” said Lydia Ely, a top San Francisco housing official. “Each one on its own is worthy, and added up all together, they start to make an impact.”</p><p>Though the price tag for low-income housing in Greater Los Angeles has not reached $1 million per apartment, it’s also rising. One 79-unit development under construction in Hollywood is costing  nearly $848,000 per apartment to build, the highest on record of state-funded projects in the region.</p><p>These cost escalations show no signs of abating. Besides the seven projects already funded  at more than $1 million per apartment, half a dozen other proposed projects identified by The Times across the Bay Area also eclipse that amount.</p></div></div> </div></div>
