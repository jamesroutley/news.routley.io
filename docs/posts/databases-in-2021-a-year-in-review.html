    <h1>Databases in 2021: A Year in Review</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was a wild year for the database industry, with newcomers overtaking the old guard, <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo/status/1460429162741645330">vendors fighting</a> over benchmark numbers, and eye-popping funding rounds. We also had to say goodbye to some of our database friends through acquisitions, bankruptcies, or retractions.</p><p>As the end of the year draws near, it’s worth reflecting and taking stock as we move into 2022. Here are some of the highlights and a few of my thoughts on what they might mean for the field of databases.</p><h2>Dominance of PostgreSQL</h2><p>The conventional wisdom among developers has shifted: PostgreSQL has become the first choice in new applications. It is reliable. It has many features and keeps adding more. In 2010, the PostgreSQL development team switched to a more aggressive release schedule to put out a new major version once per year (H/T <a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzycz/status/1475956928295673857">Tomas Vondra</a>). And of course PostgreSQL is open-source.</p><p>PostgreSQL <a href="https://dbdb.io/browse?compatible=postgresql">compatibility</a> is a distinguishing feature for a lot of systems now. Such compatibility is achieved by supporting PostgreSQL’s SQL dialect (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24531606">DuckDB</a>), wire protocol (<a href="https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/postgres">QuestDB</a>, <a href="https://databasearchitects.blogspot.com/2015/04/using-hyper-with-postgresql-drivers.html">HyPer</a>), or the entire front-end (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/introducing-the-aurora-storage-engine/">Amazon Aurora</a>, <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/api/ysql/">YugaByte</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowbrick_Data">Yellowbrick</a>). The big players have jumped on board. Google announced in October that they added <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/10/cloud-spanner-postgresql/">PostgreSQL compatibility in Cloud Spanner</a>. Also in October, Amazon announced the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/10/babelfish-aurora-postgresql-now-generally-available/">Babelfish</a> feature for converting SQL Server queries into Aurora PostgreSQL.</p><p>One measurement of the popularity of a database is the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/">DB-Engine rankings</a>. This ranking is not perfect and the score is somewhat subjective, but it’s a reasonable approximation for the top 10 systems. As of December 2021, the ranking shows that while PostgreSQL remains the fourth most popular database (after Oracle, MySQL, and MSSQL), it reduced the gap with MSSQL in the past year.</p><p>Another trend to consider is how often PostgreSQL is mentioned in online communities. This gives another signal for what people are talking about in databases. I downloaded all of the 2021 comments made on the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/database/">Database Subreddit</a> and counted the frequency of database names (in PostgreSQL of course). I cross-referenced the list of every database that I know about from my <a href="https://dbdb.io/">Database of Databases</a>, cleaned up abbreviations (e.g., Postgres → PostgreSQL, Mongo → MongoDB, ES → Elasticsearch), and then calculated the top 10 most-mentioned DBMS:</p><pre>     dbms      | cnt 
---------------+-----
 PostgreSQL    | 656
 MySQL         | 317
 MongoDB       | 266
 Oracle        | 222
 SQLite        | 213
 Redis         |  88
 Elasticsearch |  70
 Snowflake     |  52
 DGraph        |  46
 Neo4j         |  42
</pre><p>Of course this ranking is not scientific, since I am not doing sentiment analysis on the comments. But it clearly shows that people are mentioning Postgres more than other systems in the past year. There are often posts from developers asking what DBMS to use for their new application, and the response from the community is almost always Postgres.</p><h4><img loading="lazy" src="https://ottertune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pavlo-head-sideview-lomo.png" alt="" width="32" height="40"/> Andy’s Take:</h4><p> Foremost, it is a good thing that a relational database system has become the first choice in greenfield applications. This shows the staying power of Ted Codd’s relational model from the 1970s. Second, PostgreSQL is a great database system. Yes, it has known issues and dark corners, as does every DBMS. But with so much attention and energy focused on it, PostgreSQL is only going to get better over the years.</p><h2>Benchmark Violence</h2><p>There’s no love lost between different database vendors this year over benchmark results. Vendors trying to show that their system is faster than their competitors’ goes back to the late 1980s. That’s why <a href="http://tpc.org/">TPC</a> was set up to provide a non-partisan forum for officiating over comparisons. But as the influence and prevalence of TPC has <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo/status/1461164543825129481">waned over the last decade</a>, we now find ourselves in a new round of database benchmark wars.</p><p>There were three major street battles that heated up this year over benchmark results.</p><ul><li> <strong>Databricks vs. Snowflake</strong></li><li> <strong>Rockset vs. Apache Druid vs. ClickHouse</strong></li><li> <strong>ClickHouse vs. TimescaleDB</strong></li></ul><h4><img loading="lazy" src="https://ottertune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pavlo-head-sideview-lomo.png" alt="" width="32" height="40"/> Andy’s Take:</h4><p>Too much blood has been shed in the database community in previous benchmark turf wars [<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/high-performance-benchmarking-mongodb-and-nosql-systems">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2011/02/28/is-voltdb-really-as-scalable-as-they-claim/">2</a>] [<a href="https://youtu.be/-TIUGC4X2q8?t=418">3</a>]. I fully admit that I <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo/status/296336208588595200">used to be in the game</a>. But I’ve lost too many friends in the streets. I even broke up with a girlfriend once because of sloppy benchmark results. As I’ve gotten older, I can now say that it’s not worth it. It’s even harder now to compare systems because cloud DBMSs have so many moving parts and tunable options that it is often difficult to ascertain the real reasons for performance differences. Real applications also do more than just run the same queries one after another. The user experience when ingesting, transforming, and cleaning data can matter as much as raw performance numbers. And as I told the reporter <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/databricks-snowflake-data-warehouse-tpc">in this article about Databricks’ benchmarks results</a>, only old people care about official TPC numbers.</p><h2>Big Data, Big Money</h2><p>The number of venture rounds worth at least $100 million has been steadily increasing since the second half of 2020. There were 327 of these mega-deals in 2020 (just less than half of total VC deal volume). And as of January of 2021, there were <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/vc-trends">over 100 venture-backed investment rounds</a> worth $100 million or more.</p><p>A lot of that investment money was thrown at database companies in 2021. For operational databases, CockroachDB led the fundraising leaderboard by starting the year with a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/12/cockroachdb-creator-cockroach-labs-raises-160-million-at-a-2-billion-valuation/">$160m round</a> and then closed it off with raising another <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/news/press-release-series-f-funding/">$278m in December 2021</a>. Yugabyte got paid when they <a href="https://hrnxt.com/news/investment/yugabyte-closes-188-million-series-c-funding-round-bringing-valuation-to-over-1-3b/44702/2021/11/02/">raised a $188m Series C round</a>. PlanetScale pulled out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/planetscale-raises-30m-series-b-for-its-database-service/">$20m Series B</a> for their hosted version of <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a>. The comparatively older NoSQL stalwart DataStax, too, raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/datastax-series-unknown--75eb1d91">$37.6m in a venture round</a> for their Cassandra business.</p><p>As impressive as these amounts are, the analytical database market is even more heated. TileDB raised an <a href="https://tiledb.com/blog/lockheed-martin-ventures-and-ntt-docomo-ventures-invest-in-tiledb-inc-to-advance-their-universal-database-2021-09-29/">undisclosed amount</a> in September 2021. StarTree came out of stealth and announced its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apache-pinot-focused-startree-raises-24m-series-a/">$24m round</a> to commercialize Apache Pinot. Imply <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/16/data-analytics-startup-imply-nabs-70m-to-grow-cloud-service/">raised $70m</a> for database service based on Apache Druid. SingleStore <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/real-time-database-platform-singlestore-raises-80m-more-now-at-a-940m-valuation/">raised $80m</a> in September 2021, taking them one step closer to going IPO. At the beginning of the year, Starburst Data <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/starburst-data-hits-1-2-billion-valuation-as-andreessen-invests">raised $100m</a> for its Trino system (formerly PrestoSQL). Firebolt was another DBMS start-up coming out of stealth to announced that they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics/">raised $127m</a> for its new cloud data warehouse based on a fork of ClickHouse. A new company, ClickHouse, Inc., <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005287/en/ClickHouse-Raises-250M-Series-B-To-Scale-Groundbreaking-OLAP-Database-Management-System-Globally">raised a staggering $250m</a> to establish a new company around the system (as well as securing the rights to use the ClickHouse name from Yandex).</p><p>But the clear winner in the largest funding round this year was Databricks, who blew everyone else away by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">raising a whopping $1.6b</a> in August 2021.</p><h4><img loading="lazy" src="https://ottertune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pavlo-head-sideview-lomo.png" alt="" width="32" height="40"/> Andy’s Take:</h4><p>We are in the golden era of databases. There are so many excellent choices available today. Investors are searching for database start-ups that can become the next Snowflake-like IPO. These fundraising amounts are larger than previous database start-ups. For example, <a href="https://craft.co/snowflake-computing/funding-rounds">Snowflake did not have a round over $100m until its Series D</a>, which was five years into the company’s life. Starburst completed a $100m round within less than three years of its founding. Now there are a lot of factors involved in funding (e.g. the Starburst team was working on Presto at TeraData for years before spinning out), but I feel like more money is being thrown around these days.</p><h2>In Memoriam</h2><p>Regretfully, we said goodbye to some database friends in the past year.</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/servicenow-acquires-database-performance-company-swarm64/"><strong>ServiceNow acquired Swarm64</strong></a></li><li> <strong><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/26/splice_machine_insolvency/">Splice Machine went bust</a></strong></li><li> <strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-cd-r-near-deal-to-buy-cloudera-11622510459">Private equity firms bought Cloudera</a></strong></li></ul><h4><img loading="lazy" src="https://ottertune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pavlo-head-sideview-lomo.png" alt="" width="32" height="40"/> Andy’s Take:</h4><p>It’s always sad to see another database project or company go under, but that is the bloodsport nature of the database industry. Being open-source potentially helps a DBMS outlive the company that created it, but not always. Due to their complexity, databases require full-time crews working on them to fix bugs and add new features. Moving source code rights and control of a defunct DBMS to an open-source software foundation, like the <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a> or <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a>, does not mean that the project will be magically revived. For example, <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-joins-linux-foundation/">RethinkDB was donated to the Linux Foundation</a> after the <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-shutdown/">company went bust</a>, but from all appearances on Github they are dead in the water (few commits, PRs not getting merged). Another example of this happening include DeepDB: the company failed and created <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170502005138/en/Deep-Information-Sciences-Goes-Open-Source-Relaunches-as-Deep-Software-Foundation">their own non-profit foundation</a> for the code but nobody ever worked on it. I anticipate that there will be more database companies going under in the next year that are unable to compete with the major cloud vendors and the well-funded start-ups listed above.</p><h2>A Testament to Perseverance</h2><p>The pandemic has been a trying time for many. With so many terrible things being reported in the news, it is always good when an uplifting story happens. As many of you know, Oracle co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison">Larry Ellison</a> has been down on his luck in recent years. Back in 2015, Larry was feeling good about things because he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World&#39;s_Billionaires_2015">the 5th richest person in the world</a>. But the vicissitudes of life struck and Larry dropped down to a lowly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires#2018">10th place</a> in the 2018 billionaire ranking.</p><p>But this changed in December 2021 when Larry Ellison surpassed Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, rising in the ranks to become the 5th richest person in the world again. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/larry-ellison-is-now-richer-than-the-google-co-founders-page-and-brin.html">Larry Ellison made $16b in a single day</a> in December 2021, after Oracle’s stock had its second-highest increase in a single day over the last 20 years due to an announcement of better-than-expected corporate earnings. The news media are chalking it up to heightened confidence among investors that Oracle’s shift to the cloud is working.</p><h4><img loading="lazy" src="https://ottertune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pavlo-head-sideview-lomo.png" alt="" width="32" height="40"/> Andy’s Take:</h4><p>Larry and I go <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo/status/1164345071983976448">way back</a>, and this certainly is an heartwarming story for the database community and humanity as a whole. He might have been feeling a bit melancholy when he was down on his luck as just the 10th richest person in the world. But I am glad to see that he was able to pull himself out of the gutters and get back up in the listing where he belongs.</p><h2>Databases Are the Most Important Thing in My Life After My Family</h2><p>We’re looking forward to ushering in a bright new year. Databases is an industry of remarkable resilience and innovation, and we’re excited to be part of it.</p><p>Wishing you and your <a href="https://www.euclidlibrary.org/tickle/otters">romp</a> a healthy and happy 2022!</p><p>P.S.: Don’t forget to run <code>ANALYZE</code> over the holidays.</p></div></div>
