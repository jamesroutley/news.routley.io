In that eventuality, UBS would assume the first 5 billion francs, the federal government the next 9 billion francs, and UBS would assume any further losses, the government said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Switzerland&#39;s regulator FINMA said that there was a risk that Credit Suisse could have become &#34;illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action&#34;.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Credit Suisse Additional Tier 1 shares with a nominal value of around 16 billion francs ($17.2 billion) will be written down completely after the Swiss government provided support for UBS&#39; takeover of Credit Suisse, FINMA said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The 167-year-old Credit Suisse has been the biggest name ensnared in market turmoil unleashed by the recent collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, forcing it to tap $54 billion in central bank funding last week.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">&#34;With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,&#34; the Swiss central bank said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Authorities had been scrambling to rescue Credit Suisse, among the world&#39;s largest wealth managers, before financial markets reopened on Monday.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">UBS and Credit Suisse are both in a group of the 30 global systemically important banks watched closely by regulators, and Credit Suisse&#39;s failure would ripple throughout the entire financial system.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">The announcement came in a make-or-break weekend after some rivals grew cautious in their dealings with the struggling Swiss lender, and its regulators urged it to pursue a deal with UBS.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">FINMA, which said it had approved the takeover, said recent measures to stabilize itself were &#34;not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The two banks&#39; fortunes have diverged sharply over the past year. UBS earned $7.6 billion in profit in 2022, while Credit Suisse lost $7.9 billion.
