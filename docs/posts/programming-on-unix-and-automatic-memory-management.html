    <h1>Programming on Unix and automatic memory management</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Programming on Unix and automatic memory management</h2>

	<p><small>April 23, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Due to the pervasive influence of C, Unix is commonly thought of
as a programming environment of manual memory management; you program
Unix in C and C requires manual memory management. Except that I
maintain this is somewhat of an illusion. From the days of V7 Unix
onward (if not earlier), a substantial amount of Unix programming
has always been done in languages with automatic memory management.
It&#39;s just that we called this programming &#34;shell scripts&#34;, &#34;awk&#34;,
&#34;make&#34;, and so on.</p>

<p>(Then later all of these programming environments got slammed
together to create Perl. People don&#39;t necessarily like Perl,
but I think it&#39;s pretty undeniable that it had a substantial
presence in 1990s era Unix programming.)</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just an aspect of general Unix development after all
sorts of people got their hands on it (and created things like
Perl). In Bell Labs Research Unix and then Plan 9, I think pretty
much every new language (or language) created for and on Unix was one
with automatic memory management. One exception is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alef_(programming_language)">Plan 9&#39;s Alef</a>, but no less
a person than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> has
said that one reason for Alef&#39;s failure was its lack of automatic memory
management.</p>

<p>(Another exception is C++, although that didn&#39;t quite come out of
the core Research Unix environment. Obviously C++ has been highly
successful.)</p>

<p>In short, programming with automatic memory management has been a part
of Unix from Bell Labs onward. It&#39;s not some new intruder; it&#39;s a normal
part of Unix, and the creators of Unix were clearly not philosophically
opposed to automatic memory management under any circumstances.</p>

<p>PS: Some of the automatic memory management is forced in various
ways; for example, a declarative language like &#34;make&#34; doesn&#39;t really
have room for manual memory management. But I can somewhat imagine
a version of awk that required you to do manual handling of some
things. How difficult it is to imagine a version of awk with any
form of manual space management suggests why it has its actual form.</p>

<p>(This elaborates on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110250189359563345">a Fediverse post</a>, and was sparked
by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35678093">this</a>.)</p>
