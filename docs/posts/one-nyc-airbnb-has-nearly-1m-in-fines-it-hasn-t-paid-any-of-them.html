                        <p>A New York City home has accumulated nearly $1 million in fines over its illegal use as an Airbnb for years. It&#39;s just one of thousands like it. </p><p>The home in Flushing, Queens, has been on the city&#39;s radar for years, according to a new Bloomberg report, because it illegally housed people in its basement and attic. It has accumulated complaints, violations, and an order to vacate part of the building. </p><p>According to Bloomberg, it racked up more fines than nearly any other Airbnb in the city in 2021, and defaulted on more than $984,000 in penalties. The homeowner still hasn&#39;t paid those fines, Bloomberg reported. </p><p>The house sits at the center of a debate in New York between Airbnb, its hosts, and existing — and pending — short-term rental rules in the city. </p>
                        
                        <p>Under a new law that goes into effect this spring, short-term rental hosts will have to register with the city, and Airbnb and companies like it won&#39;t be allowed to collect booking fees on unregistered properties, Bloomberg reported.</p><p>Hosts will have to submit several documents to the city, including a diagram with exit routes, proof the host is a resident of the building, and the number of non-host residents in the building. </p><p>For Airbnb and many of its short-term rental hosts, the rules pose a threat to the bottom line. </p><p>&#34;Regular New Yorkers should be able to share their home and not be targeted by the city at a time when many families are trying to keep up with the rising cost of living,&#34; Nathan Rotman, Airbnb&#39;s regional public policy lead, told Bloomberg. &#34;The rules as currently written will prevent the vast majority of New Yorkers from listing their homes, and we urge the administration to work with our host community to support a regulatory framework that helps responsible Hosts and targets illegal hotel operators.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>But the city argues that short-term rentals deplete housing stock and push up costs for residents, according to Bloomberg. The city already cracked down on rentals in some cases: In July, Mayor Eric Adams&#39; administration filed a lawsuit to shut down an illegal<strong> </strong>short-term rental operation.</p><p>&#34;Safe, stable, and affordable housing is fundamental to a prosperous city, so we will not allow bad actors to deplete our housing stock and undermine our hospitality sector,&#34; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/493-22/mayor-adams-office-special-enforcement-lawsuit-against-illegal-short-term-rental#/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-module="body_link">Adams said in a press release</a>.</p><p>The mayor also blamed fake host profiles on sites like Airbnb used &#34;to deceive and lure unsuspecting guests into paying for substandard lodging at illegal rental listings.&#34; </p><p>The Queens home is in good company, Bloomberg reported. Of the 29,000 short-term rental listings in the city, about a third of them are listed illegally, according to the Adams administration. </p>
                        
                        <p>But, even with a large portion of problematic listings and a growing pile of fines, experts say Airbnb hosts can&#39;t hide from regulations forever. </p><p>&#34;If you&#39;re going to be a legitimate ongoing business concern you can&#39;t do this,&#34; Chris Slowik, a property lawyer and partner at Klein Slowik PLLC, told Bloomberg. </p>
