    <h1>Computer Randomly Plays Classical Music (2007)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
During normal operation or in Safe mode, your computer may play &#34;Fur Elise&#34; or &#34;It&#39;s a Small, Small World&#34; seemingly at random. This is an indication sent to the PC speaker from the computer&#39;s BIOS that the CPU fan is failing or has failed, or that the power supply voltages have drifted out of tolerance. This is a design feature of a detection circuit and system BIOSes developed by Award/Unicore from 1997 on.
</p><div><p>
Although these symptoms may appear to be virus-like, they are the result of an electronic hardware monitoring component of the motherboard and BIOS. You may want to have your computer checked or serviced. </p></div></div>
