    <h1>Jill â€“ a functional programming language for the Nand2Tetris platform</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Jill is a functional programming language built for the <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" rel="nofollow">Nand2Tetris</a> platform, as an alternative to the original <em>Jack</em> high-level language.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is designed as a drop-in replacement for Jack, as it uses the same VM instruction set and underlying <em>HACK</em> architecture, and follows similar design principles (willing to sacrifice ease of use to favour ease of implementation), while offering an alternative to Jack&#39;s very object-oriented, verbose style (<em>I like to think of Jill as Jack&#39;s more elegant, modern sister</em>).</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>functions as first-class citizens (ability to store them in variables, pass them on to other functions as arguments, and return from functions as a result)</li>
<li>optimized tail-call recursion to use constant stack space (single stack frame)</li>
<li>data modeling using algebraic data types with primitive pattern-matching (per type variant)
<ul dir="auto">
<li>note that, as with Jack, all variables are still effectively 16-bit integers, therefore Jill is dynamically typed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>minimal language design
<ul dir="auto">
<li>only 3 main concepts (types, variables and functions)</li>
<li>expressions can only be literals, variables or function calls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>expanded standard library which is lazily-generated (instructions are generated only for modules and functions which were used in codebase)</li>
<li>common design choices of functional languages (no loops, variables are immutable, code is organized into modules etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">TODO: add link to language tour</p>

<p dir="auto">At the root of your project you should have two directories - <code>/src</code>, which will contain all of your Jill code, and <code>/bin</code>, which will contain the generated <code>.vm</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">All of your project&#39;s Jill code should be written in <code>.jill</code> files, located in the <code>/src</code> directory at the root of your project, or one of its subdirectories.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once compiled, your projects&#39; VM instructions will be located in the <code>bin</code> directory, at the root of your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">An example project structure:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="project_root
|  README.md
|
|__src
|  |  Main.jill
|  |  Foo.jill
|  |  ...
|  |
|  |__Model
|  |  |  Bar.jill
|  |  |  Baz.jill
|  |  |  ...
|
|__bin
|  |  Main.vm
|  |  Foo.vm
|  |  Model_Bar.vm
|  |  Model_Baz.vm
|  |  ..."><pre><code>project_root
|  README.md

|__src
|  |  Main.jill
|  |  Foo.jill

</code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">You can find several examples of Jill code/projects in the <code>examples</code> directory.</p>


<p dir="auto">You can find a pre-built Windows executable in the latest <a href="https://github.com/mpatajac/jillc/releases">release</a>.</p>


<p dir="auto">Make sure you have <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">the Rust toolchain</a> installed and updated to a recent version.</p>

<p dir="auto">After cloning this repository, you can either build and run the compiler in a single step:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cargo run -- path_to_jill_project_root"><pre>$ cargo run -- path_to_jill_project_root</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or build the compiler using</p>

<p dir="auto">and use the binary in <code>./target/debug</code> to compile your Jill codebase</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ jillc [path_to_jill_project_root]"><pre>$ jillc [path_to_jill_project_root]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For more information on the compiler itself, you can always check the provided manual with <code>jillc --help</code>.</p>
