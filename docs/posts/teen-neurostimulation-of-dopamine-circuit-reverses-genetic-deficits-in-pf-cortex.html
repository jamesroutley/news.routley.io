    <h1>Teen neurostimulation of dopamine circuit reverses genetic deficits in PF cortex</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Dysfunctions of the dopamine system are commonly implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and substance-use disorders <sup>(<a href="#c1">1</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c3">3</a>)</sup>. In addition, the treatment effect of antipsychotic medication is related to its effectiveness in blocking dopamine D2 receptors <sup>(<a href="#c4">4</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c5">5</a>)</sup>. However, psychiatric symptoms include not only psychosis that can be treated by antipsychotics, but also cognitive disabilities in executive functions and memory <sup>(<a href="#c5">5</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c7">7</a>)</sup>. While current antipsychotic therapies based on D2 antagonism have little effect on cognitive disabilities <sup>(<a href="#c7">7</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c10">10</a>)</sup>, frontal cortical dopamine deficits are reported in schizophrenia and the role of frontal cortical dopamine D1 receptor activation in cognitive function has been demonstrated in animal studies <sup>(<a href="#c11">11</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c14">14</a>)</sup>. Unfortunately, due to safety and bioavailability issues, very few D1 receptor agonists have progressed to clinical testing <sup>(<a href="#c15">15</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c17">17</a>)</sup>. The long-standing difficulty of developing effective pharmacological treatments for cognitive symptoms suggests the necessity of new investigative approaches, such as evaluating the underlying neural circuitry and its potential for modification.</p><p>Dopamine regulates a multitude of behavioral functions through different anatomical pathways from dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra to cortical and subcortical target regions <sup>(<a href="#c18">18</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c21">21</a>)</sup>. The mesofrontal pathway innervates the frontal cortex and an optimal level of dopamine is important for normal frontal circuit functions <sup>(<a href="#c22">22</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c25">25</a>)</sup>. The frontal cortical circuit integrates dopaminergic signals with multisensory and memory information to control behavioral actions <sup>(<a href="#c26">26</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c29">29</a>)</sup>. Together, the frontal cortex and its dopaminergic input form a critical substrate for cognitive functions and a hypoactive frontal cortical dopamine system is found in schizophrenia patients <sup>(<a href="#c5">5</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c14">14</a>)</sup>. Genetic disruptions of several genes involved in synaptic functions and related to psychiatric disorders, such as <em>Arc</em> and <em>DISC1</em><sup>(<a href="#c30">30</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c33">33</a>)</sup>, lead to hypoactive mesofrontal dopaminergic input in mice <sup>(<a href="#c34">34</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c36">36</a>)</sup>. However, whether these genetic deficits in frontal cortex function can be reversed through therapeutic interventions remains unknown.</p><p>Adolescence is an important period for the development of cognitive control functions and exploration behaviors <sup>(<a href="#c37">37</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c39">39</a>)</sup>. Cognitive control deficits often emerge during adolescence as a characteristic manifestation of several psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and substance-use disorders <sup>(<a href="#c2">2</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c3">3</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c40">40</a>)</sup>. Developmental studies of the mesofrontal dopamine projection in both non-human primates and rodents suggest that this pathway exhibits a protracted maturation through adolescence <sup>(<a href="#c41">41</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c45">45</a>)</sup>. Importantly, the structure and function of the mesofrontal circuit are malleable to experience; activity-dependent modification during adolescence and adolescent exposure to substances of abuse can produce long-lasting deficits <sup>(<a href="#c46">46</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c49">49</a>)</sup>. However, it is unknown whether adolescent intervention in this pathway can induce long-lasting circuit changes conducive for the recovery of cognitive function from genetic deficits.</p><p>Mouse genetic models of frontal dopamine deficits and the adolescence malleability of this circuit present opportunities to investigate the cellular substrates underlying cognitive deficits and test potential treatment strategies <sup>(<a href="#c34">34</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c36">36</a>)</sup>. In this study, using single-cell resolution neuronal ensemble imaging in freely behaving animals, we identified a disruption of neuronal coordination in frontal cortex that is associated with cognitive impairment in mouse models. Furthermore, taking advantage of the activity-dependent adolescent plasticity in the mesofrontal circuit, we developed targeted chemogenetic and optogenetic neuromodulation techniques that are able to reverse the neural coordination and cognitive behavioral deficits in adult animals. Our results demonstrate the capability of adolescent frontal dopamine circuit stimulation to achieve long-term reversal of cognitive deficits and suggest potential translational targets and strategies for psychiatric treatments.</p><h2 id="s2a">Characterization of cognitive and mesofrontal innervation deficits in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice</h2><p>We first used an <em>Arc</em> mutant model of a hypo-functioning mesofrontal circuit <sup>(<a href="#c36">36</a>)</sup> for behavioral, anatomical tracing and neural activity imaging studies. To assess whether genetic disruption of <em>Arc</em> (by knocking-in a GFP reporter cassette <sup>(<a href="#c50">50</a>)</sup>) affects cognitive control of behavior, we examined wild-type and <em>Arc</em> homozygous mutant mice in a Y-maze spatial navigation task. This task takes advantage of the innate spatial navigation ability of mice and does not require extensive pretraining, making it well suited for both developmental and adult testing <sup>(<a href="#c51">51</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c53">53</a>)</sup>. Wild-type mice explore the three arms of the maze using a memory-based decision-making strategy, preferring to visit a new arm instead of the most recently visited arm (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1a</a>). The percentage of new arm visits out of the total arm visits is referred to as “alternation percentage”, which is approximately 67% in wild-type mice and significantly above the chance level from random exploration (50%). By contrast, the alternation percentage in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice is significantly reduced towards the chance level (p = 0.001, t-test, t(15) = 3.975, <em>WT</em>: 67.2±2.6%, vs. <em>Arc</em>-/-: 53.4±2.3%, N = 8 and 9 mice, respectively; <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1b</a>). <em>Arc</em> mutant mice showed a similar number of total arm entries as the wild-type mice (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1c</a>), suggesting that the <em>Arc</em> mutation did not affect overall locomotor activity or motivation level. Taken together, these results suggest that <em>Arc</em> mutant mice have a deficit in memory-guided choice behaviors.</p><figure id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod--epp.elifesciences.org/iiif/2/87414%2Fv1%2F526987v3_fig1.tif/full/max/0/default.jpg"/><figcaption><h3>Characterization of cognitive and mesofrontal deficits in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice.</h3><p>(<strong>a</strong>) Diagram showing the navigation choices for mice in a Y-maze.

The M2 region of the frontal cortex plays an important role in action planning, generating the earliest neural signals related to upcoming choice during spatial navigation <sup>(<a href="#c57">57</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c58">58</a>)</sup>. To verify the involvement of the M2 cortex in Y-maze alternation, we expressed the chemogenetic inhibitor DREADD-Gi <sup>(<a href="#c59">59</a>)</sup> in M2 with an Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) vector and used Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) injection to inhibit M2 neural activity in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We found that the alternation percentage was significantly reduced in the DREADD-Gi animals compared with control animals (p = 0.017, t-test, t(10)=2.845, Ctrl: 64.6±1.8%, Gi:54.1±3.2%, N=6 for each group, Supplementary Fig. 1b), while other aspects of motor behaviors in this task were not affected (Supplementary Fig. 1c and 1d). These results confirm the involvement of M2 frontal cortical neurons in memory-guided decision-making during the Y-maze task.</p><p>Dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental areas is critical to optimal frontal cortical function in controlling cognitive processes <sup>(<a href="#c22">22</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c24">24</a>)</sup>. We examined the anatomical structure of the frontal dopaminergic projection to determine if this input was altered in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice. A Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), rather than a Dopamine Transporter (DAT), transgenic Cre line was used to efficiently label mesofrontal dopamine neurons, because of the higher expression level of TH over DAT in these neurons <sup>(<a href="#c60">60</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c61">61</a>)</sup>. Cre-dependent AAV vectors were injected into the VTA of <em>TH-Cre</em> mice to label dopaminergic axons with tdTomato and highlight boutons with synaptophysin-GFP (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1d</a> and <a href="#fig1">e</a>) <sup>(<a href="#c46">46</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c62">62</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c63">63</a>)</sup>. Although the dopaminergic axon length in the M2 frontal cortex (normalized by the number of labeled cells in VTA) was not significantly different between <em>Arc</em> mutant and wildtype animals (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1f</a>), we found a significant reduction in the dopaminergic bouton density in this region in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice compared to wildtype animals (p = 0.034, t-test, t(12)=2.393, <em>WT</em>: 100±5%, <em>Arc -/-</em>:84±5%, N=7 for each group; bouton density normalized by axon length; <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1g</a>). These results suggest that dopaminergic innervations of the M2 frontal cortex are reduced in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice, which agrees with our previous findings of reduced frontal dopamine release and mesofrontal activity in <em>Arc-/-</em> mice <sup>(<a href="#c36">36</a>)</sup>. Our new results provide further anatomical evidence for a hypofunctional mesofrontal dopamine circuit in these mice.</p><h2 id="s2b">Task-coordinated frontal neuronal ensemble activity is disrupted in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice</h2><p>To determine how M2 neuronal activities during Y-maze performance might be affected by <em>Arc</em> mutation and reduced dopaminergic input, we expressed a genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 <sup>(<a href="#c64">64</a>)</sup> in superficial layer (L2/3) M2 neurons and used a head-mounted miniaturized microscope <sup>(<a href="#c62">62</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c65">65</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c67">67</a>)</sup> to image task-related neuronal ensemble activity in adult wild-type and <em>Arc-/-</em> mice (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2a</a>). The microscope lens was placed above the pial surface rather than inserted into the cortex to avoid damage of M2 neurons, and neuronal activities in superficial cortical layers were imaged (Supplementary Fig. 2a-2c, Supplementary Movie 1). We found that the activity of individual M2 neurons occurred at various positions along the track during Y-maze navigation (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2b</a>). An increased proportion of neurons showed peak activation when the wild-type animal was near the center of the maze before making an arm entry (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2c</a>). In contrast, this proportion was significantly reduced in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice compared to wild type animals (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-square test, <em>WT</em> 938 cells from 8 mice, <em>Arc</em>-/- 1338 cells from 7 mice). This effect is not due to a general reduction of neural activity in <em>Arc-/-</em> mice, because there is no difference between wild-type and <em>Arc-/-</em> mice in the average activity of neurons throughout the task period (Supplementary Fig. 2d-f). In addition, there is no correlation between the average activity of neurons with alteration behaviors in Y-maze (Supplementary Fig. 2j). Thus, these results suggest that the coordinated activation of M2 neurons before making a choice is disrupted in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice.</p><figure id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod--epp.elifesciences.org/iiif/2/87414%2Fv1%2F526987v3_fig2.tif/full/max/0/default.jpg"/><figcaption><h3>Task-coordinated frontal neuronal ensemble activity is disrupted in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice.</h3><p>(<strong>a</strong>) Diagram showing the setup for miniaturized microscope imaging of frontal cortical activity in mice performing the Y-maze task.

Shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To further examine how exploratory choices may be encoded in the activities of individual M2 neurons, we compared the neuronal activity patterns along the navigation trajectories leading to new arm visits versus old arm visits. Neurons selective for alternation were identified by differential neural activation between alternating and non-alternating paths (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2d</a>). This analysis showed that the proportion of alternation-selective neurons increased in the wild type mice as the animal approached the maze center, but this increase was blunted in the <em>Arc</em> mutant animals (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-square test, <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2e</a>). These same mutant animals also showed a specific reduction of alternation choices in the Y-maze (p = 0.047, t-test, t(13)=2.196, <em>WT</em>: 67.8 ± 4.4%, N = 8 mice; <em>Arc-/-</em>: 54.5 ± 4.1%, N = 7 mice, Supplementary Fig. 2g-i), replicating the deficit we observed in separate groups of animals that did not carry the miniaturized microscope (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1b</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that both task-related frontal cortical activity and memory-guided decision behavior are impaired in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice.</p><h2 id="s2c">Adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation leads to long-term reversal of mesofrontal circuit deficits</h2><p>Given the hypo-functioning mesofrontal dopaminergic circuit in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice, we next investigated the possibility of developing neurostimulation strategies to restore normal circuit functions. We have previously shown that a brief stimulation of midbrain dopamine cells during adolescence, but not adult, leads to rapid formation of mesofrontal dopaminergic boutons and enhanced mesofrontal circuit activity in wild-type mice <sup>(<a href="#c46">46</a>)</sup>. Here, we chose to test the long-term effect of this adolescent intervention strategy on the frontal circuit and memory-guided decision-making deficits in adult <em>Arc</em> mutant mice.</p><p>To stimulate dopamine neuron activity, we expressed chemogenetic activator DREADD-Gq <sup>(<a href="#c68">68</a>)</sup> in the VTA dopamine cells using a combination of stereotaxically injected Cre-dependent AAV vectors and a <em>TH-Cre</em> transgenic mouse line <sup>(<a href="#c46">46</a>)</sup> (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3a</a>, Supplementary Fig. 3a). CNO (1mg/kg) was injected systemically to enhance the activity of DREADD-Gq-expressing dopamine neurons. To control for any potential off-target effect of CNO, another group of <em>TH-Cre</em> mice that expressed AAV-mCherry reporter in dopamine neurons also received CNO injection.</p><figure id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod--epp.elifesciences.org/iiif/2/87414%2Fv1%2F526987v3_fig3.tif/full/max/0/default.jpg"/><figcaption><h3>Adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation leads to long-term reversal of mesofrontal circuit deficits.</h3><p>(<strong>a</strong>) Schematic for labeling dopamine neurons with DREADD-Gq-mCherry and imaging frontal cortical activity with GCaMP6.

Cortical activity is summarized by the standard deviation (SD) of the spontaneous activity traces. Activity change is calculated as (SD2-SD1)/SD1, where SD1 is before and SD2 after treatment.

Increased VTA dopamine activity is known to enhance frontal cortical activity, which can be measured with calcium indicator GCaMP6 <sup>(<a href="#c36">36</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c46">46</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c69">69</a>)</sup>. We validated the DREADD-Gq induced enhancement of mesofrontal activity by examining M2 cortical activity with GCaMP6 before and after CNO injection in these mice (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3a</a> and <a href="#fig3">b</a>, Supplementary Fig. 3b). There was a significant increase in the M2 cortical activity measured 1 hr after the injection of CNO in DREADD-Gq animals, whereas no significant effect occurred in control mCherry animals (DREADD-Gq: 82±17% vs. mCherry Ctrl: 20±14%, p = 0.018, t-test, t(10)=2.814, N=6 for each group; <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3c</a>). In addition, saline injection in DREADD-Gq expressing mice did not alter M2 neural activity, and CNO-induced increase in M2 neural activity was suppressed by D1 antagonist SCH23390 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). These results confirmed CNO-induced activation of the mesofrontal dopaminergic circuit in DREADD-Gq animals.</p><p>After the validation of activity enhancement by chemogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons, we examined if this treatment would have any long-term effect on the circuit deficits in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice. We first tested whether the structural deficits in the mesofrontal dopaminergic circuit would be affected by adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation. DREADD-Gq or mCherry expression was combined with tdTomato and synaptophysin-GFP to label dopaminergic axons and boutons in the <em>Arc</em> mutant animals (<em>Arc</em>-/-;<em>TH-Cre</em>). After three CNO treatments in adolescence (one injection per day for three days in mice 5 weeks of age in their home cages), the mice were kept in their regular home cage until adulthood (8 weeks) for histological assessment (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3d</a>). Although the mesofrontal dopamine axon length did not show any difference (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3e</a>), we found a significant increase in dopaminergic bouton density in DREADD-Gq mice compared to control animals (Ctrl:100±4% vs. Gq:120±6%, p = 0.013, t-test, t(18)=2.763, N=10 for each group; <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3f</a>). These results suggest that adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice led to a long-term enhancement of the connection between dopaminergic axons and M2 frontal cortical neurons, thereby ameliorating the structural deficits in these mice.</p><p>We next tested whether adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation would also lead to long-term improvement of the functional deficits in the mesofrontal circuit of <em>Arc</em> mutant mice. Our previous work indicated that <em>Arc</em> mutants have reduced frontal cortical response to VTA stimulation <sup>(<a href="#c36">36</a>)</sup>. Using the same assay in adult mice, we found that the cortical calcium activity in response to VTA electrical stimulation was significantly enhanced in DREADD-Gq mice compared to control mCherry mice after adolescence CNO treatment (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3g-i</a>). These results suggest that adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation also leads to long-term improvement of the functional deficits in the mesofrontal dopaminergic circuit of <em>Arc</em> mutants.</p><h2 id="s2d">Adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation leads to restoration of coordinated frontal neuronal activity and cognition in adulthood</h2><p>To further examine whether the uncoordinated frontal neural activity patterns in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice during the Y-maze task would be renormalized by this adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation strategy, we conducted calcium imaging using the head-mounted miniature microscope in these mice (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4a</a>). We found that the coordinated activation of neurons near the maze center (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4b</a>) and the proportion of alternation-selective neurons (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4c</a>) were both significantly enhanced in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice that received the DREADD-Gq activation compared to the mCherry control group (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-square tests, DREADD-Gq 1008 cells from 7 mice, mCherry 1286 cells from 7 mice). In contrast, the average activity of M2 neurons throughout the task period was not affected by adolescent DREADD-Gq stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). Strikingly, the DREADD-Gq stimulated animals also showed an enhancement of behavioral alternation (p = 0.010, t-test, t(12)=3.043, Ctrl:56.8±2.8%, Gq:67.6±2.2%, N=7 each group, <a href="#fig4">Fig 4d</a>), reaching a level comparable to that in the wild-type mice (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1b</a>). Total arm entries were not affected (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4e</a>), suggesting no alternations in general locomotor activity. These results indicate that adult task-related functional activity in the M2 frontal cortex is restored by adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice.</p><figure id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod--epp.elifesciences.org/iiif/2/87414%2Fv1%2F526987v3_fig4.tif/full/max/0/default.jpg"/><figcaption><h3>Adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation leads to restoration of coordinated frontal neuronal activity and cognition in adulthood.</h3><p>(<strong>a</strong>) Diagram showing procedures for adolescent stimulation of dopamine neurons and functional imaging of frontal cortical neuron activity in adult <em>Arc</em>-/-;<em>TH-Cre</em> mice.

First, we replicated the effects of adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation on Y-maze navigation in adulthood in another cohort of <em>Arc</em> mutant mice (p = 0.023, t-test, t(12)=2.598, Ctrl:59.5±2.4%, Gq:68.5±2.5%, N=7 for each group) (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5a</a>). Furthermore, when tested only one day after the three-day CNO treatment procedure (one injection per day) in adolescence, <em>Arc</em> mutant mice already showed an increased alternation percentage (p = 0.031, t-test, t(20)=2.322, Ctrl:55.8±2.9%, Gq:64.7±2.5%, N=11 for each group) (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5b</a>), which is comparable to the effect observed one-month after treatment in adult mice (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5a</a>). These results suggest that the adolescent neurostimulation effect on cognitive behavioral improvement is both fast acting and long lasting.</p><figure id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><img loading="lazy" src="https://prod--epp.elifesciences.org/iiif/2/87414%2Fv1%2F526987v3_fig5.tif/full/max/0/default.jpg"/><figcaption><h3>Efficacy requirements for adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation.</h3><p>(<strong>a</strong>) Top, diagram showing the base procedure for the stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons and Y-maze testing in <em>Arc</em>-/-;<em>TH-Cre</em> mice labeled with DREADD-Gq or mCherry control viruses.

However, this strong three-week stimulation did not enhance behavioral alternation and appeared to decrease it even further (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5c</a>). These results indicate that excessive stimulation of dopamine neurons does not lead to functional improvement, consistent with previous studies showing that an optimal level of dopamine is important for normal cognitive function <sup>(<a href="#c22">22</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c24">24</a>)</sup>.</p><p>Third, we found that in adult <em>Arc</em> mutant mice with DREADD-Gq expression, three-day CNO injection did not lead to any effects on Y-maze alternation behavior assayed one-month later (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5d</a>). These results indicate that adolescent, but not adult, intervention is critical for reversing this behavioral dysfunction, in agreement with the elevated adolescent structural and functional plasticity reported for the mesofrontal circuit <sup>(<a href="#c46">46</a>)</sup>. In addition, because 3 weeks of adolescent CNO treatment or 3 days of adult CNO treatment in DREADD-Gq mice did not lead to any rescue effects, DREADD-Gq expression alone is unlikely to generate any behavior improvement. Taken together, our findings suggest that a brief stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons in adolescence has a long-lasting effect to reverse the memory-guided decision-making deficits in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice, while not affecting other aspects of motor behaviors in the Y-maze (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p><h2 id="s2f">Specific stimulation of adolescent frontal dopaminergic axons reverses both cognitive and psychomotor deficits</h2><p>To further evaluate the impact of adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation on another frontal cortex-dependent behavioral deficit in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice, we subjected these mice to an amphetamine-induced hyperactivity test, which is considered an animal model for drug-induced psychomotor symptoms <sup>(<a href="#c36">36</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c70">70</a>)</sup>.

Dopamine neurons in the VTA include separate neuronal populations that project to the frontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens, respectively <sup>(<a href="#c18">18</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c61">61</a>)</sup>. Our results suggest that adolescent stimulation of both populations of VTA neurons in mesofrontal and mesoaccumbens pathways, which have opposing effects on amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, result in no net change in this behavioral phenotype at adulthood.</p><p>Subsequently, we tested whether targeted stimulation of dopaminergic axons projecting to the frontal cortex would be a better strategy to reinstate memory-guided decision-making in the Y-maze task and prevent amphetamine hyper-reactivity in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice. Although CNO in principle could be injected directly into the frontal cortex to stimulate DREADD-Gq labeled dopaminergic axons, we found in preliminary experiments that repeated injections (three times) in adolescent brain led to tissue deformation and damage. Therefore, we turned to a less invasive optogenetic method to enhance the activity of labeled axons using Stabilized Step Function Opsins (SSFOs), which can increase neural excitability over a 30-min time scale in response to a two-sec pulse of light <sup>(<a href="#c74">74</a>)</sup>.</p><p>To validate the effect of SSFO-based stimulation, we expressed Cre-dependent SSFO in the midbrain dopamine neurons and stimulated their axonal projections in the M2 frontal cortex with blue light through a cranial window (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6a</a>; Supplementary Fig. 6c-d). We monitored M2 neural activity using calcium reporter GCaMP6 before and 30 min after light activation. Similar to the DREADD-Gq mediated activity changes in the mesofrontal circuit, frontal cortical activity was increased after light activation compared to before in SSFO animals, and this increase was significantly higher than the control EGFP animals that were also exposed to the light (p = 0.001, t-test, t(8)=5.135, Ctrl: 7.5±3.1%, SSFO: 46.7±6.9%, N=5 each group, <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6b-c</a>, Supplementary Fig. 6e).

On the other hand, total arm entries were not affected (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6f</a> and <a href="#fig6">6h</a>).

Other aspects of motor behaviors in the Y-maze were not affected (Supplementary Fig. 7). Taken together, these results suggest that adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation is effective for long-term cognitive improvement in two different genetic models of mesofrontal hypofunction.</p><h2 id="s3a">Fast-acting and long-lasting cognitive rescue by adolescent dopamine circuit stimulation</h2><p>In this study, we have demonstrated a powerful role of adolescent dopaminergic input in inducing long-lasting circuit reorganization to reverse genetic deficits in frontal cortex function. Previous studies of dopamine function have focused on its transient neuromodulatory actions on neural dynamics or involvement in reinforcement learning <sup>(<a href="#c76">76</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c79">79</a>)</sup>. Here, by examining the effect of dopamine neuron stimulation over a developmental time scale, we have identified both fast acting and persistent effect of adolescent dopamine neuron activity at neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and behavioral levels. The cognitive dysfunction present in adolescent mutant mice is readily reversed one-day after neurostimulation and the restored performance level is maintained even one-month later at adulthood. Interestingly, the behavioral improvement afforded by dopamine neuron stimulation is observed when the intervention was introduced transiently during the adolescence period, but not adulthood, suggesting a sensitive and limited time window for plasticity-inducing therapeutic manipulations within mesofrontal dopamine circuits. These results may also stimulate future research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling the adolescent plasticity window and explore the possibility and therapeutic potential of reopening plasticity in adulthood <sup>(<a href="#c46">46</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c80">80</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c82">82</a>)</sup>.</p><h2 id="s3b">Cellular alterations in the mesofrontal circuit underlying cognitive dysfunction and rescue</h2><p>Our examination across different mechanistic levels suggests a coherent picture in which increased dopamine neuron activity in adolescence leads to enhanced frontal dopaminergic innervation and cortical response to dopamine. Previous electrophysiological studies have suggested that dopamine can act on five different receptors expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons to increase signal-to-noise ratio and temporal synchrony in network electrophysiological activity <sup>(<a href="#c25">25</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c78">78</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c79">79</a>)<!-- -->, 83–<!-- -->(<a href="#c86">86</a>)</sup>. The neural activity deficit in <em>Arc-/-</em> mice is manifested in the task-coordinated neuronal activation at the decision-making point, but not in the average activity throughout the task. The uncoordinated neural activation pattern in <em>Arc-/-</em> mice may contribute to increased noise and decreased signal for decision-making, consistent with the hypodopaminergic cortical state in <em>Arc-/-</em> mice and the computational role of dopamine in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of neuronal ensemble activities<sup>(<a href="#c25">25</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c78">78</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c79">79</a>)<!-- -->, 83–<!-- -->(<a href="#c86">86</a>)</sup>. After adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation, frontal dopaminergic innervation and cortical response to dopamine are enhanced, which help to restore task-coordinated neuronal activation in adult animals. As coordinated neuronal activity in frontal cortex is implicated in cognitive functions <sup>(<a href="#c87">87</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c88">88</a>)</sup>, the restoration of this activity may underlie the rescue of the cognitive behavioral deficit in <em>Arc</em> mutant mice. It is interesting to note that dopaminergic signaling can impact both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the frontal cortex, and the local GABAergic inhibitory network undergoes major functional remodeling during adolescence<sup>(<a href="#c81">81</a>)</sup>. The microcircuit mechanisms underlying adolescent dopamine neuron stimulation induced neuronal coordination changes will be an exciting direction for future research.</p><h2 id="s3c">Reversal of cognitive deficits in independent genetic models</h2><p>Our studies have shown that the mesofrontal dopamine circuit is a common target disrupted by mutations in <em>Arc</em> and <em>DISC1</em>, both implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders <sup>(<a href="#c30">30</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c33">33</a>)</sup>. <em>Arc</em> and <em>DISC1</em> have different protein interaction partners and function in distinct molecular pathways. <em>Arc</em> is best understood for its role in regulating the trafficking of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors at synapses, whereas <em>DISC1</em> has been shown to act as a scaffold protein to interact with multiple cytoskeletal proteins and synaptic molecules <sup>(<a href="#c89">89</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c92">92</a>)</sup>. Dopamine-related deficits have been reported in multiple <em>Arc</em> and <em>DISC1</em> mutant lines or direct knockdown of these molecules <sup>(<a href="#c34">34</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c36">36</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c93">93</a>)<!-- -->–<!-- -->(<a href="#c95">95</a>)</sup>, but the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits and the varying severity in different models remain to be elucidated in future studies. Considering the widely reported roles of <em>Arc</em> and <em>DISC1</em> in regulating activity-dependent synaptic plasticity<sup>(<a href="#c96">96</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c97">97</a>)</sup>, mutations in these genes may compromise activity-dependent maturation of the mesofrontal dopaminergic circuit. In the two mouse lines we tested, both <em>Arc</em> and <em>DISC1</em> mutations lead to a hypoactive mesofrontal circuit and deficits in memory-guided decision-making behaviors. Our study demonstrates that the cognitive behavioral phenotypes arising from distinct genetic origins can be effectively rescued by the same neurostimulation strategy targeting a convergent mesofrontal circuit phenotype during a critical adolescent window.</p><h2 id="s3d">Reversal of both cognitive and psychomotor deficits by targeting frontal dopamine projections</h2><p>Our work reveals a specific circuit target for long-lasting restoration of cognitive control functions. Dopamine neurons projecting to the frontal cortex are located in the VTA but are distinct from those projecting to the nucleus accumbens <sup>(<a href="#c18">18</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c61">61</a>)</sup>. Our initial chemogenetic neuromodulation strategies targeted most of the dopamine neurons in the VTA. While changes in the mesofrontal dopamine circuit were clearly induced, we cannot rule out other potential changes in the brain that might be also induced by such a targeting strategy and result in the lack of net effect related to amphetamine reactivity. The more refined optogenetic (SSFO) neurostimulation method allowed us to specifically target the dopaminergic axons projecting to the frontal cortex. Enhancing their activity transiently in adolescence is sufficient to not only restore memory-guided decision making in the Y-maze task but also prevent hyper-reactivity to amphetamine. Thus, the mesofrontal dopaminergic circuit may provide an important therapeutic target to restore both cognitive control functions and prevent psychomotor symptoms. While this study focused on the M2 region of the frontal cortex because it generates the earliest neural signals related to upcoming choice during spatial navigation and is optically most accessible<sup>(<a href="#c57">57</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c58">58</a>)</sup>, the medial prefrontal regions (anterior cingulate, prelimbic and infralimbic) beneath M2 also receive dense dopaminergic innervation and can act in concert with M2 in decision making<sup>(<a href="#c98">98</a>)</sup>.

Animals were placed in the start arm facing away from the center. Recording of the session was started when the animal started to move toward the center and the animal was allowed to freely explore the y-maze for 8 minutes. The Y-maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals.</p><p>Videos of the sessions were analyzed blindly offline. Arms were identified as A, B, C. Starting from the start arm, entry into each arm was recorded as a sequence of arm letters. Entry was recorded if all four paws of the animal entered the arm. The number of alternating entries (Triplet sequences with non-repeating letters, e.g. ABC) and total entries (total number of letters) were counted.

A piece of skull (3.5 mm in diameter) in the frontal cortex was removed after high-speed dental drilling. AAV2/9 -Syn-GCaMP6s (3-5×10<sup>12</sup> copies/ml, 0.6 μl per animal) was infused into M2 frontal cortex (Bregma, AP1.7, ML0.8) from the pial surface using a micro-syringe pump<sup>(<a href="#c66">66</a>)</sup>. A 3-mm coverslip was used to seal the cranial window and the exposed scalp was sutured after cranial window surgery. 7-10 days later, the baseplate of a miniaturized integrated fluorescent microscope (Inscopix) was fixed on top of the coverslip. Animals were habituated to the attachment of the microscope (20 minutes per day for 4 days), then imaged during the spontaneous Y maze alternation task.</p><p>Calcium imaging was performed in freely moving mice using the head-attached microscope (LED power: 0.6 - 1.0 mW; camera resolution: 1440 ×1080 pixels). Images were acquired at 30 Hz using nVista 2.0 (Inscopix). At the beginning of each imaging session, the protective cap of the previously implanted baseplate was removed, and the microscope was attached. The imaging field of view was 900 × 600 μm<sup>2</sup> at 0.65 μm/pixel resolution and the imaging depth was selected by adjusting the focus of the microscope until clear neuronal signals were observed in online ΔF/F calcium video. The focal plane was 150-250 μm below the lens. Mouse behavior was recorded with a video camera (Limelight), which was synchronized with calcium imaging using the trigger-out signal from nVista.</p><p>Calcium imaging videos were analyzed by using Mosaic software (Inscopix) and custom-written scripts in Matlab following published algorithms <sup>(<a href="#c106">106</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c107">107</a>)</sup>. Raw videos were first down-sampled by four-fold along spatial dimensions to reduce file size and noise. The mean fluorescence intensity of each pixel during a recording session (8 min) was calculated as F0 and changes in pixel intensity at time t were expressed as (Ft - F0)/F0 or ΔF/F0. To extract active neuronal signals, principal component and independent component analysis (PCA-ICA) was applied to the spatial-temporal data matrices of ΔF/F0 using CellSort and fastICA toolboxes (These toolboxes are freely downloadable from Matlab central). This analysis decomposes a spatiotemporal data matrix into independent components based on the skewness of data distribution. Each component has a characteristic spatial filter over the imaged area and a corresponding temporal signal during the imaging period. The spatial filter and the temporal signal of each component were graphically displayed and inspected by human observers who were blind to the experimental conditions of each video. If the spatial filter for a component overlapped with the dark shadows casted by blood vessels in the F0 image, this component was likely contributed by blood flow and was therefore rejected. In addition, since calcium signals show characteristic fast-rising and slow-decaying time course <sup>(<a href="#c64">64</a>)</sup>, the temporal skewness of calcium signals is expected to be positive and those components with skewness less than 1 were rejected <sup>(<a href="#c107">107</a>)</sup>. For each selected component, the corresponding temporal signal of each neuron was calculated from the ΔF/F0 video by subtracting the median value of the background area (in a doughnut shape surrounding the target cell) from the average value of the cell soma area.</p><p>To identify periods of increased neuronal activity, we searched for the rising phase of each calcium event (peak ΔF/F0 &gt; 3 standard deviation of baseline fluctuation), which has been shown closely associated with neuronal spiking activities <sup>(<a href="#c64">64</a>)</sup>. The start of this rising phase is detected when the 1st derivative of ΔF/F0 (calculated in 200 ms moving window) rises above 0 and continues to increase above 5 standard deviation of baseline fluctuation, and the end of this rising phase is detected when the 1st derivative of ΔF/F0 falls below 0. The magnitude of the calcium event is calculated as the ΔF/F0 difference between the start and end of the event.</p><p>To measure an animal’s movement in the Y-maze, the center of body mass was tracked in background-subtracted behavioral video using custom-written Matlab scripts. The animal’s movement in Y-maze was divided into trials. Each trial began when the animal started moving away from the terminal of one arm and ended after it stopped at the terminal of another arm. To analyze neuronal activity changes along the Y-maze track, the animal’s position in each trial was mapped into 20 equally divided location bins from one terminal to another. The calcium activity for each neuron in each trial was then averaged according to the binned position. To compare neuronal activity under different experimental conditions, the spatially averaged activities were further averaged across trials. The resulting traces from all detected cortical neurons were sorted based on their peak activation time and displayed in temporal raster plots. The proportion of neurons that showed maximal activity at each binned location was then calculated. To measure the alternation selectivity of neurons, neuronal activity difference between alternating and non-alternating trials were calculated at each track position. If the difference at a particular position is higher than 2 standard deviations of the differences at all other positions, the activity was determined as alternation-selective at the designated position.</p><h3 id="s4b4">Frontal cortex inhibition and Y-maze testing</h3><p>Animals were prepared for surgery following previous published procedures <sup>(<a href="#c66">66</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c104">104</a>)<!-- -->, <!-- -->(<a href="#c105">105</a>)</sup>.

Animals were allowed to recover for ∼2 weeks. Animals were then perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and post-fixed overnight at 4°C. Coronal 100 µm thick sections in the frontal cortical and midbrain regions were prepared with a sliding microtome. 3 sections in the frontal cortical region (AP 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0; 25x lens, 10 µm Z-stack, 10 stacks per section) and 5 sections in the midbrain region (AP -2.9, -3.1, -3.3, -3.5 and -3.7; 10x lens, single-frame images) were imaged in both the green and red channels using confocal microscopy (Olympus FV1000). For the frontal cortex, each image stack was maximum projected, and the 10 stacks were stitched together for each section. Animals that did not show VTA labeling were excluded from further analysis.</p><p>Image analysis was carried out using custom Matlab scripts. For boutons and axons, an ROI for the M2 region was drawn in each section using the mouse brain atlas (Paxinos) as reference, and boutons and axons were identified within this region. SypGFP labeled green channel images were used for bouton quantification. Boutons were detected automatically using a Laplacian filter and thresholded at 5 standard deviations above background. tdTomato labeled red channel images were used for the axon quantification. Axons were detected automatically using a Hessian filter, thresholded at 2 standard deviations above background, and skeletonized. For the midbrain sections, cells were detected automatically using a Laplacian filter and thresholded at 2 standard deviations above background.
