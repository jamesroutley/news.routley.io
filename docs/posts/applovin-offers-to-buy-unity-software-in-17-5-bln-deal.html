Unity will own 55% of the combined company&#39;s outstanding shares, representing about 49% of the voting rights.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">AppLovin hired advisors to work out an offer after Unity last month said it would buy ironSource in a $4.4 billion all-stock transaction, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Unity&#39;s board will have to terminate the ironSource deal if it wants to pursue a combination with AppLovin, according to the proposal.</p><div><div><h5 data-testid="Heading">Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Under the proposed deal, Unity&#39;s Chief Executive John Riccitiello will become CEO of the combined business, while AppLovin Chief Executive Adam Foroughi will take the role of chief operating officer.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Unity said its board would evaluate the offer. The company is slated to report its earnings after the bell on Tuesday.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Both companies make software used to design video games. Game-making software has also been expanding to new technologies such as the so-called metaverse, or immersive virtual worlds.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Unity&#39;s software has been used to build some of the most-played games such as &#34;Call of Duty: Mobile,&#34; and &#34;Pokemon Go&#34;, while AppLovin provides helps developers to grow and monetize their apps.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">AppLovin&#39;s offer comes as game developers and console makers warn of a slowdown in the sector as decades-high inflation and easing of COVID-19 restrictions lead gamers to pick outdoor activities. The company lowered its sales guidance on Tuesday.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">&#34;The deal comes as surprise to everybody in the business,&#34; said Serkan Toto, founder of game industry consultancy Kantan Games. &#34;It&#39;s a $15 billion company going after a $15 billion company. It&#39;s a desperate attempt to consolidate and the chances of this deal happening are very slim.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Shares of Palo Alto, California-based AppLovin, which went public last year, fell 9.9% while those of Unity rose 1% in the morning trading session. Shares of ironSource were down 9.7%.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Foroughi said the combined company will have the potential to generate an adjusted operating profit of over $3 billion by the end of 2024.</p><div><div><h5 data-testid="Heading">Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Eva Mathews and Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru, Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Mike Harrison</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
