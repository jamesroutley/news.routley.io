Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) left behind a trophy case stocked with mathematical achievements to choose from, but above all, he wanted a “regular heptadecagon” etched on his headstone. The highly symmetrical 17-sided shape starred in a proof that Gauss considered one of his greatest contributions to math. At just 18 years old Gauss used a heptadecagon to solve a classic problem that had <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/prime-number-puzzle-has-stumped-mathematicians-for-more-than-a-century/">stumped mathematicians</a> for more than 2,000 years.

Like modern mathematicians, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-quantum-math-theory-turned-into-a-jazz-concert/">Euclid</a> set out to derive all of geometry from a minimal list of assumptions called postulates. Instead of merely asserting the existence of shapes or other geometric objects, Euclid wanted to build them explicitly from the simplest ingredients: lines and circles.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To get a feel for these constructions, try one for yourself.

Somehow Euclid knew that a regular 3,072-gon was constructible in principle (a triangle doubled 10 times), but he had no idea how to construct a regular seven-gon (heptagon) or 11-gon (hendecagon). To be clear, regular polygons of any number of sides greater than two do exist and can be constructed with more capable tools. The question that Euclid left behind asks which ones are constructible with a compass and straightedge alone. This question would remain unanswered for two millennia until a certain German teenager picked up a pencil.</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading"><b>18th-Century Math to the Rescue</b></h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">By 1796 no new regular polygons had joined the pantheon of constructible shapes, yet mathematicians had acquired a deeper understanding of compass and straightedge constructions. Gauss knew how to reduce the problem of constructing a regular polygon to that of merely constructing a line segment with a very specific length. To see how to create a 17-gon, start with a unit circle (where the radius equals one) and a point <i>A</i> on the circle. Imagine we could find the red point <i>B</i> above <i>A</i> exactly one seventeenth of the way around the circle. If we could construct the red point from the blue point, we could repeat that construction all the way around the circle, connect the dots with our straightedge, and voilà, a regular heptadecagon. How do we draw point <i>B,</i> given point <i>A,</i> though? Notice that if we could draw the red line segment labeled <i>x,</i> then we can trace that up to the red point <i>B,</i> and we win. The entire problem of constructing a regular heptadecagon boils down to constructing a line segment with the precise length <i>x</i>. For the mathematically curious, <i>x</i> = cosine (<sup>2π </sup>⁄<sub>17</sub>).</p><figure data-block="contentful/image"><picture><source media="(min-width: 750px)" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=1350 1350w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=2000 2000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=900 900w" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw"/><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/79c967385cdd1341/original/heptadecagon_graphic_m6.png?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/79c967385cdd1341/original/heptadecagon_graphic_m6.png?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/79c967385cdd1341/original/heptadecagon_graphic_m6.png?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/79c967385cdd1341/original/heptadecagon_graphic_m6.png?w=750 750w" sizes="(min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw"/><img alt="Diagram shows a circle with line segments drawn from its center to points A and B along the circle such that the part of the circle between A and B is equal to one seventeenth of its circumference and a straight line from A to B forms one edge of a heptadecagon." decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=900" width="2917" height="1157" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=1350 1350w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=2000 2000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/405f476111f0ad33/original/heptadecagon_graphic_d6_TEXT.png?w=900 900w" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw"/></picture><figcaption><p>Amanda Montañez</p></figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Can a compass and straightedge construct a line segment of any length? By Gauss’s time, mathematicians knew the surprising answer to this question. A length is constructible exactly when it can be expressed with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division or square roots applied to integers. So some strange numbers such as the square root of <sup>99</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub> are constructible (99 and 5 are integers, and we’ve applied division and square root to them), whereas some more familiar numbers such as <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/string-theorists-accidentally-find-a-new-formula-for-pi/">pi (π)</a> and the cube root of 2 cannot be constructed because one can never write them in terms of these five operations alone.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Remarkably, the rudimentary tools that the ancient Greeks used to draw their geometric diagrams perfectly match the natural operations of modern-day algebra: addition (+), subtraction (–), multiplication (x), division (/) and taking square roots (√). The reason stems from the fact that the <i>equations</i> for lines and circles only use these five operations, a perspective that Euclid couldn’t have envisioned in the prealgebra age.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">It might surprise you to learn that Gauss never actually drew a regular heptadecagon. He didn’t need to. He proved that the shape is constructible in principle by expressing the special length <i>x</i> [cosine (<sup>2π </sup>⁄<sub>17</sub>)] solely in terms of the five <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mysterious-origins-of-x-in-algebra/">algebraic operations</a> that the compass and straightedge permit.

So not only did Gauss describe the form that all constructible regular polygons take, he and Wantzel vindicated Euclid’s frustrations by proving that the elusive regular heptagon (seven sides) and hendecagon (11 sides) are <i>impossible</i> to construct with a compass and straightedge alone, along with infinitely many other shapes.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">According to<a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/spec-41/"> biographer</a> G. Waldo Dunnington, Gauss felt great pride in cracking the millennia-old problem and told a friend that he wanted a regular heptadecagon displayed on his headstone. Sadly, this didn’t happen, but a monument in Gauss’s birth city of Brunswick, Germany, boasts a 17-pointed star engraved on the back. The stonemason chose a star because he believed that people couldn’t distinguish a heptadecagon from a circle. I wonder if Euclid would agree.</p></div></div>
