    <h2>Key points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Swinburne and CSIRO researchers are investigating ways to produce native metals using materials found on Mars.</li>
              <li>Martian settlements will require large amounts of metal that are difficult to ship from Earth.</li>
              <li>The team have successfully produced iron using regolith simulant that mimics what is available on the Red Planet.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The idea of building settlements on Mars is a popular goal of billionaires, space agencies and interplanetary enthusiasts.</p>
<p>But construction demands materials, and we can&#39;t ship it all from Earth: it cost US$243 million just to send NASA&#39;s one tonne Perseverance Rover to the Red Planet.</p>
<p>Unless we&#39;re building a settlement for ants, we&#39;ll need much, much more stuff. So how do we get it there?</p>
<p>CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellow and Swinburne alum Dr Deddy Nababan has been pondering this question for years. His answer lies in the Martian dirt, known as regolith.</p>
<p>&#34;Sending metals to Mars from Earth might be feasible, but it&#39;s not economical. Can you imagine bringing tonnes of metals to Mars? It&#39;s just not practical,&#34; Dr Nababan says.</p>
<p>&#34;Instead, we can use what&#39;s available on Mars. It&#39;s called in-situ resource utilisation, or ISRU.&#34;</p>
<h2>Building an off-world foundry</h2>
<p>As it turns out, Mars has all the ingredients needed to make native metals. This includes iron-rich oxides in regolith and carbon from its thin atmosphere, which acts as a reducing agent.</p>
<p>Swinburne University of Technology astrometallurgist, Professor Akbar Rhamdhani, is working with Dr Nababan to test this process with regolith simulant - an artificial recreation of the stuff found of Mars.</p>
<p>&#34;We picked a simulant with very similar properties to that found at Gale Crater on Mars and processed them on Earth with simulated Mars conditions. This gives us a good idea of how the process would perform off-world,&#34; he says.</p>

<p>The simulant is placed inside a chamber at Mars surface pressure and heated at increasing temperatures. The experiments showed pure iron metal formation around 1000°C, with liquid silicon-iron alloys produced around 1400°C.</p>
<p>&#34;At high enough temperatures, all of the metals coalesced into one large droplet. This could then be separated from liquid slag the same way it is on Earth,&#34; Professor Rhamdhani says.</p>
<p>Along with Dr Nababan, Prof Rhamdhani is collaborating with CSIRO&#39;s <a href="https://people.csiro.au/p/m/mark-pownceby">Dr Mark Pownceby</a> to further advance the process. They&#39;re particularly focused on making metals with zero waste, where the byproducts of the process are used to make useful items.</p>
<h2>If you can&#39;t ship it, make it</h2>
<p>ISRU is a growing area of space science because in rocket launches, every kilogram counts. While the cost of launches is going down, the demands of human exploration are immense.</p>
<p>But huge developments are already happening, including the first demonstration of ISRU off-world. The MOXIE experiment on board the Mars Perseverance rover produced breathable oxygen using only the carbon dioxide in the planet&#39;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Metal production is the next giant leap. Prof Rhamdhani hopes Mars-made alloys could be used as shells for housing or research facilities, and in machinery for excavation.</p>

<p>&#34;There are certainly challenges. We need to better understand how these alloys would perform over time, and of course whether this process can be recreated on the real Martian surface,&#34; Prof Rhamdhani says.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, Swinburne and its partners are doubling down. Prof Rhamdhani together with Dr Nababan and Dr Matt Shaw, another CSIRO researcher and Swinburne alum, recently delivered a 4-day bespoke workshop on astrometallurgy in South Korea. The feedback was promising.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re starting to see increased interest in this field globally as the world gets serious about Mars exploration,&#34; he says.</p>
<p>&#34;To make it happen, we&#39;re going to need experts from many fields — mining, engineering, geology, and much more.&#34;</p>
<p>For Dr Nababan, the benefits go beyond exploration. He hopes their research will also drive more efficient metallurgy here on Earth.</p>
<p>&#34;By doing this, I wish that I can help the development of space exploration, and at the end it will bring good to human life here on Earth.&#34;</p>
