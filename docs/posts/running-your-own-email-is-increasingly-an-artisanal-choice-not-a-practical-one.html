	<p><small>December 23, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Over on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1474174320138199044">I said something that&#39;s been on my mind for a
while</a>, and
is a bitter thing for me to accept:</p>

<blockquote><p>Gloomy sysadmin take: it&#39;s no longer possible for ordinary
organizations to operate a quality email infrastructure
themselves. You can run a little artisanal one and feel happy about
it, but it will not at all measure up to the quality of systems run by
eg Google and Microsoft.</p>

<p>This is not directly about the big providers making it harder and
harder to send them email, although that doesn&#39;t help. It&#39;s because a
quality modern email environment is big, complex, and takes a lot of
work to create and keep running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear, you absolutely can still run your own email infrastructure,
getting email delivered to you, filtering incoming spam, sending
email (with DMARC signatures and other modern email practices),
providing IMAP access, and even run your own webmail setup. You can
even do this with all open source software. But the email environment
you get this way is increasingly what I called an <em>artisanal</em> one.
It&#39;s cute, decent enough, and hand-crafted, but it doesn&#39;t measure
up in usability, features, and performance to the email infrastructure
that is run by big providers. Your IMAP access might be as good as
theirs, but things like your webmail, your spam filtering, and
almost certainly your general security will not be as good as they
have.</p>

<p>In short, if you run your own email infrastructure, it will not be
up to the general quality you could get from outsourcing to big
providers (they can&#39;t really be called specialists). And you cannot
fix this by trying harder, nor with the magical right choice of
open source software, nor with the magical right choice of commercial
software. Entirely &#34;on premise&#34; email is now an inferior thing for
almost everyone.</p>

<p>Once upon a time this definitely was not the case. The big provider
offerings were inflexible, limited, and often below the level of
service and quality that you could achieve, except in limited areas
like GMail&#39;s webmail interface. Although it&#39;s a bitter pill for
someone like me to swallow, this is no longer the way things are.
The big providers are crushing the field through the sheer amount
of resources they can throw at problems, including and especially
problems that matter to users like security and spam filtering.
Getting even close to what they provide increasing requires climbing
on board with things much like them (for example, a third party
cloud service to spam-filter your incoming email). Especially, open
source can&#39;t compete on features like webmail and performance in
things like spam filtering.</p>

<p>(And let&#39;s not even talk about additional services like organizational
calendaring.)</p>

<p>Artisanal email systems can still have some virtues, just like other
artisanal things do. You can be more responsive to the special
desires of your users and implement features they want (to some
extent) and have high limits on things like mailbox space, and
you&#39;re independent; some people will value that enough. Also, there
will probably always be some people who use run and use independent
email systems, just as there are people who use IRC.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">Our</a> email system certainly
supports a variety of features that the big institutional email
doesn&#39;t and probably never will. But there are also things we just
can&#39;t feasibly do, like add features to the webmail system we use.)</p>

<p>In the old days it made sense for a lot of organizations to run
their own email systems. Often they had no choice about it, because
there were no real alternatives that could meet their requirements
at acceptable cost. But those days have been fading for years and
are probably gone for most organizations.</p>

<p>(For individuals and perhaps very small organizations the picture
is murkier, because you have more to lose to the capricious and
random actions of big providers and fewer remedies available when
they abruptly close your account.)</p>

<p>PS: The other issue with artisanal email systems is that the
organization needs people who can run them, and those people have to
spend time on email; generally the better and more artisanal a system
you want, the more time it takes.</p>
