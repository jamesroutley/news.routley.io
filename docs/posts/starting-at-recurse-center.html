    </a>. I started making websites for myself in middle school. In college, I did a couple of web development internships, as of summer 2023 I’ve been a professional web developer for just over 11 years.</p>
<p>Most of it has been related to frontend. As time went on, I started working in other related areas, such as backend and infrastructure. I’ve been fortunate enough to work at companies that encouraged me to develop T-shaped skills — a deep specialization in one area and broad knowledge in others.</p>
<p>Hopefully, RC gives me a chance to pursue some other interests outside of that — at least, in a way that’s a little more directed than just fumbling around for tutorials on Google. Not sure how often I plan to write about it while I’m there, but I do hope to make some of my work public, and you can look forward to at least a recap post when I’m done.</p>
<p>By the way, posts here about RC will have this link at the bottom encouraging you to join. If any of this sounds fun or interesting to you, check it out!</p>
