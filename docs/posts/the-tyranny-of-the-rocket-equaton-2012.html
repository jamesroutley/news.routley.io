<p>To validate is to compute, so indexing metadata for past validation events and caching any
detailed payloads can save time and effort.</p>
<p>Why index? To search. Why search? To find relevant (“likely valid”), ranked (“more likely valid”)
results.</p>
<p>One may think of validation events as akin to GitHub stars, but with semantics: semantic stars, in
that one can filter by validation types and/or validation agents that you trust, by recency if
applicable, etc.</p>
<p>Crucially, the qualified nature (i.e., <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I3">fair:I3</a>) of starring may help a community of practice mind the
cautionary tale of The Sneeches.</p>
