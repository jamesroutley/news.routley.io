                <h3><strong>Do you have Sphere hardware, software, paperwork or stories?</strong></h3>
                <h4>I&#39;d dearly love to hear from you. Sphere systems and kits were produced in small numbers; they were often unloved even in their time and are now quite obscure. Some material has been thankfully preserved, but there&#39;s plenty I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to study and archive. If you&#39;re looking to get your old Sphere stuff to a good home, have some unseen material in a closet, or have stories of working with or for these computers, <a href="https://sphere.computer/about-contact.html">let&#39;s talk</a>. </h4>
