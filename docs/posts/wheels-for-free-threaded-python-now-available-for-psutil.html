    <h1>Wheels for free-threaded Python now available for psutil</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>With the release of <strong>psutil 7.1.2</strong>, wheels for free-threaded Python are now
available. This milestone was achieved largely through a <strong>community effort</strong>,
as several internal refactorings to the C code were required to make it
possible (see <a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2565#issuecomment-2910225647">issue #2565</a>).
Many of these changes were contributed by <a href="https://github.com/lysnikolaou">Lysandros
Nikolaou</a>.
Thanks to him for the effort and for bearing with me in code reviews! ;-)</p>
<h2>What is free-threaded Python?</h2>
<p>Free-threaded Python (available since <strong>Python 3.13</strong>) refers to Python builds
that are compiled with the <strong>GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) disabled</strong>, allowing
true parallel execution of Python bytecodes across multiple threads. This is
particularly beneficial for <strong>CPU-bound applications</strong>, as it enables better
utilization of multi-core processors.</p>
<h2>The state of free-threaded wheels</h2>
<p>According to Hugo van Kemenade&#39;s <a href="https://hugovk.github.io/free-threaded-wheels/">free-threaded wheels
tracker</a>, the adoption of
free-threaded wheels among the <strong>top 360 most-downloaded PyPI packages with C
extensions</strong> is still limited. Only <strong>128 out of these 360 packages</strong> provide
wheels compiled for free-threaded Python, meaning they can run on Python builds
with the GIL disabled. This shows that, while progress has been made, most
popular packages with C extensions still do not offer ready-made wheels for
free-threaded Python.</p>
<h2>What it means for users</h2>
<p>When a library author provides a wheel, users can install a <strong>pre-compiled
binary package</strong> without having to build it from source. This is especially
important for packages with <strong>C extensions</strong>, like psutil, which is largely
written in C. Such packages often have complex build requirements and require
installing a C compiler. On Windows, that means installing <strong>Visual Studio</strong> or
the Build Tools, which can take several gigabytes and a <em>significant</em> setup
effort. Providing wheels spare users from this hassle, makes installation far
simpler, and is effectively <strong>essential for the users</strong> of that package. You
basically <code>pip install psutil</code> and you&#39;re done.</p>
<h2>What it means for library authors</h2>
<p>Currently, <strong>universal wheels for free-threaded Python do not exist</strong>. Each
wheel must be built specifically for a Python version. Right now authors must
create separate wheels for Python 3.13 and 3.14. Which means distributing <em>a
lot</em> of files already:</p>

psutil-7.1.2-cp314-cp314t-win_arm64.whl
</code></pre></div>

<p>This also multiplies CI jobs and slows down the test matrix (see
<a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/7dfd0ed34fe70ffd879ae62d21aabd4a8ed06d6f/.github/workflows/build.yml">build.yml</a>).
A <strong>true universal wheel</strong> would greatly reduce this overhead, allowing a
single wheel to support multiple Python versions and platforms. Hopefully,
<strong>Python 3.15</strong> will simplify this process. Two competing proposals, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0803/">PEP
803</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0809/">PEP
809</a>, aim to standardize wheel
naming and metadata to allow producing <strong>a single wheel that covers multiple
Python versions</strong>. That would drastically reduce distribution complexity for
library authors, and it&#39;s fair to say it&#39;s essential for free-threaded CPython
to truly succeed.</p>
<h2>How to install free-threaded psutil</h2>
<p>You can now install psutil for free-threaded Python directly via <code>pip</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>pip<span> </span>install<span> </span>psutil<span> </span>--only-binary<span>=</span>:all:
</code></pre></div>

<p>This ensures you get the <strong>pre-compiled wheels</strong> without triggering a source
build.</p>
