<p><em>this piece is a response to</em> <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/feeling-less-lonely/">feeling less lonely</a> <em>by jay hoffman.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>i&#39;ve felt a lot of tension recently writing — and slowly writing scripts for video essays — for the internet. i say &#34;for the internet&#34; and not &#34;for my audience&#34; (vom) or &#34;for my community&#34; purposely, and for many reasons. i don&#39;t know if the people reading are &#34;my&#34; anything, firstly, and i don&#39;t always write with the people i know diligently read my posts firmly in mind (sorry to all three of you, i appreciate you more than this implies). mostly thoughm, i say i write for the internet in a <a href="https://olu.online/technopaganism">technopagan</a> intention sort of a way; i always latently hoped that these writings will lead to something bigger, something i wouldn&#39;t have dared dream of. i think this impulse is understandable given the landscape of big breaks, which to say, the breaks getting both everest-like in height, and fewer and farther between.</p>
<p>i am not hoping to sack it all in and write blog posts for a living honestly, but i would like to maybe write books? or make more involved videos, or dare i say, documentaries? i think there are more squiggly paths to all these things, but they all seem to lie on the other side of getting more people more interested in what i currently do, not to even mention the financial side of things.</p>
<p>so there&#39;s the &#34;needing to get more eyes&#34; tension, the general &#34;<a href="https:olu.online/no">should i even be posting on these platforms</a>?&#34; tension, and the &#34;is this the way to meet the people who will make my life worthwhile to me?&#34; tension. on the latter, i deeply believe in the power of the internet, but maybe posting through it isn&#39;t really the way to attract people you want to meet? i should be writing detailed replies in emails maybe? burrowing into discords perhaps? maybe i should actually faithfully use an RSS reader and dive deeper into the indie web. i could also try and get involved in conservations on my neglected mastodon account...</p>
<p>i&#39;ve grown less and less convinced of the utility of shouting into not the void, but at people with similar views if not similar backgrounds. i think it is a lesson i have to remember from margaret killjoy that writing has utility even if this was the end of the world, that <a href="https://margaretkilljoy.substack.com/p/how-to-live-like-the-world-is-ending?utm_source=publication-search">we plant our fruit trees</a> even if the world dies in flame tonight. i think dreaming big, having speculative approaches to now and soon and the far flung future are all valid pursuits, and maybe i&#39;ve been approaching all this in the wrong way.</p>
<p>i&#39;ve said before one of my values is <a href="https://olu.online/relationships">rapport</a> and i should start acting like it. i&#39;m unsure if all my writing from here on out will be in conversation with other pieces but i know i really want to be part of the living tapestry of things.</p>
<p>why do you upload things, if you do? do you feel conflicted about it?</p>
