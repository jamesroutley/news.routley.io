The plane was on its way to deliver desperately-needed aid packages to areas affected by the earthquakes that struck the country yesterday, toppling buildings and leaving countless residents trapped under the rubble.</p> <p>The Japan Airlines plane, with the flight number JAL 516, had taken off from Hokkaido, with officials saying there were 379 people on board. Though there were no fatalities, &#34;dozens&#34; of passengers required medical treatment, but the extent of their individual injuries is yet to be reported. Officials have confirmed that they all escaped without life-threatening injuries. All runways at the busy airport are now closed, reports say. One witness recalled seeing a plane &#34;explode&#34; in front of them.</p> <section data-embed-group="picture" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true" data-orientation="portrait"> <div data-redesign-embed="true">

</div> <p>Haneda is one of Japan&#39;s busiest airports and a key travel hub for people travelling across the country during the New Year holidays.</p> <p>It&#39;s the second disaster in recent days to hit the Asian archipelago after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake tore through the country, triggering tsunamis and leaving entire neighbourhoods flattened.</p> <embed-html data-callback-url="https://www.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31786969.ece?widgetId=23860023&amp;isCallback=true" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31786969"></embed-html>  <p>NHK quoted JAL as saying it believed its plane was hit by another aircraft, possibly a Japan coastguard plane. Japan&#39;s coastguard said it is checking reports about a collision between its aircraft and the JAL flight on fire. It had no further details.</p> <p>The fire comes following an incredibly safe year for commercial aviation, as fewer aircraft accidents and deaths were recorded in 2023 than ever before. </p> <p>In the previous 12 months, there were only two fatal accidents compared with six in 2022, according to the Independent. </p> <p>According to flight-tracking service, Flight Radar 24, the accident took place at exactly 5.47pm as the Japan Airlines flight came in to land. The coastguard aircraft is a De Havilland <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/canada" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic">Canada</a> DHC-8-315Q MPA - more commonly known as a Bombardier Dash-8 - which was not fitted with a modern ADS-B transponder. </p> <p>The lack of transponder could have been a problem, because they&#39;re used to transmit pinpoint accurate information about where the aircraft is to controllers on the ground, and to other aircraft, reports Sky News. The technology has proven far more accurate than traditional radar surveillance. </p> <p>The two late-afternoon arrivals from London Heathrow were unaffected by the blaze and touched down as normal at Haneda Airport. However, passengers from both flights will have been going through the airport, completing passport checks and picking up luggage, while the crash was happening on the runway outside. </p> <p>All arrivals and departures have been cancelled while those still in the air had to be diverted. </p><!-- Article End--><scroll-depth-observer data-event-markers="10%,25%,50%,100%"></scroll-depth-observer></div></div>
