An English Version by Ursula K. Le Guin
ISBN: 978-1-59030-744-1</p>


<p dir="auto">The way you can go</p>
<p dir="auto">Heaven and earth</p>
<p dir="auto">So the unwanting soul</p>
<p dir="auto">Two things, one origin,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: A satisfactory translation of this chapter is, I believe, perfectly impossible. It contains the book. I think of it as the Aleph, in Borges’s story: if you can see it rightly, it contains everything.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Everybody on earth knowing</p>
<p dir="auto">Everybody knowing</p>
<p dir="auto">For being and nonbeing</p>
<p dir="auto">That’s why the wise soul</p>
<p dir="auto">The things of this world</p>
<p dir="auto">To bear and not to own;</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: One of the things I read in this chapter is that values and beliefs are not only culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great reversals that maintain the living balance of the world. To believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance. To let go of that belief is to find safety.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Not praising the praiseworthy</p>
<p dir="auto">Not prizing rare treasures</p>
<p dir="auto">Not looking at the desirable</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise soul</p>
<p dir="auto">When you do not-doing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Over and over Lao Tzu says wei wu wei: Do not do. Doing not-doing. To act without acting. Action by inaction. You do nothing yet it gets done...
It’s not a statement susceptible to logical interpretation, or even to a syntactical translation into English; but it’s a concept that transforms thought radically, that changes minds. The whole book is both an explanation and a demonstration of it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">The way is empty,</p>
<p dir="auto">Blunting edge,</p>
<p dir="auto">Quiet,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Everything Lao Tzu says is elusive. The temptation is to grasp at something tangible in the endlessly deceptive simplicity of the words. Even some of his finest scholarly translators focus on positive ethical or political values in the text, as if those were what’s important in it. And of course the religion called Taoism is full of gods, saints, miracles, prayers, rules, methods for securing riches, power, longevity, and so forth -- all the stuff that Lao Tzu says leads us away from the way.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Heaven and earth aren’t humane.</p>
<p dir="auto">Wise souls aren’t humane.</p>
<p dir="auto">Heaven and earth</p>
<p dir="auto">Empty yet structured,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: The “inhumanity” of the wise soul doesn’t mean cruelty. Cruelty is a human characteristic. Heaven and earth -- that is, “Nature” and its Way -- are not humane, because they are not human. They are not kind; they are not cruel; those are human attributes. You can only be kind or cruel if you have, and cherish, a self. You can’t even be indifferent if you aren’t different. Altruism is the other side of egoism. Followers of the Way, like the forces of nature, act selflessly.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">The valley spirit never dies.</p>
<p dir="auto">The mystery,</p>
<p dir="auto">Forever this endures, forever.</p>


<p dir="auto">Heaven will last,</p>
<p dir="auto">So wise souls</p>


<p dir="auto">True goodness</p>
<p dir="auto">It goes right</p>
<p dir="auto">For a house,</p>
<p dir="auto">No competition,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: A clear stream of water runs through this book, from poem to poem, wearing down the indestructible, finding the way around everything that obstructs the way. Good drinking water.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Brim-fill the bowl,</p>
<p dir="auto">Nobody can protect</p>
<p dir="auto">Wealth, status, pride,</p>


<p dir="auto">Can you keep your soul in its body,</p>
<p dir="auto">Can you keep the deep water still and clear,</p>
<p dir="auto">Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven,</p>
<p dir="auto">To give birth, to nourish,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Most of the scholars think this chapter is about meditation, its techniques and fulfillments. The language is profoundly mystical, the images are charged, rich in implications.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Thirty spokes</p>
<p dir="auto">Hollowed out,</p>
<p dir="auto">Cut doors and windows</p>
<p dir="auto">So the profit in what is</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: One of the things I love about Lao Tzu is he is so funny. He’s explaining a profound and difficult truth here, one of those counter-intuitive truths that, when the mind can accept them, suddenly double the size of the universe. He goes about it with this deadpan simplicity, talking about pots.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">The five colors</p>
<p dir="auto">Racing, chasing, hunting,</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise soul</p>


<p dir="auto">To be in favor or disgrace</p>
<p dir="auto">What does that mean,</p>
<p dir="auto">What does that mean,</p>
<p dir="auto">So people who set their bodily good</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Lao Tzu, a mystic, demystifies political power.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Look at it: nothing to see.</p>
<p dir="auto">Triply undifferentiated,</p>
<p dir="auto">Never, oh! never</p>
<p dir="auto">Call it unthinkable thought.</p>
<p dir="auto">Holding fast to the old Way,</p>


<p dir="auto">Once upon a time</p>
<p dir="auto">Since they’re inexplicable</p>
<p dir="auto">Who can by stillness, little by little</p>
<p dir="auto">To follow the Way</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: In the first stanza we see the followers of the Way in ancient times or illo tempore, remote and inaccessible; but the second stanza brings them close and alive in a series of marvelous smiles. (I am particularly fond of the polite and quiet houseguests.) The images of the valley and of uncut or uncarved wood will recur again and again.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Be completely empty.</p>
<p dir="auto">The return to the root</p>
<p dir="auto">To know what endures</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: To those who will not admit morality without a deity to validate it, or spirituality of which man is not the measure, the firmness of Lao Tzu’s morality and the sweetness of his spiritual counsel must seem incomprehensible, or illegitimate, or very troubling indeed.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">True leaders</p>
<p dir="auto">To give no trust</p>
<p dir="auto">When the work’s done right,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: This invisible leader, who gets things done in such a way that people think they did it all themselves, isn’t one who manipulates others from behind the scenes; just the opposite. Again, it’s a matter of “doing without doing”: uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force. An example or analogy might be a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">In the degradation of the great way</p>


<p dir="auto">Stop being holy, forget being prudent,</p>
<p dir="auto">But even these three rules</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: This chapter and the two before it may be read as a single movement of thought.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">How much difference between yes and no?</p>
<p dir="auto">What the people fear</p>
<p dir="auto">Everybody’s cheerful,</p>
<p dir="auto">Forlorn, forlorn.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ignorant, ignorant.</p>
<p dir="auto">Everybody has something to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG:  The difference between yes and no, good and bad, is something only the “bright” people, the people with the answers, can understand. A poor stupid Taoist can’t make it out.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">The greatest power is the gift</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Mysticism rises from and returns to the irreducible, unsayable reality of “this.” “This” is the Way. This is the way.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Be broken to be whole.</p>
<p dir="auto">So wise souls hold to the one,</p>
<p dir="auto">Not showing themselves,</p>
<p dir="auto">What they used to say in the old days,</p>


<p dir="auto">Nature doesn’t make long speeches.</p>
<p dir="auto">The people who work with Tao</p>
<p dir="auto">Give yourself to the Way</p>
<p dir="auto">To give no trust</p>


<p dir="auto">You can’t keep standing on tiptoe</p>
<p dir="auto">Such stuff is to the Tao</p>


<p dir="auto">There is something</p>
<p dir="auto">all-pervading,</p>
<p dir="auto">If it must be named,</p>
<p dir="auto">So they say: “The Way is great,</p>
<p dir="auto">People follow earth,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: I’d like to call the “something” of the first line a lump -- an unshaped, undifferentiated lump, chaos, before the Word, before Form, before Change. Inside it is time, space, everything; in the womb of the Way.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Heavy is the root of light.</p>
<p dir="auto">So wise souls make their daily march</p>
<p dir="auto">Only when safe</p>
<p dir="auto">How can a lord of ten thousand chariots</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: I take heaviness to be the root matters of daily life, the baggage we bodily beings have to carry, such as food, drink, shelter, safety. If you go charging too far ahead of the baggage wagon you may be cut off from it; if you treat your body as unimportant you risk insanity or inanity.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Good walkers leave no track.</p>
<p dir="auto">So wise souls are good at caring for people,</p>
<p dir="auto">Good people teach people who aren’t good yet;</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: The hidden light and the deep mystery seem to be signals, saying “think about this” -- about care for what seems unimportant. In a teacher’s parental care for the insignificant student, and in a society’s respect for mothers, teachers, and other obscure people who educate, there is indeed illumination and a profoundly human mystery. Having replaced instinct with language, society, and culture, we are the only species that depends on teaching and learning. We aren’t human without them. In them is true power. But are they the occupations of the rich and mighty?</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Knowing man</p>
<p dir="auto">Knowing light</p>
<p dir="auto">Knowing glory</p>
<p dir="auto">Natural wood is cut up</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: The simplicity of Lao Tzu’s language can present an almost impenetrable density of meaning. The reversals and paradoxes in this great poem are the oppositions of the yin and yang -- male/female, light/dark, glory/modesty -- but the “knowing and being” of them, the balancing act, results in neither stasis nor synthesis. The riverbed in which power runs leads back, the patterns of power lead back, the valley where power is contained leads back -- to the forever new, endless, straightforward way. Reversal, recurrence, are the movement, and yet the movement is onward.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Those who think to win the world</p>
<p dir="auto">Under heaven some things lead, some follow,</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise soul keeps away</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: For Lao Tzu, “moderation in all things” isn’t just a bit of safe, practical advice. To lose the sense of the sacredness of the world is a mortal loss. To injure our world by excesses of greed and ingenuity is to endanger our own sacredness.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">A Taoist wouldn’t advise a ruler</p>
<p dir="auto">Where the army marched</p>
<p dir="auto">Things flourish then perish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: This first direct statement of Lao Tzu’s pacifism is connected in thought to the previous poem and leads directly to the next.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Even the best weapon</p>
<p dir="auto">Weapons are unhappy tools,</p>
<p dir="auto">It is right that the murder of many people</p>


<p dir="auto">The way goes on forever nameless.</p>
<p dir="auto">To order, to govern,</p>
<p dir="auto">The Way in the world</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: The second verse connects to the uncut, the uncarved, the unusable, to the idea of the unnamed presented in the first chapter: “name’s the mother of the ten thousand things.” You have to make order, you have to make distinctions, but you also have to know when to stop before you’ve lost the whole in the multiplicity of parts. The simplicity or singleness of the Way is that of water, which always rejoins itself.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Knowing other people is intelligence,</p>
<p dir="auto">Boldly pushing forward takes resolution.</p>
<p dir="auto">To live till you die</p>


<p dir="auto">The Great Way runs</p>
<p dir="auto">Doing its work,</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise soul</p>


<p dir="auto">Hold fast to the great thought</p>
<p dir="auto">Walking around, we stop</p>


<p dir="auto">What seeks to shrink</p>
<p dir="auto">This is called the small dark light:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: There is a third stanza in all the texts:</p>
</blockquote>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Fish should stay underwater:  
the real means of rule  
should be kept dark.  "><pre><code>Fish should stay underwater:  
the real means of rule  
should be kept dark.  
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or, more literally, “the State’s sharp weapons ought not to be shown to the people.” This Machiavellian truism seems such an anticlimax to the great theme stated in the first verses that I treat it as an intrusion, perhaps a commentator’s practical example of “the small dark light.”</p>


<p dir="auto">The Way never does anything,</p>
<p dir="auto">In the unnamed, in the unshapen,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Here the themes of not doing and not wanting, the unnamed and the unshapen, recur together in one pure legato. It is wonderful how by negatives and privatives Lao Tzu gives a sense of serene, inexhaustible fullness of being.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Great power, not clinging to power,</p>
<p dir="auto">The good the truly good do</p>
<p dir="auto">So: when we lose the Way we find power;</p>
<p dir="auto">Obedience to law is the dry husk</p>
<p dir="auto">So great-minded people</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: A vast, dense argument in a minimum of words, this poem lays out the Taoist values in steeply descending order: the Way and its power; goodness (humane feeling); righteousness (morality); and -- a very distance last -- obedience (law and order). The word I render as “opinion” can be read as “knowing too soon”: the mind obeying orders, judging before the evidence is in, closed to fruitful perception and learning.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Those who of old got to be whole:</p>
<p dir="auto">Heaven through its wholeness is pure;</p>
<p dir="auto">Without what makes it pure, heaven would disintegrate;</p>
<p dir="auto">The root of the noble is in the common,</p>
<p dir="auto">A multiplicity of riches</p>


<p dir="auto">Return is how the Way moves.</p>
<p dir="auto">Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things</p>


<p dir="auto">Thoughtful people hear about the Way</p>
<p dir="auto">So they say:</p>
<p dir="auto">The great square has no corners.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Way is hidden</p>


<p dir="auto">The Way bears one.</p>
<p dir="auto">People despise</p>
<p dir="auto">What others teach, I say too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Beginning with a pocket cosmology, this chapter demonstrates the “interplay of energy” of yin and yang by showing how low and high, winning and losing, destruction and self-destruction, reverse themselves, each turning into its seeming opposite.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">What’s softest in the world</p>
<p dir="auto">The immaterial</p>
<p dir="auto">So I know the good in not doing.</p>
<p dir="auto">The wordless teaching,</p>


<p dir="auto">Which is nearer,</p>
<p dir="auto">All you grasp will be thrown away.</p>
<p dir="auto">Contentment keeps disgrace away.</p>


<p dir="auto">What’s perfectly whole seems flawed,</p>
<p dir="auto">True straightness looks crooked.</p>
<p dir="auto">To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving;</p>


<p dir="auto">When the world’s on the Way,</p>
<p dir="auto">The greatest evil: wanting more.</p>
<p dir="auto">To know enough’s enough</p>


<p dir="auto">You don’t have to go out the door</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise soul</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: We tend to expect great things from “seeing the world” and “getting experience.” A Roman poet remarked that travelers change their sky but not their soul. Other poets, untraveled and inexperienced, Emily Bronte and Emily Dickinson, prove Lao Tzu’s point: it’s the inner eye that really sees the world.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Studying and learning daily you grow larger.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run things,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: The word shi in the second stanza, my “fuss,” is troublesome to the translators. Carus’s quite legitimate translation of it is “diplomacy,” which would give a stanza I like very much:</p>
</blockquote>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="To run things,  
be undiplomatic.  
No diplomat  
is fit to run things.  "><pre><code>To run things,  
be undiplomatic.  
No diplomat  
is fit to run things.  
</code></pre></div>


<p dir="auto">The wise have no mind of their own,</p>
<p dir="auto">They’re good to good people</p>
<p dir="auto">They mingle their life with the world,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: The next to last line is usually read as saying that ordinary people watch and listen to wise people. But Lao Tzu has already told us that most of us wander on and off the Way and don’t know a sage from a sandpile. And surely the quiet Taoist is not a media pundit.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">To look for life</p>
<p dir="auto">So I’ve heard</p>


<p dir="auto">The Way bears them;</p>
<p dir="auto">Their reference for the Way</p>
<p dir="auto">To have without possessing,</p>


<p dir="auto">The beginning of everything</p>
<p dir="auto">Close the openings,</p>
<p dir="auto">Insight sees the insignificant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: This chapter on the themes of return and centering makes circles within itself and throughout the book returning to phrases from other poems, turning them round the center. A center which is everywhere, a circle whose circumference is infinite...</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">If my mind’s modest,</p>
<p dir="auto">The great way is low and plain,</p>
<p dir="auto">The palace is full of splendor</p>
<p dir="auto">People wearing ornaments and fancy clothes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: So much for capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Well planted is not uprooted,</p>
<p dir="auto">To follow the way yourself is real power.</p>
<p dir="auto">So in myself I see what self is,</p>
<p dir="auto">How do I know the world is so?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: I follow Waley’s interpretation of this chapter. It is Tao that plants and keeps; the various kinds of power belong to Tao; and finally in myself I see the Tao of self, and so on.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: As a model for the Taoist, the baby is in many ways ideal: totally unaltruistic, not interested in politics, business, or the proprieties, weak, soft, and able to scream placidly for hours without wearing itself out (its parents are another matter). The baby’s unawareness of poisonous insects and carnivorous beasts means that such dangers simply do not exist for it. (Again, its parents are a different case.)</p>

<p dir="auto">Who knows</p>
<p dir="auto">blunting edge,</p>
<p dir="auto">Then you can’t be controlled by love</p>


<p dir="auto">Run the country by doing what’s expected.</p>
<p dir="auto">The more restrictions and prohibitions in the world,</p>
<p dir="auto">So a wise leader might say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: A strong political statement of the central idea of wu wei, not doing, inaction.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">When the government’s dull and confused,</p>
<p dir="auto">The normal changes into the monstrous,</p>
<p dir="auto">And so the wise</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: In the first verse, the words “dull and confused” and “sharp and keen” are, as Waley points out, the words used in chapter 20 to describe the Taoist and the non-Taoists.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">In looking after your life and following the way,</p>
<p dir="auto">Invulnerable, unlimited,</p>


<p dir="auto">Rule a big country</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Thomas Jefferson would have liked the first stanza.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">The polity of greatness</p>
<p dir="auto">By stillness the woman</p>
<p dir="auto">So a great country</p>
<p dir="auto">Lie low to be on top,</p>


<p dir="auto">The way is the hearth and home</p>
<p dir="auto">Fine words are for sale,</p>
<p dir="auto">So, at the coronation of the Son of Heaven</p>
<p dir="auto">Why was the Way honored</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: I think the line of thought throughout the poe has to do with true reward as opposed to dishonorable gain, true giving as opposed to fake goods.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Do without doing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Meet injury</p>
<p dir="auto">Study the hard while it’s easy.</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise soul,</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless,</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Waley says that this charmingly complex chapter plays with two proverbs. “Requite injuries with good deeds” is the first. The word te, here meaning goodness or good deeds, is the same word Lao Tzu uses for the Power of the Way. (“Power is goodness,” he says in chapter 49.) So, having neatly annexed the Golden Rule, he goes on to the proverb about “taking things too lightly” and plays paradox with it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">It’s easy to keep hold of what hasn’t stirred,</p>
<p dir="auto">The tree you can’t reach your arms around</p>

<p dir="auto">That’s why the wise</p>


<p dir="auto">Once upon a time</p>
<p dir="auto">People get hard to manage</p>
<p dir="auto">Mysterious power</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Where shall we find a ruler wise enough to know what to teach and what to withhold? “Once upon a time,” maybe, in the days of myth and legend, as a pattern, a model, an ideal?</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Lakes and rivers are lords of the hundred valleys.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just so, a wise soul,</p>
<p dir="auto">And so the wise soul</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: One of the things I love in Lao Tzu is his good cheer, as in this poem, which while giving good counsel is itself a praise and enjoyment of the spirit of yin, the water-soul that yields, follows, eludes, and leads on, dancing in the hundred valleys.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Everybody says my way is great</p>
<p dir="auto">All greatness</p>
<p dir="auto">I have three treasures.</p>
<p dir="auto">But to brave without compassion,</p>
<p dir="auto">Compassion wins the battle</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: The first two verses of this chapter are a joy to me.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: A piece of sound tactical advice (practiced by the martial arts, such as Aikido, and by underground resistance and guerilla forces), which leads to a profound moral warning. The prize thrown away by the aggressor is compassion. The yielder, the griever, the mourner, keeps that prize. The game is loser takes all.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">My words are so easy to understand,</p>
<p dir="auto">and yet nobody in the world</p>
<p dir="auto">Words come from an ancestry,</p>
<p dir="auto">In my obscurity</p>


<p dir="auto">To know without knowing is best.
Not knowing without knowing it is sick.</p>
<p dir="auto">To be sick of sickness
is the only cure.</p>
<p dir="auto">The wise aren’t sick.
They’re sick of sickness,
so they’re well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: What you know without knowing you know it is the right kind of knowledge. Any other kind (conviction, theory, dogmatic belief, opinion) isn’t the right kind, and if you don’t know that, you’ll lose the Way. This chapter is an example of exactly what Lao Tzu was talking about in the last one -- obscure clarity, well-concealed jade.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">When we don’t fear what we should fear
we are in fearful danger.
We ought not to live in narrow houses,
we ought not to do stupid work.</p>
<p dir="auto">If we don’t accept stupidity
we won’t act stupidly.
So, wise souls know but don’t show themselves,
look after but don’t prize themselves,
letting the one go, keeping the other.</p>


<p dir="auto">Brave daring leads to death.
Brave caution leads to life.
The choice can be the right one
or the wrong one.</p>
<p dir="auto">Who will interpret
the judgment of heaven?
Even the wise soul
finds it hard.</p>
<p dir="auto">The way of heaven
doesn’t compete
yet wins handily,
doesn’t speak
yet answers fully,
doesn’t summon
yet attracts.
It acts
perfectly easily.</p>
<p dir="auto">The net of heaven
is vast, vast,
wide-meshed,
yet missing nothing.</p>


<p dir="auto">When normal, decent people don’t fear death,
how can you use death to frighten them?
Even when they have a normal fear of death,
who of us dare take and kill the one who doesn’t?
When people are normal and decent and death-fearing,
there’s always an executioner.
To take the place of that executioner
is to take the place of the great carpenter.
People who cut the great carpenter’s wood
seldom get off with their hands unhurt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: To Lao Tzu, not to fear dying and not to fear killing are equally unnatural and antisocial. Who are we to forestall the judgment of heaven or nature,
to usurp the role of “the executioner”? “The Lord of Slaughter” is Waley’s grand translation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">People are starving.
The rich gobble taxes,
that’s why people are starving.</p>
<p dir="auto">People rebel.
The rich oppress them,
that’s why people rebel.</p>
<p dir="auto">People hold life cheap.
The rich make it too costly,
that’s why people hold it cheap.</p>
<p dir="auto">But those who don’t live for the sake of living
are worth more than the wealth-seekers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: How many hundreds of years ago was this book written? And yet still this chapter must be written in the present tense.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Living people
are soft and tender.
Corpses are hard and stiff.
The ten thousand things,
the living grass, the trees,
are soft, pliant.
Dead, they’re dry and brittle.</p>
<p dir="auto">So hardness and stiffness
go with death;
tenderness, softness,
go with life.</p>
<p dir="auto">And the hard sword fails,
the stiff tree’s felled.
The hard and great go under.
The soft and weak stay up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: In an age when hardness is supposed to be the essence of strength, and even the beauty of women is reduced nearly to the bone, I welcome this reminder that tanks and tombstones are not very adequate role models, and that to be alive is to be vulnerable.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">The Way of heaven
is like a bow bent to shoot:
its top end brought down,
its lower end raised up.
It brings the high down,
lifts the low,
takes from those who have,
gives to those who have not.</p>
<p dir="auto">Such is the Way of heaven,
taking from people who have,
giving to people who have not.
Not so the human way:
it takes from those who have not
to fill up those who have.
Who has enough to fill up everybody?
Only those who have the Way.</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise
do without claiming,
achieve without asserting,
wishing not to show their worth.</p>


<p dir="auto">Nothing in the world
is as soft, as weak, as water;
nothing else can wear away
the hard, the strong,
and remain unaltered.
Soft overcomes hard,
weak overcomes strong.
Everybody knows it,
nobody uses the knowledge.</p>
<p dir="auto">So the wise say:
By bearing common defilements
you become a sacrificer at the altar of earth;
by bearing common evils
you become a lord of the world.</p>
<p dir="auto">Right words sound wrong.</p>


<p dir="auto">After a great enmity is settled
some enmity always remains.
How to make peace?
Wise souls keep their part of the contract
and don’t make demands on others.
People whose power is real fulfill their obligations;
people whose power is hollow insist on their claims.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Way of heaven plays no favorites.
It stays with the good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: This chapter is equally relevant to private relationships and to political treaties. Its realistic morality is based on a mystical perception of the fullness of the Way.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">Let there be a little country without many people.
Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred,
and never use them.
Let them be mindful of death
and disinclined to long journeys.
They’d have ships and carriages,
but no place to go.
They’d have armor and weapons,
but no parades.
Instead of writing,
they might go back to using knotted cords.
They’d enjoy eating,
take pleasure in clothes,
be happy with their houses,
devoted to their customs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The next little country might be so close
the people could hear cocks crowing
and dogs barking there,
but they’d get old and die
without ever having been there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> UKLG: Waley says this endearing and enduring vision “can be understood in the past, present, or future tense, as the reader desires.” This is always true of the vision of the golden age, the humane society.
Christian or Cartesian dualism, the division of spirit or mind from the material body and world, existed long before Christianity or Descartes and was never limited to Western thought (though it is the “craziness” or “sickness” that many people under Western domination see in Western civilization). Lao Tzu thinks the materialistic dualist, who tries to ignore the body and live in the head, and the religious dualist, who despises the body and lives for a reward in heaven, are both dangerous and in danger. So, enjoy your life, he says; live in your body, you are your body; where else is there to go? Heaven and earth are one. As you walk the streets of your town you walk on the Way of heaven.</p>
</blockquote>


<p dir="auto">True words aren’t charming,
charming words aren’t true.
Good people aren’t contentious,
contentious people aren’t good.
People who know aren’t learned,
learned people don’t know.</p>
<p dir="auto">Wise souls don’t hoard;
the more they do for others the more they have,
the more they give the richer they are.
The Way of heaven profits without destroying.
Doing without outdoing
is the Way of the wise.</p>


<p dir="auto">This is a rendition, not a translation. I do not know any Chinese. I could approach the text at all only because Paul Carus, in his 1898 translation of the Tao Te Ching, printed the Chinese text with each character followed by a transliteration and a translation. My gratitude to him is unending.</p>
