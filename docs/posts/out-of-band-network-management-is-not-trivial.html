	<p><small>July  6, 2024</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the Canadian news items of the time interval is that <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/xona2024.htm">a
summary of the official report on the 2022 Rogers Internet and phone
outage has been released</a> (see
also the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rogers-outage-human-error-system-deficiencies-1.7255641">CBC summary of the summary</a>,
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Rogers_Communications_outage">Wikipedia page on the outage</a>). This
was an extremely major outage that took down both Internet and phone
service for a lot of people for roughly a day and caused a series
of failures in services and systems that turned out to rely on
Rogers for (enough of) their phone and Internet connectivity. In
the wake of the report, some people are (correctly) pointing to
Rogers not having any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_management">&#34;Out of Band&#34; network management</a> capability
as one of the major contributing factors. Some people have gone so
far as to suggest that out of band network management is an obvious
thing that everyone should have. As it happens I have some opinions
on this, and the capsule summary is that out of band network
management is non-trivial.</p>

<p>(While the outage &#39;only&#39; cut off an estimated 12 million people,
the total population of Canada is about 40 million people, so it
directly affected more than one in four Canadians.)</p>

<p>Obviously, doing out of band network management means that you need
a dedicated set of physical hardware for your OOB network; separate
switches, routers, local network cabling, and long distance fiber
runs between locations (whether that is nearby university buildings
or different cities). If you&#39;re serious, you probably want your OOB
fiber runs to have different physical paths than your regular network
fiber, so one backhoe accident can&#39;t cut both of them. This separate
network infrastructure has to run to everything you want to manage
and also to everywhere you want to manage your network from. This
is potentially a lot of physical hardware and networking, and as
they say it can get worse.</p>

<p>(This out of band network also absolutely has to be secure, because
it&#39;s a back door to your entire network.)</p>

<p>When you set up OOB network management, you have a choice to make;
is your OOB network the only way to manage equipment, or can you
manage equipment either &#39;in-band&#39; through your regular network or
through the out of band network. If your OOB network is your only
way of managing things, you not only have to build a separate
network, you have to make sure it is fully redundant, because
otherwise you&#39;ve created a single point of failure for (some)
management. If your OOB network is a backup, you don&#39;t necessarily
need as much redundancy (although you may want some), but now you
need to actively monitor and verify that both access paths work.
You also have two access paths to keep secure, instead of just one.</p>

<p>Security or rather access authentication is another complication
for out of band management networks. If you need your OOB network,
you have to assume that all other networks aren&#39;t working, which
means that everything your network routers, switches, and so on
need to authenticate your access has to be accessible through the
OOB management network (possibly in addition to through your regular
networks, if you also have in-band management). This may not be
trivial to arrange, depending on what sort of authentication system
you&#39;re using. You also need to make sure that your overall
authentication flow can complete using only OOB network information
and services (so, for example, your authentication server can&#39;t
reach out to a third party provider&#39;s MFA service to send push
notifications to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/MFABasicOptionsIn2023">authentication apps</a>
on people&#39;s phones).</p>

<p>Locally, <a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">we</a> have what I would
describe as a discount out of band management network. It has a
completely separate set of switches, cabling, and building to
building fiber runs, and some things have their management interfaces
on it. It doesn&#39;t have any redundancy, which is acceptable in our
particular environment. Unfortunately, because it&#39;s a completely
isolated network, it can be a bit awkward to use, especially if you
want to put a device on it that would appreciate modern conveniences
like the ability to send alert emails if something happens (or even
send syslog messages to a remote server; currently <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/CentralizeSyslog">our central
syslog server</a> isn&#39;t on this network, although
we should probably fix that).</p>

<p>In many cases I think you&#39;re better off having redundant and and
hardened in-band management, especially with smaller networks.
Running an out of band network is effectively having two separate
networks to look after instead of just one; if you have limited
resources (including time and attention), I think you&#39;re further
ahead focusing on making a single network solid and redundant rather
than splitting your efforts.</p>
