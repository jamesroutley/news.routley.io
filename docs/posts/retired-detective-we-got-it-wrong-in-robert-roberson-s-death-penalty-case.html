    <h1>Retired detective: We got it wrong in Robert Roberson&#39;s death penalty case</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><section><p>I was a police officer in Palestine, Texas, for 14 years. I was the supervising detective, investigating and providing oversight in a case where <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/01/11/robert-roberson-texas-death-penalty-shaken-baby/">Robert Roberson was accused of shaking his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki, to death</a>. I testified for the prosecution and helped send Roberson to death row in 2003. For 20 years, I have thought that something went very wrong in Roberson’s case and feared that justice was not served. If there is no movement to correct this injustice, I fear myself and others will carry our guilt eternally.</p><p>I have come to believe that Nikki died of accidental and natural causes. I am convinced that she was not murdered. Roberson is innocent. There was no crime. I believe this because the “science” that was used to obtain Roberson’s arrest and conviction has changed drastically since his arrest.</p><p>We investigators found no sign of violence in the home where Nikki had collapsed, and she did not look like she had been beaten. But after a CAT scan of her head, we were given three words: “shaken baby syndrome.” Those three words placed focus on Roberson to the exclusion of any other offender or potential cause of death. As an investigator, I deferred to the expert knowledge of a pediatrician and medical examiner in Dallas and followed their lead in explaining what then seemed inexplicable.</p><p>In 2002 when Roberson was arrested, the medical community seemed united in thinking that a child with Nikki’s set of internal symptoms must have been violently shaken or possibly struck against a hard surface, most likely by the last person with the child when she collapsed. Those, like Roberson, who denied doing anything to harm their injured children were assumed to be lying.</p><p>Now, however, I have observed how the version of the shaken baby hypothesis put before his jury as “fact” has been entirely debunked by evidence-based science. I also understand that a reexamination of the autopsy by experts has shown that Nikki had severe pneumonia, something that was not shared with us during the investigation. She was also taking prescribed medicines that are no longer given to children her age because they can cause fatal breathing problems. Now it is recognized that many naturally occurring diseases that cause oxygen deprivation, including pneumonia, as well as short falls with a head impact, can cause the same set of internal conditions that Nikki had.</p><p>There is another <a href="https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2018/05/dallas-county-exonerations-innocent-conviction-integrity-unit/">post-conviction shaken baby case out of Dallas </a>where the state has conceded that the convicted man should get a new trial. That conviction and Roberson’s both hinge on the shaken baby hypothesis, and both cases were tried in the same era (2000 and 2003, respectively) when a version of shaken baby, now universally rejected, was viewed as sound medical knowledge. Both trials featured the very same Dallas-based child abuse expert who told the juries that three medical findings, often referred to as the “triad”— subdural bleeding, brain swelling, an retinal hemorrhage—could support an inference that abusive shaking and blunt impact explained how the child had collapsed.</p><p>Over two decades later, the shaken baby hypothesis has been discredited and accused caregivers have been exonerated or granted new trials. According to the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/john-grisham-on-robert-roberson-texas-may-execute-an-innocent-man">National Registry of Exonerations, there have been at least 32 exonerations</a> of those wrongfully convicted under the shaken baby hypothesis. I believe Roberson is the only person currently on death row in the United States because of a conviction based on this discredited science.</p><p>Beyond science, I have been haunted by a number of issues. Primarily, why was Roberson’s demeanor always flat and emotionless? Roberson did not display the kinds of emotion that I’d expect from a distraught parent. But neither did he behave like a guilty suspect. I felt certain that a defense lawyer would present evidence of mental impairment. Only years after trial, in his appeals would we learn that Roberson was diagnosed with autism. This condition explains his apparent lack of emotion, but we — the detectives, the lawyers, the jury — did not understand that at the time.</p><p>Additionally, why did a nurse say that Nikki had been sexually abused when no one else — including me — saw any signs of such abuse? How and why did that insinuation get into the trial without any form of corroborating evidence?</p><p>Thankfully, we now have the opportunity to do something before it’s too late. Anderson County District Attorney Allyson Mitchell could pause and take another look at Roberson’s case. Although there is no execution date, the urgency is clear. A motion to reconsider a denial of Roberson’s innocence claim is pending in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. I hope they take another look. There needs to be a public reckoning.</p><p>I am asking for those who care deeply about justice to urge another look at this case. Objectively, considering all the questions that have been raised and how science has evolved since 2003. It would be a terrible legacy for all of us to be associated with executing an innocent man based on a rush to judgment and bad science.</p><p>We must prevent Texas from making a tragic, irreversible mistake.</p><p><i>Brian Wharton is an ordained elder in the United Methodist Church.
