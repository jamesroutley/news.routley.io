    <h1>My Cord-Cutting Adventure (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div size="+2">
    I&#39;m not into conspiracy theories, but you&#39;d swear there was one against cord-cutting.  Cord-cutting shouldn&#39;t be any more of an &#34;adventure&#34; than buying a toaster. But it is.

      For starters, the consumer electronics industry, normally so eager to sell us computers, laptops, pads, phones, and watches; the industry that for 30 years has sold us VCRs, competed over Beta vs VHS and Super-VHS (look it up, it existed), then sold us DVDs, DVD recorders with DVD-R and DVD-RW, then sold us DVRs that recorded standard definition, then sold us Blu-Ray players of increasing degrees of quality and declining prices...these days, they&#39;ve utterly given up selling us anything that can record video.
    </p><p>
      The DVR was so beloved, the culmination of decades of home video-entertainment recording into the most-convenient possible form, it was called &#34;God&#39;s Machine&#34; by the chair of the FCC. <br clear="left"/>
    </p><h4>Casus Belli</h4>
      Now they are gone from stores, at least in Canada. The change shows us how little oligopoly differs from monopoly where it counts.   Canada has a very tight little oligopoly of TV providers: Shaw, Rogers, Bell, Telus - few enough to meet in an apartment bathroom.   There was no objective, technical reason to extend this oligopoly from TV signals to the consumer electronics of video recorders.  Great technical agonies had been already done to ensure that the new HDTV video plug, &#34;HDMI&#34;, would be required to include &#34;HDCP&#34; - high-def copy protection - so that you couldn&#39;t just take a video signal from your Blu-Ray and make another Blu-Ray.  The same could have been applied to cable movies.

      Even participating in that restriction of user rights to copy was already a new legal innovation.  The cable/satellite companies had no stake of their own in whether Disney movies could be copied and the purchase of discs avoided. One would think they&#39;d be compelled to help Disney&#39;s bottom line only at gunpoint, their own interests being to give their customers the best TV experience they could.  People had been recording TV for 20 years when the HDTV switch came along; the function was a very free and open market, as many firms competed to come up with the best recorder features, quality and price - and that free market worked its magic, the products kept getting better.  Shutting down that free market, into a literal company store of bad choices, was not in consumer&#39;s interest.
    </p><p>
      Content providers had already been proven wrong when they freaked out at this, industry spokesman Jack Valenti comparing the VCR to the Boston Strangler.  Instead, people loved to buy commercial tapes and discs as presents, the ownership of a TV-recorded movie having all the cachet that &#34;music recorded from radio&#34; had enjoyed since the cassette tape came out in 1969: none.  
    </p><p>
      But their paranoia broke out again with digital recording: it would be of perfect quality, eliminate the stigma, and wipe out their disc sales.   Oddly, at the time, the ability to do perfect digital music copies from CD to CD-R was not really destroying the music industry.   All the destruction was happening from low-quality MP3 recordings being <i>very easily available</i> by download.
</p><p>
	  Since then, movie disc sales have been drastically reduced by the comparable easy availability of video streaming.  Even worse for disc rentals: the convenience of Netflix actually killed video stores, just as they jumped to high-quality Blu-Rays. The lower quality of streaming had nothing to do with it.
      <br clear="right"/></p><p>
    It doesn&#39;t really require a conspiracy theory where Disney and Universal conspire with cable-TV to kill off home recording; if the cablecos could make money by doing it, they&#39;d need no other incentive.
    </p><p>
      I rented or purchased, from both Shaw Cable and Bell Satellite, two different DVR machines over the early 21st century.  They were pretty good quality compared to the standard-def DVR I&#39;d used in the late 1990s that could burn its hard-drive recordings to DVD-R.  They were still trying to sell the new, more-expensive, HDTV at all, with many not seeing much from it.
</p><p>
  With the Shaw HD-DVR, however, there was no way to save content. Indeed, while the Shaw effort could save even more movies to a plug-in hard drive, all your content was lost if you stopped your cable subscription: the recording format was (pointlessly) proprietary, and only your rented Shaw DVR could read it.  You could &#34;buy&#34; the DVR with time-payments, which meant that any repairs could still only be done by Shaw, who would charge you for repairing your property - but you still couldn&#39;t use it without the subscription running.
</p><h4>The Final Straw</h4>
  Then in 2015, I moved, and we got the new, CRTC-demanded, minimal cable subscription for $25 per month; and paid more to rent/buy a minimal DVR.   Minimal was the word for it.  The computer that runs it is so inadequate to the task that it frequently reboots, often while recording, leaving a truncated recording.  The lack of CPU horsepower is revealed by its response to a series of commands from the remote: more than three &#34;jump ahead&#34; clicks during an ad block, and it refuses to take any more for most of a minute while it catches its breath.   I tried to wrestle with it, called the 1-800 and all that, but its failures were intermittent and hard to replicate, so nothing was fixed. Finally, this was what inspired me to cord-cut.
<p>
  It&#39;s not the cost of the cable plan that pushed me over: it was their arrogance in selling me a DVR that was distinctly inferior in performance to my first DVR from nearly 20 years earlier - the arrogance of a monopoly that knows you have to eat what they feed you.
</p><p>
  Meanwhile, at Best Buy, there were no recording devices.  On a recent (spring 2019) trip, I saw a lot of TVs, half a shelf of Blu-Ray players, a DVD player, and half a shelf devoted to two Over-The-Air (OTA) antenna choices.  The antennas were accompanied by posters advertising that you could use them to &#34;cut the cord and watch TV for free Over-The-Air&#34;...but zero shelf space for a DVR that would work with them.
</p><h4>The Antenna</h4>
 <a href="https://www.terk.com/indoor-antennas/?sku=LOGTVAZ"><img src="https://olivia.website/notes/examples-of-naming-in-computer-systems/antenna.jpg"/></a>
 The antenna, I&#39;d already purchased, when we nearly cord-cut back in Calgary before we retired to Vancouver.  I got it at Radio Shack for about $80.  It&#39;s still available as the <a href="https://www.terk.com/indoor-antennas/?sku=LOGTVAZ">Terk Logtvaz.</a>
<p>
  My only problem with it turned out to be that the amplifier was too strong.  The swoopy-looking triangular piece is the real HDTV antenna; it also has rabbit ears for picking up the VHF signal (channels 2-13) which does not seem to be used any more, at least in Canada; all the HD stations are up in the UHF range the swoopy-bit is for.
</p><p>
  A coax cable comes from the back of it and goes into a coax input on your HDTV.  A few inches short of that end is a box hardly bigger than a matchbox, which has a little power cord going to a small power brick for your wall socket, max output 0.9W.  This amplifies the HD signal.
</p><p>
  The antenna is directional, you have to point it at the broadcast station for best results.  All this can be sorted out with no DVR, just plug the antenna into your HDTV and see what you can pull in.
  <a href="https://olivia.website/notes/examples-of-naming-in-computer-systems/www.tvfool.com">The job is made trivial with a web site called &#34;tvfool.com&#34;.</a>
</p><p>
  TVfool is just a database of where all the transmitters are in North America, and can find locations for your address; that and a little computation provides a web map of what direction all the transmitters around you are from your house.
</p><p>
 After plugging in my address and waiting a minute, TVfool provides this very nice little compass-point map for you, and a list of available transmitters.
  </p><p>
  For the rest, you just grab your phone and put in &#34;DTV antennas&#34; into your app search.  On Android, at least, I quickly found <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.com.lichtmaier.antenas&amp;hl=en_CA">There&#39;s an App For That</a>.
</p><p>
  This app uses the magnetic compass inside your smartphone, so beware: these can be a little glitchy.  Mine worked perfectly when I installed, but was pointing in another direction when I checked a day later, confusing me; I was advised to tap the phone a bit, power cycle it, to joggle the compass into behaving.  So do check your phone&#39;s compass, see if it can find North before trusting it to find East-Northeast-by-North.

In my location, I hardly needed to know which channel names were the ones on Mt. Seymour: the top three all pointed in the same direction, and that was it.  I pointed the antenna at 62 degrees as if every degree counted, and six channels came in crystal-clear.  The only ones that matter, of course, are CBC, CTV, and Global, unless you want the French CBC (also in the same place) or local-access programming for several other languages like Mandarin and Punjabi.  The sixth one calls itself &#34;CTV2&#34;, but most of its content is CBC, confusing me.   Nearly everything we watch is on CTV, in any event.
</p><p>
  <img src="https://olivia.website/notes/examples-of-naming-in-computer-systems/amplifier.jpg"/>
  In subsequent days, I realized I had some spotty reception on the lowest-numbered channel (presumably lowest frequency?), CBC.  Morning reception, in particular, would have cut-outs of the sound for a few seconds, as often as every minute; and even some breakup of the pixels in the image.
</p><p>
  I was fiddling around some more, checking connections, and cursing my balky compass in the smartphone, when I bumped the OFF switch on the little amplifier box that&#39;s a few inches short of the end of the coax from the Terk antenna. (Picture at right.) The signal cleared up at once.
</p><p>
  I checked the other channels, and they were fine; all has been fine, since.  Alas, you must leave the amplifier plugged in; I unplugged it and all signal was lost, so I assume that the amplifier needs to be on for signal to get through it at all.  The cost will be a small fraction of a watt.
</p><p>
  So, at this point, you&#39;ve spent maybe $80 Canadian, spent less than an hour, and you&#39;ve gone, if not back to the future, back to 1955: you can watch TV over-the-air again.   You just can&#39;t record it, which after 36 years since my first VCR, feels like going back from a fridge to an icebox.   It&#39;s funny to think, now, that one must be pretty grey-haired to even remember the era where you had to be there in front of the TV when your show was on, or miss it entirely.  It seems like an ancient time even to those of us who do remember it.
</p><p>
  Everybody who does this has one immediate reaction: damn, that&#39;s one clear, sharp picture.  Better than cable.  Here&#39;s the reason.  OTA broadcasts must meet a legally defined broadcast quality: they&#39;re all at the top quality that HD can provide.  Cable providers, on the other hand, are not using public airwaves; and they have captured their regulators so fully the CRTC has to ask for sunlight to be piped down to them.  They have cheerfully given the OK for Shaw and friends to cut down their bandwidth until you complain, and they cut it down until people start calling to say this is worse than standard definition.  They do provide a good 6 Mb/s for fast-moving, detail-needed imagery like football games; but for the evening news, it might be a quarter of that.  OTA, it&#39;s all at the top quality.
</p><h4>NOTE FROM FOUR MONTHS LATER: This antenna location ultimately did not work out. Scroll to the very bottom for the addendum!</h4>
  </div><p><SPAN size="+2">
  So, OTA fans, there&#39;s your lesson for today: always complain about bad reception in the new digital era.  It might be sunspots or lightning, but it might also be some techie being a jerk.  The CBC, at least, has really good staff waiting for your call.  All praise for our national broadcaster.
