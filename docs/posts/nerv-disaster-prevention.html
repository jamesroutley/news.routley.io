      In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, when everything came to a standstill, the availability of information was the difference between life and death for many people. While some lives were saved by the information they had beforehand, others may have lost their lives because of it.</p><div id="mainContainer">

        <div>
          <p>
            The Strong-Motion Monitor layer is a feature that displays the real-time shaking situation throughout Japan, as observed by the Strong-Motion Observation Network (a network of seismometers for recording strong shaking), operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). When an Earthquake Early Warning (Forecast) is issued, the Strong-Motion Monitor layer automatically integrates and displays the information from the EEW, including the forecasted Seismic Intensity distribution, and estimated propagation of the P and S waves along side the Strong-Motion data.</p>

          <p>
            The Strong-Motion Monitor layer has been experimentally worked on since February 2023 based on the &#34;Joint Research Implementation Plan for the Utilisation of Strong-Motion Monitor Data&#34; which was established by four parties: the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED), Gehirn Inc., TBS Television Inc., and TBS / JNN NEWS DIG LLC. This service has been made available to the general public through the &#34;Mutual Cooperation Agreement for the Utilisation of Strong-Motion Monitor Data&#34;. Gehirn Inc. processes and distributes the information received from a dedicated communications line installed at NIED. This dedicated line uses a redundant configuration to ensure a fast and reliable service for the NERV Disaster Prevention app. Please note that this is a separate service from the &#34;Strong-Motion Monitor&#34; web service provided by NIED.

            The NERV Disaster Prevention app is a smartphone service that delivers optimised disaster prevention and weather information, such as earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption bulletins, as well as landslide, flooding and inundation risk information based on the user’s current and registered locations. The app has been developed to assist residents and visitors to areas where damage is expected to occur to accurately recognise the situation and make quick decisions to be able to take action.</p>

        <h2>Various Disaster Information<span>All in One Place</span></h2>
        <p>
            Receive a wide range of disaster prevention information - real-time earthquake early warnings (with expected seismic intensity at your current location and a countdown until the arrival of shaking), earthquake, tsunami, and volcanic eruption early warnings, weather warnings and advisories, landslide, flooding and inundation risk distribution, rain cloud radar, real-time weather observations, typhoon information, ashfall forecasts, snow depth, and even J-Alert (Civil Protection Information) - in just one app. By touching the map displayed on the screen, you can view rain cloud conditions and local seismic intensity at any scale.

            <p>
              The home screen displays the information you need at the time and place you need it. When there’s an earthquake, the home screen will show you the latest information. If another type of warning or alert is issued while the earthquake is active, the app will sort them depending on the type, elapsed time and urgency, so you’ll always have the most important information at your fingertips.</p>

            <h2>Push Notifications for Important Information</h2>
            <p>
              We send out different types of notifications depending on the device’s location, the type of information and level of urgency. If the information is not urgent, we send a silent notification as not to disturb the user. For more urgent situations where a disaster is time-sensitive, a ‘Critical Alert’ alerts the user to an imminent danger. Notifications like Earthquake Early Warnings (Alert level) and Tsunami Warnings will be forced to sound, even if the device is in Silent or Do Not Disturb modes.
            </p>
            <p>
              ※ If you prefer not to have critical alerts, you can disable them at any time from; [iOS] Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Critical Alerts, or [Android] Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Silent Mode Exception (Android 9.0 or later). When disabled, critical alerts will be treated as normal notifications.

            When we imagined what would happen if a blackout like the one caused by the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake were to occur in the Tokyo metropolitan area, we could see ourselves helplessly regretting our lack of preparedness. As long as such events are possible, we want to be as prepared as possible.

            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>
              The NERV Disaster Prevention app puts user privacy and security first. The app does not acquire any information about the user or their device that are not required to help the app to function. The user’s detailed location information (precise position) is only used for disaster prevention purposes and is calculated and processed entirely on-device, and is never transmitted externally. Location information required for push notifications of disaster prevention information is stored on the device only after having been converted to an area code (similar to that of a postcode). No location history is stored either on your device or the server, so your movements cannot be tracked.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Credibility</h3>
            <p>
              The Earthquake Early Warning service of the NERV Disaster Prevention app has been reviewed for operational systems, equipment and technical suitability, and is distributed under a licence from the Director General of the Japan Meteorological Agency to forecast earthquake ground motion. The <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/know/bosai/ame_push.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risk Distribution notification service</a> was jointly developed with the JMA as a cooperating operator. Other disaster prevention and weather information that’s displayed in the app is processed independently based on JMA data. The maps are independently created based on the Geographical Survey Institute’s map data.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>System Reliability</h3>
            <p>
              The NERV Disaster Prevention app’s information processing system is connected by a dedicated line to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s main office in Tokyo, and the Meteorological Service Support Centre at the Osaka District Meteorological Observatory. The system is geographically redundant with multiple data centres based in Tokyo and Osaka, and is designed to be able to continue working in the event of a major disaster.

          <h3>Privacy <sup>※3</sup></h3>
          <p>Acquired location information and registered area information is used only for displaying disaster prevention information and sending push notifications. Location information sent from the application to the server is converted into an area code or mesh code in advance, within the application (client side), and only those codes are sent over the internet. In other words, the user’s detailed location coordinates never leave your device.</p>

          <p>If the app&#39;s location setting is set to &#34;Always Allow,&#34; the app will periodically retrieve your location in the background. This should have very little impact on your battery life. Also, when &#34;Low Power Mode&#34; is enabled, the app will not update your location in order to reduce power consumption.</p>
