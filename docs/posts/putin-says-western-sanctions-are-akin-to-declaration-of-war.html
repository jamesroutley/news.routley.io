Such a step he said would have catastrophic consequences for Europe and the world.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The NATO military alliance has rejected Kyiv&#39;s request for a no-fly zone, on the grounds it would escalate the war beyond Ukraine into a far wider conflict, potentially pitting the United States against Russia.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">&#39;GOING TO PLAN&#39;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Asked about reports that Russian conscripts had been used in Ukraine, Putin said none had been involved and said the military operation was going to plan.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">&#34;There is not one conscript and we don&#39;t plan for there to be,&#34; Putin said. &#34;Our army will fulfil all the tasks. I don&#39;t doubt that at all. Everything is going to plan.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">That description was at odds with assessments from U.S. and British officials. British military intelligence said on Thursday that Russia&#39;s advance on the Ukrainian capital had made little progress and encountered staunch resistance. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-intelligence-says-russian-advance-kyiv-has-made-little-progress-2022-03-03/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Putin dismissed concerns that some sort of martial law or emergency situation could be declared in Russia. He said such a measure was imposed only when there was significant internal or external threat.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">&#34;We don&#39;t plan to introduce any kind of special regime on Russian territory - there is currently no need,&#34; Putin said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the West was behaving like a bandit by cutting economic relations over the conflict in Ukraine but that Russia was far too big to be isolated as the world was much larger than just the United States and Europe. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-west-is-behaving-like-bandits-2022-03-05/"> read more </a></p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Reuters
