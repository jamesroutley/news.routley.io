<p>The other day I was playing around with Claude Code, experimenting with porting
some C code to Rust - not for any particular reason, just because I was curious
how well it could do. As these things happen, I got more and more invested in
the process, instead of just letting Claude do something and noting what
happened, I kept poking in and adjusting the behavior, &#34;no you can&#39;t pretend the
result is 0, try again&#34; - the usual stuff when you&#39;re trying to get an LLM to do
something large or novel.</p>
<p>But I got so invested in seeing the port of the module work that I forgot that
my original goal was to see how well the LLM could do on its own. Instead of
testing a potentially interesting hypothesis, I was poorly porting a module of a
project that I had no interest in continuing. I was only rescued in this case
from my pains by the LLM itself: Claude hit some kind of rate-limiting
error, forcing me to take a break from the project.</p>
<p>Once I was forced away, I found myself possessed with a sudden clarity: why on
earth had I 5 minutes ago become so invested in this particular task?  Given the
forced break, my brain &#34;reset&#34; and I could step away from it, and go back to
thinking about the original problem and what my goals and conclusions were. <em>But
there was no way in the moment I could do so.</em> I just couldn&#39;t let it go.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t of course the first time that this has happened. Sometimes the breaks
are imposed: my wife and I are off to get lunch, and while walking to the door I
realize the last 2 hours spent feverishly trying to get some RPC from A to B to
work are actually pointless and there&#39;s some much simpler solution. Other times
I find myself sitting back and catching myself getting too deep into a problem.</p>
<p>Of course, in any big enough problem, you&#39;re never sure what to do initially.
You have to just... explore, and correct yourself if you&#39;re off. There&#39;s an
unresolvable tension between trying to get through the problem at hand and
contemplating &#34;maybe this isn&#39;t the right direction after all&#34;. At least I can&#39;t
seem to hold both of them in my head at the same time: if you&#39;re trying to debug
some subtle problem involving 10 layers of software and hardware, you can&#39;t
afford the brain space for questioning whether you&#39;d be better off trying a
different approach. But even more, the tenacity that makes you stick on
problems, it&#39;s almost the thing that makes you a good engineer. You need to be
stubborn and willing to push through stupid problems in order to get things
done.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an easy solution: how do you know when you&#39;re in too deep?
In RL we&#39;d probably characterize this as a variation on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration%E2%80%93exploitation_dilemma">Exploration/Exploitation</a>
-- how much energy should we invest into getting &#34;just this next bug fixed and
working&#34; versus taking a sip of tea and then you should change your approach or change your job?</p>
<p>Spending too much time fixating on one thing leads you towards a sort of
monomaniacal obsession with it: &#34;functional programming is the only way&#34; sort of
thing. On the other hand, you can fixate the other way and spend all your time
contemplating what the best thing is to do, leading to a weird sort of nihilism
as you question everything while you watch life go by. And yet stepping away
from our problems can be such a powerful tool for us, giving us the space to
understand if we&#39;re doing the right thing: you can&#39;t see the forest for the
trees and all that.</p>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve found myself adopting a sort of ritual for stepping back and
reflecting. I find if I align it to natural time boundaries: hours, days, weeks,
months, years, I can sort of set a mental schedule for myself and it&#39;s not too
much of a distraction. When I take a break, I can ask myself the usual
questions: &#34;what am I doing?&#34;, &#34;why am I doing it?&#34;, &#34;what could I be doing
instead?&#34;. I find this can be cathartic as well, letting me note progress as
well as struggles.</p>
<p>(It should be taken for given that of course it&#39;s really hard to switch your
mindset from &#34;debugging this thing is really important&#34; to &#34;should I debug this
thing at all&#34;, <em>while you&#39;re in the middle of debugging said thing</em>. But you
know, you just try your best, sometimes your brain refuses to let go, and other
times, maybe you get enough space to decide going off for a beer is the better
bet.)</p>
<p>Of course, the amount of time deliberating and the scope of the questions
changes with the time duration: I don&#39;t want to question why I&#39;m working at my
job 8 times at day, but maybe once a week is okay? Conversely, I can afford 1
minute an hour to jot down what I&#39;m trying to do: I&#39;m not contemplating throwing
away a project at that point, but maybe the scope of a feature or how I&#39;m
debugging an issue.</p>
<p>But once a year, well then maybe it&#39;s worth taking a day off from everything and
contemplating where you&#39;re going in life: are you happy with your decisions? In
a way you&#39;re paying 1% of your time and energy as a sort of insurance against
wandering too far in a bad direction. Not a bad trade.</p>
