    <h1>Why is Swift so slow (timeout) in compiling this code? (2022)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <p>I filed a number of bugs some time ago about this issue:</p>

<p>In particular (some are somewhat fixed):</p>






<p>You can see the quadratic complexity in this diagram:</p>


<p>It&#39;s quite common in rendering to include precomputed arrays:</p>


<p>I&#39;d be interested in hearing about those. I can think of two:</p>

<li>Use another language (C, C++). Disadvantage: Clumsy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the bugs are years old I wouldn&#39;t bet my hat on it.</p>
