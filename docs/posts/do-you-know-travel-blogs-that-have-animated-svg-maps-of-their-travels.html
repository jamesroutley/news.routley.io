    <h1>Ask HN: Do you know travel blogs that have animated SVG maps of their travels?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m searching for a travel blog that wrote a tutorial on how they created custom SVG animations for the routes he took along his trips.</p><p>I&#39;ve been banging my head against Google for a solid 3-4 hours at this point but it is pointless to try to search something there these days so I come here.</p><p>I remember that the blogger in question was into photography and photographed the Te Whanganui-A-Hei (Cathedral Cove) in New Zealand during early morning with no people there and wrote a post about the process. And of course they had these small SVG animations of their trips at the top of their posts, with a map displaying the route they took, animating the path.</p><p>They wrote a pretty in-depth article about how they accomplished this with the help of some custom JS and SVG animations too and I am after that article.</p><p>If you know the name of the blog that would absolutely make my day!</p><p>Please also feel free to answer if you know anything <i>similar</i> to the title of the blog where somebody has created stylized animated SVG maps of their trips and documented the process they used to create those.</p></div></div></div>
