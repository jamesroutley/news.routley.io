<p>Many word processors have built-in change management. Authors can
suggest changes and add comments, then an editor can accept or reject
them.</p>

<p>People who write documents using text-file-based formats like
<strong>TeX</strong> or <strong>markdown</strong> have a problem: text
files don’t have a concept of changes. This makes it harder to
collaborate in teams. To get change management, they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an online editor, losing the flexibility of simple text
files;</li>
<li>Use a version control system like <strong>git</strong>, which is
complex and technical.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Suggestions files</em> are a standard for changes for plain text.
They let authors collaborate, suggest and review changes. They don’t
require any special software, and they can be used on any kind of text
file. You just edit the file as usual, and follow some simple rules.</p>
<h2 id="file-format">File format</h2>
<h3 id="making-suggestions">Making suggestions</h3>
<p>To suggest new text to add to a file, enclose it in <code>++[</code>
and <code>]++</code> tags like this:</p>
<pre><code>The original text, ++[your addition,]++ 
and more text.</code></pre>
<p>To suggest a deletion from a file, enclose it in <code>--[</code> and
<code>]--</code> tags like this:</p>
<pre><code>The original text, --[text to delete,]-- 
and more text.</code></pre>
<p>To make a comment, enclose it in <code>%%[</code> and
<code>]%%</code>:</p>
<pre><code>%%[Is this clearer? @stephen]%%</code></pre>
<p>You can sign the comment with a <code>@handle</code> as the last
word.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-suggestions">Reviewing suggestions</h3>
<p>To review suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>To accept a suggested addition, delete the <code>++[</code> and
matching <code>]++</code>, leaving everything between them.</li>
<li>To accept a suggested deletion, delete everything between
<code>--[</code> and <code>]--</code> inclusive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rejecting suggestions is just the other way round:</p>
<ul>
<li>To reject an addition, delete everything between <code>++[</code>
and <code>]++</code> inclusive.</li>
<li>To reject a deletion, delete the <code>--[</code> and matching
<code>]--</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also delete comments. Typically, you will have to do this
before using the text file for another purpose.</p>
<p>If a tag (<code>++[</code>, <code>]++</code>, <code>--[</code>,
<code>]--</code>, <code>%%[</code> or <code>]%%</code>) is on its own on
a line, treat the subsequent newline as part of the tag and delete
it:</p>
<pre><code>A paragraph of text.
++[
A new line.
]++
The paragraph continues.</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre><code>A paragraph of text.
A new line.
The paragraph continues.</code></pre>
<p>if the addition is accepted, or</p>
<pre><code>A paragraph of text.
The paragraph continues.</code></pre>
<p>if it is rejected.</p>

<p>If multiple authors are working on a document, you may want to sign
your suggested changes. Do that by putting your handle at the end of the
change, just like for a comment. The handle must start with
<code>@</code> and must be the last word:</p>
<pre><code>And God said, 
%%[first try! @wycliffe]%%
--[Light be made, 
and the light was made. @tyndale]-- 
++[Let there be lyghte 
and there was lyghte. @tyndale]++
++[Let there be light: 
and there was light. @kjv]++</code></pre>
<p>You can nest suggestions within each other:</p>
<pre><code>Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley
++[, the famous ++[Cornish @editor]++ 
seaside resort, @daphne ]++ again.</code></pre>
<p>You can’t nest changes within comments (it would be too confusing).
If you want to add to a comment, just write inside it with your handle.
It’s only a comment anyway.</p>
<p>The rules for reviewing nested comments are the same as above. You
may need to adjudicate between different alternatives. Obviously, if you
accept someone’s deletion, any other suggestions inside it will be
deleted and be irrelevant.</p>

<p>There is a command line tool <code>suggs</code> for working with
suggestions files.</p>
<p>The purpose of <code>suggs</code> is to let you automate parts of the
editing process. For example, you can edit a file, save a new version,
then use <code>suggs</code> to create a suggestions file. Or you can
take someone else’s suggestions file and quickly accept or reject all
the changes. Lastly, <code>suggs</code> can display suggested changes in
extra-readable formats, like colorized text or TeX.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>Print a suggestions file with additions, deletions and comments shown
in color:</p>
<pre><code>suggs colorize file.txt</code></pre>
<p>Print <em>file.txt</em> with all suggestions accepted:</p>
<pre><code>suggs new file.txt</code></pre>
<p>Print <em>file.txt</em> with all suggestions rejected:</p>
<pre><code>suggs old file.txt</code></pre>
<p>Accept or reject all changes in-place, writing the result back to
<em>file.txt</em>:</p>
<pre><code>suggs accept file.txt
suggs reject file.txt</code></pre>
<p>Create a suggestions file from the difference between
<em>old.txt</em> and <em>new.txt</em>:</p>
<pre><code>suggs diff old.txt new.txt</code></pre>
<p>Print <em>file.txt</em> with changes highlighted as a TeX file:</p>
<pre><code>suggs tex file.txt</code></pre>

<h3 id="why-not-just-use-a-diff-file">Why not just use a diff file?</h3>
<p><code>diff</code> is a command that prints the difference between two
text files. It’s widely used in the computing world. But diffs are
designed for computers and code, not humans and text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diff output makes no sense without the original file. You can’t read
changes in their original context. A suggestions file shows additions
and deletions in context; it can be sent as an email attachment, read
and understood.</li>
<li>Using and applying diffs requires command line tools. This is hard
for non-technical authors. Suggestions files don’t require any command
line tools, but you can <a href="https://github.com/hughjonesd/suggestions">use one</a> if you
like.</li>
<li>Diffs are typically line oriented. This makes them hard to read when
only a word or phrase has changed.</li>
<li>You can’t put comments and authorship in a diff file.</li>
<li>A diff file only shows one set of changes. A suggestions file can
show changes by multiple authors, including nested changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a comment or suggestion, file an <a href="https://github.com/hughjonesd/suggestions">issue</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tex-tip">TeX tip</h3>
<p>If you write comments like</p>
<pre><code>%%[
% My comment here.
% ]%%</code></pre>
<p>then TeX will also treat them as comments.</p>
