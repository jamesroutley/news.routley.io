				<h3><a name="intro">Liquid Physics Using Cellular Automation</a></h3>

<p>
One interesting way to represent liquids in a grid based world, is to use a form of cellular automaton.  You may have heard of cellular automata from the popular “Conway’s Game of Life”, where cells evolve based on a set of rules that they adhere to.  
</p>

<p>
As the cells evolve, they create some interesting patterns, sometimes even chaotic in nature.  For our liquid simulation, we are going to want to enforce some strict rules, so that we have much more control over the movement of our cells.  
</p>

<p>Take a look at the following gif.  Notice how the liquids are all contained inside of grid cells.  Each cell is capable of holding a value to indicate how much liquid is contained inside of it.</p>

<p>
In this simulation, the cells attempt to disperse their liquid into their neighboring cells.  It will do this by following rules that we will set for them.  In each iteration of our simulation, every cell that contains liquid will execute the same set of rules.
