      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;ve been learning about computer architecture [1] and I&#39;ve become comfortable with my understanding of how a processor communicates with main memory - be it directly, with the presence of caches or even virtual memory - and I/O peripherals.<p>But something that seems weirdly absent from the courses I took and what I have found online is how the CPU communicates with other processing units, such as GPUs - not only that, but an in-depth description of interconnecting different systems with buses (by in-depth I mean an RTL example/description).</p><p>I understand that as you add more hardware to a machine, complexity increases and software must intervene - so a generalistic answer won&#39;t exist and the answer will depend on the implementation being talked about. That&#39;s fine by me.</p><p>What I&#39;m looking for is a description of how a CPU tells a GPU to start executing a program. Through what means do they communicate - a bus? How does such a communication instance look like?</p><p>I&#39;d love get pointers to resources such as books and lectures that are more hands-on/implementation aware.</p><p>[1] Just so that my background knowledge is clear: I&#39;ve concluded NAND2TETRIS, watched and concluded Berkeley&#39;s 2020 CS61C and have read a good chunk of H&amp;P (both Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach and Computer Organization and Design: RISC-V edition), and now am moving on to Onur Mutlu&#39;s lectures on advanced computer architecture.</p></td></tr>
