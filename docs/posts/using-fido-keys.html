<h3 id="what&#39;s-fido" tabindex="-1">What’s FIDO</h3>
<p>FIDO (standing for Fast IDentity Online) is a set of open standards created by the very originally named FIDO Alliance, designed to address the limitations of traditional password-based authentication.</p>
<ul>
<li>U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) - Is made to strengthen and simplify 2FA using USB or NFC hardware; nowadays it is succeeded by FIDO2 and CTAP2</li>
<li>CTAP2 (Client to Authenticator Protocol) - Enables interoperability between an authenticator (phone, security key) and a client (a computer)</li>
<li>FIDO2 - The one on everybody’s lips, consists of WebAuthn (published by W3C) and CTAP2 and specifies a standard authentication protocol</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-use-it" tabindex="-1">Why use it</h3>
<p>The main thing that sold security keys to me is the hardware component brought into authentication.</p>
<p>Regular OTP is also prone to attacks, be it <a href="https://nitter.net/mysk_co/status/1651021165727477763">the incompetence of OTP app providers providing a sync</a>, your password manager getting compromised or just SIM swap attacks (being a bit more exotic though increasing, according to <a href="https://archive.is/og8go">a TWSJ citing FBI numbers</a>).</p>
<h3 id="caveats" tabindex="-1">Caveats</h3>
<p>The main caveat of hardware keys is, of course, if your key ever gets stolen or lost.</p>
<p>Technically, this still doesn’t accounts for attacks like bruteforcing, where someone could just try and test all PIN combination possible.</p>
<p>That kind of protection also means someone can easily sabotage your keys and render them unusable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the main security key on you at all times</li>
<li>Occasionally test your backup key(s)</li>
<li>Make sure services have ways of recovering accounts and that those are up-to-date</li>
</ul>
<p>Another caveat of physical security keys is the number of passkeys a single device can support.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-you-use-it" tabindex="-1">Where can you use it</h3>
<p>In recent years, tons of websites added support for security keys.</p>
<p>Others can be cited like:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Gandi</li>
<li>ProtonMail</li>
<li>DNSimple</li>
<li>Bitwarden</li>
</ul>
<p>The list could be way longer, those are just a tiny fraction of those who support it.</p>
<h2 id="personal-journey-and-use" tabindex="-1">Personal journey &amp; use</h2>
<p>Let’s see my personal uses of security keys and which ones I have.</p>
<h3 id="a-long-long-wait" tabindex="-1">A long, long wait</h3>
<p>Back in July 2021, I backed the the Solokeys V2 IndieGoGo campaign, that were originally supposed to be released in June 2021.</p>
<p>Fast forward to September, more delays, pushing delivery even further to October; but after waiting all of that time, what is one month more? (little did I know)</p>
<p>Finally, in August 2023, after two years of waiting, I received my two Solokeys V2, one USB-A and one USB-C.</p>
<h3 id="yubikey" tabindex="-1">Yubikey</h3>
<p>The Yubikey is the first ever security key I got.</p>
<ol>
<li>The firmware is completely locked, closed-source and impossible to update, which can make it pretty bad if the firmware the key was shipped with has security holes in it (as a matter of fact, <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021803580">that already happened back in 2017</a>)</li>
<li>Given their early grip on the market, lots of websites and solutions will often only support Yubico OTP instead of the FIDO2 standard which makes it unable to use other brands of security keys (<a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/accounts-panel/accounts/two-factor-authentication/">Hetzner is guilty of this for instance</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, good hardware, works correctly.</p>
<h3 id="solokeys-v2" tabindex="-1">Solokeys V2</h3>
<p><em>Now, here comes the review I originally planned to release months ago.</em></p>
<p>So, I received two Solokeys, one USB-A and one USB-C as well as the pledge goal reward being small colourful silicone protective covers for the keys.</p>
<p>Another thing to have in mind is that if the first generation of Solokeys was FIDO certified, the V2 isn’t <em>yet</em>.</p>
<p>Other than that, they work as expected everywhere that has support.</p>
<p>Given the current state of the project (as of 2023/12/08, no blog posts or communication since June 2023 and no commits in Solokeys V2 repos since January 2023), I sadly cannot recommend that solution and instead redirect people to Yubikey, that has been pretty solid for years.</p>
<h3 id="my-use" tabindex="-1">My use</h3>
<p>I basically use security keys everywhere I can, be it on external websites like Gandi or my internal stuff, either through native support like with FireFish or through a SSO solution like KeyCloak.</p>
<p>Small update: I’m also using my key for SSH now.</p>
<p>As a side note, when trying to register my Solokeys as a GitHub passkey, I was getting generic errors “Something went wrong” without any much more.</p>
<h2 id="final-words" tabindex="-1">Final words</h2>
<p>I’m extremely happy to see more and more websites and software supporting that kind of hardware, for instance, Discord recently added support for security keys as MFA, Google and Microsoft allow passwordless passkey sign-ups, and some other platforms that I use daily like Resonite plan to implement FIDO2 support in the future.</p>
<p>I can recommend anyone getting security keys and adding them everywhere you can.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the future, we can have even more FIDO2 support, not only as a MFA but also as a passwordless way to login.</p>
<p>Also massive thanks to Dezponia, in the Furry Tech Matrix room, for the extensive feedback and additional information about how FIDO2 works and security practices they provided for this blog post.</p>
<hr/>
<p>So this post was longer than usual.</p>
<p>You also probably noticed that the font of this website changed completely and this has been done for a good reason: the old pixel font was extremely hard to read for longer texts, not very practical when you host a blog and a wiki with lore and other stuff people might want to read.</p>
<p>That’s all for today.</p>
