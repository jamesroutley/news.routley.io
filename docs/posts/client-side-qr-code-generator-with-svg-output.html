    <h1>Client-side QR code generator with SVG output</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" tabindex="-1"><section><div><div><p>QRSVG is a small JavaScript project to render a two-dimensional bitmask (mostly assumed to be a QR code) to an SVG element as a collection of SVG paths with defined purposes.</p></div></div></section><section><h2>Project Description</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> have established themselves as a popular way to provide a chunk of digital information (most commonly a web address to jump to) via physical media. I myself occasionally use them in flyers, posters, or presentation slides.</p><p>They are not too complicated to generate and a variety of free websites exist for this purpose. Sadly none of them appear to have all of the customization options that I want, plus most of them use some manner of ads and/or data tracking. The demo on this page combines <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library">Project Nayukiâ€™s QR Code generator library</a> (a multi-language open source project that can, among other things, perform the conversion of text into raw QR code data) with my own QRSVG project, which can turn a QR-like two-dimensional boolean data map into an efficient vector description of its own visualization by tracing the contours of contiguous shapes. Or in simpler terms: it turns a QR code into a straightforward and customizable SVG file. The demo up top showcases a number of stylistic customizations enabled by QRSVG. Its strengths include:</p><ul><li>Conversion of QR code data into efficient SVG markup</li><li>Shape and color customization</li><li>QR codes can be made downloadable in SVG and PNG formats</li><li>Entirely client-side, hostable as static files (i.e. making this available to you costs me nothing)</li></ul><p>If the demo QR code generator at the top of this page is convenient for you too, please feel free to spread the word!</p></section></div></div>
