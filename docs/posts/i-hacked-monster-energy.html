                <h2>The Energy Drink Giant That Forgot to Lock Its Doors</h2>
<p>As a hacker who likes energy drinks, I decided to check out Monster Energy&#39;s corporate infrastructure. What I found was completely exposed and making terrible security decisions.</p>
<h3>Monster University: Where Security Goes to Die</h3>
<p>Monster University (<code>mu.monsterenergy.com</code>) is where Monster employees go to learn about their brand. It&#39;s also where I learned that changing <code>/login</code> to <code>/register</code> in the URL is apparently Monster&#39;s idea of &#34;authentication.&#34;</p>
<p>The registration form appeared but wouldn&#39;t submit. So I went straight to the JavaScript to find the actual API endpoint. The API helpfully told me exactly which fields were missing from my registration attempt.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/register_api.png" alt="Monster University Registration API"/></p>
<p>Once I called the API directly with the right fields, boom, I was in. Full access to Monster University, complete with all their training materials, including this absolute masterpiece about their target demographic:</p>
<h3>This Is What Monster Thinks You Look Like</h3>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/consumer_demographics.jpg" alt="Monster&#39;s " consumer"="" demographics"=""/></p>
<p>I&#39;m not kidding. This is from their actual brand training guide. According to Monster Energy, their &#34;Core Brand Family Consumer&#34; is:</p>
<p><em>&#34;Monster Green shoppers are likely younger (Gen-Z/Millennial/Gen-X) male, lower income &amp; Caucasian (skews Hispanic).&#34;</em></p>
<p>And they included this photo of five people in Monster gear looking like they&#39;re being held hostage in a marketing photoshoot. This is literally what Monster corporate thinks their average customer looks like. I can&#39;t make this stuff up.</p>
<h3>The Irony: Their Own Cybersecurity Training</h3>
<p>The best part? Monster University has a cybersecurity course they bought from a third-party vendor. The same platform with no authentication has lessons teaching employees about phishing and basic security:</p>

<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/gamelist.png" alt="Monster Cybersecurity Game List"/></p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/amplify_game.png" alt="Amplify Cybersecurity Game"/></p>
<p>The irony of hosting a cybersecurity course about phishing on a completely unsecured platform is just <em>chef&#39;s kiss</em>.</p>
<h3>Meanwhile in Monster Corporate: Walmart Zoom Calls and &#34;ULTIMATE BEAST&#34; Badges</h3>
<p>While exploring Monster University, I found some gems about their corporate culture. You can view their entire Zoom meeting schedule and even get the join links:</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/walmart_meeting.png" alt="Walmart Office Hours Event"/></p>
<p>And check out their employee achievement system - you can earn badges for everything from &#34;BEAST&#34; to &#34;ULTIMATE BEAST&#34;:</p>

<h3>Beast Bux: Monster&#39;s Internal Currency System</h3>
<p>But wait, it gets better. I found their internal employee rewards system called &#34;Beast Bux.&#34; Here&#39;s their actual training video explaining it:</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/video_section.png" alt="Monster University Video Section"/></p>

<p>Essentially, employees get Beast Bux yearly and can give them to other employees to show appreciation. These can be used to buy Monster merch at their internal store: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bleedgreenshop.monsterenergy.com/">https://bleedgreenshop.monsterenergy.com/</a></p>
<h3>The Real Treasure: Exposed Corporate File System</h3>
<p>The scariest part wasn&#39;t the training portal or the questionable customer profiling. It was finding their OpenText API completely exposed with no authentication required:</p>
<pre><code>https://opentextapi.monsterenergy.com/opentext/search/?page=1&amp;pageSize=1000&amp;searchTerms=
</code></pre>
<p>This endpoint allows anyone to search through Monster&#39;s entire file system. No password. No authentication. Nothing.</p>
<p>Then you get a a bunch of JSON objects in a response that looks like this</p>
<pre><code> {
      &#34;id&#34;: &#34;fe48838d8df3084c14f285ac1b7729833a8d607c&#34;,
      &#34;name&#34;: &#34;How-To-Guide_Installing Aspera.pdf&#34;,
      &#34;fullUrl&#34;: &#34;fe48838d8df3084c14f285ac1b7729833a8d607c&#34;,
      &#34;thumbnailId&#34;: &#34;34141d2798622aac76eecf0a12ce737deab89a17&#34;,
      &#34;previewId&#34;: &#34;62018cf35dd827f39df46dbf1192f40b1a823f95&#34;,
      &#34;mimetype&#34;: &#34;application/pdf&#34;,
      &#34;dateLastUpdated&#34;: &#34;2019-06-26T07:53:09&#34;,
      &#34;dateImported&#34;: &#34;2017-08-22T16:20:18&#34;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>You can put the id in this url to open the file</p>
<pre><code>https://opentextapi.monsterenergy.com/opentext/images/${id}
</code></pre>
<p>(Don&#39;t let the &#34;images&#34; in the URL fool you - it serves all file types, not just images)</p>
<p>The API returns full document metadata, file paths, and direct download links for everything in their system. Marketing Videos/Images, Contracts, internal documents, you name it.</p>
<h3>Even Worse: The ClickUp Integration Disaster</h3>
<p>On a subdomain called Kermometer (<code>kermometer.monsterenergy.com</code>), I discovered Monster had integrated ClickUp into their workflow, but they made a critical mistake: they exposed an admin&#39;s private account token directly in their website&#39;s JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/clickup_token.png" alt="ClickUp Token Exposed in JavaScript"/></p>
<p>This token would allow anyone to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access their entire ClickUp workspace</li>
<li>View all private documents and projects</li>
<li>Invite themselves to the workspace</li>
<li>Potentially modify or delete critical project data</li>
</ul>
<p>To prove it worked, I invited myself to their workspace:</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/clickup_invite.png" alt="ClickUp Workspace Invitation"/></p>
<p>For the lulz, I wrote a script to share everything with myself using their admin token:</p>
<p><img src="https://bobdahacker.com/static/images/blogs/monsterEnergy/sharing_script.png" alt="Script Sharing Everything With Me"/></p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry, I left their workspace immediately after proving the vulnerability. I&#39;m not trying to steal Monster&#39;s secret energy drink formulas or anything.</p>
<h3>The Response (Or Lack Thereof)</h3>
<p>I tried contacting Monster Energy directly about these vulnerabilities. No response.</p>
<p>They did fix the Monster University registration issue, but I don&#39;t think they even read my emails - they probably just noticed someone had signed up through their broken system and patched it.</p>
<p>Finally, I told ClickUp themselves about the exposed token on Monster&#39;s site. They investigated and contacted Monster, getting it fixed in less than a week. </p>
<p>But Monster? They never even acknowledged any of my reports. And as you can see, they left their entire file system API wide open.</p>
<p><strong>The OpenText API is STILL ACTIVE as of writing this post.</strong></p>
<h3>To Monster Energy</h3>
<p>Your energy drinks might &#34;Unleash the Beast,&#34; but your security is definitely asleep.</p>
<p>Maybe spend less time creating stereotypical customer profiles and more time securing your infrastructure? Just a thought.</p>
<p>Also, a security contact email would be nice. You know, for next time.</p>
