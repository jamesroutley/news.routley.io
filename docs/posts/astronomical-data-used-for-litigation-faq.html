    <h1>Astronomical Data Used for Litigation (FAQ)</h1>

<p><span>The U.S.
Naval Observatory (USNO) does not furnish data specifically tailored for
litigation.</span>  <span>The data describing
astronomical phenomena, provided by the USNO, are intended for public
information and general use. The data are computed and are not reports of
observed or recorded events. The computations assume certain conditions and
the data might therefore not be relevant to the facts at issue in a
specific case.  The data are provided without seal or certification
regarding authority, custody, or authenticity, and acceptance by a court is
not guaranteed.</span> </p>

<p>Astronomical data are sometimes needed for civil or criminal court
proceedings, especially where there is an issue of the amount of natural
illumination available during the incident in question.  Both astronomical
and meteorological information may be needed in such cases.</p>

<p><b>The USNO does not collect or maintain records or systems of records
of astronomical phenomena—for example, observed times of sunrise,
sunset, twilight, or Moon phases— that might be useful for
litigation.</b>  Such observations are not regularly made by any agency of
the U.S. Government, since the relevant data can be computed for past or
future dates to sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes.  In this
sense, astronomical data are different from weather data, which must be
observed and recorded.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://aa.usno.navy.mil/index">Astronomical Applications Department</a> of the USNO
provides Web pages where these computations can be made online.  For
example, the Web page titled <a href="https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/RS_OneDay">Sun and Moon
Data for One Day</a> provides sunrise/sunset, moonrise/moonset, and
twilight times along with Moon phase for any specific date and place.
Other astronomical information can be found in the department&#39;s <a href="https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/index">Data Services</a> pages.  There is no charge for these data
services.  These kinds of astronomical computations can also usually be
performed by any observatory, planetarium, university astronomy department,
or other competent authority.</p>

Applications Department for additional information. -->

<p>If a litigant desires a signed letter or some other type of &#34;certified&#34;
document containing the calculated data, there are several private-sector
sources that can be used.  Resources that can assist you in finding
information and expert testimony are listed below under
<a href="https://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/lawyers#forensic">Forensic Services</a>.</p>
