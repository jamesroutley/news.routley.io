    <h1>Ask HN: Any tools to do generic WiFi imaging?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><p>I have an older house (1950s) and I&#39;d really like to see behind my walls without physically excavating so I can try to run some wires without encountering surprise obstructions. There are tools which use WifI to do detect humans[1] (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-routers-used-to-detect-human-locations-poses-within-a-room" rel="nofollow">https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-routers-used-to-dete...</a>) [2](<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897828">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897828</a>) but I&#39;m looking for a way to use Wifi for more general imaging. There&#39;s a paper from 2017 (&#34;Holography of WiFi Radiation)[<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.183901" rel="nofollow">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.11...</a>] and many other scholarly papers about object detection via WiFi, but I haven&#39;t been able to find any off-the-shelf products/projects that would just build a 3D environmental density map without any object detection. The resolution doesn&#39;t have to be great - not looking for millimeter scale features e.g. structural weakness. Is there anything out there that comes close? Given recent archaeological uses of drone LIDAR and satellite tomography, I figure the software for interpreting this kind of data should be pretty robust by now, just maybe it hasn&#39;t filtered down to the consumer market.</p></td></div></div>
