    <h1>Hands-Free Coding (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Earlier this year, I developed Cubital Tunnel Syndrome, a repetitive-strain injury, in both of my elbows. As a result, I pretty much can&#39;t use a mouse or keyboard; after a few minutes, I get a burning pain shooting down my arms. Even if I try to limit my computer usage to 60-second bursts, I wind up inadvertently making the situation worse.</p><p>As you might imagine, this was a pretty big deal; as a software developer, my entire career is based on being able to use a keyboard!</p><p>After many failed attempts at solving the problem with physiotherapy, ergonomics, braces, diet and supplements, prescription medications, supplements, mindbody soul-searching, and a bunch of other stuff, I&#39;ve found a solution that allows me to be productive without risking further nerve damage. I now work almost exclusively using a microphone and an eye-tracker.</p><p>In this article, I&#39;ll show you what that workflow looks like, and how I&#39;ve optimized it to fit my needs!</p><p><em>Update, December 9th:</em> I am thrilled to report that my injury has gotten much better! I&#39;m back to using a keyboard and mouse as my primary input mechanism. It&#39;s a relief, but I also feel confident that I would have managed just fine either way.</p><p>To give you a quick sense of what this looks like, here&#39;s a short video of me writing a React component:</p><p>We&#39;ll get into how this all works, don&#39;t worry if it doesn&#39;t make a ton of sense yet! I mostly wanted to showcase this upfront to show how <em>feasible</em> this process can be.</p><p>Dictation software has been around for a long time, but it&#39;s usually used purely to transcribe speech, often in the legal and medical industries. Writing code is a different beast, since there&#39;s a lot of syntax and conventions and non-dictionary words.</p><p>Fortunately, specialized software exists! I currently use <a href="https://talonvoice.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Talon Voice</a>, a tool built specifically to help software developers work without using their hands.</p><p>Talon has a free public version, but the exciting stuff happens in the paid private beta. You can gain access by supporting the creator <a href="https://www.patreon.com/join/lunixbochs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Patreon</a>.</p><p>Let&#39;s dive into how this software works.</p><p>The first thing you learn as a new Talon user is how to dictate individual letters.</p><p>Generally, you won&#39;t be dictating one letter at a time, but it comes in handy now and then, like specifying CSS units (px, rem, etc).</p><p>English is an annoying language when it comes to phonetics. So many of our letters sound the same. There&#39;s a reason telephone operators say things like &#34;M like Mary&#34;, &#34;T as in Thomas&#34;.</p><p>The United Nations solved this problem with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NATO phonetic alphabet</a>—you know, the Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot thing. But these words tend to be multi-syllable, and nobody has time for that jazz. So Talon includes its own phonetic mappings of (mostly) single-syllable words:</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>a</code> - air</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>b</code> - bat</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>c</code> - cap</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>d</code> - drum</p></li></ul><p>When I say “drum” into the microphone, the letter <code>d</code> is written as if I had pressed that key on the keyboard.</p><p>You can capitalize letters by prefixing them with “ship”. “ship drum” will output <code>D</code> instead of <code>d</code>.</p><p>Numbers are spoken normally, from 0 through 9. If I wanted to output <code>1024</code>, I would speak “one zero two four”.</p><p>Talon has intuitive mappings for most special characters. <code>command cap</code>, for example, will hold <code>command</code> while pressing the <code>C</code> key, to copy to the clipboard. <code>control command space</code> will open the Emoji drawer on MacOS, since that&#39;s the OS-level mapping.</p><p>Certain keys are mapped to shorter/cuter terms. Instead of &#34;backspace&#34;, I say &#34;junk&#34;. &#34;Delete&#34; becomes &#34;dell&#34;. If you&#39;re unhappy with any of the mappings, by the way, everything is editable in Talon.</p><p>Arrow keys are prefixed with the word &#34;go&#34;. If I want to move the cursor left, I say <code>go left</code>.</p><p>This would be really tedious if not for one awesome addition: <em>ordinals</em>.</p><p>In English, an ordinal number is one used to describe order, like &#34;fifth&#34; or &#34;ninth&#34; or &#34;three hundredth&#34;. In Talon, they&#39;re used to repeat commands. If I wanted to go left by 9 spaces, I would say <code>go left ninth</code>.</p><p>The phrasing is a little strange. Surely, &#34;go left nine&#34; would be more intuitive, right? But <code>nine</code> is already taken; it outputs the literal number <code>9</code>.</p><p><strong>This works for all commands.</strong> If I wanted to write the number <code>1000</code>, I would say <code>one zero third</code>, to repeat the <code>0</code> character 3 times.</p><p>The conventional way to write JavaScript uses camelCase for variables. In fact, there are lots of conventions when it comes to variable names! Talon has a solution for this: <strong>formatters.</strong></p><p>A formatter is a command which will transform the text spoken afterwards. When I say “camel hello world”, for example, the software outputs <code>helloWorld</code>. Conversely, “snake hello world” produces <code>hello_world</code>.</p><p>If you want to output text without transforming it, the command is <code>say</code>. “say hello world” will output <code>hello world</code>.</p><p>Formatters can be composed. For example, I&#39;m a fan of UPPER_SNAKE for JavaScript constants:</p><pre></pre><p>To output <code>DARK_COLORS</code>, I can combine the <code>snake</code> and <code>allcaps</code> formatters. “allcaps snake dark colors” outputs <code>DARK_COLORS</code>.</p><p>While Talon does have a &#34;dictation mode&#34;, the default mode is command-based. Commands can be thought of as functions. Everything we&#39;ve seen so far is command-based.</p><p>For example, when I say <code>focus chrome</code>, it&#39;s like I&#39;m calling the <code>focus</code> function, and passing <code>chrome</code> as an argument. <code>focus</code> is a command that focuses the specified application, so this would be equivalent to using Spotlight to select Chrome.</p><p><code>focus</code> isn&#39;t some black-box native thing built into Talon, though; it&#39;s part of a community package of commands. I can access and edit the source, which is written in Python:</p><pre></pre><p>The real power of Talon is being able to <em>create your own commands</em>. It offers a bunch of APIs for interacting with the operating system and outputting characters. I&#39;ve created a dozen handy utilities for front-end development, and I expect I&#39;ll add many more as I keep using it.</p><p>You can add simple &#34;say X to produce Y&#34; commands using a YAML-like syntax:</p><pre></pre><p>When I speak &#34;react&#34;, the software outputs <code>import React from &#39;react&#39;;</code>.</p><p>For more complex commands, you can write Python functions. As an example, here&#39;s what happens when I say “styled button fancy button”:</p><pre></pre><p>The second word, <code>button</code>, is matched against a known set of HTML elements. The subsequent words, <code>fancy button</code>, are UpperCamelCased and used for the component name. It adds some whitespace, and moves the cursor to the appropriate spot.</p><p>Here&#39;s the Python source for the command:</p><pre></pre><p>And here&#39;s the Talon mapping:</p><pre></pre><p>Programming Talon commands is beyond the scope of this article. If you&#39;re interested, check out the <a href="https://talon.wiki/unofficial_talon_docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unofficial Talon docs</a>. You can also learn a ton by reading how existing commands are implemented.</p><p>You can also check out <a href="https://github.com/joshwcomeau/talon-commands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my fork</a> of the commands, which includes all the React stuff I&#39;ve added—be warned, though, it&#39;s messy, incomplete, and poorly documented.</p><p>No matter how good speech recognition gets, there will always be ambiguities that will be difficult to resolve.</p><p>For example, if I say &#34;check out my site&#34;, do I mean <code>site</code> or <code>sight</code>? Or possibly <code>cite</code>??</p><p>To resolve these ambiguities, Talon includes a <code>phones</code> command:</p><p>I learned about this trick from <a href="https://twitter.com/yomilly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emily Shea</a>&#39;s amazing conference talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz3JeYfBTcY&amp;feature=emb_logo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perl Out Loud</a>.</p><p>By far the most sci-fi part of my setup is my eye-tracker.</p><p>I use the <a href="https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tobii 5</a>. It&#39;s a bar with an infrared sensor, and it tracks your eye motion. It slaps onto the front of your monitor:</p><span type="default"><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27675%27%20height=%27430%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="imac computer with a slim bar stuck on the front" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></span><p>Interestingly, it isn&#39;t marketed as a mouse replacement; it&#39;s designed for Windows users for some sort of competitive gaming purpose. But Talon—the same software I use for dictation—includes custom MacOS drivers that allow it to function as a mouse replacement.</p><p>Clicking is a two step process. First, you look where you want to click, and make a popping noise with your mouth. This will zoom way in, and allow you to be really precise with your click. A second pop will perform a left-click:</p><p>There are commands to double-click, to right-click, and to drag and release. It takes some getting used to, but it works surprisingly well. The accuracy is good enough to do some pretty precise things.</p><p>The tobii 5 sells for $229 USD. You can also try and find the tobii 4C, which is purported to offer a smoother experience with Talon, but they&#39;re really rare.</p><p>So far, I&#39;ve shared only the tip of the iceberg of what I&#39;ve learned, and what I&#39;ve learned is only the tip of an even-bigger iceberg—Talon is a really powerful tool, and I&#39;m still figuring it out. It took <em>years</em> to become proficient with a keyboard, so I&#39;m still very early into my journey with dictation.</p><p>In fact, I&#39;d say that this whole cottage industry is pretty new. Talon is a wonderful piece of technology, and it&#39;s already had a huge positive impact in my life, but I think there&#39;s so much potential and opportunity ahead.</p><p>Talon continues to improve every day—it uses a proprietary machine-learning algorithm to handle speech-recognition, and I&#39;ve already seen a noticeable improvement with it. Other products like <a href="https://serenade.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serenade</a> seem pretty compelling as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, companies like <a href="https://neuralink.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neuralink</a> are working on establishing a &#34;direct link&#34; between our brains and everyday technology. It sounds like science fiction, but I may soon be able to &#34;think&#34; my code into existence ✨😮✨</p><p>I&#39;d say I probably work at about 50% of my normal speed<span></span>. Now, this doesn&#39;t mean that I produce 50% of the results; it just means I need to prioritize a little more ruthlessly.</p><p>I&#39;ve heard that learning Vim can make this much more effective. Depending on how much longer my injury lasts, I may consider switching.</p><p>The biggest issue I&#39;ve found so far is voice strain; I&#39;m not used to talking for 8+ hours a day! I imagine I need to build a tolerance, and I hope to get better at this with time.</p><p>The first few weeks were rough. In addition to it being slow and frustrating, Talon work best when you write your own commands. I&#39;d wind up hurting myself trying to get it set up. Being able to configure Talon by voice is a real milestone, and it&#39;s gone much smoother since then.</p><p>Honestly, it&#39;s just been such a relief to discover that my hands aren&#39;t needed for me to do my work. Recently, I heard Kent C Dodds and Joel Hooks talking on the <a href="https://egghead.io/podcasts/kent-c-dodds-chats-about-how-epic-react-was-designed-for-learner-success" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">egghead podcast</a> about how Kent&#39;s wary of injuring his hands, since as a software developer and educator, they&#39;re his money-makers<span></span>. I used to feel the same way, whereas now I see that with a bit of determination and a lot of awesome technology, nothing&#39;s gonna stand in my way 💖</p><p>There&#39;s something else I want to talk about, and it&#39;s a bit less fun.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thing: you are not likely to develop Cubital Tunnel Syndrome. Even if you do, it&#39;ll likely go away on its own after a few weeks; many cases resolve spontaneously, and most respond well to conservative treatments. I&#39;m an edge-case.</p><p>At some point in your life, however, you will likely experience some sort of impairment, whether temporary or permanent. Almost all of us will<span></span>.</p><p>It&#39;s so so easy to fall into the trap of thinking about accessibility as something that affects <em>other people</em>, a hypothetical abstract group. I&#39;ve known that accessibility is important for years, but it felt kinda nebulous to me; I&#39;ve never watched someone struggle to use a thing I built because I neglected to test it without a mouse or keyboard. It feels more urgent to me now.</p><p>I am still incredibly privileged, and I don&#39;t mean to compare my situation to anybody else&#39;s. But this experience has given me a window into what it&#39;s like trying to operate on an internet not designed with alternative input mechanisms in mind. Before I got comfortable with the eye-tracker, things were <em>tricky</em>. And certain things are much more difficult than they used to be.</p><p>The internet has become critical infrastructure. It&#39;s a necessary part of living in modern society, and it needs to be accessible! As front-end developers, it&#39;s our job to advocate for it, and to ensure that we build with accessibility principles in mind.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to learn more about accessibility, I recommend checking out <a href="https://a11y.coffee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a11y.coffee</a>.</p><p>I&#39;ve learned one other thing from this experience: I should prioritize stuff which is important to me!</p><p>One of the very first web apps I built was an education platform. This was about a decade ago, and it was built with PHP, MySQL, and jQuery.</p><p>I gave up on that product when I discovered <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>, which was essentially what I was doing, but way better. I would later go on to work as a software engineer at Khan Academy, and do some of the most fulfilling work of my career.</p><p>I&#39;ve long since imagined that at some point, I&#39;d start my own thing in education. Even though I&#39;ve been motivated to do this for years, I kept putting it off. This experience has taught me something valuable: I don&#39;t have an infinite amount of time ahead of me. If there&#39;s something I want to do, I should do it now, since I may not be able to do it later.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I left my job as a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Gatsby Inc, to pursue this dream. My first project is an online interactive course that teaches advanced CSS skills to JS developers. I&#39;ve seen <em>so</em> much frustration around CSS, and the goal is to give you rock-solid confidence, the ability to implement any layout and build all kinds of cool, next-level experiences.</p><p>You can learn more about it on the <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSS for JavaScript Developers</a> site.</p><p>I&#39;d like to thank two friends and former coworkers who suggested the idea of dictation to me: <a href="https://twitter.com/amber1ey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amberley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/madalynrose" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Madalyn</a>. I&#39;m not sure the idea ever would have occurred to me!</p><p>I was also inspired by two conference talks on this subject:</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span></li></ul></article></div>
