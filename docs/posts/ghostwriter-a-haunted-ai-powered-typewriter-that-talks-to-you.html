<p>On Wednesday, a designer and engineer named <span>Arvind Sanjeev</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/ArvindSanjeev/status/1603021010898677760?s=20&amp;t=53ItvH4ADIZfP3FhsZYw7A">revealed his process</a> for creating Ghostwriter, a one-of-a-kind repurposed Brother typewriter that uses AI to chat with a person typing on the keyboard. The &#34;ghost&#34; inside the machine comes from OpenAI&#39;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/">GPT-3</a>, a large language model that powers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">ChatGPT</a>. The effect resembles a phantom conversing through the machine.</p>

<p>To create Ghostwriter, Sanjeev took apart an electric <a href="https://etzone.org/2022/11/10/brother-ax-325/">Brother AX-325</a> typewriter from the 1990s and reverse-engineered its keyboard signals, then fed them through an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/arduino-creator-explains-why-open-source-matters-in-hardware-too/">Arduino</a>, a low-cost microcontroller that is popular with hobbyists. The Arduino then sends signals to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/raspberry-pi-inventory-improving-could-reach-pre-pandemic-levels-in-2023/">Raspberry Pi</a> that acts as a network interface to OpenAI&#39;s GPT-3 API.</p>
<p>When GPT-3 responds, Ghostwriter noisily types the AI model&#39;s output onto paper automatically.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is an AI large language model trained on millions of books and websites that statistically predicts which word is most likely to occur after being fed a prompt, which includes text typed by the user on Ghostwriter&#39;s keyboard. Depending on the input, GPT-3 can function like a chatbot or complete whatever text you feed it, including assisting with writing tasks or composing poetry.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>While experimenting with the machine, Sanjeev realized he needed a way to control the creative &#34;temperature&#34; and response length of GPT-3, so he <a href="https://twitter.com/ArvindSanjeev/status/1603021384120434688?s=20&amp;t=wemsGPgAvV6vc3n-iYaWFw">added two knobs</a> and an OLED status screen just above the keyboard. Sanjeev also gave the machine a dramatic new gray, cream, and orange custom paint job.</p>
<p>Sanjeev first <a href="https://twitter.com/ArvindSanjeev/status/1598303946585821185?s=20&amp;t=DD-hcM5YkuRt6hqL3S1SsA">teased</a> Ghostwriter on December 1, but it&#39;s been months in the making. &#34;The idea for Ghostwriter came in early 2021, inspired by Rob Sloan&#39;s Sci Fi writer,&#34; Sanjeev <a href="https://twitter.com/ArvindSanjeev/status/1603021623313207296?s=20&amp;t=wemsGPgAvV6vc3n-iYaWFw">wrote</a> on Twitter, &#34;but it was difficult to squeeze time from my full time role at @Lumen_world, so I have been slowly spending my weekends working on this.&#34;</p>

<p>Part art project, part artisanal hack, Sanjeev wants Ghostwriter to make a statement about the relationship between humans and AI.</p>

<p>&#34;I wanted to create a mindful intervention that allows you to take a moment to breathe and reflect on the new creative relationship we are forming with machines,&#34; Sanjeev <a href="https://twitter.com/ArvindSanjeev/status/1603021010898677760?s=20&amp;t=wemsGPgAvV6vc3n-iYaWFw">wrote</a>. &#34;The calm meditative interface of a vintage typewriter takes away all the digital distractions and takes us on an emotional journey through paper and ink.&#34;</p>
