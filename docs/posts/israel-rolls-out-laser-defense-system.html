This new generation of air defence can also serve our friends in the region, who are also exposed to grave threats from Iran and its proxies.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Andrea Ricci</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
