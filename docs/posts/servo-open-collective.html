    <h1>Servo â€“ Open Collective</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Servo aims to empower developers with a lightweight, high-performance alternative for embedding web technologies in applications. Servo is a web browser rendering engine written in Rust, with WebGL and WebGPU support, and adaptable to desktop, mobile, and embedded applications.</p>
<p>Created by Mozilla Research in 2012, the Servo project is a research and development effort. It is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, taking advantage of the memory safety properties and concurrency features of the language. Work on Servo has helped contribute to W3C and WHATWG web standards, reporting specification issues and submitting new cross-browser automated tests, and core team members have co-edited new standards that have been adopted by other browsers. As a novel engine without origins in Gecko or WebKit, the Servo project helps drive the entire web platform forward.</p>
<p>In 2020, Mozilla Research handed stewardship over to the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>.  In 2023, thanks to some external funding and investment of their own, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/igalia-the-open-source-powerhouse-youve-never-heard-of/">Igalia</a> got involved and the project moved to <a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/">Linux Foundation Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Funds from this collective will be used first to cover infrastructure costs that keep engine releases available, integrated with Web Platform Tests, and so on. Once those needs are met, extra available funds can be applied toward sponsoring more infra costs related to improvements or development.</p>
<p>Once those needs are met, extra available funds can be applied toward sponsoring more infra costs related to improvements or development. The Servo Technical Steering Committee will collectively discuss how to prioritize the spending of available funds in the <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/governance/tsc/README.md">public monthly calls</a>.</p>
