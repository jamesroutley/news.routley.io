											</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The demand for environmentally acceptable products is growing rapidly. There is increased concern about the influence of petroleum-based oils on the envi-ronment. Also, exposure to petroleum-based oils can have adverse health effects on users. One potential alternative is the use of “environmentally compatible” or “enviro-friendly” oils that are produced from vegetables. To achieve this classification, an oil must be nontoxic and must  biodegrade rapidly if spilled.  Rapeseed-based (usually called canola) oil is currently the most common environmentally compatible chain-and-bar lubricant.</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

												</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modern vegetable-based lubricants first appeared in the marketplace in Europe in the mid-1980s. The acceptance and use of these products, particularly in the European forest industry, is widespread and growing. The two main reasons for this are concerns about workers’ occupational safety and health and environmental protection.</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
											</font>
											<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
												<p>Petroleum-based oils are known carcinogens and medical records show that they cause discomforting eczema and oil acne. In addition, prolonged ex-posure to petroleum-based-oil mist can cause irritation of the respiratory tract. Environmental damage caused by petroleum-based oil spills has had extensive attention from the media.</p>
											</font>
											<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
												<p>The benefits of using vegetable oils are well known in Germany, where there are about 80 brands available, and  in  the  Scandinavian  countries.  In  Austria,  all petroleum-based chain saw oils are banned. The Coordinating European Council (CEC) has established a test methodology for bio-degradability. This test standard (CEC-L-33-T-82) measures the amount of oil that biodegrades over a 21-day period. (Cautionary Note: Some products show CEC on their product labels and all this means is that the products contain some portion of bio-degradable material. They may still contain mineral oils or mineral-based additives. It is best to find out what percentage of the total product will biodegrade in 21 days.)</p>
											</font>
											<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
												<p>Readily biodegradable, petroleum-free lubricants based on canola oil—including hydraulic fluids, greases, motor oils, concrete release oils, two-cycle oils, and chainsaw-oils are now available commercially in North America. Canola oil is a renewable, sustainable farm product. Manufacturers claim that these products are rapidly bio-degradable, nontoxic to the environment, and safe for operators and mechanics.</p>
											</font>
											<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
												<p>Canola-based chain-and-bar oil has been extensively tested in Europe. It has excellent lubricating properties and some studies have shown up to 40 percent reduction in consumption without sacrificing bar-and-chain life. Most high quality or “professional” chain saws have sophisticated chain oilers that are more efficient and have the capability of controlling the amount of oil being used (figure 1). Manufacturers and some users claim that there is a potential for extended bar-and-chain life when using canola-based products because it lubricates and adheres to metal better than petroleum-based oils.</p>
											</font>
											<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
												<p>Canola-based chain oils have low vapor pressure, which reduces inhalation of fumes by users. Its composition is similar to human skin oil and this can reduce skin irritation and eczema for operators and mechanics. Tests have shown that canola-based chain oils provide good performance down to -13 degrees F but stor-age can affect the pour point temperature (they may not pour easily after standing for several days at -22 degrees F). Generally, vegetable-based oils have higher flash points than petroleum-based products.</p>

												</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The overall results were positive. Users reported that the vegetable-based oil was easier to clean from clothes and equipment. Users also experienced less skin irritation. Rottne harvester operators noticed a significant reduction in the oil mist that collects on the machines’ windows due both to the cleanliness of the Binol compared to petroleum-based oil and to the reduced consumption of oil. The operators claimed a 60 percent reduction in consumption, however, the manufacturer does not claim such a large reduction. They also claimed that Binol increased the life of the bar-and-chain, but the hand fallers reported no noticeable change. The coldest temperature during the trial was -13 degrees F, and there were no lubrication-related failures.</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
											</font>
											<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
												<p>The vegetable-based oil performed satisfactorily in both trials. FERIC reported that Binol costs about twice as much as mineral oil, but when taking into account the manufacturer’s claim of a 40-percent reduction in consumption, the cost increase over mineral oil is around 20 percent. FERIC noted that the potential for extended bar-and-chain life may offset this cost. The report concluded that even with the increased cost, the benefits for workers and the environment make vegetable-based oils an attractive alternative. </p>
