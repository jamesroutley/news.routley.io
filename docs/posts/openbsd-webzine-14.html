<h2>Note from the editorial team</h2>

<h3>Note from Solene</h3>
<p>I finally catched up all the backlog I gathered over almost six months. I need to make adjustments to the website framework to make it easier to work with for newer issues, I&#39;d like to publish like before, an issue every two months. I&#39;m still super happy of the webzine style and format, it looks old-school and fits the community in some sense. Thanks everyone contributing to OpenBSD and its community!</p>
<p>The webzine is two years old, what a journey! I&#39;m really proud to see it available in 9 different languages (all the issues aren&#39;t translated but still). I may change the layout a little but otherwise, it&#39;s good to continue like this.</p>
