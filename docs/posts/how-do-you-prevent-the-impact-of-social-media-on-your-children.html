    <h1>Ask HN: How do you prevent the impact of social media on your children?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I don&#39;t yet have children but having grown up during the rise of social media, it&#39;s clear to me that the way it is used now by young children and teens has transformed even from when I was their age (approx 10 years ago).
It worries me for when I myself have to manage their exposure to things like this. On one hand, I feel it would be in their best interests to be completely shielded from it as I personally feel it isn&#39;t beneficial for them on the whole at that age.
However, it&#39;s undeniable that at that age it&#39;s all about fitting in and it would likely make them feel like a bit of an outcast if I were to limit them from being a part of it, like I imagine every other kid would be.</p><p>I&#39;m curious to know what kinds of methods you have implemented to manage this or whether you feel the same as me</p></div></div></div>
