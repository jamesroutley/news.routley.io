    <h1>NASA&#39;s Curiosity picks up new skills</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><!--[--><div><p data-block-key="3uu6m">Instead, Curiosity and its younger sibling <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/">Perseverance</a> each use their <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/mars_2020/launch/mission/spacecraft/power/">MMRTG</a> nuclear power source, which relies on decaying plutonium pellets to create energy and recharge the rover’s batteries. Providing ample power for the rovers’ many science instruments, MMRTGs are known for their longevity (the twin <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/">Voyager</a> spacecraft have relied on <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/spacecraft/#h-radioisotope-power-system-rps">RTGs</a> since 1977). But as the plutonium decays over time, it takes longer to recharge Curiosity’s batteries, leaving less energy for science each day.</p><p data-block-key="fq71o">The team carefully manages the rover’s daily power budget, factoring in every device that draws on the batteries. While these components were all tested extensively before launch, they are part of complex systems that reveal their quirks only after years in the extreme Martian environment. Dust, radiation, and sharp temperature swings bring out edge cases that engineers couldn’t have expected.</p><p data-block-key="1nfva">“We were more like cautious parents earlier in the mission,” said Reidar Larsen of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which built and operates the rover. Larsen led a group of engineers who developed the new capabilities. “It’s as if our teenage rover is maturing, and we’re trusting it to take on more responsibility. As a kid, you might do one thing at a time, but as you become an adult, you learn to multitask.”</p><h3 data-block-key="e6csg"><b>More Efficient Science</b></h3><p data-block-key="2ho0n">Generally, JPL engineers send Curiosity a list of tasks to complete one by one before the rover ends its day with a nap to recharge. In 2021, the team began studying whether two or three rover tasks could be safely combined, reducing the amount of time Curiosity is active.</p><p data-block-key="cfof9">For example, Curiosity’s radio regularly sends data and images to a passing orbiter, which <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/the-mars-relay-network-connects-us-to-nasas-martian-explorers/">relays them to Earth</a>. Could the rover talk to an orbiter while driving, moving its robotic arm, or snapping images? Consolidating tasks could shorten each day’s plan, requiring less time with heaters on and instruments in a ready-to-use state, reducing the energy used. Testing showed Curiosity safely could, and all of these have now been successfully demonstrated on Mars.</p></div><!--]--></div></div><div><div><!--[--><div><p data-block-key="436fb">Another trick involves letting Curiosity decide to nap if it finishes its tasks early. Engineers always pad their estimates for how long a day’s activity will take just in case hiccups arise. Now, if Curiosity completes those activities ahead of the time allotted, it will go to sleep early.</p><p data-block-key="b26s7">By letting the rover manage when it naps, there is less recharging to do before the next day’s plan. Even actions that trim just 10 or 20 minutes from a single activity add up over the long haul, maximizing the life of the MMRTG for more science and exploration down the road.</p><h3 data-block-key="f5j4r"><b>Miles to Go</b></h3><p data-block-key="ai5jd">In fact, the team has been implementing other new capabilities on Curiosity for years. Several mechanical issues required a rework of how the robotic arm’s <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/drilling-success-curiosity-is-collecting-mars-rocks/">rock-pulverizing drill</a> collects samples, and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-science-laboratory/curiosity-rover/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-gets-a-major-software-upgrade/">driving capabilities</a> have been enhanced with software updates. When a color filter wheel stopped turning on one of the two cameras mounted on Mastcam, Curiosity’s swiveling “head,” the team <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-science-laboratory/curiosity-rover/nasas-curiosity-rover-clocks-4000-days-on-mars/">developed a workaround</a> allowing them to capture the same beautiful panoramas.</p><p data-block-key="5sjdo">JPL also developed an <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/an-algorithm-helps-protect-mars-curiositys-wheels/">algorithm to reduce wear</a> on Curiosity’s rock-battered wheels. And while engineers closely monitor any new damage, they aren’t worried: After 22 miles (35 kilometers) and extensive research, it’s clear that, despite some punctures, the wheels have years’ worth of travel in them. (And in a worst-case scenario, Curiosity could remove the damaged part of the wheel’s “tread” and still drive on the remaining part.)</p><p data-block-key="fi860">Together, these measures are doing their job to keep Curiosity as busy as ever.</p><h3 data-block-key="5hk3l"><b>More About Curiosity</b></h3><p data-block-key="c18ov">Curiosity was built by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the mission on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington as part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program portfolio. Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego built and operates Mastcam.</p><p data-block-key="2s4lj">For more about Curiosity, visit:</p><p data-block-key="fmd7f"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity"><b>science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity</b></a></p></div><!--]--></div></div></div>
