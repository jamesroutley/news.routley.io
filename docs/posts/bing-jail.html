    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A short story on how my website lost all indexed pages in Bing, affecting my presence in DuckDuckGo, secret blacklisting and classification as a splog by Bing AI</p><div id="Read_More"><p>My personal site has been recently penalized by Bing, or if you prefer different naming for it - <strong>secretly blacklisted</strong> or <strong>shadowbanned</strong>. Don’t know exactly why but by the end of January 2023 I lost every indexed page that had been in Bing.</p><p><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/images/2023/04/Bing_Search_Performance_DW_6m_hueb62fb2ccc9003d205d86686cab1a78b_30285_960x0_resize_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x,

Until the issue is sorted I have been forced to change it back to Google.</p></blockquote><p>Firstly, don’t bother contacting Bing Support. This <strong>support is simply non-existent</strong>. Nobody will reply to your emails, and nobody will care unless you are heavy paying customer.</p><blockquote><p>Hey Bing Team. If you want to follow up, my most recent request is <strong>‌REQ00056361</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>There is plenty of forum posts with similar experiences like the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bing/discovered-but-not-crawled-url-cannot-appear-on-bing/m-p/3802346/highlight/true#M2738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent one</a> in which I decided to participate.</p><p>When I don’t care too much about Bing Search I am angry because of my lack of site presence on DuckDuckGo.</p><p>I started reading various things, and <strong>yes</strong>, I went through Bing Webmaster Guidelines. If you know my site a bit more you may see that is perfectly optimised and all requirements have been met so that wasn’t the issue.</p><p>Just been thinking that the content of my website is what somebody in Microsoft disliked and decided to ban me behind the scene without acknowledging it.</p><blockquote><p>It looks like Microsoft is doing some shady secret blacklisting which, if happens to some company with a budget to spare, would finish in a lawsuit. With a niche website like mine, they can sleep without worrying and the support can keep ignoring me.</p></blockquote><p>I got some articles about Microsoft and Windows but all are legit and none of them relates to piracy. <strong>So why?</strong></p><p>The question is <strong>Why have I been thinking that somebody there does not like what I am writing and secretly blacklist my website?</strong> <em>It’s because none of my other websites has been affected.</em></p><p>All other websites have been built with the same webmaster and SEO practices and techniques, the only difference was content, so <strong>yes</strong>, I am thinking that Bing and Microsoft itself doing some shady job behind scenes and discriminating websites through their search engines.</p><p>I would be very happy to have an open discussion on the reasons, but when you don’t know the real reasons behind it and you don’t have anybody to contact/speak with, that’s just making you angry a bit more.</p><p>I decided to ask the Bing Chat bot “Why my website is not indexed in Bing?” and here is what I get.</p><hr/><blockquote><p>“Your site is new and Bing hasn’t discovered and crawled it yet. With new websites, it can take Bing time to find links and crawl through to your website.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>No, that’s not the case.</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Bing is running into issues crawling the site. If Bing consistently cannot crawl your website, it may not select it to be indexed.”</p></blockquote><p>No crawling issues were reported, nada.</p><blockquote><p>“No links are pointing to your website. A common problem for new websites is the lack of links pointing to them from other places on the web. Such links help Bing discover your content and tell us about the popularity of your web pages.”</p></blockquote><p>Google know how many links are there and how popular the website is. When importing my website into Bing Webmaster Tools I used direct import from Google Search Console hence that shall confirm the thing that indeed there are links and some are quite popular.</p><blockquote><p>“You can check if any of these issues apply to your website and take appropriate actions to resolve them. You can also use Bing Webmaster Tools to get more insights into why your website is not being indexed.”</p></blockquote><p>It will be nice if I will see any issues. The text “use Bing Webmaster Tools to get more insights into why your website is not being indexed” just angers me even more. <strong>What insights!?</strong></p><p>I am not alone, there is plenty of users reporting the same problems without any support from Microsoft and the Bing team.</p><hr/><p>You may ask what issues are reported when trying to do URL Inspection from Webmaster Tools. The information is very vague.</p><p><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/images/2023/04/Bing_Discovered_but_not_crawled_huaf6b9fd2b4ca364a1b2481e478b8157c_30611_960x0_resize_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x,

So on 22nd April 2023, I added the main domain (<code>wieckiewicz.org</code>) as well. Through this, I added sitemaps to my website (in the subdomain) and my daughter’s to see if anything will change. It will be nonsense if I will but let’s try.</p><p>At the stage when I added the domain and verified ownership through the CNAME DNS setting on the homepage of Bing Webmaster Tools I noticed a chart for Search Performance. As this (in theory) is a newly added site there is no graph showing, however, there were some figures on top of it that makes no sense and I started thinking.</p><p><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/images/2023/04/Bing_Search_Performance_wieckiewicz_org_hu350f93847daafbed6614adcd280aac43_15928_960x0_resize_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x,

That’s a bit nonsense, as firstly, there is no website on my main domain and my daughter got only 123 pages. This starts looking like the figures from my website. When started playing with the date range switch noticed that these figures are most likely for indexed pages that were months ago, hence not very accurate.</p><p>I decided to wait a couple of days to see if the graph will update and if anything changed.</p><blockquote><p>If in fact, something changed in Bing requirements around January (we know about their core update in mid-Jan.), it would be nice if their Webmaster guidelines would at least mention this somehow.</p></blockquote><p>I keep investigating others’ experiences in that matter, like <a href="https://daverupert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave</a>, who shared a couple of posts about this issue.</p><p>Dave took some <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/01/updates-on-my-bing-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps</a> to help him back on track with Bing, which I also followed before I even discovered his website.</p><p>He <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/solved-the-case-of-the-bing-ban-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solved</a> his issue. I decided to follow his lead and complain publically and blog about it as well, hence this text here.</p><hr/><p>I learned new terminology today, which was “splog”. Somehow Bing robots most likely classed my site like that which means “Spam Blog”. <strong>Total nonsense!</strong></p><p>Seriously, I would appreciate it if somebody at Bing would go through my website and explain to me how I am called a Spam Blog.</p><p>Apart from sending a most recent request (REQ00056361) to Bing Webmaster Support Team, there is nothing that I can do about it.</p><hr/><p>Dave mentioned some crawling issues and SEO errors reported and I decided to look at mines as well.
