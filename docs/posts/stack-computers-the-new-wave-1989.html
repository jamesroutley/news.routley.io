<p><b>The ENTIRE BOOK is available to read on-line or to download for off-line
reading!</b></p>
<p>Published in 1989, this was the first book to explore the new breed of stack
computers led by the introduction of the Novix NC4016 chip. The author
commences with an overview of how stacks are used in computing, and a taxonomy
of hardware stack support which includes a survey of approximately 70 stack
machines past and present. Detailed descriptions, including block diagrams and
instruction set summaries, are given for seven new stack processors from Harris
Semiconductor, Novix, Johns Hopkins University/APL, MISC, WISC Technologies,
and Wright State University. Major topics covered also include architectural
analysis of stack machines, software issues, application areas, and potential
for future development. </p>

<p><b>Originally published by Ellis Horwood in 1989</b> -- now on the World
Wide Web! </p>
<p>This web edition is essentially unchanged from the 1989 book. While some of
the material is obviously dated and new work has been done in this area, I
believe that the book remains the principal reference work on Forth-style stack
computers. My <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack.html">Stack
Computer</a> web page serves as a starting point to exploring recent
developments in the area. </p>
