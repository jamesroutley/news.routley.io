    <h1>A shower thought turned into a Collatz visualization</h1>

    <p>
        I recently went on a nice long SCUBA diving trip with my wife and daughters. Lots of diving implies lots of showers, and
        lots of showers means lots of shower-thoughts!  An especially interesting one I had turned into a nice way to visualize
        some aspects of the Collatz Conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Collatz Conjecture defines a very simple function on all positive integers as follows:
        </p><ul>
            <li>If the number is even, divide it by 2</li>
            <li>If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and then add 1</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>
        If you can prove that repeated applications of this function, starting from any positive integer, will eventually reach 1 then you have proved the Collatz Conjecture
        and won a million dollars and plenty of fame and glory! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Individual inputs are trivial to verify. For example, if we start with 6, we get:
        </p><ul>
            <li>6 is even, so 6 / 2 → 3</li>
            <li>3 is odd, so 3 × 3 + 1 → 10</li>
            <li>10 is even, so 10 / 2 → 5</li>
            <li>5 is odd, so 5 × 3 + 1 → 16</li>
            <li>16 is even, so 16 / 2 → 8</li>
            <li>8 is even, so 8 / 2 → 4</li>
            <li>4 is even, so 4 / 2 → 2</li>
            <li>2 is even, so 2 / 2 → 1</li>
        </ul>
        </div></div>
