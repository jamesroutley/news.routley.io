<p><span>KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on June 9th that a research team led by Professor Kyeongha Kwon from the School of Electrical Engineering, in a joint study with Professor Hanjun Ryu&#39;s team at Chung-Ang University, has developed a self-powered wireless carbon dioxide (<span>CO</span><span>2</span>) monitoring system. This innovative system harvests fine vibrational energy from its surroundings to periodically measure </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> concentrations.</span></p>

<p><span>This breakthrough addresses a critical need in environmental monitoring: accurately understanding &#34;how much&#34; </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> is being emitted to combat climate change and global warming. While </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> monitoring technology is key to this, existing systems largely rely on batteries or wired power system, imposing limitations on installation and maintenance. The KAIST team tackled this by creating a self-powered wireless system that operates without external power.</span></p>

<p><span>The core of this new system is an &#34;Inertia-driven Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG)&#34; that converts vibrations (with amplitudes ranging from 20-4000 ㎛ and frequencies from 0-300 Hz) generated by industrial equipment or pipelines into electricity. This enables periodic </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> concentration measurements and wireless transmission without the need for batteries.</span></p>

<p><span>The research team successfully amplified fine vibrations and induced resonance by combining spring-attached 4-stack TENGs. They achieved stable power production of 0.5 mW under conditions of 13 Hz and 0.56 g acceleration. The generated power was then used to operate a </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> sensor and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system-on-a-chip (SoC).</span></p>

<p><span>Professor Kyeongha Kwon emphasized, &#34;For efficient environmental monitoring, a system that can operate continuously without power limitations is essential.&#34; She explained, &#34;In this research, we implemented a self-powered system that can periodically measure and wirelessly transmit </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> concentrations based on the energy generated from an inertia-driven TENG.&#34; She added, &#34;This technology can serve as a foundational technology for future self-powered environmental monitoring platforms integrating various sensors.&#34;</span></p>

<p><span>This research was published on June 1st in the internationally renowned academic journal `<span>Nano Energy</span> (IF 16.8)`. Gyurim Jang, a master&#39;s student at KAIST, and Daniel Manaye Tiruneh, a master&#39;s student at Chung-Ang University, are the co-first authors of the paper.<br/></span><span>*Paper Title: Highly compact inertia-driven triboelectric nanogenerator for self-powered wireless </span><span>CO</span><span>2</span><span> monitoring via fine-vibration harvesting<br/></span><span>*DOI: 10.1016/j.nanoen.2025.110872</span></p>

<p><span>This research was supported by the Saudi Aramco-KAIST </span><span>CO</span><span>2 </span><span>Management Center.</span></p>
