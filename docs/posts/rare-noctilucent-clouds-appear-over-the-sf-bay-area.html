            <p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/How-to-see-noctilucent-clouds-17300366.php">Noctilucent clouds</a> — the rarest clouds in the world — glowed like shimmering cobwebs in the sky over the <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> Bay Area early Friday morning, and experts think they were likely the result of a rocket launch. </p>
                <p>Skywatchers across the region were delighted by the otherworldly spectacle overhead and shared images on social media. One Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Srhogan1984/status/1603762230113116161">posted</a> a photo taken in the Sunset District at 6:30 a.m. &#34;Pretty crazy looking,&#34; the tweet read.</p>
    <div id="paywall">            <p>Scientists chimed in with excitement. &#34;Great shot of what appears to be a noctilucent cloud over the SF Bay Area this morning!&#34; UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain <a href="https://twitter.com/Weather_West/status/1603779018846789633" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> in response to one photo. &#34;Such clouds are very rare at this latitude and also in winter, and are the Earth&#39;s highest and driest clouds, forming in the mesosphere about 50 miles (!) up.&#34; </p>
        <!-- hearst/article/content/embed.tpl -->

<!-- e hearst/article/content/embed.tpl -->            <p>The National Weather Service confirmed Bay Area residents were indeed looking at noctilucent clouds just before sunrise, and the the clouds&#39; occurrence is highly unusual. The clouds are most prevalent in the polar regions at the North and South Poles. When they do appear on the West Coast, which isn&#39;t often, they more commonly form in the Pacific Northwest. </p>
                <p>&#34;They were being reported right around sunrise,&#34; Matt Mehle, a forecaster for the weather service told SFGATE on the phone. &#34;There are several photos floating around showing the clouds in San Francisco ... I saw a photo taken in Point Reyes.&#34; </p>
                <p>Noctilucent clouds form when water droplets crystallize around fine dust particles, resulting in clouds of ice that can reflect light from the sun. The process occurs high in the atmosphere&#39;s mesosphere, where temperatures are colder than -180 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ama/noctilucentclouds">weather service</a>. While most clouds float no more than 10 miles above Earth, noctilucent clouds are some 50 miles up in the sky.</p>
                <p>Cora Randall, a professor in the University of Colorado Boulder&#39;s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, suspects this morning&#39;s spectacle was the result of water vapor from the exhaust of the <a href="https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/category/vandenberg-sfb/">Falcon 9 SpaceX launch at Vandenberg</a> Air Force Base in Santa Barbara at 3:50 a.m.</p>
                <p>Mehle backs Randall&#39;s hypothesis.</p>
                <p>&#34;That would make sense as to why we could see them around here because typically when they occur naturally it&#39;s in the Seattle area and Oregon, and not Northern California,&#34; said Mehle, who last saw the clouds in the Bay Area on Oct. 28, 2011, after a rocket launch at Vandenberg.</p>
                <p>Randall said the season for naturally occurring noctilucent clouds is May through August in the northern hemisphere and November through February in the southern hemisphere. &#34;Today is definitely outside the normal season for noctilucent clouds in the northern hemisphere,&#34; she wrote in an email. &#34;It is well known that rocket exhaust leads to noctilucent formation outside of the noctilucent seasons.&#34;</p>
                <p>Researchers believe the clouds may be occurring more frequently due to decreasing temperatures and/or increasing methane in the mesosphere. These effects are caused by &#34;anthropogenic activities,&#34; or human activity creating pollutants, Randall told <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/How-to-see-noctilucent-clouds-17300366.php">SFGATE </a>for a previous story with tips on how to see noctilucent clouds. </p>

<!-- e hearst/article/content/embed.tpl -->            <p>Oakland resident<a href="https://www.rainhayes.com/"> Rain Hayes</a> spotted the clouds over the Bay Area this morning from her apartment that&#39;s on the sixth floor of a building overlooking Lake Merritt. She took a photo at 6:15 a.m. with her iPhone and <a href="https://twitter.com/RainHayesPhoto/status/1603760578698153984">posted it on Twitter</a>.</p>
                <p>&#34;They seemed unusually shimmery and bright and I wasn’t quite sure what I was looking at,&#34; Hayes, who is a professional photographer told SFGATE. &#34;I knew the moon had already set. I’m facing east with the camera, the moon sets in the west and the Oakland skyline is in the way but I didn’t know how it could be illuminated by the moon. It was right between astronomical and nautical twilight. There’s usually noting to bright in the sky at that time of day.&#34;</p>
