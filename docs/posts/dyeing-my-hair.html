<p data-block-key="645mb">I recently bleached and dyed my hair at home, and I really enjoyed the end result. A few people expressed curiosity, and I will probably want to refer to the process later, so here&#39;s a writeup.</p><p data-block-key="4ip2j">My factors:</p><ul><li data-block-key="dnada">I&#39;m of South Asian descent and my hair is darkest black. So I needed to bleach it before adding color.</li><li data-block-key="8crg2">The quantity of hair I wanted to color was pretty limited: a fauxhawk-type stripe from forehead to neck, maybe two inches wide, each strand 1-2 inches long. So <a href="https://arcticfox.reamaze.com/kb/bleach-please/will-one-kit-cover-my-whole-head">I didn&#39;t need the whole bleach kit</a>. I figured I needed maybe a quarter of it.</li><li data-block-key="fi1ko">I chose a few different colors of hair dye thinking I&#39;d create a cool swirly blendy pattern. It basically worked!</li><li data-block-key="ahq6i">I thought I&#39;d be able to do all of this myself, but as my spatial skills and dexterity weren&#39;t good enough, Leonard helped me with the top and back of my head. I don&#39;t know what additional stuff you might need to do this solo.</li></ul><p data-block-key="eovvt">On to the hair bleaching &amp; dyeing process!</p><h3 data-block-key="91hff">Objects needed</h3><ol><li data-block-key="7ns8l">bleach kit (<a href="https://arcticfoxhaircolor.com/products/bleach-please">Arctic Fox&#39;s &#34;Bleach, Please!&#34;</a>; I chose this because people on hair care subreddits recommended it)</li><li data-block-key="1b5cb">hair dye(s) (I picked cheapo clearance dyes from the beauty supply store: Color Jamz brand Tripped Up Turquoise, Designer Denim High Pigment, and Pastel Chic In Pink)</li><li data-block-key="18ptk">kitchen scale for weighing out a portion of the bleach kit</li><li data-block-key="ap674">nitrile or food-handling gloves</li><li data-block-key="an452">timer</li><li data-block-key="eq32h">mirror(s)</li><li data-block-key="61qte">ratty towel</li><li data-block-key="7ppj5">showercap</li><li data-block-key="5ej7o">ratty clothes that are ok to get bleach and dye on</li><li data-block-key="fro3a">electric fan</li><li data-block-key="3gcs9">plastic bowl &amp; brush for applying bleach/dye (bought these for like $8 total at a local beauty supply store; reusable)</li><li data-block-key="7tcjb">maybe a square foot of aluminum foil</li><li data-block-key="6sbaj">Vaseline</li><li data-block-key="7n6eg">book to read while waiting</li></ol><h3 data-block-key="ehud8">Phase 0: Testing</h3>

    <p> <strong>Bleaching! It&#39;s dangerous!</strong></p>
    <p data-block-key="4k6gj"><a href="https://arcticfox.reamaze.com/kb/bleach-please/a-safety-warnings">Bleach is dangerous</a> and you should heed the warnings on the package. Do that skin allergy patch test before bleaching your hair - the Bleach, Please instructions explain in detail, but basically, you make a wee bit of bleach mix, apply it to a patch of your skin, and leave it there for 48 hours to test for a reaction.</p>

So I figured I was good to go. (The bleach kit also suggested doing a <a href="https://arcticfoxhaircolor.com/pages/strand-test">strand test</a> in advance, to check whether the color would be good enough, but I didn&#39;t care about that and figured if I hated the end result I&#39;d just cut it all off.</li><li data-block-key="823bj">I saw that the dye bottles also suggested doing a patch test and a strand test, but I decided to skip those, and perhaps got lucky.)</li></ol></li><li data-block-key="7h0pj">leave hair unshampooed &amp; unbrushed for like 2 days (to protect the scalp; brushing hair can introduce tiny tears in the skin of the scalp, and bleach on those is very ouch)</li><li data-block-key="9gc8b">a friend advised: like an hour before bleaching, work in some coconut oil, which protects the hair but doesn&#39;t interfere with bleaching; I didn&#39;t have any around, so I substituted olive oil, then washed it out</li></ol><h3 data-block-key="bbp3d">Phase I: Bleaching</h3><ol><li data-block-key="ed1b2">prep objects (bleach kit, fan, etc.) in bathroom</li><li data-block-key="dngbt">open bathroom window and turn on fan</li><li data-block-key="b32a2">change into ratty clothes</li><li data-block-key="3jp3m">use Vaseline to protect hairline -- in my case, at the edge of the forehead and at the nape of my neck</li><li data-block-key="6q02d">weigh like 1/4 of the kit into the bowl</li><li data-block-key="t9u2">put gloves on</li><li data-block-key="7enf1">open kit; mix developer &amp; bleach together</li><li data-block-key="4j0k2">apply bleach mix, starting with ends, working down to roots - stay 1/8 inch away from roots, to avoid scalp irritation (I probably did not manage this)</li><li data-block-key="av1k7">finish applying to whole fauxhawk</li><li data-block-key="4vr2d">start 45-min timer</li><li data-block-key="924r5">cover head with showercap</li><li data-block-key="c968e">rinse out bowl/brush, take gloves off</li><li data-block-key="1q8pp"><b>wait 45 minutes</b></li><li data-block-key="8k5m4">rinse with lukewarm water (both my head and the showercap, since I&#39;ll want to reuse the showercap)</li><li data-block-key="7r7ur">wash head with shampoo</li></ol>

            <p data-block-key="db15a">And here&#39;s how I looked immediately after that last step. One side is indeed more blue and then it shifts into green on the other side. The top of the scalp includes a few pink bits which faded a lot faster than the blues and greens, but since the underlying color was now the bleached yellow, that worked fine as part of the blue-green-yellow spectrum.</p><p data-block-key="59ec5">From here on out I put a ratty towel on my pillow to absorb bits of dye so they wouldn&#39;t stain the pillowcase.

        <p data-block-key="1u6px">I liked it a lot immediately afterwards but I liked it even more some weeks later, as the bits near my face lightened a bit and the blues went more green.
