    <h1>What character was removed from the alphabet? (2020)</h1>

          <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, Barnes &amp; Noble, Dolce &amp; Gabbana: the <em> <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ampersand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-linkid="536e3a">ampersand</a></em> today is used primarily in business names, but that small character was actually once the 27th<sup> </sup>member of the alphabet. Where did it come from though? The origin of its name is almost as bizarre as the name itself.</p>
<h2><strong>Where did <em>ampersand</em> come from?</strong></h2>
<p>The shape of the character (&amp;) predates the word <em>ampersand</em> by more than 1,500 years. In the first century, Roman scribes wrote in <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cursive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cursive</a>, so when they wrote the Latin word <em>et</em> which means “and,” they linked the <em>E</em> and <em>T</em>. Over time, the combined letters came to signify the word <em>and</em> in English as well. <a href="https://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-3/signs-and-symbols/ampersands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certain versions of the ampersand</a> clearly reveal the origin of the shape.</p>
<h2><strong>Why was <em>&amp;</em> part of the English alphabet?</strong></h2>
<p>The word <em>ampersand</em> came many years later when <em>&amp;</em> was actually part of the English alphabet. In the early 1800s, school children reciting their ABCs concluded the alphabet with the <em>&amp;</em>.</p>
<p>It would have been confusing to say “X, Y, Z, and.” So, the students said, “and per se and.” <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/perse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Per se</em></a> means “by itself,” so the students were essentially saying, “X, Y, Z, and by itself <strong>and</strong>.” The term <em>per se</em> was used to denote letters that also doubled as words, such as the letter <em>I </em>(for “me”) and <em>A. </em>By saying “per se,” you clarified that you meant the symbol and not the word.</p>
<p>Over time, “and per se and” was slurred together into the word we use today: <em>ampersand</em>. When a word comes about from a mistaken pronunciation, it’s called a <em> <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mondegreen#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mondegreen</a></em>. (If you sing the wrong lyrics to a song, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/mondegreen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that’s also known as a <em>mondegreen</em></a>.)</p>
<p>The ampersand is also used in an unusual configuration where it appears as “&amp;c” and means <em><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/etc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etc</a></em>. The ampersand does double work as the <em>E</em> and <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>The ampersand isn’t the only former member of the alphabet. Learn what led to <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/letters-alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the extinction of the <em>thorn</em> and the <em>wynn</em></a>.</p>
