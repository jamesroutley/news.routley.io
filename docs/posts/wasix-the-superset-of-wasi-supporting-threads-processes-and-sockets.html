    <h1>WASIX, the Superset of WASI Supporting Threads, Processes and Sockets</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today we are very excited to launch a new initiative that will start shaping the future of WebAssembly on both the browser and the server.</p>
<p>WASI was announced about 4 years ago and was a great push to move the Wasm community forward. It got everyone so excited that even Solomon, the founder of Docker tweeted about it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Solomon Hykes is also an investor in Wasmer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ambition of WASI is a great one and we continue to support it, but it&#39;s slow iteration pace it&#39;s holding back the progress on making Wasm widely adopted.</p>
<h3>ü•Å Drumroll</h3>
<p>The Wasmer team and key community members have been working relentlessly to enhance the existing WASI ABI, <em>stabilizing it</em> and making it <em>more compatible with POSIX</em> programs.</p>
<p><strong>Today, we are incredibly excited to launch WASIX!</strong></p>
<p>WASIX is ready <strong>today</strong> for the community to build <em><strong>awesome</strong></em> apps and complete their runtimes: supporting threads, Berkeley <em>sockets</em>, <em>forking</em> and many more things that have been available for almost all the life of POSIX.</p>
<p>We believe this step will pave the way by making it easier to compile any apps into Wasm, to run them anywhere.
And here‚Äôs the proof: <code>curl</code> fully running on WASIX! üöÄ</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># Run curl compiled to WASIX with Wasmer!</span></span>

<p>Note: You will need <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha.1">Wasmer <code>4.0.0-alpha.1</code></a> to run it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not only <code>curl</code>... we also got <code>bash</code>, <code>CPython</code>, <code>tokio</code>, <code>hyper</code>, <code>axum</code>, <code>static-web-server</code> and many more apps and libraries running on WASIX. Even <a href="https://wapm.io/wasmer/wasmer-io">this very own website</a> runs on WASIX!</p>
<p>Did you get as excited reading this as we did working on it? Continue reading to learn more about WASIX and how you can use it!</p>
<h2>So, what exactly is WASIX?</h2>
<p>WASIX is the long term stabilization and support of the existing WASI ABI <em>plus</em> additional non-invasive syscall extensions that complete the missing gaps sufficiently enough to enable real, practical and useful applications to be compiled and used <strong>now</strong>. It aims to speed up the ecosystem around WASI so that the Wasm‚Äôification of code bases around the world can really start <em><strong>today!</strong></em> And it does so without any <em>breaking changes</em> to <code>wasi_preview1</code>.</p>
<p>WASIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs a <strong>toolchain</strong>:
<ul>
<li><a href="#rust">Rust</a></li>
<li><a href="#ccpp">C</a> (upcoming support for Zig!)</li>
<li>AssemblyScript (expect upstream support soon!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&#39;s a <strong>specification</strong>: <a href="https://wasix.org/docs/api-reference">https://wasix.org/docs/api-reference</a></li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong> support: starting with Wasmer, but we expect more runtimes joining the initiative soon!</li>
<li>Is fully runnable in <strong>browsers</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What extension features will you get with WASIX?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>full support for efficient multithreading</li>
<li>full support for sockets (<code>socket</code>, <code>bind</code>, <code>connect</code>)
<ul>
<li>IPv4, IPv6</li>
<li>UDP, TCP</li>
<li>Multicast, Anycast</li>
<li>RAW sockets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>changing the current directory (<code>chdir</code>)</li>
<li><code>setjmp</code> / <code>longjmp</code> support (used extensively in <code>libc</code> ) via <code>asyncify</code> wizardy</li>
<li><code>pthreads</code> support</li>
<li>process forking (<code>fork</code> and <code>vfork</code> )</li>
<li>subprocess spawning and waiting (<code>exec</code> , <code>wait</code> )</li>
<li>TTY support</li>
<li>asynchronous polling of sockets and files</li>
<li>pipe and event support (<code>pipe</code>, <code>event</code> )</li>
<li>DNS resolution support (<code>resolve</code> )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Running seamlessly in the browser or server</h3>
<p>WASIX programs can run anywhere: in the browser or the server.</p>
<p>As an example, we have created <code>wasmer-web</code> , which basically showcases that any WASIX program published to Wasmer (including those with threads and forking!) works also with Wasmer running on the browser.</p>
<p>Too good to be true?</p>
<p>Try it yourself online and let us know your thoughts!</p>
<p><a href="https://wasmer.sh/">https://wasmer.sh/</a></p>
<p><img src="https://wasmer.io/images/blog/wasmer-sh.png" alt="Wasmer.sh"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wasmer.sh runs <code>bash</code> compiled to Wasm/WASIX and pipes the stdin/stdout to xterm.js.
When you run <code>wasmer run syrusakbary/python</code> a new subprocess is created/forked.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>

<p>Please note that this is a preview release of the WASIX toolchains.
Building code isn&#39;t trivial yet, and there are some implementation kinks to iron out.
But we&#39;ll be working hard to make WASIX as reliable and easy to use as any other build target!</p>

<h2>Rust</h2>
<p>Compiling to Wasm/WASIX from Rust is simple. You can use <code>tokio</code>, <code>mio</code> (with full sockets support), ‚Ä¶and anything you want!</p>
<p>Just use the WASIX toolchain!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$</span><span> </span><span>cargo</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> </span><span>cargo-wasix</span></span>
<span><span># In a directory with a Cargo.toml:</span></span>
<span><span>$</span><span> </span><span>cargo</span><span> </span><span>wasix</span><span> </span><span>build</span><span> </span></span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: support for some libraries is not added upstream yet, so you may need to use a patched version.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Rust Demos</h3>
<p>Sample Rust applications that you can compile to Wasm with WASIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static-web-server - <code>wasmer run wasmer/static-web-server</code>
Uses tokio/mio under the hood.
</li>
<li>Tantivy</li>
<li>Leptos</li>
<li>Anything else‚Ä¶ literally. Even if it uses threads or anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more examples here: <a href="https://wasix.org/docs/language-guide/rust/examples">https://wasix.org/docs/language-guide/rust/examples</a></p>

<h2>C/C++</h2>
<p>We are working on a toolchain for C that will make it a breeze to compile your C applications to WASIX.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can use wasix-libc to compile your C/C++ programs to WASIX.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wasix-org/wasix-libc">https://github.com/wasix-org/wasix-libc</a></p>
<p>Here are some C applications that we compiled to WASIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bash - <code>wasmer run sharrattj/bash</code>
</li>
<li>Dash - <code>wasmer run sharrattj/dash</code>
</li>
<li>Curl - <code>wasmer run curl/curl</code>
</li>
<li>CPython - <code>wasmer run wasmer/python</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See more examples here: <a href="https://wasix.org/docs/language-guide/c/examples">https://wasix.org/docs/language-guide/c/examples</a></p>

<h2>Better together</h2>
<p>WASIX was started by just Wasmer, but we don&#39;t want it to stay that way!</p>
<p>We welcome all interested parties to help us evolve and improve the specification,
and are hopeful that other runtimes will add support soon.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://wasix.org/docs/community-and-governance">Community and Governance</a> docs, and join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rWCBJ7tH82">WASIX Discord</a> to get in touch.</p>
<h2>In summary...</h2>
<p>We got <code>curl</code>, <code>cpython</code>, <code>bash</code>, <code>tokio</code>, <code>axum</code>, and many more programs with minimal-to-no-modifications compiling to Wasm/WASIX.</p>
<p>WASIX is here to allow any developer to target WebAssembly with their already existing applications without requiring any code modification, at all...</p>
