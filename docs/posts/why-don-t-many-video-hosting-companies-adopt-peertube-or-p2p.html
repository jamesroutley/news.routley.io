    <h1>Ask HN: Why don&#39;t many video hosting companies adopt PeerTube or P2P?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I recently found the peertube and its technology is very nice. You could deliver video using p2p torrent like streaming if there are more than 1 user watching it. For me it looks like the hosting provider gets a huge savings in terms of bandwidth. But I don&#39;t see many companies making use of this technology.<p>I think Bitchute is using p2p to deliver videos, or is it, really?</p></td></div></div>
