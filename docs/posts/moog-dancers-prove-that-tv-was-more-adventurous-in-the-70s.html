<p>Was television a lot more adventurous in the ’70s? <span id="more-133485"></span></p>
<p>That’s just one question raised by this 1971 ATV video of dancers interpreting a set of Moog pieces, ranging from the abstract to synth-pop to the psychedelic. This would have been at the height of ‘Moog mania’, when the success of Switched On Bach led to an explosion of interest in electronic music.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine where you might see something like this today.</p>
<p>Check it out and share your thoughts on the ‘Moog dancers’. And if anyone has info on the music that they are dancing to, let us know!</p>
