Thanks for all of you who pointed me to my glaring mistake to subscribe to the WRONG (read: essentials) version which provides NO email. Changed to &#34;Workspace Business Starter&#34; (with in intermediate step, check comments if you are stuck like me).</p><p>My vanity domain (¨Lastname¨.net) had its email hosted on gmail, for over 10 years with a lot of success.</p><p>Util I was forced to buy Workspace. Since that moment the message &#34;We are sorry, but you do not have access to Gmail&#34; shows with NO way to enable it.</p><p>I made the mistake of having this domain registration done with an email on this domain and have lost the password for the domain registar (NetSol).</p><p>So now I can not change the MX records (password reset only works with registered email) and I have try every single possibility to contact google: to no avail.</p><p>EVERYTHING I own (user accounts and the like) are now unavailable since I lost access to my email.</p><p>Is there any google whisperer who can help or tell me where I could find help?</p><p>I am desperate...</p></div></div></div>
