<p>While I’ve posted a few technical post on my personal blog, I’ve
taken a lot of time to guest-post on the <a href="https://wormwoodiana.blogspot.com/search/label/Fogus">Wormwoodania
blog</a> about weird, macabre, and sardonic fiction and other related,
non-technical topics. I hope to continue this trend into next year.
Also, my most assiduous readers will have noticed that I’ve written more
about games. I’ve decided to keep those posts on this blog since my
intent for the site has always been about systems and systems-thinking
and games are a great way to study and model systems.</p>

<p>The vast majority of my reading this year was fiction, and I
discovered some real gems.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24201">The Eye of
Osiris</a></strong> by R. Austin Freeman - <em>This is the first book
that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in
the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham,
Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation
stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up
the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader
to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it.
The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/564">The Mystery
of Edwin Drood</a></strong> by Charles Dickens - <em>His final work
remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it.
Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the
ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The
meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation
around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from
other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints,
accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some
cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself.
What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and
although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the
“Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason
enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is
a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CHQCS/?tag=fogus-20">Chiltern
Library edition</a> of the book contains the story and a good bit of the
lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its
publication.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/shadow-people-Margaret-St-Clair/dp/B00005XVNT/?tag=fogus-20">The
Shadow People</a></strong> by Margaret St. Clair - <em>Sadly out of
print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades
and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the
1980s when I learned about it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_N">appendix-n</a> of the
1st edition Advanced D&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of
the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them
over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test
of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings
in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book
feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is
unique even today.</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/lolly-willowes-warbler-classics-annotated-edition-sylvia-townsend-warner/793f95da3bb968a0?aid=98208&amp;ean=9781959891635&amp;listref=best-things-2025&amp;next=t">Lolly
Willowes</a></strong> by Sylvia Townsend Warner - <em>The book started
as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British
middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background
decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about
only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out
on her own to the country<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> in her middle age does she gain a
central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is
where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this
unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I
don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not
expect how the story ends.</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.fantagraphics.com/collections/daniel-clowes/products/patience">Patience</a></strong>
by Daniel Clowes - <em>A profound graphic novel using time-travel to
explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through
time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he
loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’
signature psychological complexity.</em></li>

and Goldmund</a></strong> by Herman Hesse - <em>I’ve read most of the
books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this
year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his
passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in
life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the
flesh.</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/we-who-are-about-to-joanna-russ/a7176b6dc2109f04?aid=98208&amp;ean=9780819567598&amp;listref=best-things-2025&amp;next=t">We
Who Are About To…</a></strong> by Joanna Russ - <em>A small group of
astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that
rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so
the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives
on subverting reader expectations.</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tartaruspress.com/russell-fifty-forgotten-records.html">Fifty
Forgotten Records</a></strong> by R.B. Russell - <em>Another lovely
entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical
explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book
describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal
connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new
albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable,
reflective memoir threaded throughout.</em></li>

Way of All Flesh</a></strong> by Samuel Butler *A novel that follows
4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular

<p>As I mentioned, I have taken to writing more on non-technical topics,
but I’ve even taken to dabble in fiction this year. I wrote a lot of
fiction when I was (much) younger but all that I wrote from those days
resides at the bottom of a landfill in Baltimore… which is probably for
the best. I doubt that this avenue will result in any publications or
even anything worth reading at all, but I’m having a great time
regardless.</p>

magnifying the cringe that arises by stretching scenes to their breaking

dash of luck thrown in for good measure. It’s a purely stock holding and
market manipulation game where a little bit of information compounds to
large advantages if you can leverage it at the right time. I would play
this 50 more times if I could.</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262939/far-away">Far

cooperative sandbox game for 2-players but that I’ve only ever played
solo. While I think that the game as designed would be a better 2p
affair, as a solo game it’s still an interesting world-builder. I enjoy
the meta-nature of the game that allows the player(s) to not only build
the world as they explore it, but they are tasked with defining the

<h2 id="state-of-plans-from-2025">State of plans from 2025</h2>
<p>2025 was a particularly productive year for meeting my plans for the
year. Starting early in the year I knew that I needed a better way to
track my tasks. So to start the year I visited a couple of Japanese
stationary stores<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> to get some ideas. In 2024 I had
used the Hobonichi Techo<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> and while I found it
to be a lovely system, it didn’t quite work for me. First, it wasn’t
clear how or if I was making progress on my tasks without spelunking
into the past pages of the schedule. Second, I take a lot of notes
longhand in cheap composition notebooks and so I found myself jumping
back and forth between those and the Hobonichi. I tried using an insert
into my Techo case for note-taking but I didn’t like the form-factor. I
take big sprawling notes and filled the pages too quickly. So after the
new year I took a minimalist approach with a Japanese calendar
stamp:</p>

</figure>
<p>The image above shows an example, but the problem with it should be
apparent… there’s just not enough room for fidelity. OK, sure it didn’t
work as a real task tracker, but I still use it to keep track of small
bits of detail associated with days of the week like: energy level,
mood, sleep, exercise, etc. It became apparent that I needed something
that solved three problems: 1) track any number of tasks, 2) give me an
idea of my progress at a glance, and 3) be on hand already. My first
pass at this was to draw a 4-week grid on my notebook and scribble tasks
in pencil into the cells. I would then color the grid as I progressed
through tasks. This worked great for about 5 weeks until I went on a
week-long trip without my notebook, killing my solution to #3. Even
before that however I had found that I wanted to make frequent changes
and move things around, defer items, and change the colors, so it became
apparent that I had another problem to solve; 4) allow for easy change.
While I was on my week-long trip I decided to find a solution that
account for all four of my problems, and it turned out that my solution
was the solution to so many other problems… spreadsheets!</p>

<p>Above you’ll see a representational image that gives the basics of
the task tracking. The rows correspond to tasks and the columns to the
months. The white section on the left are the tasks details like
category, name, description, and success criteria. The colored segments
represent the state of the tasks regarding progress. The left-most
colored column is the current month. Each cell is filled in before the
month starts with high-level goals which are amended and modified as I
make progress (or not). The meaning of the colors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light green: Task completed and success criteria met</li>
<li>Dark green: Task completed, but its success criteria changed during
the process</li>
<li>Light orange: Not started</li>
<li>Dark orange: In progress (not shown above)</li>
<li>Red: Incomplete and/or unsuccessful</li>
<li>Gray: Not applicable. This is for new tasks that are added to the
tracker, or removed and brought back. All months are back-filled in
gray.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s the whole system. It’s easy to change and rearrange. It’s
on-hand.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> I can see how I’m doing at a
glance. Can track any number of simultaneous tasks. Perfect.</p>
<p>Enough of this meta-discussion… how did my plans for 2025 go?</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.clojure.org/">Clojure 1.13</a></em> -
<em>While a 1.13 release didn’t happen, we did release numerous updates
to 1.12 and made plans for how to fill out the next version.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async
next</a></em> - <em>We made some interesting changes to core.async to
leverage JDK 21+ virtual threads, but before that we made changes to
smooth the path for allowing opt-in use of vthreads. At the moment there
are some challenges around the way that the JVM tracks vthreads, but I
feel pretty good that if we can address those then the implementation is
solid.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://blog.fogus.me">Simplify my blog</a></em> -
<em>I completely moved away from Wordpress onto a hacked-together
Markdown/org-mode + pandoc + bash to static pipeline. It’s a piece of
junk, but so much more lightweight that what I had running for
years.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://gist.github.com/fogus/224d658be2a1afaaffe4ac1f25d1fa61">Juxt</a></em>
- <em>Juxt is my exploration in functional concatenative language design
built on the JVM. It’s not yet clear to me if or when I would ever
release this into the wild, but the explorations have been great fun and
I’ve used Juxt as a vehicle for finding relevant books and papers.<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> That said, most of my programming
time is spent maintaining and evolving Clojure, but there are rare
moments of time that I can spend on Juxt, and I plan to continue to do
so in 2025. You’ll see some interesting progress in the gist
link.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plans-for-2026">Plans for 2026</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>More non-technical writing in 2026.</em> - <em>I would like to
continue explorations of fiction and games. That’s not to say that there
aren’t a few technical posts in me still, but they will not be my
priority.</em></li>
<li><em>Publish the rules for a card game of my own design.</em> - <em>I
have a couple in the pipeline, and feel like one of them could be a
keeper.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.clojure.org/">Clojure 1.13</a></em> -
<em>Thinking around the 1.13 release is ongoing and we’d like to get it
out sooner rather than later. Stay tuned.</em></li>
<li><em>Create something with my hands</em> - <em>I have no idea what
this might be, but I’ve been putting off artifact creation for waaaaay
too long.</em></li>
<li><em>Read more non-fiction</em> - <em>I’m particularly interested in
biographies and books-on-books.</em><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Read an untranslated book</em> - <em>Inspired by the <a href="https://theuntranslated.wordpress.com/">Untranslated Blog</a>… my

<li>assess: LLMs - <em>I’m into the 3rd AI hype-cycle in my life (at
least) and this is not much different than they other two, save for the
potential market and job disruptions in play. I tried in earnest to make
AI work for me, with varying degrees of un-success. I’ve had zero
success leveraging it in my work maintaining and evolving Clojure. For
problem formation in the face of novelty, LLMs have been more
frustrating than helpful and the little gains that I’ve found were in
the very early phases of problem solving requiring a bare minimum of
experimental code. But even these examples operate wholly in the known
rather than in the unknown where I’d like to operate instead. Even in
these early stages the “hand-holding” involved was more frustrating than
helpful. In my work, the bottleneck is absolutely not the code. While I
think that the kind of up-front work that I do could inform
prompt-engineering to some degree, by the time that I get to that point
the code is often perfunctory. Most of the work that I do is devising
and investigating new problem framing rather than in interpolation of
the known (i.e. analogy play). While the latter is important for sure,
what’s known often acts as a source of tension to help motivate and
tease out potentially new solutions. And this is a huge problem in the
very nature of LLMs. That is, they are trained on the products of
problem solving processes rather then also in the very processes
themselves. Further, as a Socratic partner, LLMs are incredibly
frustrating in their inability to move a “discussion” forward. A good
Socratic partner creates pressure to move toward truth, but LLMs are too
sycophantic, lack an awareness of useful tension,<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
cannot often identify contradiction, and lack any ability to adhere to
the trajectory of a conversation. So far I’m left wanting, but because
LLMs are likely to never go away then I’ll see if these downsides get
better in the future.</em><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></li>
