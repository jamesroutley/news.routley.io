    <h1>Reliability meeting experiences</h1>
    
    
<p>
I was a new employee.  I wanted to see what the reliability situation 
was at the company.  Nobody was going to just tell me, so I had to just 
try a bunch of things to see how much could be learned from poking 
around.
</p>
<p>
How did it start?  Well, it started with me showing up at a bunch of 
disjoint meetings to see what the ground truth looked like.  One of 
them was this Monday morning show and tell for the VP.  It supposedly 
included a focus on reliability, but it was a joke.  Taking two minutes 
to read a one-pager about an outage aloud and glossing over everything 
is not a reliability review to me.
</p>
<p>
At one of them, there were two people representing a single outage.  One 
of them (&#34;user&#34;) was from this team that used GPUs to compute something 
or other.  The other one (&#34;service&#34;) managed the team that ran the 
gunk that let people ask for machines with GPUs so they can run stuff.  
What happened is that &#34;service&#34; presented it as &#34;user screwed up and 
was down because of some stuff that happened&#34;.
</p>
<p>
This didn&#39;t seem to sit right.  Why would you have the manager of a 
service team presenting the outage for one of their customers?  
Questions were asked.  
</p>
<p>
It turned out to be a completely different story than the one they were 
pitching.  In fact, what happened is that the &#34;service&#34; team made some 
change and started shipping kernels without GPU support (or something 
like that).  Every system that came up after this point therefore had 
no GPU support and so jobs that needed a GPU would not run on them.  
Eventually, through attrition, ALL systems had that no-GPU kernel, and 
so the GPU-requiring job couldn&#39;t run anywhere, and hence the outage 
happened.
</p>
<p>
That the outage happened is itself of relatively low interest on the 
grand scale of things.  Sure, to make it not happen again, this 
technical thing needs that technical thing done to it.  It&#39;s like a Star 
Trek script full of [TECH] [TECH] [TECH] nonsense.  Rotate the shield 
harmonics and repurpose the main deflector dish, already.  Monitor this, 
alert on that, test this other thing, you know the drill.  That&#39;s not 
the part to focus on here.
</p>
<p>
What was far more interesting to me is the way they tried to spin it, 
and how the &#34;user&#34; person basically sat there and let it happen at 
first.  The power dynamic was such that the &#34;service&#34; team&#39;s manager 
almost got away with it - and would have too, if not for those pesky 
questions!
</p>
<p>
That situation suggested that many more outages would follow, given that 
the people who ran the service seemed rather skilled in turning things 
around on their customers.  This is one of those cases where a little 
bit of
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/05/19/abc/">company C action</a>
would actually be preferable, I think!
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
Another meeting was rather interesting in terms of how topsy-turvy 
things had gotten at that company.  There was a whole group of people 
who did customer support from a distant state.  They were good, hard 
working people who for the most part wanted to do right by the 
customers.  Any time something went wrong, they were the ones who found 
out about it.  They issued credit memos and tried to put things right.
</p>
<p>
If something in the product was hurting the customers somehow, it would 
invariably show up in the support queues, and the support teams would 
notice patterns.  They&#39;d try to report things to the software teams 
back at HQ and would frequently be ignored, told it wasn&#39;t actually a 
problem, or otherwise dismissed with no progress to be seen. 
Meanwhile, the support queries would continue flooding in from the 
customers who were hitting problems.
</p>
<p>
The point of this meeting was to provide a relief valve of sorts: they&#39;d 
bring up issues that weren&#39;t getting traction, and then the people at 
HQ (where I was) in that same meeting would &#34;go to bat&#34; for them with 
the software teams.  First, it&#39;s harder to outright dismiss someone 
who&#39;s right there in person instead of being 2300 miles away, sure, but 
there&#39;s more to it than that.  Anyone from &#34;support&#34; was automatically 
inferior in the eyes of a great many software people, so coming in as 
not one of &#34;those support people&#34; also (dubiously) conferred benefits 
in terms of getting them to maybe pay attention by default.
</p>
<p>
At some point I had seen enough, and just told the support folks that I 
am going to inherently trust that you are diligent people who aren&#39;t 
making things up from thin air, and have good reasons for reporting 
these things.  I said that they should go ahead and open a SEV 
(think outage report, site event, service event, significant event...) 
any time they think it&#39;s appropriate, and I will support them by 
default by chasing people down on the software side of things and 
getting them to deal with the (now quite visible to the entire company)
situation.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
Some time later, I described the &#34;support&#34; situation to someone new to 
the company, and their reaction was genuine and spot on: isn&#39;t that 
backwards?  Essentially, why are we not finding out about problems 
until they make it all the way to production, make life miserable for a 
bunch of customers, turn into trouble reports, that then get noticed as 
a pattern by the senior support people, and then get pushed back to HQ?
</p>
<p>
I was glad to hear this out of the mouth of this new person, since they 
were at the sort of high-up position that (in my eyes) implied that 
they had the power to change this sort of thing for the better.  They 
could theoretically light a fire under these teams to own their 
problems better lest they incur the wrath of someone who only answers 
to the president and CEO of the company.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, not nearly enough happened, and while I don&#39;t know 
exactly why, I can always speculate.  I considered what it must have 
been like.  If things are broken and you want them fixed, fixing them 
is supposedly your job, you report to the top two people at the 
company, but it doesn&#39;t happen, then I guess &#34;the fish rots from the 
head&#34; really is true, huh?  I was not surprised when this person left 
the company earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
This encounter and another one from around the same time taught me a new 
bit of nasty truth about this line of work: it doesn&#39;t matter what title 
you have.  You can be the &#34;(S)VP of XYZ&#34; at a company, but when push 
comes to shove, if the people truly running the show don&#39;t support your 
decisions, you aren&#39;t really the (S)VP of anything, and it&#39;s time to 
leave.
