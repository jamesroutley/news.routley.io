    <h1>See a Fish? Ring the Bell</h1>

    <p><span><strong>See a fish? Ring the bell!</strong></span></p>
<p>Welcome to the Fish Doorbell. Will you help fish pass the city boat lock?</p>
<p>Every spring fish migrate upstream, in search of places to spawn. They swim through the centre of  the city of Utrecht. Unfortunatly, the boat lock is closed during spring. You can help the fish.</p>
<p><strong>Do you see a fish? Press the Doorbell!</strong></p>
<p>All the photos are collected. When there are enough fish waiting, the lock will be opened.</p>

<p><strong>Watch the live stream</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of the boat lock a camera is placed. Watch the live stream! And ring the bell when you see a fish. Please find more information on ‘About the fish doorbell’.</p>
<p>No fish? Don’t worry! Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_0qh5wnYjwth74auOgEMPg?sub_confirmation=1">Fish Doorbell News Report</a> and see the best fish videos of the week.</p>

<p><strong>Ecologists Anne &amp; Mark keep you updated on the Fish Doorbell</strong></p>
<p>First of all, thank you all for watching and helping us out! We are amazed about the number of people all around the world, that help out the fish in a small Dutch city called Utrecht. You are the best!</p>
<p>NO DOORBELL?! Please note we only have ~950 streams available. We did not expect so many help! When there are more visitors, you get redirected to the YouTube livestream. Unfortunately, YouTube doesn’t allow the doorbell function, that’s why you don’t see the button. Fortunately, we ‘only’ get a thousand pictures of every fish that appears for the camera ;).</p>
<p>Fish numbers are really increasing now. In the last days we are starting to see new species. After the pike and ide, we are now seeing perch, the common roach and freshwater bream joining the migration. Although the water is still cloudy, chances of seeing fish are increasing. You have got to be fast though, to get them in the picture!</p>
<p>Don’t forget, you can watch previous fish sightings on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_0qh5wnYjwth74auOgEMPg?sub_confirmation=1">Fish Doorbell News Report</a>.</p>
