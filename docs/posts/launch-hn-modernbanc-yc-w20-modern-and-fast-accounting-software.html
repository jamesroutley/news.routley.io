    <h1>Launch HN: Modernbanc (YC W20) – Modern and fast accounting software</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We&#39;re the team behind Modernbanc (<a href="https://modernbanc.com">https://modernbanc.com</a>). Today we’re introducing our modern accounting software designed for startups and small businesses. Here’s a demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLkJ-6liTNU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLkJ-6liTNU</a></p><p>If you&#39;re familiar with the issue tracker Linear, think of it as Linear for accounting software. It is fast, works offline, and saves you time with automated bookkeeping, accounting and invoicing.</p><p>This is our third pivot. Previously, we built infrastructure like a ledger API and payments vault to help companies create fintech products.</p><p>For this idea, our motivation came from two completely opposite experiences: using Linear and using Quickbooks. The difference in quality between the two products was shocking, and despite there being dozens of accounting tools, none come even close to the quality of Linear, Notion, or Figma.</p><p>With Linear, I’ve heard stories of engineers threatening to quit if their company switches to another tool! With Quickbooks it takes me so long to get to the right page that sometimes I forget why I opened it.</p><p>This was baffling to us because accounting is the core system of every business—it tells you what you have, what you made, and whether you’ll still be around in 12 months.</p><p>To solve this, we took a Linear-like approach, focusing on speed and quality from day one. For example, we built our own in-house real-time sync engine to ensure it’s lightning fast, works offline, and keeps your business finances at your fingertips.</p><p>Modernbanc is still early and doesn’t have every feature yet, but we believe we’ve built a long-term foundation for the best accounting software in the world. It even includes a built-in spreadsheet so you’re never limited in reporting.</p><p>Although early, the software is already useful and helps founders:  Automate bookkeeping effortlessly. Transaction rules and AI smart actions handle the work for you. Get answers to any question, including runway, burn, and custom budgets, all in one place; Create and manage invoices. Our AI will auto-match incoming payments to them; Be tax-ready with all the data available for seamless tax filing. And if you don’t have an accountant, we’ll find you one!</p><p>We’ll have more releases in the coming weeks including receipts matching, payroll integrations and AI-powered report generation.</p><p>We’ve just launched (mainly focusing on smaller US-based startups) and would love your feedback! Please give it a go at <a href="https://modernbanc.com">https://modernbanc.com</a> (you’ll see a demo workspace once you sign-up).</p><p>We’d love your feedback! If you’ve ever been frustrated by accounting software, what has been the worst part? What features are missing? Have you ever had to rely on a spreadsheet because your accounting tool could not do what you needed? We are still early, so your input will help shape what we build next. If you have thoughts, frustrations, or ideas, we would love to hear them!</p></div></td></div></div>
