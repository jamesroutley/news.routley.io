    <p>Today was Wednesday of my second week at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=24c53dc56ddd7af575ff67d7fa1194c4">Recurse Center</a> as a participant in this year’s Summer 2 batch!
Yesterday was a US Holiday so I took the day off to spend time with family. This has completely thrown me for a loop on how to number these blog posts. I’m open to suggestions. Please message me with ideas on Zulip, or <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@englishm">Hachyderm</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/englishm.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/123510893194510337">Discord</a>, or wherever else you can find me (even if it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/englishm_">Twitter</a>).</p>

<p>Most of today was spent pairing and getting to know other people. I played with sine waves and differently shaped waves in Pure Data. I paired with Erika for a while on a project involving the generation of shell completion configurations. I also had some good coffee chats and shared a bit of what I’ve learned about how work gets done within the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>.</p>

<p>I also got some good feedback on <a href="https://mikeenglish.net/blog/2023/07/03/rc-day-6/">Monday’s post</a> from other Rustaceans and learned something interesting about shared libraries that I hope to write up soon.</p>
