    <h1>Generating social media posts to promote blog posts with {shiny} and {ellmer}</h1>

<p>Writing blog posts is fun, but the next step, getting people to actually read them, can be trickier. I wanted to promote a recent blog post I co-authored for R-Ladies, but coming up with multiple social media posts felt like a bit of a chore.Instead of doing it it manually, I decided to automate the process by building a Shiny app that generates social media content using large language models (LLMs). It was a fun little project, and could even be useful for others too!</p>

<p>The app does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes a GitHub Markdown link as input.</li>
<li>Lets users specify hashtags, the number of posts to generate, and whether or not to use emojis.</li>
<li>Allows selection of tone (e.g., serious, playful, informative).</li>
<li>Calls Google’s Gemini API via the <a href="https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/" data-original-href="https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/"><code>ellmer</code></a> package to generate social media posts promotinhg the blog post.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>ellmer</code> package was released last year, and is a delightfully straightforward way to directly call LLMs from R. Google’s Gemini API, in particular, offers a generous free tier - up to 15 requests per minute, which was more than enough for my needs.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="how-it-works">How It Works<a aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" href="#how-it-works"></a></h2>
<p>The app is simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Enter the GitHub Markdown file link</strong> (or other text source).</li>
<li><strong>Set your preferences</strong>—hashtags, emojis, tone, and how many posts to generate.</li>
<li><strong>Click generate</strong>, and it spits out a bunch of posts.</li>
<li><strong>Copy and paste</strong> into your social media scheduler.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the hood, it builds a prompt using the user’s inputs and calls the Gemini API. The response is formatted into platform-appropriate posts, making it much easier to schedule across different social networks.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="deployment-considerations">Deployment Considerations<a aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" href="#deployment-considerations"></a></h2>
<p>Right now, the app runs locally, and users need to enter their own Gemini API key as an evironment variable. This prevents abuse of a shared key, but it also makes the app a bit more DIY. I’m considering deploying it on Posit Connect Cloud or a similar service in the future. The trick will be allowing users to bring their own API keys while keeping things secure.</p>
<p>Another thought: supporting multiple AI models so users can plug in API keys for different services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude.</p>

<p>Some things I’d love to add:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More refined prompts</strong> tailored to different platforms (e.g., longer for LinkedIn, punchier for Bluesky).</li>
<li><strong>Suggested images</strong> to go with posts.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a fun little side project that turned out to be actually useful - I’m going to be using it to promote this blog post!</p>
<p>I’d love to hear if you have any ideas for improvements—hit me up if you try it out!</p>
