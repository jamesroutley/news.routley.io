        So as a quick intro, my name is Joel. I live just down the road in Louisville with my wife and son. I’ve been building for the web for about 20 years now with over a decade working in Ruby on Rails. I got my start here at MojoTech, and in fact moved to Colorado when the Boulder office was first opened. I’ve since worked at a couple local startups before joining GitHub in early 2018.

        Almost seven years later, I have no plans of leaving GitHub. Which honestly feels weird to say, given how short tenures tend to be in the industry. I love the culture, the problems I get to work on, and the wonderful colleagues I work with just as much as I did when I first joined. I recognize how extremely privileged I am to say that. Even amongst peers in the industry, it’s unusual to feel this way about a job.</td>

        One of the greatest parts of working on a single codebase for so long is getting to watch the entire lifecycle of your decisions. From idea to prototype, internal release, public availability, widespread adoption, and finally long-term, keep-the-lights-on support, we have so much to learn. When you&#39;re switching companies every year, two, or three, you’re missing out on learning those lessons.

        Thankfully, with component-driven UI, we are quickly turning the corner on this issue. We have effectively total test coverage for our components. But that isn’t enough, due to how varied the frontend runtime can be. Think about the amount of tooling and research around making perfect backend code. We can, with a bit of math, prove that mission critical systems such as avionics and S3 are immune from certain failure modes. In my research, there are little to no robust guarantees around frontend.

        As Rubyists I think we are really good about working together to improve open source software. Contributing changes back to Rails based on our experiences using it. The same should be true about UI frameworks and even browsers themselves.<br/>

        One of the most inspiring things for me as I&#39;ve done this work is seeing my colleagues work to improve the greater ecosystem. For example, my colleague Keith has worked to improve browsers to the point of enabling us to remove custom behavior from our code base. In just the past 18 months, he has contributed 100 patches across five different browsers! https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/100-patches-to-5-browsers-in-18-months/

        I was recently asked by someone about whether their company should build their own design system from scratch. They had a single designer and a handful of engineers, at least an order of magnitude smaller than our team. Here’s what I told them: we can’t afford to maintain two implementations of our design system to our own standards. And even at our scale, we don&#39;t build all of our UI ourselves. For example, we use 3rd party charts (High charts) and tables (React Table).</td>

        I’d recommend thinking about UI complexity as something to budget for. And then spend it wisely, only inventing as little as absolutely possible. Because if there’s any lesson I’ve learned in my time working on Github’s UI architecture,

        It’s that the equivalent amount of code complexity costs 10x as much on the frontend as on the backend in the long run.</td>

        The UI abstraction paradox is real. Beware the cost of reinventing the wheel and reuse existing design systems whenever possible.
