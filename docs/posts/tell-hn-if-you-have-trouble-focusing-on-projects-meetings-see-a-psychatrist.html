    <h1>Tell HN: If you have trouble focusing on projects/meetings, see a psychatrist</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I have been a chronic procrastinator all my life, and I could never truly focus on classes, meetings, and everyday conversations.</p><p>You could talk to me, but I would only half listen or get distracted for a few seconds here or there. I would start personal or work projects and get super stuck for unknown reasons. I&#39;d never be able to finish a book unless it was genuinely thrilling. And I&#39;d never been able to complete any online classes I took.</p><p>Due to life circumstances, this problem got much worse in the past year or so. I couldn&#39;t pay attention to my spouse or my kids, I couldn&#39;t remember to do simple stuff, I routinely lost things such as my glasses, wallet, and keys, and all of this created a lot of unnecessary stress.</p><p>This sort of unfocused behavior always occurred, but it got much more frequent and worse to the point of generating a lot of frustration for me and those around me.</p><p>Then it got to the point I could not finish projects, start tasks I didn&#39;t like, and so on. This lack of focus almost impacted my work, yet no one seemed to notice, as I could work on things that didn&#39;t block anyone.</p><p>Following advice from my wife, friends, father, and here on HN, I looked for a psychiatrist to understand what was going on. After a lengthy consultation, the doctor told me I most likely had ADHD, and it got worse due to a more demanding lifestyle.</p><p>He prescribed me weekly therapy with a psychologist and some medicine. I was skeptical of it all at first but decided to give it a go.</p><p>I cannot express more emphatically how these two steps changed my life this past month. I&#39;m more aware of everything around me, focus on things with ease, and start and finish projects efficiently. My wife and I rarely fight anymore, and I even have the willpower to play with my kids.</p><p>It was as if my mind got pulled away at every turn, but now I can finally fully control it.</p><p>If you feel the same way I did, do look for help. Even if it makes your budget tight, it will help you beyond what I can describe.</p></div></td></div></div>
