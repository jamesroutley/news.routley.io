    <h1>I&#39;m an engineer that needs to sell my services. Any good books on sales?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently left my role as a lead devops engineer and would like to work for myself under a devops service contract model (multiple clients, each part-time). Unfortunately, I know nothing about sales or the mechanics of creating and following up on leads. Are there any good books that can explain the tools and workflows of someone who works in sales? Thanks in advance.</p></div></div>
