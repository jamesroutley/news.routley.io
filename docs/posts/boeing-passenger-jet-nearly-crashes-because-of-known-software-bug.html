The CVR fitted to G-FDZS was not removed from the aircraft as it continually overwrites itself, retaining only the last two hours of audio.</p><p>“As such, the recording of the takeoff would have been overwritten during the flight to Las Palmas. However, the FDR was removed and downloaded”.</p><p>The incident is the latest in a string of problems with Boeing jets in recent years.</p><p>The aerospace giant’s safety standards are coming under increasing scrutiny following several <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/boeing-737-max-safety-aircraft-passengers-crash-b2542773.html"><u>recent incidents</u></a>, including one <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alaska-airlines-passengers-boeing-lawsuit-b2506896.html"><u>where a disused door fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off.</u></a> There were no injuries.</p><p>In April a FedEx Airlines Boeing cargo plane landed at Istanbul Airport without the front landing gear deployed but managed to stay on the runway.</p><p>Five years ago, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5bn and make safety improvements after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boeing-british-nairobi-addis-ababa-ethiopia-b2372747.html"><u>two new 737 Max jets crashed </u></a>within the space of five months - one in Indonesia in 2018 and one in Ethiopia in 2019, killing a total of 346 people.</p><p>In May US officials <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/boeing-whistleblower-safety-report-news-b2538763.html"><u>warned Boeing it could face criminal charges</u></a> after claims the airline failed to improve plane safety and adhere to a settlement after the deadly 737 crashes.</p><p>A TUI UK&amp;I spokesperson said: “We have worked closely with the authorities to provide all available information.</p><p>“The AAIB recommendations and learnings resulting from this take-off will support the whole aviation sector and other airlines. The safety of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority.”</p><p>Boeing was contacted for comment.</p></div></div>
