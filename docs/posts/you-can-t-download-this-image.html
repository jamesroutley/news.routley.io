        Or can you? Go ahead and try downloading the lovely Mona Lisa from
        below:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://youcantdownloadthisimage.online/lisa.jpg" alt="Mona Lisa"/>
        <figcaption></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Assuming you&#39;ve just given it a go, you&#39;re probably being confronted
        with a download that&#39;s infinitely going on. What black magic is this?!

        <summary>The answer</summary>
        <p>
          When you usually try to download an image, your browser opens a
          connection to the server and sends a GET request asking for the image.
          The server responds with the image and closes the connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here however, the server sends the image, but doesn&#39;t close the
          connection! It keeps the connection open and sends bits of data
          periodically to make sure it stays open. So your browser thinks that
          the image is still being sent over, which is why the download seems to
          be going on infinitely.
