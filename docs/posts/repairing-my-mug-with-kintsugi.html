    <h1>Repairing my mug with Kintsugi</h1>

                    This is the finish line! Several months of mixing exotic compounds together, painting, brushing,
                    sanding, and a <i>lot</i> of waiting for urushi to cure have led up to this moment. The final layer
                    of lacquer is applied at this stage. I&#39;m going for a gold finish on my mug, and the recommended base
                    layer for this is <i>bengal red urushi</i>. Painting or sprinkling gold on top of red or earthy
                    materials is apparently an old trick to improving the overall color of the final result.

                    A significant driver of the cost of the kintsugi kit I purchased was the small amount of
                    astonishingly fine gold powder that came with it. Included were also a couple of balls of pure silk
                    (because why not) that, when coerced into small balls, will hold a small amount of gold powder.
                    Carefully, I brushed the gold-laden silk balls across the lines of bengal red urushi and watched as
                    they transformed, in the blink of an eye, from earthy red to brilliant gold, as if by magic. That
                    is, until I applied a bit too much pressure and smeared some of the lacquer and made a mess of a
                    couple of parts of the seams. All in all, though, I believe this part went okay. Far better than I
                    feared, at least.
