    <h1>B-Trees Require Fewer Comparisons Than Balanced Binary Search Trees</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-7272100166292231148" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Due to better access locality, B-trees are faster than binary search trees <i>in practice</i> -- but are they also better <i>in theory</i>? To answer this question, let&#39;s look at the number of comparisons required for a search operation. Assuming we store <i>n</i> elements in a binary search tree, the lower bound for the number of comparisons is <i>log<sub>2</sub> n</i> in the worst case. However, this is only achievable for a perfectly balanced tree. Maintaining such a tree&#39;s perfect balance during insert/delete operations requires <i>O(n)</i> time in the worst case.</p>
