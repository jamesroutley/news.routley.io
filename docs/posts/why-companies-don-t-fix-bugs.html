    <h1>Why Companies Don&#39;t Fix Bugs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>A few years ago, a lone programmer named t0st did something extraordinary: he fixed an 8-year-old bug in <em>GTA Online</em> that had been driving players crazy. The bug? Painfully long load times, sometimes up to 20 minutes. While the single-player mode loaded in seconds. His solution was elegant: a 13-line code tweak that cut load times by 70%. Rockstar Games, the studio behind <em>GTA</em>, rewarded him with a $10,000 bounty and patched the game. Problem solved, right? </p>

<p>Not quite.  </p>

<p>The internet erupted with criticism. How could a billion-dollar company miss something so obvious? Were their developers incompetent? As someone who’s worked in tech, I can tell you the answer isn’t that simple. The real story here isn’t about lazy developers or technical incompetence. It’s about how even the simplest fixes get lost in the labyrinth of corporate priorities.  </p>

<p>Let me paint you a picture of what likely happened behind the scenes.  </p>

<h3>The Lifecycle of a Bug</h3>

<p>Imagine this conversation happening at Rockstar (or any big tech company, really):  </p>

<p><strong>Year 1</strong></p>

<p><strong>Year 3</strong></p>

<p><strong>Year 6</strong></p>

<p><strong>Year 8</strong></p>

<p>And so the cycle continues.  </p>

<h3>Why Good Bugs Go Unfixed</h3>

<p>This isn’t just a Rockstar problem. It’s a <em>big company</em> problem. Here’s why even obvious bugs like this one slip through the cracks:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Tyranny of “Requirements”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Rotating Door of Ownership</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Myth of “Quick Fixes”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Invisible ROI</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The Happy Ending That Changes Nothing</h3>

<p>t0st’s fix was a PR win for Rockstar, but it didn’t solve the underlying issue. For every high-profile bug that gets fixed, thousands languish in backlogs, forgotten and ignored. The real takeaway here isn’t that companies don’t care about bugs. It’s that they’re often paralyzed by competing priorities, bureaucratic inertia, and the cold calculus of profit.  </p>

<p>So the next time you’re staring at a loading screen or cursing a glitch, remember: the enemy isn’t lazy developers. It’s the system that treats user experience as an afterthought. Until an outsider forces its hand.  </p>
