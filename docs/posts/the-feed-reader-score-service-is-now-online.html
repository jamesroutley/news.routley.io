    <h1>The feed reader score service is now online</h1>
    
    
<p>
The 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/05/29/score/">&#34;feed reader score&#34; service</a>
that I mentioned earlier this week is now up and running.  Several 
people reached out to me and I have sent them their unique codes and 
links to the instructions so they can get started.
</p>
<p>
As of about a day ago, we are now logging metadata on the requests, and 
as of a couple of hours ago, the reports are starting to be built.  I&#39;m 
still adding features to it, but it&#39;s already pretty clear that not all 
feed readers are built to the same standards.
</p>
<p>
This is a sample report for the sort of real programs that I see plenty 
on the actual site all day every day:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">Time span analyzed: about 17 hours (63734.284600 sec)
-------------------------------------
Number of log entries: 34
-------------------------------------
Conditional requests: 0
-------------------------------------
❗ Unconditional requests: 34
One is normal for feed initialization.
-------------------------------------
Good If-Modified-Since values: 0
-------------------------------------
❗ Bogus If-Modified-Since values: 34
-------------------------------------
Good If-None-Match values: 0
-------------------------------------
User agent: (34) &lt;redacted&gt;
-------------------------------------
Useless cookies: none!
-------------------------------------
Useless referrers: none!
-------------------------------------
Useless query parameters: none!
-------------------------------------
(Still evolving.  Check back later.)
</pre>
<p>
I&#39;ve removed the user-agent info here so you&#39;ll just have to guess at 
which software this might be.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, in the short time it&#39;s been reporting in, it always
sends requests with broken If-Modified-Since values.  This makes it get 
a full copy of the feed every time, and that makes it an unconditional 
request.
</p>
<p>
The average polling interval appears to be about 17-18 minutes.  If it 
ran all day, it would make about 45 requests and would use about 25 MB 
of data that&#39;s all redundant since nothing&#39;s actually changing.
</p>
<p>
So, it begins!  If you want to participate, send me some feedback and 
let me know.  Also, to that one &#34;wants to be a good citizen&#34; person who 
indicated interest but didn&#39;t supply an e-mail address, can you try 
that again?  Thanks.
