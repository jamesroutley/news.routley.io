          <p>We’re excited to announce that official support for .NET on Heroku is entering public beta starting today. Developers can now build and deploy applications in C#, F#, and Visual Basic, using frameworks like ASP.NET Core and Blazor, all with the simplicity and flexibility of the Heroku platform.</p>

<p>.NET has long been one of the most requested frameworks to join Heroku’s lineup, and for good reason. Known for its power and versatility .NET enables developers to build everything from high-performance APIs to complex, full-stack web applications and scalable microservices. Now, developers can combine .NET’s capabilities with Heroku’s streamlined platform for a first-class developer experience.</p>

  <a name="why-now" href="#why-now">Why Now?</a>
</h2>

<p>Over the last decade .NET has evolved from a Windows-only framework into a cross-platform and open-source ecosystem. Shaped by lessons learned and inspired by best practices from other technologies, .NET elegantly emphasizes simplicity, maintainability, and performance – qualities that naturally align with Heroku’s mission to help developers focus on building great apps without unnecessary complexity.</p>

<p>For years, developers have relied on community-built <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a> to run .NET apps on Heroku, from the <a href="https://github.com/brandur/heroku-buildpack-mono">early buildpacks</a> to the popular <a href="https://github.com/jincod/dotnetcore-buildpack">.NET Core buildpack</a>. These solutions not only showed the demand, but also demonstrated what was possible. With official support for .NET, we’re building on that foundation to deliver a cohesive and reliable experience. Developers can expect consistent updates, rigorous testing and quality assurance to confidently build and scale their applications.</p>

</h2>

<p>Our buildpack makes deploying .NET applications a breeze, offering seamless functionality out of the box with the flexibility to customize as needed. Deploying is simple:</p>

<pre><code>heroku create --buildpack heroku/dotnet
git push heroku main
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: Setting the buildpack with <code>--buildpack heroku/dotnet</code> is only required during the beta.</em></p>

<p>Whether you’re a seasoned .NET developer or new to the framework, it’s easy to get started. Check out our <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-dotnet">Getting Started tutorial</a> walking through steps to deploy a Blazor app using a fully managed Heroku Postgres database, running migrations, and more. Our <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dotnet-heroku-support-reference">.NET support reference</a> has more detailed documentation.</p>

<p>There’s no better time to use .NET for your apps — and no better place to deploy them than Heroku. <a href="https://github.com/heroku/roadmap/issues/217">Share your feedback</a> via our public roadmap and help shape the future of .NET on Heroku!</p>

<p>We can’t wait to see what you’ll build, and we’re here to help every step of the way.</p>
