</span></p><div data-testid="textComponent"><p>Having presented well over 1,000 episodes of the much-loved BBC Radio 4 series, Melvyn Bragg has made the decision to step down from In Our Time following the series which aired earlier this year. Melvyn has presented every episode of In Our Time since the series first launched in 1998.</p>
<p>In Our Time is regularly one of the BBC’s most listened to on-demand programmes around the world, its appeal spanning generations. It is one of BBC Sounds&#39; most popular podcasts amongst under 35s.</p>
<p>Over the last quarter of a century, Melvyn has skilfully led conversations about everything from the age of the Universe to ‘Zenobia’, Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. He has welcomed the company of the brightest and best academics in their fields, sharing their passion and knowledge with a fascinated audience right around the globe.</p>
<p>While he will be much missed on In Our Time, Melvyn will continue to be a friend of Radio 4 with more to come to celebrate his extraordinary career, and a new series in 2026 (details to be announced soon).</p>
<p>Melvyn Bragg says: &#34;For a programme with a wholly misleading title which started from scratch with a six-month contract, it&#39;s been quite a ride! I have worked with many extremely talented and helpful people inside the BBC as well as some of the greatest academics around the world. It&#39;s been a great privilege and pleasure. I much look forward to continuing to work for the BBC on Radio 4. Thank you for listening.&#34;</p>
<p>Melvyn first joined the BBC in 1961 as a general trainee. His BBC career has spanned the World Service, a ten-year stint presenting Radio 4&#39;s Start the Week from 1988 - 1998 as well as numerous arts and culture programmes. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy and was given a Peerage in 1998 and a Companion of Honour in 2017. Melvyn will continue to work with the BBC on future projects which are yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Tim Davie, BBC Director General, says: “Melvyn’s passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions. Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century. He leaves behind not just an extraordinary body of work, but a gold standard of broadcasting and interviewing excellence that will inspire generations to come.”</p>
<p>Mohit Bakaya, Director of Speech and Controller of BBC Radio 4 says: &#34;Melvyn has been part of the heartbeat of Radio 4 for over three decades. His fierce intellect, coupled with a wonderful curiosity and extraordinary passion for knowledge marks him out as one of the broadcasting greats. Though we will miss him on In Our Time, he leaves behind a unique legacy: the treasure trove of over 1,000 archive episodes, which are a wonderful resource for all those with a love of learning. I look forward to working with him on new projects for Radio 4.”</p>
<p>To mark the end of an era, later this year Radio 4 will be airing some of Melvyn’s most cherished episodes and there will also be a curated selection on <a title="Opens BBC Sounds in a new window" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/b006qykl" target="_blank">BBC Sounds</a> chosen by some of In Our Time&#39;s most notable fans.</p>
<p>In Our Time will be back on Radio 4 with a new presenter who will be announced in due course.</p>
