And before I begin, you should probably clarify if your views are representing The University of Calgary’s views, The University of California at Berkeley’s views, or your commercial endeavor AppCensus’s views, or your views representing any customer, agency, etc…?  If in fact these views are completely independent and personal, that is also helpful to note. </p><p>For any of the technical details about <a href="http://msgsafe.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=http://msgsafe.io/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1669979597650000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bXBP7LI2M8a_-usqwkUwU">MsgSafe.io</a>’s email software and service, that belongs in a different forum as it is not related to CA operations or CA public policy based on your description. I know you guys promote some kind of app security solution commercially, but I did note in my earlier response that our company and MsgSafe has never shipped an app that was not in BETA only and that the 5-year-old app beta was abandoned years ago and replaced with a mobile-first web experience that we think is really quite awesome on the phone browser itself without having to install any app software which is (as you guys well know) dangerous when it comes to navigating the 3rd party software that helps make apps easier to use or helps monetize them or whatever, but may also contain other stuff bad guys use for their own purposes. We abandoned mobile development years ago (as you can clearly tell) and instead of replacing it we just suggest users make use of their built-in browsers only to use the service which as you can see for yourself works amazingly well now based on React Native’s mobile capabilities. This is by far the safest way to use the email app from what I’ve been told by the team, but again in that other forum please share your suggestions because of course we want to make it even better. I encourage you to follow those up with the <a href="http://msgsafe.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=http://msgsafe.io/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1669979597650000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bXBP7LI2M8a_-usqwkUwU">MsgSafe.io</a> directly via their customer support channels and I know for a fact they will be thrilled if you can provide any positive suggestions for improving that product suite, and thank you in advance for that. I know they get a lot of suggestions, but everything helps when it comes to making products better and more secure, I think that’s one thing we all agree on. My suggestion is you don’t start the conversation with them talking about an abandoned app beta from many years ago (except maybe to say remove it), and instead focus on improving their production web application for mobile. </p><div><p>Specific to your commentary on the certificate authority and policy pertinent to this forum, I appreciate that you recognize and stated multiple times throughout your post that you have found </p><u>no evidence</u><p> of TrustCor mis-issuing certificates or otherwise abusing our authority or violating established CA policies or root policies. We obviously agree. I’m going to comment on a few of your other points for the benefit of this forum, and then I suggest we take things off-line (sideline at least) and either meet in person or have phone calls or professionally approach our discourse some other way, without you guys using the media, your twitter forces or slinging more false claims, which isn’t good for anyone including the public that we both hope to serve. </p></div><p>I’m not an attorney, but when a company registers itself as a corporate entity and lists its officers and addresses and mailing addresses and uses attorneys to do those things, often times the company initially gets registered to the attorney or there and then that information gets immediately obsoleted through amendments pointing to the real officers. I can tell you we don’t have any crossover between our officers and the officers of the other companies you mention, for certain. As for the ownership or beneficial shareholders of the company, the names you list are close, but wrong. We have had the same beneficial owners for 7 years, and while their names are &#34;similar to&#34; the names you mentioned, they are not identical and we certainly never had any ownership from companies registered in the USA. As for the cross-over between officers, I am as perturbed as you because what that website is showing (open corporates) and probably what the gov attorneys have in our records is absolutely not what exists in my files, so obviously it is my duty to reconcile this with the ownership and get it corrected and most importantly explained. Without having researched any of that, I will again refer to those other random USA companies that are not us, and that were created in other jurisdictions 7 years after we were incorporated, that sound similar to our ownership, and their potential for foul play against us in this way along with the insurance information attempt I mentioned before. It looks like the real companies were there before, but were modified and the attorneys and individuals were added to the record, whereas our records show slightly different names and without that individual. Again, I will reconcile and explain after I’ve done more research and compared these things on the complete timeline of events. </p><p>Also, we are not in USA territory based on ownership, though as you pointed out we do host some equipment in the USA. I don’t think it’s common for companies to disclose where any of their critical hosting infrastructure is located, but yes we have infrastructure in the USA and in the Caribbean, and our key locations are properly documented in our CA audits and insurance filings.</p><p>When I read your comments about the company names and the domain name, it seems like we already explained this in our initial reply to the extent my attorney is comfortable with me explaining publicly because we are concerned about follow-on civil lawsuits. Plainly stated, it looks like 7 or so years after we were founded, someone went and created companies with similar names (but instead of creating them where they belong and are already registered, they created them inside the USA). I don’t know for a fact why anyone would do this, we certainly did not do it. Our attorneys believe someone could have done this (and it agrees with our event timeline we’re creating as we investigate) for physical actions taken and may have used this with insurance companies to obtain additional nonpublic information about our company and our insurance infrastructure which is large and complicated just like every CA’s insurance has to be. When you pair that with someone also having a lookalike domain name, obviously that could be used for bad purposes (phishing, etc) against our clients or against us or against our vendors I guess, … that doesn’t look like a good combination. It looks quite nasty, actually. When we realized the domain name was out there, we took legal action and we had asserted international trademark claims and we were able to force the domain be sold to us and we have it and use it today. Who would register those companies or domain or do these things to us and why?  That’s beyond me, but none of it sounds like good behavior to me or to our attorneys. If you guys have any actual evidence of better ideas as to how these could have been used, I’d like to share that with our attorneys.</p><p>I think I’ve hit on all the big points I can talk about publicly, obviously I can’t comment on prior (whether deceased or not) employees, etc. </p><p>Oh and on our own domain ownership or prior employee domain ownership, frankly that again has to do with that MsgSafe email product and not CA operations, but our customers and the company and prior and current employees etc all register domains through it by the hundreds or thousand(s) there are at some level of provisioning or not, and we really can’t be responsible for what they all register. Certainly if any violate any guidelines we try to handle that on an individual case basis, but hopefully abuse is kept to a minimum and we have a lot of protections built-in like checking against Alexa top sites and other things CAs do operationally as part of the business. Some but not all of these protections are extended to the MsgSafe email product but that can be blurry because people register some really weird domains quite naturally and without any malice that contain weird words or substrings or whatever… </p><p>As I said happy we are to take this offline with our CA operational partners and fellow root program stakeholders and administrators, etc.</p><p>Thank you everyone,</p><p>Rachel</p><p>Please note: this message is not in direct reply to Kathleen’s message that just came in, we have not yet had time to absorb her post and will reply to Kathleen’s message on all mentioned points within the timeframe allotted. However, we did not feel the need to delay our response to Joel and Serge. </p></div><div><div><div><blockquote type="cite"><div><p><span>I want to follow this up with some additional details that I&#39;ve found:</span></p><p>We initially came across this CA after discovering the malware SDK that Joel described.

Even still, it was not even a corporate/wholesale account, it was a personal account with a variety of domains held by one of the original DecoyMail shareholders.

To the best of our knowledge (and our focused investigation) there is not and has never been shared ownership with any defense company or any USA company. This common group of investors with Measurement Systems S de RL. had already dissolved mid 2021, before these recent claims were publicized, meaning as a natural course of business and not as a reaction to any claims or adverse events. In 2021 TrustCor ownership was transferred from the initial investors/founders to the employees of TrustCor. The legal process has been very step-by-step and very slow, especially due to the protracted treatment and recent death of one key founder, Ian Abramowitz.

Relative to the tiny population of Beta product-testers (which were largely our own employees) who chose to test a Beta version of the app containing that SDK, I will add that during the development stages of MsgSafe’s BETA mobile app, our developers sought out the help from 3rd party software services to obtain better app analytics. We are aware that they evaluated other SDKs and tools like Firebase, Bugsnag, etc. but they claimed to not help much in troubleshooting and improving the app functionality across all device manufacturers and OS versions. There was a time during this process where they incorporated additional software developers to help with the issues we were facing. Whether or not the SDK was added for a developer’s own financial gain or otherwise is beyond us and we don’t care to speculate. Again, the MsgSafe BETA mobile app was never released in a production supported version and has been abandoned for years, and we can confirm the mobile-first web UI, which is the only supported mobile interface in-use today and for the last few years, which does not contain any SDK from anyone.</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div jscontroller="Ai4Tv" jsaction="click:lkS8Jd;" data-view-attachment-url="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/group/dev-security-policy/attach/5f0bb22670488/TC_CA-Quantifying_Value_Statement.pdf?part=0.0.1.1&amp;view=1&amp;view=1" jslog="82509; track:click" tabindex="0" aria-label="Download file TC_CA-Quantifying_Value_Statement.pdf" role="link"><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false"><path d="M14 2H6c-1.1 0-1.99.9-1.99 2L4 20c0 1.1.89 2 1.99 2H18c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V8l-6-6zM6 20V4h7v5h5v11H6z"></path></svg><div><p><span aria-hidden="true"></span></p><div><p>TC_CA-Quantifying_Value_Statement.pdf</p></div></div></div><div jscontroller="Ai4Tv" jsaction="click:lkS8Jd;" data-view-attachment-url="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/group/dev-security-policy/attach/5f0bb22670488/TC_Wylie_Letter_Attach.pdf?part=0.0.1.3&amp;view=1&amp;view=1" jslog="82509; track:click" tabindex="0" aria-label="Download file TC_Wylie_Letter_Attach.pdf" role="link"><svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false"><path d="M14 2H6c-1.1 0-1.99.9-1.99 2L4 20c0 1.1.89 2 1.99 2H18c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V8l-6-6zM6 20V4h7v5h5v11H6z"></path></svg><div><p><span aria-hidden="true"></span></p><div><p>TC_Wylie_Letter_Attach.pdf</p></div></div></div><div jscontroller="Ai4Tv" jsaction="click:lkS8Jd;" data-view-attachment-url="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/group/dev-security-policy/attach/5f0bb22670488/A143A9A0-CC51-41E5-9EFC-9B9009AD35ED%5B1%5D.png?part=0.0.1.5&amp;view=1&amp;view=1" jslog="82509; track:click" tabindex="0" aria-label="Download file A143A9A0-CC51-41E5-9EFC-9B9009AD35ED[1].png" role="link"><div><p><span aria-hidden="true"></span></p><div><p>A143A9A0-CC51-41E5-9EFC-9B9009AD35ED[1].png</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section jscontroller="ywEdOe" data-doc-id="EEe04872BQAJ" data-subject="Re: concerns about Trustcor" data-is-first="false" data-author="Watson Ladd" jsaction="VqL3Gc:xvWlrc;QvNAx:AHmuwe;JIbuQc:OOqk2e(onkYyb),OOqk2e(IgWJu),FUJCwf(OqWcW),Bmlfs(rKtXic),qHAave(k1xLRe);rcuQ6b:npT2md;DB0tFc:dvCNbf; keydown:hXsouf; click:mHokFf(A9KrYd),gfTIJc(yjbGtf),hXsouf;" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="true" role="listitem"><div tabindex="-1"><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu9T3LURs8NMRUmGqR-mHMiQSLHShmYZJBk9zRaEdw=s40-c" alt="Watson Ladd&#39;s profile photo" role="presentation"/></p></div></div><div><div jsname="A9KrYd"><div><p><h3 id="i52">Watson Ladd</h3></p><p><span>unread,</span></p><div><p><span>Nov 18, 2022, 1:05:24 PM (12 days ago) </span><span>Nov 18</span></p></div></div><p><span>to Rachel McPherson, MDSP, Clint Wilson, Ryan Dickson, Kathleen Wilson, joel.r...@ucalgary.ca, Serge Egelman</span></p></div><div jsname="yjbGtf" aria-labelledby="i52" role="region"><div><div dir="ltr"><div><p>On Fri, Nov 18, 2022 at 2:14 PM Rachel McPherson &lt;<a href="" data-email-masked="" rel="nofollow">rac...@trustcor.ca</a>&gt; wrote:<br/></p><blockquote><div><p>Kathleen, Ryan, Clint and the rest of the community:</p></div></blockquote></div></div></div><div dir="ltr"><div><p>My I am not accused of missiuance t-shirt is raising questions answered by my t-shirt.</p></div></div><div><div dir="ltr"><div><blockquote><div><p>I will do my best to succinctly respond to the questions and concerns from the representatives from the root programs representatives first, and then for the readers wanting additional detail, I will provide more context in the sections below the most pertinent information of my response.

Relative to the tiny population of Beta product-testers (which were largely our own employees) who chose to test a Beta version of the app containing that SDK, I will add that during the development stages of MsgSafe’s BETA mobile app, our developers sought out the help from 3rd party software services to obtain better app analytics. We are aware that they evaluated other SDKs and tools like Firebase, Bugsnag, etc. but they claimed to not help much in troubleshooting and improving the app functionality across all device manufacturers and OS versions. There was a time during this process where they incorporated additional software developers to help with the issues we were facing. Whether or not the SDK was added for a developer’s own financial gain or otherwise is beyond us and we don’t care to speculate. Again, the MsgSafe BETA mobile app was never released in a production supported version and has been abandoned for years, and we can confirm the mobile-first web UI, which is the only supported mobile interface in-use today and for the last few years, which does not contain any SDK from anyone.</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></div></div><div dir="ltr"><div><p>Finally let me note that the general evasiveness, thinly veiled legal threats, and contemptuous attitude this entire email contains have convinced me that TrustCor does not have the appropriate attitude for a CA.  Rather than openly share information to assuage the community and rebuild that most precious and delicate material of human relations, trust, Rachel has chosen to obfuscate, feign ignorance and give partial answers to some very serious questions.<br/></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Watson Ladd<br/></p></div></div>

Likewise, we have not assisted or enabled any company or 3rd party to surveil, monitor or in any way gather information on our customers for the purposes of providing it to anyone else in any form, nor do we sell or broker customer data. Whether you’re a customer that has never paid us anything and you enjoy a free service level, or if you’re a customer who pays us for our most premium tier of service, your data is safe from prying eyes from the outside, and it always has been. With the help of our email products and services, we have enough premium paying customers to afford to make our downmarket services low-cost or free temporarily, and encourage people to spend money and upgrade for more features. Our email service operates at a statistically low level of abuse because we do things automatically to reduce the opportunity for abuse, such as limiting outbound email per account and automatically closing accounts when successive bounce notifications are received, and we process other complaints manually as efficiently as we can. </p><p>TrustCor has never allowed a certificate and/or key material to be generated outside of our audited and published standard processes, common amongst the entire industry. We live in a world with:</p><div><ul><li>certificate transparency logs;</li><li>face to face audits once or more per year with 3rd party auditors visiting our locations and having direct access to internal records, offices and equipment;</li><li>network security audits by separate, recognized industry experts;</li><li>industry-approved, fixed set of options for auditors controlled by WebTrust/AICPA;</li><li>the CA/B Forum and CCADB;</li><li>and hyper-social accountability.</li></ul></div><p>To assert there has been any violation or bypass of these safety measures would be silly, or at least completely impractical, and would render the standards a waste of everyone&#39;s time and money—which would set a new precedent. What&#39;s more, we&#39;ve never even been accused of any false issuance or mishandling of material. Between the additional security afforded by our board-level exclusion provision designed to protect our CA business unit, and our nearly decade-long track record of having no change in control (only the payment of debt to prior shareholders), we operate a valuable, growing enterprise that serves global public interest and provides unique value to the community.</p></div><p>Some might argue this discourse is all healthy to shine more light onto this small community trying to make the Internet better and safer. However, the accusations and false claims against us have debilitating impact on our ability to service our customers, and instead have mainly served the self-interest of the accusers who are trying to drive traffic and intrigue into their startup company, despite their overt university affiliations. </p><p>And what exactly is the researchers&#39; narrative? We’ve been accused of a &#34;shady&#34; corporate structure, but what they presented wasn’t an accurate reflection of our corporate structure even a year ago (which by the way was not significantly different than other corporate structures in any company). We’ve been accused of including some other company’s &#34;bad&#34; 3rd party software in an app, but that app never made it out of beta, and was already abandoned over 3 years ago, never having been released in production as a supported endpoint. Now they continue to recursively shake trees to try and associate shareholders-of-shareholders (2 or more parts removed) from the company and prior (already-dissolved) holding companies to try to establish any link with any other company, even though our exclusion provision would render that useless and immaterial and thus it would have no impact on CA operations. Likewise, because they don’t have experience in the CA ecosystem, they’ve already gone many steps beyond the scrutiny placed on any other member of these root CA programs because 2-degrees-removed shareholder enumeration is certainly not a feasible requirement to levy on any company, and is especially pointless when the equity holder interest cannot threaten CA operations (due to exclusion provisions). </p><p>Similar to our response of the previous comments made by Joel, we are obliged to respond that there are aspects of what Joel has stated both in his report and in his supplemental statements with which we disagree, would dispute or are factually inaccurate. We cannot ignore blanket statements designed to confirm our assent, of which there were several of these again.</p><div><p>I will respond below to the summarization points and additional questions raised by the researchers, many of which have already been addressed by our previous replies.</p></div><p>—————————————</p><p><b><u>In Response to Joel’s (University of Calgary/AppCensus) summarization and restatement (simplification) of previous responses,</u></b></p><div><p>Allow me to first address the summarized points, but please first note that we have addressed most (if not all) of these in-context in earlier replies. I believe in good faith you’re trying to simplify these topics, but it’s not easy or at least it’s not straightforward to do that. Many of these summarized points are factually inaccurate and contain misused legal terminology, which makes this extremely difficult for readers because the statements are misleading, especially when stated out of context as they are. I am not an attorney, and likewise you are not an attorney (unless you also have a JD, you have not shared that). That makes this dangerous because corporate law is not simple just like computer science is not simple. When you add the complexities of multinational jurisdictions,  </p><SPAN color="#000000">differences in language of the same legal terms having a different meaning across legal territories, </SPAN><p>and applying terminology and constructs that vary between those territories, there’s lots of room for misinterpretation and error that neither of us intend to cause. To give you a tangible example of how slippery a slope this is and how it can be easily misinterpreted: the open corporates guys are trying to normalize data from many different legal territories and for example, they list corporate &#34;officers&#34; and &#34;members&#34; in the same list. Obviously a &#34;company&#34; cannot be an &#34;officer&#34; inside another company (perhaps it can elect legal representatives to serve on a board of directors, but that’s different), just as an officer doesn’t necessarily mean someone is an owner or managing member of a company. Therefore that list is totally ambiguous. It’s not their fault, they’re getting data in different languages that’s translated and &#34;normalized&#34; for them so by the time they &#34;get it&#34; the data is already probably &#34;imperfect,&#34; so to speak. Also, as you have already shown, filings can be created by attorneys or &#34;others&#34; listing controlling members or officers using &#34;other people’s names&#34; for a variety of reasons which can be helpful or perhaps malicious. </p><u>This is precisely why management assertions and auditing standards are so important. Legal territories are not the same for everyone, so at least the auditing standards can be made the same for everyone (as they have been). The public has to rely on management assertions being 3rd-party-validated by approved auditors. That’s how the system has worked as long as any of us can remember, and it’s a pretty good system. Could it get better? Maybe, but remember you have to solve the problem for the whole world in this, not just North America.</u></div><p><b>In response to: &#34;(i) The Panama open corporate records were accurate in 2020 and earlier, but at some point in 2021 have changed.

You’re not just in the weeds and going far beyond our already-generous level of detail, but now you’re in the weeds using legally inaccurate terminology such as &#34;partners&#34; and others when we have already provided that level of detail in context.</p></div></blockquote><div><div><div><div><p><b>In response to: &#34;</b></p><SPAN color="#000000"><b>(ii) These companies are also partners for Measurement Systems S.

While again I can’t speculate, my point is simply that making statements about those companies would not only be speculation, but it would be speculation in a direction that is known to be false, meaning your premise and statement is a false claim. You may not intend for it to be, but it is. If a company is already dissolved, it would not be possible for it to be a &#34;partner&#34; (again wrong legal term, but trying to be helpful to you) in any other businesses. You used &#34;are&#34; in present tense, yet as of more than a year ago that would not be accurate for any company in the same way as it was not accurate for us. I don’t know the disposition of that other company or its interactions with its shareholders in the past or present, but what we do know for certain is that the holding companies you mentioned were already dissolved. Therefore, we know that as of more than a year ago, those holding companies (once dissolved) were not &#34;involved in&#34; that other company either. </SPAN></p><p><SPAN color="#000000">It’s not my place to speak for anyone other than TrustCor, but you might also be wrong about that other company—maybe not because you didn’t try to get it right, but because you had outdated information and probably didn’t speak to them to make sure you had the latest or most accurate information. Also if they’re not subject to audits like we are then maybe you couldn’t or wouldn’t believe them anyway, but again there’s no point in speculating. </SPAN></p></div></div></blockquote><div><div><div><div><p><b>In response to: &#34;</b></p><SPAN color="#000000"><b>(iii) The CHIVALRIC HOLDING COMPANY, LLC has no relation to the Chivalric Holding </b></SPAN><SPAN color="#000000"><b>Company LLC registered in New Mexico formed Sept 2020 dissolved June 2022 with </b></SPAN><SPAN color="#000000"><b>officer Vito Piacente, unless the relation is due to an attack against TrustCor.</b></SPAN><p><b>&#34;</b></p></div></div></div></div><blockquote><div><p><SPAN color="#000000">We cannot comment on the activity of another company, as any comment would be purely our speculation.

All I can say is that it isn’t us, and that it would not make any sense for it to be us, and I don’t know anything about it. In fact, had you not brought some of these things into the public spotlight, they may have gone unnoticed by us completely because anybody can open a business in any name basically anywhere, anytime. That may violate trademarks, but that would mean the guy who owns the marks would have to know it happened and assert themselves.  Who knows, there may even be a &#34;Joel and Rachel Corp&#34; in Haiti for all I know, and nobody needs my or your permission to register it, open or close it. Apparently in some regions / states in the USA you don’t even need to prove who you are to open a company in any name, or provide an ID. So I guess technically even if it was registered by a person, that person may not even be the person whose name it is registered under. I assume you can’t open a bank account (at least I hope you can’t!) without an ID and without being the person you say you are, but apparently those rules do not apply to people registering companies.

We confirmed through corporate records and email searches that no such agreement was ever obtained by the company or company counsel. Also, none was included inside the software/check-in to revision control.

Further, their opinion was that damages might not be readily provable because (as previously stated) the mobile app was never &#34;released&#34; or rather it was only provided for testing in a BETA form (that specifically admonished it was a beta and not supported) and used primarily by our own employees testing it. I realize the existence or proposition of this basically-unused beta software may have been a boon to AppCensus reporting and is of intellectual interest to the researchers, but our company sees no benefit to any legal or other pursuit with regard to benefitting our customers, or any relying parties. </p><blockquote></blockquote></div></div></blockquote><div><div><div><div><p><b>In response to: &#34;</b></p><SPAN color="#000000"><b>(vi) The Msgsafe website is implemented where the key material and </b></SPAN><SPAN color="#000000"><b>PGP/SMIME encryption/decryption processing is performed on Msgsafe servers, with industry standard TLS used to secure the connection from the browser to Msgsafe </b></SPAN><SPAN color="#000000"><b>servers.</b></SPAN><p><b>&#34;</b></p></div></div></div></div><blockquote><div><div><p>Your statement is incomplete and also not accurate without additional context, and the answer is more complicated than an &#34;always&#34; and &#34;never&#34; situation because it is <b><u>highly</u></b> dependent on a user’s individual configuration and the options users choose to implement, which may be different than any default software behaviours.

To address your concerns, based on our team&#39;s exhausted research into many other providers offering similar services, one basic rule applies; whether the encryption or decryption functions are occurring on the client (often in javascript) or on the server, the server is still storing and handling the key material in the process. Our implementation is one of two commonly used by secure messaging services and chosen for a few reasons. If encryption occurs on the client then the key material is passed from the server to the browser over TLS. If the encryption occurs on the server then the message is transferred from the client to the server over TLS, then encrypted. As the <a href="http://MsgSafe.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=http://MsgSafe.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1669979597997000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2yu7QKqAw2Rtsh0UHBe8ok">MsgSafe.io</a> website explains, our team has found that implementing the key material and encryption/decryption processing on the server provides security without the additional processing requirement on the client. One of the benefits of this implementation is that it allows slower/older devices (phones) to utilize our mobile-first web experience (since, as we previously mentioned, we abandoned development of a mobile app, which could have done the encryption/decryption process on the mobile phone), while also supporting desktop users. To be clear, at no point is data passed in the clear while using the service, it is either encrypted with the user key material or encrypted with industry-standard TLS.</p></div></div></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><div><div><p>Of course we can accept the possibility of a weakness in <a href="http://msgsafe.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=http://msgsafe.io/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1669979597997000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0b6IiXxxCfdVrkgjhzXe3w">MsgSafe.io</a>&#39;s user interface, we take such reports very seriously, but we would be surprised to find that to be the case here.

Whether the decryption is happening in javascript or in python or in any language, on the client or on the server, if the user came with &#34;nothing&#34; from a public computer, then the keys are necessarily on the server.

Once it completes we will be pleased to share the public records, but we cannot control how long it takes various attorneys to reflect changes upon death, etc. Obviously Ian’s name is on many records already publicized and searching for his name allows anyone to see his memorial website from June 2022 (but he had been in treatment for some time) and other public records of this type. Since its inception in 2013, TrustCor’s CA business unit has been completely insulated and protected from any shareholders through its exclusion agreement, which separates equity ownership from access-to or control-over the CA business unit. </blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><br/></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><blockquote>In Response to &#34;They have identical corporate officers: Measurement Systems, Trustcor Systems”:<br/></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><br/></blockquote><blockquote>This statement is inaccurate because the funding/holding companies in question were already dissolved in 2021.

The researchers&#39; conclusions that the journalists further expound are confusing the facts. For example, if it holds that any &#34;investor&#34; in one company (making them an &#34;affiliate&#34; of that company) is also affiliated as an &#34;investor&#34; in another company, links the two companies together as affiliates, and then even when one of those two companies further invests in a third company (one part removed), basically most businesses and even CAs come into question because of the suggested transitive property. Also conflated by the researchers and media is the point about American corporations bearing similar (not exactly the same) names to those of the funds/holding companies in question. We are not now and never have been owned by any American company with any names similar to those pointed out by the researchers. We have no idea what those companies are or what are their purpose, but they are not affiliated with our company or anyone known to us. Our business was formed in Panama over 9 years ago and any paperwork filed in the last few years, pointing to an American or similar-named company was not executed by us or affiliated with us in any way.</blockquote></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><blockquote><blockquote><br/></blockquote>In Response to: &#34;Like Measurement Systems, Trustcor is also registered in Panama [17].

This common group of investors with Measurement Systems S de RL. had already dissolved mid 2021, before these recent claims were publicized, meaning as a natural course of business and not as a reaction to any claims or adverse events. In 2021 TrustCor ownership was transferred from the initial investors/founders to the employees of TrustCor.

Our software revision control system revealed immediately when the software was introduced and which developer introduced it. As I had previously stated, &#34;… they incorporated additional software developers to help with the issues we were facing.&#34; The additional developers were contract developers. Also as I previously stated, &#34;Whether or not the SDK was added for a developer’s own financial gain or otherwise is beyond us and we don’t care to speculate.&#34; Our investigation found the developer in question properly signed our standard &#34;Confidentiality Obligation and Invention Agreement” that requires any developer to obtain a corporate license to any 3rd party software or intellectual property the developer chooses to include. We confirmed through corporate records and email searches that no such agreement was ever obtained by the company or company counsel. Also, none was included inside the software/check-in to revision control. We also confirmed no approval for including this third-party software was ever obtained from Wylie (technically the manager of the developers at that time). Technically that individual developer violated our Confidentiality Obligation and Invention Agreement. </blockquote><blockquote><br/></blockquote><blockquote>When we discussed this with legal counsel, their opinion that a labor dispute over an agreement violation that took place over 3 years ago would be limited/difficult to pursue, especially since the developer has not worked for the company in 3 years since native app development was abandoned in favor of our decision to focus on our mobile-first web application, which involves completely-different skillsets / personnel. Further, their opinion was that damages might not be readily provable because (as previously stated) the mobile app was never &#34;released&#34; or rather it was only provided for testing in a BETA form (that specifically admonished it was a beta and not supported) and used primarily by our own employees testing it. I realize the existence or proposition of this basically-unused beta software may have been a boon to AppCensus reporting and is of intellectual interest to the researchers, but our company sees no benefit to any legal or other pursuit with regard to benefitting our customers, or any relying parties. </blockquote><blockquote><br/></blockquote></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><blockquote>In Response to &#34;… I decided to spend a little bit more time exploring it … [many lines of technical details] … This certificate was issued by/to MsgSafe (it appears to be self-signed)&#34;:</blockquote></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><blockquote><blockquote>Prior context:</blockquote><blockquote>In Response to &#34;How was an unobfuscated version of the Measurement Systems SDK incorporated into MsgSafe?&#34;:</blockquote><blockquote>Our company never published a production or supported version of the MsgSafe mobile app containing the Measurement Systems SDK.

The decision to trust a CA is an ongoing one, and the behavior of its representatives is evaluated in that light, as representative of the attitude taken by the organization to its responsibilities. Your aggressive bloviation and evasion contrasts quite negatively to the openness with which other CAs have addressed issues before, and is most certainly affecting the trust that I would consider reasonable to place in TrustCor.<br/></p><p>In particular it is not clear to me what the entities and people being discussed who have ownership of TrustCore CA are, what all the jurisdictions where operations or entities were formed are, how these structures change over time, and what transactions were supposed to effect these changes. All we hear is a few pieces and disputing that we need to care about the rest. You talk about an operational insulation agreement, but haven&#39;t provided any details or indicated where details might be found. This incompleteness makes it difficult for me to assess your assertions about the entities involved.  Nitpicking the tense and grammar of questions reminds me of nothing so much as a former President.</p></div>

The original concerns, except the potential links to a spyware operation, didn&#39;t feel like grounds for distrust to me. However, the way this CA approached the claims leaves me with no trust in their operations. Every communication was combative, condescending, not forthcoming, vaguely threatening, and showing contempt for the forum and the process. Multiple times they point fingers at other operators, rather than take the opportunity to note potential improvement areas. They tell us what we are supposed to care about, instead of proactively striving for transparency.<br/></p><p>Overall, I can&#39;t tell if the core concern—the link to a spyware operation—is assuaged or drowned and misdirected, but I do leave with the impression that TrustCor can only be relied upon to operate at the minimum common denominator of the baseline requirements. My understanding is that the baseline requirements are just that, a rock bottom that no CA may drop below, and not a bar that is sufficient to clear to deserve trust. Instead, TrustCor seems to believe meeting the baseline is all that is required of them, and disputes any other concerns by remarking they meed the baseline.<br/></p><p>Fundamentally, a baseline CA is not particularly valuable, especially if it serves a single relatively low-volume customer, and it would seem to me it exposes the Mozilla and WebPKI community to more risk than it&#39;s worth.<br/></p><p>Best,<br/></p><p>Filippo<br/></p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section jscontroller="ywEdOe" data-doc-id="lV6kFKL_BAAJ" data-subject="Re: concerns about Trustcor" data-is-first="false" data-author="Cynthia Revström" jsaction="VqL3Gc:xvWlrc;QvNAx:AHmuwe;JIbuQc:OOqk2e(onkYyb),OOqk2e(IgWJu),FUJCwf(OqWcW),Bmlfs(rKtXic),qHAave(k1xLRe);rcuQ6b:npT2md;DB0tFc:dvCNbf; keydown:hXsouf; click:mHokFf(A9KrYd),gfTIJc(yjbGtf),hXsouf;" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="true" role="listitem"><div tabindex="-1"><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu8da_RXqPdxffq_jQe9rvnd4elOOkWUPPcFblhkIg=s40-c" alt="Cynthia Revström&#39;s profile photo" role="presentation"/></p></div></div><div><div jsname="A9KrYd"><div><p><h3 id="i124">Cynthia Revström</h3></p><p><span>unread,</span></p><div><p><span>Nov 27, 2022, 5:09:06 PM (3 days ago) </span><span>Nov 27</span></p></div></div><p><span>to Filippo Valsorda, dev-secur...@mozilla.org</span></p></div></div></div></div></section><section jscontroller="ywEdOe" data-doc-id="XRiWGz4JBQAJ" data-subject="Re: concerns about Trustcor" data-is-first="false" data-author="Rachel McPherson" jsaction="VqL3Gc:xvWlrc;QvNAx:AHmuwe;JIbuQc:OOqk2e(onkYyb),OOqk2e(IgWJu),FUJCwf(OqWcW),Bmlfs(rKtXic),qHAave(k1xLRe);rcuQ6b:npT2md;DB0tFc:dvCNbf; keydown:hXsouf; click:mHokFf(A9KrYd),gfTIJc(yjbGtf),hXsouf;" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="true" role="listitem"><div tabindex="-1"><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu-EtUs2AcNZrkm6S2P7MCZCpJdhsYk1Pp2erwMX=s40-c" alt="Rachel McPherson&#39;s profile photo" role="presentation"/></p></div></div><div><div jsname="A9KrYd"><div><p><h3 id="i130">Rachel McPherson</h3></p><p><span>unread,</span></p><div><p><span>Nov 27, 2022, 8:05:12 PM (3 days ago) </span><span>Nov 27</span></p></div></div><p><span>to MDSP, Kathleen Wilson, Ryan Dickson, Clint Wilson</span></p></div><div jsname="yjbGtf" aria-labelledby="i130" role="region"><div><div><div><p>Dear Kurt, Watson, Filippo &amp; Cynthia,</p><div><SPAN color="#5856d6"><br/></SPAN><p>Thank you all for chiming in.
