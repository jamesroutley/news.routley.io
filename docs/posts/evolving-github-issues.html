<p>GitHub Issues has been how the world’s best software teams collaborate since it first launched in <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/github-issue-tracker/">2009</a>. Today we are excited to unveil a major evolution of issues and projects, featuring a range of highly requested enhancements including sub-issues, issue types and advanced search for issues. Together, these additions make it easier than ever to break down work, visualize progress, categorize and find just the right issue in GitHub.</p>
<p>These new features are now available in public preview for you to try. To gain access for your organization, please sign up <a href="https://github.com/features/issues/signup">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="break-down-and-nest-issues-with-sub-issues">🔗 Break down and nest issues with sub-issues<a href="#break-down-and-nest-issues-with-sub-issues" aria-label="🔗 Break down and nest issues with sub-issues"></a></h2>
<p>Sub-issues allow you to break down and organize issues within a parent-child hierarchy. You can create sub-issues from any issue and use their nested structure to track progress and understand remaining work. You can also easily track sub-issues progress within your projects.</p>


<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/adding-sub-issues">Learn more</a> and share feedback on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/139932">sub-issues</a>.</p>
<h2 id="organize-your-work-with-issue-types">📁 Organize your work with issue types<a href="#organize-your-work-with-issue-types" aria-label="📁 Organize your work with issue types"></a></h2>
<p>Issues types allow you to classify and manage your issues with a shared and consistent language across all repositories in an organization. You can quickly understand the progress of your bug backlog, find all of the high level initiatives teams are working on, and understand the breakdown of work in a project.</p>

<p>From the repository issues page, you can build advanced searches using the <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> keywords and parentheses for nested searches. This allows you to build more complex filters to find the exact set of issues you’re looking for.</p>

<h2 id="issues-ui-updates">🎨 Issues UI updates<a href="#issues-ui-updates" aria-label="🎨 Issues UI updates"></a></h2>
<p>All these new features are based upon an update to the issues front end, designed to be fast and familiar. This means there are no new UI patterns to slow you down, but we did include a few tweaks to speed you up, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issues index page has a new filter bar with autocomplete and syntax highlighting.</li>
<li>Creating multiple issues is faster with a ‘create more’ option to quickly get back to the creation screen.</li>
<li>Issue form and templates are now presented in alphabetical order based on file name, making it easier for you to set just the right order.</li>
<li>Easily share the URL to an issue with a new ‘copy link’ button.</li>
<li>On long issues, selecting ‘load more’ will now fetch 150 events instead of 50.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="increased-items-in-github-projects">♾️ Increased items in GitHub Projects<a href="#increased-items-in-github-projects" aria-label="♾️ Increased items in GitHub Projects"></a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, we introduced the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2024-02-12-github-issues-projects-projects-without-limits-private-beta/">private beta of increased project item limits</a>, expanding the capacity from 1,200 to 50,000 items in a project. Today, we’re expanding the audience for these increased limits.</p>
<p>Since the private beta, we’ve added support for slice by, swimlanes, and GraphQL API. We’ve also fixed your top bug reports and made performance improvements.</p>
<p>If you’re a project admin and your project is approaching the item limit without utilizing Insights (our only currently unsupported feature), a banner will appear over your project to notify you.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b0efffa-11b3-43ed-9065-56afd2278a67" alt="The sign up banner for the increased items waitlist" width="700" loading="lazy"/></p>
<p>As this update is on a project by project basis rather than per organization, to join, just click the “Join beta” button on eligible projects.</p>
