    <h1>String pinsetters are upending bowling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Something mysterious awaits Kevin Mills at the far end of the bowling lane, down there in the shadows.</p><p>It doesn’t matter that his fingers find just the right grip on the ball. Or that he takes three careful strides on the way to a smooth throw, finishing in a classic bowler’s pose. Something is making him uneasy.</p><p>Sure enough, it sounds weird when the ball hits home, more clattering than thunderous. The pins don’t scatter like normal; two remain standing.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ef6f5b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/320x193!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21d07df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/568x343!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5cf61c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/768x464!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/354cd7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/1080x652!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1767d17/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/1240x749!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf5381c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/1440x870!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad2d197/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/2160x1305!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw"/>     <img alt="Kevin Mills doesn&#39;t approve of the controversial shift with mechanical pinsetters compared to the increasing" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/30b7bac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/320x193!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25f6dc4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/568x343!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6cac95c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/768x464!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a17a429/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/1080x652!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 1080w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/545975c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/1240x749!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 1240w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e80c599/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/1440x870!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 1440w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d80a62c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/2160x1305!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg 2160w" sizes="100vw" width="2000" height="1208" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4248e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7510x4535+0+0/resize/2000x1208!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fdd%2Fca48944f4fa7bf1c3910ca9d7982%2F1362404-sp-1027-string-bowling4-wjs.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>  </picture>  <div>   <p>Kevin Mills, a longtime league player, was skeptical of the increasingly popular string pinsetters.</p>   <p>(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)</p>   </div>  </figure></div><p>“That should have been a strike,” Mills says.</p><p>A technical revolution is changing the game he grew up with. Even if you don’t care about bowling, his vexation is understandable. It’s all about progress, vinyl records giving way to streaming, handwritten letters replaced by text messages, that sort of thing.</p><p>Bowling alleys across the country are ditching traditional pinsetters — the machines that sweep away and reset pins — in favor of contraptions that employ string. Think of the pins as marionettes with nylon cords attached to their heads. Those that fall are lifted out of the way, as if by levitation, then lowered back into place after each frame.</p><p>String pinsetters mean big savings, maybe salvation, for an industry losing customers to video games and other newfangled entertainment. That is why the U.S. Bowling Congress recently certified them for tournaments and league play.</p><p>But there is delicate science at play here. Radius of gyration, coefficient of restitution and other obscure forces cause tethered pins to fly around differently than their free-fall counterparts. They don’t even make the same noise.</p><p>Faced with growing pushback, the bowling congress published new research this month claiming the disparity isn’t nearly as great as people think. Mills seems dubious on a recent night when he visits a San Fernando Valley bowling alley that has made the switch.</p><p>“The physics are entirely different,” he says. “It’s a big deal in our world.”</p><p>First came pinboys.</p><p>These actual humans — mostly teenagers — did the sweaty work of scrambling around behind the lanes, gathering and resetting by hand. Old black-and-white photographs show them dressed in suspenders and snap-brim hats.</p><p>After World War II, machines took over. Even as automated pinsetters evolved over the years, they remained Rube Goldberg devices, made of gears, levers and spinning mechanisms that needed lots of electricity, full-time mechanics and expensive replacement parts.</p><p>None of this mattered during flush times. In the 1960s, the U.S. had about 11,500 bowling alleys, or “houses,” according to industry reports. Such establishments were referred to as “the poor man’s country club.”</p><p>Though the sport has remained popular, with about 67 million Americans playing at least once a year, current demand supports only 3,000 or so houses.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp"

bowling congress’ executive director. “If [houses] can lower their costs, that’s a good thing.”</p><p>European bowling alleys have used string pinsetters for decades because they require less energy and maintenance.

Enhanced Automated Robotic Launcher.</p><p>Though this sport conjures images of the common man — Ralph Kramden, Archie Bunker and the Dude from “The Big Lebowski” — E.A.R.L. is a star at the bowling congress’ research center in Arlington, Texas. Its mechanical arm, powered by hydraulics and air pressure, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DP35Us1QsU" target="_blank">has rolled thousands of test balls from every angle</a>, with various speeds and spins, on string-equipped lanes. </p><p>Early results were not encouraging.</p><p>“It wasn’t a sport,” Murphy says. “It was an arcade game.”</p><p>Researchers toyed with cord length and modified the walls surrounding the deck area, where the pins stand.

Officials subsequently enlisted 500 human bowlers for more testing and, this time, reported finding “no statistically significant difference.”</p><p>But hundreds of test participants commented that bowling on strings felt “off.” The pins seemed less active, they said. There were occasional spares whereby one pin toppled another without making contact, simply by crossing strings.</p><p>Nothing could be done about the muted sound. It’s like hearing a drum roll — the ball charging down the lane — with no crashing cymbal at the end. That crescendo and climax, Mills insists, is a visceral part “of the experience of smashing pins with a heavy ball.”</p><p>Napa Bowl is decidedly old school, the kind of place that prides itself on bustling league nights and reasonably priced cocktails.
