<p>Garmin has confirmed the first emergency use of its <a href="https://avbrief.com/more-garmin-autothrottle-safety-backstop-for-big-king-airs/">Autoland</a> system occurred on Saturday in Colorado. “Garmin can confirm that an emergency Autoland activation occurred at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, Colorado,” the company said in a statement Sunday. “The Autoland took place on Sat., Dec. 20, resulting in a successful landing. We look forward to sharing additional details at the appropriate time.”  Garmin also confirmed that it was the first use of the system that was not a test or a demonstration. </p>



<p>Social media posts from flight tracking hobbyists reported a King Air 200 squawked 7700 about 2 p.m. local time today. The Autoland system was initiated and landed the aircraft at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport near Denver. A recording from <a href="https://www.liveatc.net/archive.php?" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LiveATC’s feed</a> of the airport’s tower frequency includes a robotic female voice declaring a pilot incapacitation and the intention to land on Runway 30. The aircraft landed successfully and there have been no reports of injuries. The nature of the incapacitation and the condition of the pilot have not been released. VASAviation put together this nice animation of the event below. </p>

<p>The aircraft, <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N479BR/history/20251220/1910Z/KASE/KBJC" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">N479BR</a>, was being operated by Buffalo River Outfitters from Aspen to Rocky Mountain Metropolitan. It’s not clear how many people were on board. The system appeared to work flawlessly, and the controller at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan seemed to take it in stride, accommodating as many requests as he could before shutting down the airport for the landing. We’ll have more detail on this as it becomes available. There were some social media posts questioning whether there was an actual emergency. Garmin did not respond to our questions regarding those posts. The aircraft operator did not respond to our email and phone requests for comment.</p>

<p>A reader was at the airport Saturday and shared this video that he had posted to Instagram.</p>
