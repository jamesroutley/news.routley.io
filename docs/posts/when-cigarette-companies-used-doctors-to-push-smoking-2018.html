    <h1>When cigarette companies used doctors to push smoking (2018)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>What cigarette do doctors says causes less throat irritation? In the 1930s and 40s, tobacco companies would happily tell you it was theirs. Doctors hadn’t yet discovered a clear link between smoking and lung cancer, and a majority of them actually smoked cigarettes. So in cigarette ads, tobacco companies used doctors’ authority to make their claims about their cigarettes seem more legitimate.</p><p>To the modern-day reader, the pitching of cigarettes as healthy (even to youth and pregnant moms) and the use of doctors’ endorsements may appear horrifying. Yet before 1950, there wasn’t good evidence showing that cigarette smoking was bad for you. </p><div><figure itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><phoenix-picture><a><picture><source type="image/webp" sizes="(min-width: 675px) 300px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-srcset="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.webp 300w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.webp 380w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.webp 700w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.webp 1200w"/><source sizes="(min-width: 675px) 300px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-srcset="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.jpg 300w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.jpg 380w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.jpg 700w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.jpg 1200w"/><img alt="A 1930 Lucky Strike advertisement. " decoding="async" src="https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.jpg" data-src="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjgxMjUy/lucky_20679.jpg" height="1711" width="1200" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" itemprop="contentUrl url"/></picture></a><div></div></phoenix-picture><!-- disableImageMeta is needed to prevent duplicate rendering of the image meta.--><!-- Duplicate rendering can occur because we have moved the image metadata outside of--><!-- the .m-detail-header--container.

It wasn’t <em>all </em>cigarettes that gave you problems—it was just those other ones.</p><p>The first cigarette company to use physicians in their ads was American Tobacco, maker of Lucky Strikes. In 1930, it published an ad claiming “20,679 Physicians say ‘LUCKIES are less irritating’” to the throat. To get this number, the company’s ad agency had sent physicians cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes and a letter asking if they thought Lucky Strikes were “less irritating to sensitive and tender throats than other cigarettes,” while noting “a good many people” had already said they were.</p><div><figure itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><phoenix-picture><a><picture><source type="image/webp" sizes="(min-width: 675px) 300px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-srcset="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.webp 300w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.webp 380w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.webp 700w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1011/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.webp 1011w"/><source sizes="(min-width: 675px) 300px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-srcset="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.jpg 300w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.jpg 380w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.jpg 700w, https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1011/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.jpg 1011w"/><img alt="1937 Philip Morris advertisement claiming their brand cleared up irritation of the nose and throat." decoding="async" src="https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.jpg" data-src="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTU4NDI2ODU5NTc3NjE1NzE2/morris_33.jpg" height="1464" width="1011" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" itemprop="contentUrl url"/></picture></a><div></div></phoenix-picture><!-- disableImageMeta is needed to prevent duplicate rendering of the image meta.--><!-- Duplicate rendering can occur because we have moved the image metadata outside of--><!-- the .m-detail-header--container.

In 1937, the Philip Morris company took that one step forward with a <em>Saturday Evening Post </em>ad claiming doctors had conducted a study showing “when smokers changed to Philip Morris, every case of irritation cleared completely and definitely improved.” What it didn’t mention was that Philip Morris had sponsored those doctors.</p><section></section><p>Philip Morris continued to advertise “studies” it sponsored through the 1940s, the decade that saw the introduction of penicillin. “The American public is thinking about medicine in such a positive way and science in a positive way,” says <a href="https://www.mcphs.edu/about-mcphs/mcphs-directory/bio?id=0034243" rel="noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);" target="_blank">Gardner</a>, who co-authored an <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3372909/Brandt_Doctor_Choice.pdf" rel="noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);" target="_blank"><em>American Journal of Public Health </em>article</a> about doctors in cigarette ads. “So framing it that way seems like it’ll help appeal to people.”</p><p>To this end, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company created a Medical Relations Division and advertised it in medical journals. Reynolds began paying for research and then citing it in its ads like Philip Morris. In 1946, Reynolds launched an ad campaign with the slogan, “More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.” They’d solicited this “finding” by giving doctors a free carton of Camel cigarettes, and then asking what brand they smoked.</p><p>By the mid-1950s, when tobacco companies had to confront good evidence that their products caused lung cancer, advertising strategies started to shift. “What happens is, all the different cigarette companies kind of work together to try to promote the idea that…we don’t know yet if it’s harmful,” Gardner says. In 1954, these companies released <a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0268.pdf" rel="noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);" target="_blank">“A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers”</a> arguing that research showing a link between cancer and smoking was alarming but not conclusive. Therefore, the companies were forming a research committee to investigate the issue.</p><p>After this, cigarette ads stopped featuring doctors because this was no longer a convincing tactic. Doctors were coming out against cigarettes, culminating in 1964 with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/history/index.htm" rel="noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);" target="_blank">U.S. Surgeon General’s report</a> that smoking causes lung cancer, laryngeal cancer and chronic bronchitis.</p><p>Still, tobacco companies continued to maintain, through their research committee, that there was still a “controversy” over whether cigarettes were unhealthy until 1998. That year, the Tobacco Institute and the Committee for Tobacco Research (as it was then known) <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/06/19/tobacco.decline/" rel="noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);" target="_blank">disbanded</a> in accordance with a lawsuit settlement.</p><div phx-gallery=""><phx-gallery-image data-caption-html="&lt;p&gt;This 1950 Chesterfield advertisement targeted &#34;young America,&#34; portraying happy, attractive and mature people lighting up.&lt;/p&gt;" data-full-height="1500" data-full-src="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_2000%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_2000/MTU4NDI3MTEyNDQzNzQ5NzMy/1-young_32.jpg" data-full-width="1437" data-image-id="ci0232d89eb0012502" data-image-slug="1-young_32" data-public-id="MTU4NDI3MTEyNDQzNzQ5NzMy" data-source-name="From the collection of Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising" data-source-page-url="http://tobacco.stanford.edu/"></phx-gallery-image><!-- FIXME: WINS-481 temporary feature to archive pages prior to takedown, remove once done--><phx-gallery-image data-caption-html="&lt;p&gt;Cigarette ads featuring children were not anything surprising to see for decades.
