    <h1>Lisping at JPL Revisited</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-761476203130653408" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>It has been over 20 years since I wrote &#34;<a href="https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html" target="_blank">Lisping at JPL</a>&#34;, half memoir and half geeky screed (and all of it half-baked) about how an obscure programming language came to define my career.  It was a borderline throwaway piece written as much to vent my spleen as to inform.  In the intervening two decades it has gotten <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34535623" target="_blank">a lot more attention</a> than I ever expected, becoming a perennial favorite on Hacker News, launching my (very short) career as a <a href="https://www.corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/" target="_blank">podcast guest</a>, and even inspiring some people to <a href="https://mecrisp-stellaris-folkdoc.sourceforge.io/lisp.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">plagiarize</a> it, which make me feel simultaneously flattered and annoyed.</p><blockquote><p>Since this essay cycles here on HN perennially and inevitably people are curious about how your views about lisp, or other languages have changed, you might want to have a follow up page that you forever keep on updating as your views change?</p></blockquote><p>So, by request...</p><p>My views on Lisp have not changed: Common Lisp is still far and away my favorite programming language, but that is mainly because I don&#39;t really program in Common Lisp any more.  I program in a <a href="https://github.com/rongarret/ergolib/" target="_blank">little custom language</a> that I have incrementally built on top of Common Lisp over the years.  This language consists mainly of a single macro called <a href="https://github.com/rongarret/ergolib/blob/master/core/binding-block.lisp" target="_blank">BINDING-BLOCK</a> which is a stand-alone replacement for almost all of the other binding constructs in Common Lisp and makes my code look very different from most CL code.  In particular, my code has a lot fewer parentheses, and it doesn&#39;t run off the right side of the screen as much.  (Here is <a href="https://github.com/rongarret/tweetnacl/blob/master/ratchet.lisp" target="_blank">an example</a>.)  A CL programmer looking at my code would probably go, &#34;<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat" target="_blank">WAT</a>?&#34;  And when I look at regular CL code nowadays I go &#34;blech!&#34;  Especially if that code uses LOOP.  Then I go double-blech, despite the ironic fact that LOOP and BINDING-BLOCK have a lot in common.</p><p>There is one feature of Common Lisp that I absolutely love which no other language offers AFAIK, and that is a generic-function model of objects.   IMHO, the goal of a programming language ought to be to make writing code as easy and free of cognitive load as possible.  If I want to do an operation, I want to be able to say (op arg1 arg2 ... argn) without having to think about whether OP is a plain function or a method or an operator.  In every other language I have to think about whether to write op(arg1, arg2 ... argn) or arg1.op(arg2, ... argn) or &#34;arg1 op arg2&#34; or, in Objective C, [arg1 op:arg2 someRandomThing:arg3 ... someOtherRandomThing:argn].  In Lisp I never have think about that.  I just write (op arg1 .. argn) and it does the right thing. <br/></p><p>So the bottom line is: I still love Common Lisp.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/693183/what-does-ymmv-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/" target="_blank">YMMV</a>.</p><p>My <a href="https://blog.rongarret.info/2008/02/what-python-gets-right.html" target="_blank">second favorite language</a> at this point is Python.  It has a lot of nifty features, and a clean design that is mostly free of gotchas.   Ironically, I <i>don&#39;t</i> like Python&#39;s most iconic feature, the syntactically significant white space.  Python claims to not use braces, but this is half a lie.  It does use an open brace, it just uses the colon character to serve that purpose.  So in my code I use the &#34;pass&#34; statement as a de-facto close-brace, so when I use emacs python-mode, my code always auto-indents correctly.</p><p>But the best programming language is like the best wine.  Different people like different things, and that&#39;s OK.  Drink whatever is the best fit for your palate, and code in whatever is the best fit for your brain.<br/></p>
