    <h1>Two Ethereum DeFi traders just made $120M using a strategy called &#39;looping&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><article><div><div><ul><li>Two Ethereum traders made $120 million in the last 24 hours.</li><li>The traders employ a &#39;looping&#39; strategy in DeFi, enabling leveraged positions on Ether to amplify their investments.</li><li>Upcoming Ethereum upgrades and the potential approval of an Ether ETF are key market catalysts, potentially driving Ether&#39;s price even higher.</li></ul></div></div><p>A pair of high-value Ethereum traders are up nearly $120 million today as crypto prices continue to jump.</p><p>According to <i>DL News</i>’ analysis, two wallet addresses, <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x28a55c4b4f9615fde3cdaddf6cc01fcf2e38a6b0">0x28</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x741aa7cfb2c7bf2a1e7d4da2e3df6a56ca4131f3">0x74</a>, have used various lending protocols to increase their exposure to Ether.</p><p>Combined, these wallets hold over 1.1 million in Ether and staked Ether derivatives — worth $3 billion. Both wallets are deposited in a handful of lending protocols like <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/">MakerDAO</a>, <a href="https://spark.fi/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://morpho.org/">Morpho</a> and <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a>.</p><p>The identities of wallet owners aren’t publicly known, but these wallets caught attention in 2022 for nearly <a href="https://twitter.com/RuneKek/status/1484654546529968133?lang=en">being liquidated</a> for $600 million worth of Ether. Now, that risky bet has paid off.</p><h2>Looping on DeFi</h2><p>The strategy these whales — a term for high-value crypto traders or investors — employ is commonly referred to in DeFi as looping.</p><p>A trader deposits an asset, such as Ether, into a lending protocol and then borrows a different asset, like dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI, against their deposit. They then swap that DAI for Ether, the original asset.</p><p>After swapping cryptocurrencies, the trader re-deposits the newly-acquired Ether back into the lending protocol. This action allows them to borrow additional funds, establishing what’s called a ‘leveraged long position’ on their original Ether deposit.</p><p>The looping strategy enables traders to achieve a leverage of 3-5x — multiplying capital by a factor of 3 to 5 times — on their initial investment.</p><p>But in this case, these whales have opted for a more conservative leverage range of 1-2x. Despite its potential for higher returns, this strategy carries a multitude of risks. A significant drop in the Ether price could lead to liquidation, resulting in the loss of the initial deposit.</p><p>The pair of whales deployed these strategies years ago when Ether was worth around $1,000. Ether is currently trading around $2,700. The price of Ether would have to drop over 60% for them to be liquidated.</p><h2>Ethereum catalysts</h2><p>Traders who utilise the looping strategy inherently hold a bullish sentiment — conviction that the prices will go up — on the market.</p><p>For Ether, there are a couple of significant catalysts on the horizon.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Ethereum&#39;s Ether token has performed well over the past year. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The first is the upcoming <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/ethereum-takes-a-step-closer-to-launching-its-dencun-upgrade/">Dencun upgrade</a>, which will reduce the cost of transactions on Ethereum’s layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. After successful tests on two of Ethereum’s test networks, the upgrade is slated to come to Ethereum mainnet around March 13.</p><p>The weeks leading up to major Ethereum upgrades generally coincide with increased interest in the Ethereum network, and some researchers even find that it causes Ether’s price to <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/study-shows-price-of-ether-increases-before-eips/">increase</a>.</p><p>Since the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, the market has turned its sights to an <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/snapshot/jpmorgan-gives-ethereum-etf-approvals-coin-toss-odds/">Ether spot ETF</a>.</p><p>Heavyweights like Blackrock, Fidelity, Invesco and others have all already applied for an Ether spot ETF, with a decision to be made by May 23.</p><p>Given the Bitcoin ETFs hold <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/btc-etfs">692,000 Bitcoin</a>, or 3.53% of the total supply, traders are hoping an Ether ETF would see a similar success.</p><p><i>Ryan Celaj is DL News’ New York-based Data Correspondent.
