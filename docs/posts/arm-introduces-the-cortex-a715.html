<p>Succeeding the Cortex-A710 as the newest big core, the A715 supports largely the same as ARMv9.0 ISA with several enhancements. Perhaps more critically, the new core offers exclusive support for only AArch64 – dropping 32-bit support altogether. The design principles for the A715 remain similar to the prior big core: improve performance at a higher ratio than affecting power and area. With this iteration, performance emphasis was placed on improving throughout without significantly widening the pipeline or extending its depth (although both took place). Finally, Arm engineers introduced targeted improvements – such as to the branch predictor and prefetching enhancements – that were inspired by earlier Cortex-X designs.</p></div>
