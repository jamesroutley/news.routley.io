Many thanks to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/11/ab-nominations">11 candidates</a>.</p>
<p>The newly elected participants join continuing Advisory Board fellows Heejin Chung (Samsung), Wei Ding (Huawei), Tatsuya Igarashi (Sony), Florian Rivoal (W3C Invited Expert), Tzviya Siegman (Wiley), Avneesh Singh (DAISY Consortium), Chris Wilson (Google).</p>
<p>Many thanks to David Singer (Apple), Eric Siow (Intel), Léonie Watson (TetraLogical), and Hongru Zhu (Alibaba) who stepped down to focus on being members of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/governance/board/">W3C Board of Directors</a>.</p>
<p>Created in March 1998, the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to the W3C Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. The Advisory Board manages the evolution of the Process Document. The elected Members of the Advisory Board participate as individual contributors and not representatives of their organizations. Advisory Board participants use their best judgment to find the best solutions for the Web, not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user.

      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webapps">Web Applications Working Group</a> has published a First Public Working Draft of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-web-locks-20230105/">Web Locks API</a>. This document defines a web platform API that allows script to asynchronously acquire a lock over a resource, hold it while work is performed, then release it. While held, no other script in the origin can acquire a lock over the same resource. This allows contexts (windows, workers) within a web application to coordinate the usage of resources.</p>

      <p>The Accessible Platform Architectures (<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/apa">APA</a>) WAI-Adapt Task Force (<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/tf/personalization-tf">WAI-Adapt</a>) invites implementation and welcomes comment on the Candidate Recommendation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/CR-adapt-symbols-20230105/">WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module</a>. The purpose of this specification is to support Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) symbols in web content. Millions of users comprehend AAC symbols better than standard text, but there are multiple AAC symbol sets and they are not mutually comprehensible. To solve this issue and make it possible for content creators to support AAC users in web content, this specification defines the appropriate use of Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) concept indexing as specified by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/aac-registry/">W3C Alternative and Augmented Communication (AAC) Symbol Registry</a> in web content, provided guidance on associating an appropriate BCI index value with a span of text corresponding to the defined concept expressed as standard text, and it is anticipated that user agents will display the corresponding AAC symbol from the user’s preferred symbol set by allowing the user to configure for their preferred AAC symbol set and cache that symbol set locally.
