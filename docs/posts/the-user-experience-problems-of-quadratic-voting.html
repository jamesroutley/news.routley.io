    <h1>The user experience problems of quadratic voting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In their seminal book, &#34;Radical Markets,&#34; Eric Posner and Glen Weyl
introduce quadratic voting to improve (or radicalize) democratic
preference voting. They argue that by allowing voters to express
preference intensity and introducing a social cost for voters, the vote
more accurately reflects the populous opinion on a set of choices.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2022, with Hito Steyerl, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://decentralala.com">DoD</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://studiobonn.io">Studiobonn</a>, inspired by Weyl et al.&#39;s
idea, we conducted a quadratic vote on the future governance mechanisms
of Bundeskunsthalle, a federally-backed art exhibition hall. To allow
audience participation, we handcrafted <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://strikedao.com">strikedao.com</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/strikedao/strikedao.com">source code</a>), a
minimum viable quadratic voting app.</p>
<p>Having been the main developer behind the application, and since I&#39;m
currently studying Weyl et al.&#39;s book, with this post, I&#39;ll name several
conceptional user experience problems we ran into during
implementation.</p>
<p>Before I dive in, however, if you want to educate yourself on
quadratic voting, I recommend looking at RadicalExchange&#39;s concept page
on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/">quadratic
voting</a> as I won&#39;t really go into explaining how it works.</p>

<p>In their 2018 book, Weyl et al. introduce the benefits of having a
social cost by telling the story of a town and its nearby power plant
emitting pollutants into the air. Their argument: Depending on the
individual&#39;s intensity of preference, a cost should incur for how much
they each demand the plant&#39;s pollution to decrease assuming everyone&#39;s
electricity bills dropping.</p>
<p>For example, in a town with many pollution-tolerant citizens that
prefer cheap energy, Nils, who is running a laundry and is strongly
anti-air pollution, shall bear the (quadratic) cost of change in
relation to his peers. Said differently, he should pay the nominal
economic cost of his peers&#39; higher electricity bill that would result
from lowering the town&#39;s pollution.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A really sloppy drawing of the
externality geometry of Nils. For a better one, buy Weyl&#39;s
book.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While, actually, this example motivates the point for introducing a
social cost to preference voting well, I&#39;d say it&#39;s much harder to grok
in real-life voting scenarios.</p>
<p>Not only isn&#39;t it always possible to directly identify a concrete
economic cost for each proposal in a voting process, but also, if we&#39;d
vote only on choices with perfect information, we may not have to vote
in the first place. Things would just take care of themselves.</p>
<p>My point being that preference voting on choices isn&#39;t always easily
reducable to a nominal economic problem. Particularly not these
days.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-differentiate-between-voting-credits-and-votes-is-hard.">Learning
to differentiate between &#34;voting credits&#34; and &#34;votes&#34; is hard.</h2>
<p>However, here&#39;s where I see the first actual user experience problem
with quadratic voting: Introducing &#34;voting credits&#34; and mapping them
onto votes through a mathematical function is where we abandon many.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, asking people to &#34;forget&#34; all about voting
and then introducing &#34;voting credits&#34; that only become votes after
running them through a quadratic cost function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c(x) = {x}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>c</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span><span></span><span>=</span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span><span>x</span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span>2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a huge challenge. Honestly,
and without wanting to sound rude, most people probably have long
forgotten what a quadratic function looks like or that it&#39;s just a more
elegant way of saying: We&#39;re going to square some numbers. Those school
days have been a while back...</p>
<p>But additionally, I want to stress the difficulty of motivating the
introduction of &#34;voting credits&#34; - which even I am having trouble
understanding at times. The problem is only exemplified by the
backwardness of math itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-math-of-quadratic-voting-is-literally-backward">The Math Of
Quadratic Voting is Literally Backward</h2>
<p>As humans of the twenty-first century, we&#39;re well-versed in
allocating budgets and spending &#34;credits&#34; everywhere. E.g., if we have
5€ in our wallets, we are easily capable of spending them on one
espresso, one cappuccino, and one piece of cake - if all those end up
costing roughly five euros.</p>
<p>But with quadratic voting, and since we&#39;re used to having natural
numbers as voting outcomes, the cost function is reversed. We don&#39;t
define quadratic voting as:</p>

<p>This subtle difference leads to a lot of confusion in the front end.
It&#39;s, for example, why some voters may not be able to allocate
<strong>all</strong> their voting credits. Below&#39;s why...</p>
<h2 id="voters-may-not-be-able-to-allocate-all-their-credits">Voters May
Not Be Able to Allocate All Their Credits</h2>
<p>In our show with Studiobonn, we, e.g., had given 25 voting credits to
each participant and implemented the above-outlined (&#34;backward&#34;) math.
However, having three proposals gave rise to voting configurations where
voters could not spend all credits. An example of the interface is
linked in the tweet below.</p>

<p>In our case, if a user allocated all credits to one proposal, the
math worked out in their favor and they&#39;d vote with five. However, if
they decided to allocate credits to other proposals partially, then
sometimes they ended up having leftover credits they couldn&#39;t otherwise
spend. Consider where, e.g., a voter allocates as follows:</p>

a real head-scratcher for user experience designers.</p>

<h2 id="quadratic-voting-results-are-hard-to-interpret">Quadratic Voting
Results Are Hard To Interpret</h2>
<p>However, I think the probably <strong>best feature</strong> of boring
democratic elections is the replicability of a one-person one-vote
election. If e.g., in Germany, all citizens go voting, we can roughly
expect that the sum of all votes is 80 million people - or whatever the
latest census number from Wikipedia says.</p>
<p>It&#39;s this thing our math teachers tried to hammer into our brains
before every exam: Sanity-check your results. If the outcome is beyond
stupid, trace back the calculation path to find the error.</p>
<p>With regular voting, sanity checks are easy as most people are
capable of adding all proposal results. I mean, unless you vote for
Trump - then all bets are off.</p>
<p>Still, with quadratic voting, this way of sanity-checking an
election&#39;s result has suddenly become a non-trivial math challenge.</p>
<p>First of all, since the election&#39;s result is the sum of each voter&#39;s
credit allocation ran through the square root, and since in additions
with square roots, the commutative rule is invalid <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></msqrt><mi mathvariant="normal">≠</mi><msqrt><mi>a</mi></msqrt><mo>+</mo><msqrt><mi>b</mi></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{a + b} \neq \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span>a</span><span></span><span>+</span><span></span><span>b</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><svg width="400em" height="1.08em" viewBox="0 0 400000 1080" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin slice"><path d="M95,702c-2.7,0,-7.17,-2.7,-13.5,-8c-5.8,-5.3,-9.5,

<p>Albeit arguably our design and implementation failure in this regard,
what would you conclude from the above screenshot? We can see that
&#34;There&#39;s No Such Thing As Disintermediation&#34; came in first and &#34;Beyond
Public Accountability&#34; second. And more?</p>
<p>In fact, at this point, I&#39;d even consider it a luxury to understand,
e.g., &#34;how different people voted&#34;: When I see that screenshot, my main
question is: Did the vote work out well? Are the results plausible or
did someone hack it?</p>
<p>Actually, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/quadratic-voting">Anish
Agnihotri&#39;s quadratic voting app</a> does a better job on this by
showing not only the votes but also the percentage of voting credits
allocated per choice. However, for reproducibility, I&#39;d argue showing
the absolute number of credits would be even better.</p>

<h2 id="finally-the-end-boss-allocating-voting-credits-to-anons-on-the-internet">Finally,
the End Boss: Allocating Voting Credits To Anons On the Internet</h2>
<p>Though all of the above are challenging problems, each probably
needing weeks or months more research, the real end boss to quadratic
voting is properly allocating voting credits. Or actually; the ability
to know when one should call their voting app &#34;quadratic.&#34;</p>
<p>These days, with edgy mechanisms being rare given the bull market&#39;s
incentive structure to bubble up innovative ideas, everyone and their
dog supposedly implements &#34;quadratic voting.&#34;</p>
<p>As a popular choice e.g., snapshot.org prominently shipped a
mechanism adopted by many for tallying votes quadratically. However, in
these announcements, it is often neglected to properly state that
quadratic voting is based on the assumptions of mitigating any form of
Sybil attacks.</p>
<p>Whereas in a parliament, with a fixed set of representatives having
access to a potential quadratic voting app, it poses practically no
safety risk: Opening voting to everybody on the internet (as many
blockchain governance mechanisms do) has the drawback of introducing a
cat and mouse game dynamic.</p>
<p>Since allocating a few credits towards an issue costs less and the
margin cost for influence increases, separating voting tokens into many
wallets can help to influence one&#39;s voting power positively.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that either I&#39;m missing something; or that the
others don&#39;t fully understand the math behind quadratic voting.</p>
<p>With strikedao.com we ended up having the same problem.</p>
<p>We allocated votes via email, given the flaky assumption that each
voter only controls one email on the internet. And while I tried arguing
to my colleagues that another layer of verification (e.g., also signing
up with a phone number) could make the deciding difference, Hito Steyerl
had the conceptually better argument, which was that validation
complexity increases quadratically - which is why we (gladly) ended up
not quadrupling our validation budget.</p>
<p>Gitcoin now has a flurry of services they want you to sign up for
before participating in their grants round. Ocean Protocol uses
BrightID, albeit it&#39;s entirely unclear how it&#39;s supposed to make sure
that each human being just ends up creating one identity. Snapshot.org
acknowledges its shortcomings concerning tokens and wallets not being
Sybil resistant - but still calls their feature &#34;quadratic voting.&#34;</p>
<p>Sadly, the world isn&#39;t ready for quadratic voting. Actually, the
world might still not even be prepared for regular digital voting.</p>
<p>Beyond the <em>minor details</em> I&#39;ve managed to mention, much more
authority carry Tom Scott&#39;s videos on why digital voting is generally a
bad idea, which are what I want to leave you with. Thanks for
reading.</p>
