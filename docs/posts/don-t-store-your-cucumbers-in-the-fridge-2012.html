<p>Just in time for cucumber season, some news that surprises me. Did you know that you should store cucumbers at room temperature?</p>
<p>Credit for my enlightenment goes to <a href="http://caes.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a>. (May I just say bless UC Davis for all the good it does?) In this case I’m referencing their department of <a href="http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/">Post Harvest Technology</a>. According to them, cukes should be stored at room temperature. If you do feel the need to put them in the fridge, they can tolerate up to 3 days of cold storage if they are used soon as they are removed from the refrigerator. </p>
<p>Seems that cucumbers are susceptible to cold injury if held more than 3 days at temperatures lower than 50F/10C. Signs of cold injury are wateriness, pitting on the outside and accelerated decay</p>
<p>Another factoid: Cucumbers are sensitive to ethylene gas, which is put off by some ripening fruits and vegetables. So for longest storage, don’t keep your cukes near melons, tomatoes or bananas.</p>
<p><b>Tomatoes, peppers and eggplants </b>are also damaged by cold, so keep these on your counter as well.  I’ve highlighted cucumbers in this post, because I think most people refrigerate them as a matter of course–I did, at least. Whereas its more common, I think, to leave tomatoes to ripen on the counter. If you want to read up on any particular fruit or veggie, see the fact sheets linked below.</p>
