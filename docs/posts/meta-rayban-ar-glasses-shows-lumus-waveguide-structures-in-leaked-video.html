    <h1>Meta RayBan AR Glasses Shows Lumus Waveguide Structures in Leaked Video</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Just a short note today. I’m in the middle of my trip, which will end in Eindhoven next week (see notice at the end of this article), when I heard that Meta had leaked a video on YouTube of its Monocular AR glasses, which are expected to be disclosed at Meta Connect tomorrow, September 17th at 5 PM PST, at Mark Zuckerberg’s Keynote. Although the original leaked video on YouTube has been removed, multiple copies were captured before it was taken down. </p>



<p>This blog reported on May 11, 2025, that it was likely that Meta was using a Lumus waveguide for their upcoming AR glasses product codenamed Hypernova (see:  <a href="https://kguttag.com/2025/05/11/meta-hypernova-and-google-ar-ai-glasses-lumus-avegant-inside-both-using-lcos-microdisplays/#Hypernova-lumus">Meta’s Hypernova Optics – Likely a Lumus Z-Lens Variant</a>). While the codename for the AR glasses was Hypernova, the product is expected to be named Celest. Bloomberg has reported that the Celest AR glasses are supposed to cost about $800 for the base model without prescription correction. </p>



<h2>Evidence of Lumus Z-Like Waveguide in the Video</h2>



<p>Below left is a still frame I captured from the video, which shows the diagonal “slats” that form part of Lumus 2-D pupil expansion. This video appears to be a rotating 3-D model, so I was a bit surprised that they showed the slate details. </p>







<p>The 3-D model makes them appear much more visible than they appear in real life. On May 21, 2025, I identified similar pupil expansion slats in Rivet’s AR glasses in “<a href="https://kguttag.com/2025/05/21/exclusive-rivet-industries-using-lumus-waveguides-for-military-industrial-ar/">Exclusive: Rivet Industries Using Lumus Waveguides for Military &amp; Industrial AR</a>.” The images above, middle and far right, compare the Rivet AR glasses to a Lumus Z-Lens waveguide. There is clear evidence that Lumus is being utilized in both Meta’s first AR consumer product and Rivet’s military AR glasses.</p>



<h2>In Closing: Be Looking for the Lumus Waveguide in Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Connect Keynote </h2>



<p>I’m likely to be able to see when Zuckerberg gives his live presentation on the 17th. It is assumed that he will showcase the Celest glasses. Hopefully, you will be able to spot the Lumus waveguides when he puts the glasses on. </p>







<h2><span>MicroLED-AR/VR Connect In Eindhoven, Netherlands, September 23-25</span></h2>



<p>I’ve been asked to speak at and partner with the joint <strong>MicroLED and AR/VR Connect</strong> conference and exhibition in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, on September 23-25, 2025. The Conference operates like a single conference with two tracks, so attendees attend presentations from both. The first day, September 23, is Master Classes and Tours of some Local Labs. The conference proper is on September 24-25th. I’m speaking at 5:20 PM on the 24th.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.microledconnect.com/registration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conference is offering my readers a €150 discount if they use the discount code KarlARVR</a>. <strong>This discount code is </strong><strong>valid for both the “Virtual Pass” and “Hybrid Pass”</strong> (see the tables below) for virtual and/or physical conferences, which can be attended remotely (this blog receives remuneration for the use of this code). </p>



<p><strong>MicroLED and AR/VR Connect have a 12-month pass program</strong> that offers a “<strong>Virtual Pass</strong>,” which allows attendees unlimited 12-month access to recorded presentations at both the virtual (March) and physical (September) conferences, as well as other materials outlined below. The “Hybrid Pass” includes everything from the Virtual Pass, plus attending the physical Conference in person. The lists below outline the two passes in more detail:</p>
