    <h1>The Objects of Our Life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Steve ends his speech and without a pause starts taking questions. Apart from scripted product demonstrations, he always preferred the give-and-take of Q&amp;As over prepared remarks, and this talk is no exception. His formal comments in the blue notebook ran about 20 minutes, but the Q&amp;A will last nearly twice as long. He has developed a rapport with the audience, and their questions cover a wide range of issues: networking, privacy, graphic design, hiring and recruiting, and voice recognition. </p><p>The biggest applause comes when Steve describes “Kids Can’t Wait,” Apple’s program to put a computer in every school in California. This audience of people who have never used computers now want their children to have access to them.</p><p>In response to a question about computer-based tools for graphic design, he lays out a much larger core ambition, one that will become a life-long theme. “We’re solving the problems of injecting some liberal arts into these computers,” he says. Computers should include multiple fonts and graphics because they are beautiful in themselves but also because they serve as the gateway to so much more. An engaging, easy-to-understand interface will help draw people to the computer, making it possible for them to discover new ideas and convey their own in new ways and with new tools. </p><p>“Where we’ve got to get to,” he says, is a place where no college student would think of writing a paper without a computer, where “people three, four years from now are using these things and they go, ‘Wasn’t this the way it always was?’” This sense of inevitability—so hard won, so hard to describe, and so obvious when achieved—is, for Steve, a hallmark of success. His sedimentary model of innovation works only if each generation takes the existing tools for granted. </p><p>Perhaps the most revealing moment in the Q&amp;A comes when Steve is asked about Apple’s low rate of employee turnover. He starts to answer by talking about the wide distribution of stock options, then swerves to describe what he thinks really underpins people’s commitment to their work. “We feel that for some crazy reason we’re in the right place at the right time to put something back,” he says, pausing to collect his thoughts. “Most of us didn’t make the clothes we’re wearing, and we didn’t cook or grow the food that we eat, and we’re speaking a language that was developed by other people; we use mathematics that was developed by other people.” He is emphasizing every word. “We are constantly taking–and the ability to put something back into that pool of human experiences is extremely neat.” This desire to <a rel="noopener" aria-describedby=":Ramjld4lacmvdm:" href="https://putsomethingback.stevejobsarchive.com">“put something back”</a> would drive his work throughout his life.</p><p>The questions could go on, but Steve looks offstage and prompts, “I don’t know how much time we have?” As the crowd rises to their feet in a standing ovation, Steve picks up his coat off the floor, gives it a shake, and speeds up the aisle and out of the tent. A newspaper will later report, “An undercurrent was felt most of the day Wednesday and part of Thursday over whether Jobs was good or bad—visionary or huckster,” but Steve has no time for such debates. He has come to Aspen to speak but also to learn. Maya Lin, the 23-year-old student architect of the new stark and controversial Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is speaking nearby. He wants to hear her talk. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
