Hello and welcome to my backgrounds index page! I currently have ~2000 backgrounds to choose from, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find something that fits your needs :3 As you can see from the selections above, the backgrounds are either sorted into colours or general themes. The colour pages are (mostly, with a few exceptions) plain or textured in nature, whereas the themed ones usually have some kind of design on them!
</p>

If you want to view any of these backgrounds as they look tiled, <!--you can either click on the tile you like which will open it in a new window, or--> you can use one of the following sites: <a href="https://www.pycheung.com/checker/" target="_blank">pycheung</a> or <a href="https://patternchecker.com/" target="_blank">pattern checker.</a> You can use both by either a) clicking &amp; dragging the image you would like into an open tab of either site, or b) by saving a picture and uploading it to either site. One day I will have a built-in pattern checker for all the pages, but for now this will have to do ^-^

All of the backgrounds I have here were downloaded through other collection sites I found while browsing through geocities and tripod, and despite the sites all saying they only had public use backgrounds I have noticed that some of them were taken from peoples personal or graphic sites. I don&#39;t believe this was done on purpose or to steal others&#39; work; I&#39;m sure the people compiling collections thought that all the images were free for public use &amp; distribution. However, I know this wasn&#39;t the case and nearly all the sites I have come across expressely state to NOT add their works to collections. As this is the case, I will be adding a &#39;found&#39; section to my site where I will add the backgrounds that I know belong to people, with appropriate attribution to their sites. If you come across the original artists of any backgrounds, please don&#39;t hesitate to tell me!

Now, in the spirit of old-web sharing &amp; nostalgia, I would LOVE for you sign my guestbook with your site if you choose to use any of the backgrounds I have archived :3 This is something that is asked in many older sites, and I really do think it&#39;s such a fun idea â™¡

HOW TO USE: Since my backgrounds aren&#39;t hosted on my site, you can use the direct links to them if you wish, but be advised if you do this as they could potentially end up as dead links if I ever rearrange how I save my images. You are encouraged to save the files and upload them either to your own site or an image host in order to always have access to them!
