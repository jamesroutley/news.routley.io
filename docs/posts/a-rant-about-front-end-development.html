<h2>First, some background</h2>



<p>I have neither a computer science degree nor an engineering degree. But I have worked in web technologies since the second Bush administration. I’ve worked in a variety of roles ranging from business analyst, tester, all the way through developer, consultant, and principal architect.  </p>



<p>I did agency work for 11 years before making the choice to work for a very large tech company. I have worked across sectors like insurance, healthcare, retail, banking, investing, marketing, and manufacturing. I have worked with global brands which are household names. </p>



<p>I have written <em>a lot</em> of front-end code for <em>a lot</em> of companies. I have also dealt with <em>a lot of consequences created by front-end code</em>. My criticisms come from my role as a front-end developer and as someone affected by a front-end developer. </p>



<h2>No one gives a shit about content</h2>



<p>Unless it’s a content-specialized front-end developer who works specifically in the content management space and is specialized in writing front-end for content management system. Did you count how many times I had to write both “front-end” and “content”? Too fucking many. </p>



<p>I have mentored quite a few bootcamp graduates. There are exactly zero graduates of zero bootcamps who have ever been told, “users go to websites for the content.” <strong>Zero</strong>. They all think it’s their moral imperative to make sure every site is built in React.</p>



<p>I have worked with exactly zero computer science graduates who have ever heard the phrase, “content before code”.</p>



<p>Unless the front-end developer has been forced by threat of not-being-able-to-pay-rent to care about content, they don’t fucking care. </p>



<p>This is <strong>wild</strong> to me because HTML5 semantics exist and their whole-ass raison d’être is, in fact, having an understanding of content. </p>



<ul>
<li>You can’t write content-managed HTML if you don’t understand the content.</li>



<li>You can’t write semantic HTML if you don’t understand the content. </li>



<li>You can’t write SEO-ready HTML without understanding the content.</li>



<li>You can’t write accessible HTML without understanding the content.</li>



<li>You can’t write <em>good</em> HTML without understanding the content. </li>
</ul>



<p>Zero SPA developers that I’ve ever met have ever given a shit about using a<code> &lt;header&gt;</code> instead of a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. I have found <code>NaN</code> fucks given about using a <code>p</code> over a <code>div</code>. The number of times I’ve seen numbers written inside of a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> that’s inside of a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> — instead of just using an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> — <strong>is deeply disturbing.</strong></p>



<p><em>Maybe we should ask the designer or business owner a few questions about what the design means to the end-user before hammering out 18 layers of <code>div</code>s. </em></p>



<h2>CSS is fine; you’re the problem</h2>



<p>If someone gets a ticket for speeding, we don’t blame the car or the road. We definitely blame the idiot who thought it’d be a good idea to race the Dodge Charger camped out in the Dollar General parking lot. </p>



<p>It’s in this very same vein that we don’t blame CSS:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The problem with CSS is that the scope is global”</p>
<cite>Every dork who promotes writing styles in JavaScript</cite></blockquote>



<p>Those aren’t problems; they’re <em>features</em>. They are solutions to the very specific problems of, “how do we make content presentable as easily as possible, with as little duplication as possible, and with as few negative impacts to the user as possible.”</p>



<p>Chances are, the things you don’t like about CSS are the things you haven’t bothered to understand about it. </p>



<p>Styles rarely, <em>if ever</em> need to actually be scoped and encapsulated. In fact, the only time you want to prevent styles from being in the global scope is when you didn’t write them <em>and</em> can’t control them. </p>



<p>If duplicated class names are ruining your day, 15-class selectors are crapping in your cereal, and 8 <code>!important</code> are igniting turds in your garage, that’s actually an <em>architecture problem</em>. </p>



<p>Are there <em>real</em> problems in CSS? Of course. But those are problems like, “<code>border-radius</code> should have been called <code>corner-radius</code>,” and “atomic stacking contexts are generated when using <code>opacity</code>,” and “<a href="https://blog.frankmtaylor.com/2012/01/25/css-font-size-an-em-isnt-an-m-but-an-ex-is-an-x/" data-type="link" data-id="https://blog.frankmtaylor.com/2012/01/25/css-font-size-an-em-isnt-an-m-but-an-ex-is-an-x/">an <code>em</code> isn’t really an <code>em</code>.</a>”   Those are problems. </p>



<p>The C of CSS is not a problem. You’re the problem. </p>



<p><em>Put on your big-kid pants and develop a strategy, pick some conventions, write them down, and enforce them through merge requests and peer reviews. </em> </p>



<h2>Server-side rendering does not mean, “rendered with JavaScript”</h2>



<p>There’s a disconcerting number of front-end developers out there who act like it wasn’t possible to generate HTML on a server prior to 2010<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a>.  They talk about SSR <em>only</em> in the context of node.js and seem to have no clue that people started working on this problem when season 5 of Seinfeld was on air<a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a>. </p>



<p>Server-side rendering was not invented with Node. What Node brought to the table was the convenience of writing your shitty <code>div</code> soup in the very same language that was invented in 10 days for the sole purpose of pissing off Java devs everywhere. </p>



<p>Server-side rendering means it’s rendered on the fucking server. You can do that with PHP, ASP, JSP, Ruby, Python, Perl, CGI, and hell, <em>R</em>. You can server-side render a page in <em>Lua</em> if you want. </p>



<p>Just because <em>Node</em> isn’t involved in generating HTML, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible to generate markup at request time.  It is possible. It’s been possible. It will continue to be possible. </p>



<p><em>Stop denying the history, contributions, and value that other technologies bring to solving this exact problem that is definitely not unique to you.</em></p>







<h2>JavaScript is not always the answer</h2>



<p>My brothers and sisters in Christ I want you to know that I care about your souls enough to share these truths with you:</p>



<ul>
<li>You don’t need JavaScript to make a web page. </li>



<li>You don’t need JavaScript to write styles. </li>



<li>You don’t need JavaScript to make an animation. </li>



<li>You don’t need JavaScript just to show content. </li>
</ul>



<p>In 2010 I was a contractor for an organization working with some Very Smart IBM consultants. They could not figure out how our in-house developer made the navigation for the site they were implementing. </p>



<p>It was because our developer used CSS. Our consultants had never considered that CSS could do something as fancy as, “show you a thing when you hover over it.”</p>



<p>That’s a fun “har-har silly ignorant smart consultants,” story except at least it’s about their <em>harmless</em> <em>ignorance</em>.</p>



<p>It’s so much <strong>worse</strong> when they <em>know JavaScript</em>. </p>



<p>Five years ago I was on a project where the perfectly fine .net MVC app was turned into an API for delivering content to a .net core app that used node services to render Vue templates into fully rendered HTML which meant that all of our templates were written in Vue <em>and we still had to write jQuery to make content interactive</em>.  We literally had two layers of JavaScript wrapped in a .net sandwich with JavaScript spread on the top. </p>



<p>I’m seeing architectures being proposed <em>today</em> that do pretty much the same thing I just described but with Drupal on Apache, containerized Node, and Web Components. </p>



<p>If  making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by spreading the jelly on both sides of the bread is disturbing to you, <em>good</em>. You can still find God. </p>



<p>Do you have any idea how frustrating it is that that in order to explain my sadness to my therapist I must first explain like 5 different technologies and by the time I’m finished <em>she’s sad just hearing it</em>, the session’s over, and I didn’t even get to what was making me upset? Technology has made my anger a recursive function. </p>



<p><em>Can we please stop adding complexity to our systems just so we can do it in JavaScript? If you can do it without JavaScript, you probably should. Tools shouldn’t add complexity. </em></p>



<h2>Sass wasn’t just a mistake but a mistake factory</h2>



<p>10 years ago I thought CSS preprocessors were the coolest thing ever and I was incredibly fucking dumb for thinking that. </p>



<p>The <em>only three good features</em> CSS preprocessors gave were</p>



<ol>
<li>Variables</li>



<li>Mixins</li>



<li>Color transformation</li>
</ol>



<p>Every thing else was a mistake:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nesting</li>



<li>Calc</li>



<li>Functions, including control statements like if and for</li>



<li>Interpolation</li>



<li>Data types of any kind</li>



<li>The entire module thing</li>
</ul>



<h3>Nested CSS obscures complexity</h3>



<p>I hate this feature so much. I hate it more that it’s now native to CSS because not only has it spread, but <em>it’s mutated</em><sup>. <a href="#three">3</a></sup> </p>



<p>Nesting obscures complexity and then makes it impossible to find or fix. </p>



<p>Without using a compiler or psychedelic of any kind, can you tell me what this generates?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="scss" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">.feature {
	color: blue;
	&amp;__header {
		p &amp; {
			a {
				&amp;:hover,
				&amp;:focus {
					color: red;
				}
			}
		}
	}
}</pre>



<p>Does this seem reasonable to you?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="css" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">.feature {
  color: blue;
}
p .feature__header a:hover, p .feature__header a:focus {
  color: red;
}</pre>



<p>If that’s the output you expected, either you’re one of the Sass spec writers or you did a double-shot of espresso followed by a Ritalin chaser. </p>



<p>Nesting is not good. It hides the specificity that you’re producing and will lend to increasingly fragile code as you try to override a 13 part selector. </p>



<h3>Interpolation, et all</h3>



<p>This was also just a bad idea that we couldn’t have predicted at the time. I’m not mad at the Sass people for this. Hindsight is 20/20 and all. What I want is for it to all stop. </p>



<p>This is fundamentally a bad idea:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="scss" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$sizes: 10px, 20px, 30px, 50px;

@each $size in $sizes {
  .icon-#{$size} {
    font-size: $size;
    height: $size;
    width: $size;
  }
}
</pre>



<p>I know what you’re thinking. </p>



<p>You’re thinking, “But Frank, it saves me on keystrokes! Now I can generate more classes and classnames just based on that list of sizes!”</p>



<p>Bro. </p>



<p><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> exist. </p>



<p>Are you a VS Code user? Even easier: Highlight it and press <kbd>alt/opt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> , that’ll copy the chunk or line down.  Then, highlight the part that’s repeated a few times (where you’d interpolate), press <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>, and keep pressing until they’re all highlighted. Make your change. Now you’re done.</p>



<p>What did you save? Time and sanity in looking up the Sass syntax? Future time where future you is trying to find where the fuck <code>.icon-80px </code>is living? <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">XKCD is not on your side</a> for this automagical icon generator loop that’s going to piss you off with edge cases for the next 5 years. </p>



<p><em>Can we please stop using languages and tech stacks to solve problems that our IDEs are capable of helping us with? </em></p>



<h2>Seriously … forget the Frameworks</h2>



<p>I was blown away when Angular came out. It was an actual <em>thing</em> that could do it all. It could render the markup with fun logicy attributes, respond to data changes, make the AJAX requests, amazing! I wanted to use Angular for <em>all</em> the <strong>interactive web apps</strong>. </p>



<p>Then React came out. That was amazing. It could render the markup and … [incoherent mumbling] components or something… and … <em>wait, that wasn’t even markup; it was JSX. </em> Sure, I had to add a few libraries to really use it, but yay, I used it for <strong>interactive web apps</strong>. </p>



<p>Then there was Vue. Then Preact. Then Ember, Svelte, Backbone, Alpine, Mithril, Solid, Lit, Stencil, Qwik…</p>



<p>Maybe it’s because Angular was no one’s first choice — even though it came first. Maybe that’s why the front-end world lost its damned mind with React. React was so <em>not-angulary</em> that front-end folks were like, “let’s use it client side, server side, native-side, and the 3 other sides of a damned cube”. Folks decided it was a good idea to Reactify All The Things®. </p>



<p>And that’s how React, a framework used to deliver interactive content to a whole 28% of the world’s population, is being used to generate static sites. </p>



<p>I had a client a few years ago that was a <em>household name</em>. Their front-end was written in Gatsby. Gatsby is a <em>static site generator</em> that uses React. This globally-known brand had probably 50 websites in at least as many languages. But the content was very, very, static. </p>



<p>So imagine the horror the front-end dorks felt when they learned that a content author in Bulgaria  updating the terms and conditions didn’t want the whole-ass site rebuilt for every country and language. </p>



<p>This would’ve been a non-problem had the web app been written in .net, Java, or, fuck me for saying it, PHP or Node. </p>



<p>But nah. These goobers got high off npm modules and did shots of JSX in the bathroom at lunch time. They chose a framework <em>used to deliver interactive content  to a significant percentage of the planet</em> for generating non-interactive content on a server. It took them <em>weeks</em> to come up with a solution to the problem they created when they chose a problem as a solution.  </p>



<p>Yes. I am absolutely calling React a problem. I’m calling Angular, Vue, and All the Rest of Them ™ a problem. Because unless you have a <em>specific problem of highly interactive, data-driven content</em>, you don’t need a framework.</p>



<p><em>You don’t need a framework to render static content to the end user.  Stop creating complex solutions to simple problems</em></p>



<h2>Also more generally fuck your complexity</h2>



<p>This, more than anything, is a rant about <em>complexity</em>. </p>



<p>I am mad at how front-end developers create complex solutions to simple problems. I am mad that front-end developers use tools to obscure complexity. I am mad that front-end developers embrace complexity rather than challenge it. </p>



<p>You know what’s great about jQuery? </p>



<p>Everything. </p>



<p>jQuery took several complex problems (browsers do things differently, selecting elements is complex, changing things on elements is tedious, AJAX requests are <em>a lot</em>) and it provided a simple, intuitive, and readable solution:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$(&#39;.getResults&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, () =&gt; {
    $.ajax({
       url: &#39;/api/results&#39;,
       data: {
         foo: &#39;bar&#39;
       },
       success: function (result) {
          $(&#39;.results&#39;).html(result);
       }
    });
});</pre>



<p>Cool your jets for a second and think about how wonderfully <em>simple</em> that is. It handles finding your element in a way that lets you avoid the null checks, shortens your event binding, lets you make an AJAX  request, lets you find the element that the result goes into, and plop it there if it’s successful. </p>



<p>If the problem is, “user clicks on thing, you get data, and show data”, that is a <em>beautiful</em> and simple 11-line solution. It did not need NPM modules and a build system.</p>



<p>And <em>sure</em>, <a href="https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">maybe you don’t need jQuery</a>, and that’s fine. Will you need more lines of code to do the same thing? Of course. But even without jQuery, your complexity doesn’t grow exponentially like it would if you brought in a framework with its build system, linters, compilers, and 700mb of Node Modules some of which inexplicably require some stupid shit like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~jonschlinkert" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npmjs.com/~jonschlinkert">is-odd</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-git-url?activeTab=dependents" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-git-url?activeTab=dependents">is-git-url</a> <sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup>.  </p>



<p>Pretend I’m not talking about JavaScript for a second. Let’s pretend it’s just an ordinary, everyday, 3-template web site. Maybe it’s managed by a CMS. Maybe it’s not. Does it really need Tailwind? Bootstrap? <em>Even &lt;gasp class=”from the back of the room”&gt; <strong>Sass</strong></em>? Is writing plain CSS really such a terrible thought?</p>



<p>Let me fill you in on a cool fact about CSS: It doesn’t need a fucking compiler. No <code>npm install -D sass</code>. No <code>npm i gulp</code>. You get to tell WebPack to fuck off good and proper-like, the way the Good Lord Intended. <sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup></p>



<p><em>Simplicity is unsophisticated and lacking in many parts. The simplest solution to a problem is always the best solution. Choose simplicity. I’m begging you. Your future is begging you,.   </em></p>



<h2>Oh, and enough with the new and shiny</h2>



<p>Sure it’s awesome that you can strongly type CSS variables, but that doesn’t mean you should <sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup>. Can you have web components with declarative shadow DOM? d’uh! But, hear me out: Why have three steps to render markup when you could have one?</p>



<p>Yes, the new JS Framework is all the awesomeness. Definitely do a side project with it. Please in the name of her Sweet Saint Fuck of Apathy, don’t use it in your next project. We haven’t learned what our regrets will be, and the regrets are what everyone else has to live with but you. </p>



<p>I don’t care if it’s a new CSS trick, a new JS thing, or a new JS framework: <strong>Give it two years before you take it for a ride in production</strong>. </p>



<p>You know what happens in the next two years?</p>



<p>Two year’s worth of StackOverflow questions. </p>



<p>You do <strong>not</strong> want to be the person taking a new tech or feature for a joy-ride in production and discovering some hemorrhaging-edge bug. </p>



<p>You <strong>also</strong> don’t want to be the person who has to clean up after the person who discovered a bug on a bleeding-edge technology. </p>



<p> Person-Alpha is the asshole. The Alphasshole, if you will. Because they chose to use the bleeding edge thing. </p>



<p>On the scrum-master’s Fibionacci-sequence of suckassness The Alphasshole is a 21. The Alphasshole implemented the new tech and turned your project into a collection of medical-attention-needed polyps on Satan’s butthole. </p>



<p>Person-Beta is the Betasshole. </p>



<p>The Betasshole had to work in real-time with other betassholes on other projects created by other alphassholes that were all equally hemorrhoidal in nature over StackOverflow and Discord to come up with whatever collection of hackery that properly deserves to be called, “Satan’s Self-soothing salve of sour-ass solutions.”</p>



<p>The Betasshole is a 5 on the Satanic-sequence of Suckassness. They’re not nearly as bad as the dickweed who chose new tech. But unfortunately, they made a lot of terrible choices and cannot be free from blame, git-related, or otherwise. </p>



<p>Listen. I’ve been an Alphasshole and a Betasshole before. I regret that. I should not have done that. </p>



<p>I’ve <em>also</em> been gamma waaaaaay more often. Who is not an asshole. That’s a person who’s just had to deal with two years of shit rolling downstream. What’s unfortunate for the gammas is that they often will be <em>accused</em> of being the assholes because they will git-blame, complain, and refrain from touching whatever that new tech was because it’s haunted their nightmares and their daymares. They are simply picking up the pieces. </p>



<p>The new and shiny is fun for side projects. It is not for production.</p>



<p><em>Please put two years between you and any new tech. If for anyone, do it for the gammas who actually have to keep your precious world wide web running. </em></p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>Just… grow up and think.</p>



<ul>
<li>Think and care about the content first. Because that’s what the users care about. Assume the users’ interests are more important than your own. </li>



<li>Quit acting like CSS is some giant-ass mistake that needs fixing. A group of people who were collectively smarter than us wrote those specs. They didn’t make mistakes. Assume you are making the mistake, not them. </li>



<li>Server-side rendering was not invented with JavaScript and it doesn’t have to be implemented with JavaScript. There are many ways to render content on a server. Assume non-JavaScript solutions existed first.</li>



<li>JavaScript either is neither the God-send nor the hell-spawn for your project. It is a tool which you can choose to use incorrectly. Learn when JavaScript is the right tool for the job. </li>



<li>Quit doing hard things for simple problems. Quit doing things that are degrees of difficulty <em>harder</em> than the problem. When a problem presents itself, look for multiple solutions, and then choose the simplest one. Assume the simplest solution is the best one. </li>



<li>Quit chasing the new and shiny in your day job. I, too, am excited about the new and shiny. But I put a 2-year buffer between me and prod because I don’t want to be the person to have to discover browser bugs, framework bugs, or even compiler bugs. </li>
</ul>



<p>Or whatever. Don’t do this and continue to be an Alphasshole, Betasshole, or an otherwise generally contemptuous person. I don’t care. At least I can sleep better knowing that you know that I know that you now know that you’re an asshole. </p>

Every PR that involves adding a new dev dependency to any project should require the developer to hand-write the entire dependency tree. That would probably save a lot of future heartache.  </p>

<p id="five"><small>5</small> I do not, in fact, have strong evidence that the Good Lord intended for WebPack to be told to, “fuck off good and proper like.” <em>However</em> <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/19/Leviticus-19-19.html">if the Good Lord had something to say about cotton blends</a>, He’d probably also have something to say about using a JavaScript build utility for building styles.  </p>
<p id="six"><small>6</small> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@property">Yes, you can have strongly-typed CSS</a>, but it’s insanely tedious because those “types” are not like any types you’d expect from any other language, and the syntax is going to be a huge pain. Also, you have the option to set it to not inherit which is, in fact, the most unCSSy thing ever. So please. Don’t.    </p>
