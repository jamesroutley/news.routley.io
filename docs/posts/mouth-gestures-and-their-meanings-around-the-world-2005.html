    <h1>Mouth gestures and their meanings around the world (2005)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>An excerpt from François Caradec’s book “Dictionary of Gestures.”</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gestures-2-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async"/></figure><p>We might believe that the seat of speech (without considering ventriloquists and flatulists) has no need for the assistance of hand gestures when it comes to expressing emotions and sensations. Numerous adjectives confirm this to be true: <em>foul</em>, <em>open</em>, <em>loud</em>, <em>smart</em>, <em>foaming</em>, <em>pouty</em>, <em>watering</em> — the mouth can be all of these things and many more still.</p><p>Whereas in English, <em>to have your heart in your mouth</em> means to be very nervous, in French, it is inverted and has a different meaning. As Raymond Queneau puts it in “Loin de Rueil”: “He coldly left like in a transitional scene, just like that, in the night, mouth in heart, without a word.” Typically, in French, this means to put on airs or to simper.</p><p>The French also have the expression <em>la bouche en cul de poule</em>, which literally means “to have a chicken’s ass for a mouth,” but idiomatically indicates that someone has put on a honeyed or fawning look, puckering his lips or not, in the hopes of getting what he wants. The mouth can be mysterious and arouse fantasies, which Simone de Beauvoir acknowledged in her book “Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter”:</p><blockquote><p>I would have very much liked to find out through what mechanism it was that the contact of two mouths brought about sensual pleasure: often, looking at the lips of a young man or a young woman, I was amazed.</p></blockquote><p>The mouth also knows how to keep quiet: It is upon the mouth that the monkey of Chinese wisdom places its hands to signify that silence is always worth more than an imprudent<em> word.</em></p><hr/><figure><img

(1924–2008) was a French writer and a member of both the Collége de ‘Pataphysique and the Oulipo. His voluminous oeuvre includes biographies of Raymond Roussel and Alfred Jarry, as well as an encyclopedia of practical jokes and a dictionary of French slang. Caradec was a devoted specialist in Alphonse Allais, compiling and editing his collected works, and was one of the first historians of the bande dessinée in France.
