<p>Despite its 1996 release, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Nintendo-64-Console-HTPC-Intel-Atom-Nvidia-Ion,11445.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Nintendo-64-Console-HTPC-Intel-Atom-Nvidia-Ion,11445.html">Nintendo 64</a>&#39;s original hardware and games have both remained relatively hot-button in enthusiast circles here into 2024. Now, the next frontier of high-end N64 gameplay may be through recompiled PC ports instead of emulation, courtesy of Mr-Wiseguy on GitHub. Wiseguy is responsible for the release of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp" data-url="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">N64Recomp</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp" data-url="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Zelda64Recomp</a>, a project that ports <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#39;s Mask</em> to PC with N64Recomp&#39;s graphical and QoL improvements, as screenshotted above and highlighted by YouTuber Nerrel below.</p><div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywWwUuWRgsM" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>So, what makes crazy graphical improvements like real ray-tracing, uncapped FPS, and proper ultrawide support possible for N64 games? If you&#39;ve been in the Nintendo 64 enthusiast scene for a long time, you may recall the waves made when a completely decompiled <em>Super Mario 64 </em>PC Port dropped in 2020 and allowed for features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChqP2ecA8qE" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChqP2ecA8qE" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">real ray-tracing</a>, full model replacements, and so on. It still gets mods to this day.</p><p>Recompiled ports aren&#39;t quite the same as decompiled ports like the SM64 PC port in this context, but both will run natively on PC and thus be able to <em>truly</em> maximize performance and effect accuracy to the original hardware while still providing the PC-expected enhancements that come with emulation. Â N64Recomp is basically the best of both worlds, and since manually decompiling N64 games takes years of labor from one or more people, a tool to more efficiently recompile them into a quickly playable-on-PC state is a godsend for preservationists everywhere.</p><p>A tool like this also ensures that old classics that aren&#39;t currently receiving the attention of big mainstream hits remain playable well into the future in an ideal state. A Twitter post by Dario, who makes the RT64 plugin leveraged by N64Recomp and some N64 emulators, highlights this.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My friend Wiseguy&#39;s been working in secret for a year on a tool to make PC ports of N64 games without complete decompilations. The result doesn&#39;t include assets and only requires a ROM to play.He&#39;s managed to run games like Banjo-Kazooie, Rocket Robot and even Superman 64. pic.twitter.com/sKGuViEsJZ<a href="https://twitter.com/dariosamo/status/1789049134709678500" data-url="https://twitter.com/dariosamo/status/1789049134709678500" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Even as we speak, advancements like this aren&#39;t the only huge boons we&#39;re seeing for fans of the Nintendo 64&#39;s library or even original hardware.
