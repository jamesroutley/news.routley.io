    <h1>Ask HN: Those making $0/month or less on side projects â€“ Show and tell</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><p>Not sure about anyone else, but I enjoy seeing the posts on side projects making money. Often while reading all of the comments I find new products or services I want, so I buy them and contribute further to that hustle&#39;s success. But for every hacker making $100 or more per month with their idea, there are hundreds more working hard, making nothing, struggling to get started. Does that describe you? Maybe the community just needs to hear about what you&#39;re offering, what you&#39;ve been working on. If you&#39;ve got something cool that has not yet gained traction, maybe it just needs to be seen by a gaggle of like-minded hackers and geeks. So share!</p></td></div></div>
