    <h1>Week 9: CSS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Over the last week, </span><strong>I’ve really been learning a lot about CSS</strong><span>. </span><strong><a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Josh Comeau’s course</a><span> continues to be very useful</span></strong><span> — I especially appreciate the little games he put in to help cement tricky concepts like </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">margin collapse</a><span> and </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">how absolute and fixed positioning interact with containing blocks</a><span>. I’m realizing that </span><strong>there are some remarkably tricky and subtle concepts in CSS</strong><span>!</span></p><p><span>So far, </span><strong><span>I’ve made it all the way through the </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">flow layout</a><span> module</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>most of the way through the </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">positioned layout</a><span> module</span></strong><span>. </span><strong>I’ve learned so much already</strong><span>, even before making it to </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">flexbox</a><span> or </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">CSS Grid</a><span>, which I know are the more modern tools that people use more today — I’m excited to get to them! The sandboxes where you recreate a website mockup have helped me cement that learning, too. </span><strong><span>You can see the first workshop I did </span><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/css-class-huckleberry-fork-qx1tic?file=/style.css" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a></strong><span> (don’t forget to click the “Project View” icon in the upper-right to switch the sandbox to “Current Module View”, which actually shows the styling).</span></p><p><strong>I’m not </strong><em><strong>quite</strong></em><strong> at the point where I want to start skinning my app yet, but I will be next week for sure.</strong><span> As I said, there’s just so much to CSS I never realized was there, so it’s taking a bit longer to learn than I thought it would!</span></p><p><span>Overall, </span><strong>my strategy for Recurse from last week is still working</strong><span> as well. </span><strong>In category theory, I’m still learning a lot</strong><span> and it’s still interesting: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_transformation" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">natural transformations</a><span> are gradually getting firmer in my mind, I’m starting to understand </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">adjunctions</a><span>, and it was pretty cool to see the recursive descent parsing </span><a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/parsing-expressions.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">I learned about in Crafting Interpreters</a><span> being used for category theory too! </span><strong>And for socializing, I had to cut down coffee chats this week from 5 to 3</strong><span>, but after doing that, I feel like </span><strong>I’m finally hitting a sustainable pace</strong><span> here at Recurse.</span></p><p><span>One more thing: </span><strong><span>I found out about </span><a href="https://bangbangcon.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">!!Con</a><span> through the Recurse Center</span></strong><span> (apparently many of the organizers and speakers have gone through RC), so </span><strong>I decided to go</strong><span> (online) last weekend. </span><strong>It was cool!</strong><span> Especially </span><strong><span>getting to make Game Boy music with the amazingly talented </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipzel" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Chipzel</a><span> </span></strong><span>using </span><a href="https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">LSDJ</a><span>! </span><strong>I’m continuing to learn about new things and have unexpected awesome experiences through Recurse</strong><span>, and as Thanksgiving approaches, I just want to say that I’m very thankful for that. ❤️</span></p><p><strong>Next time</strong><span>: More CSS, and hopefully working on my Elixir / Phoenix app again!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
