<p>Just over two years ago, we <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/revealed-thunderbird-on-android-plans-k9/">announced our plans</a> to bring Thunderbird to Android by taking K-9 Mail under our wing. The journey took a <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/12/when-will-thunderbird-for-android-be-released/">little longer than we had originally anticipated</a> and there was a lot to learn along the way, but the wait is finally over! For all of you who have ever asked “when is Thunderbird for Android coming out?”, the answer is – today! We are excited to announce that the first stable release of Thunderbird for Android is out now, and we couldn’t be prouder of the newest, most mobile member of the Thunderbird family.</p>
