    <h1>As I am currently in a war zone, I don&#39;t have many options for cabling</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>I&#39;m not an electrician, but I can help with the circuit analysis. The formula for resistance is:</p>
<p><span>$$R = \rho \frac L A$$</span></p>
<p>where <span>\$\rho\$</span> is the resistivity of the steel, <span>\$L\$</span> is the length of the wire, and <span>\$A\$</span> is the cross-sectional area of the wire. The first question is whether your resistance measurement is correct. Measuring small resistances with a two-wire multimeter is hard due to the resistance of the leads. You also (for testing and use) need to make sure you have good contact with the wire. The surface of metals oxidizes, which can add resistance to a weak connection.</p>
<p>Your measurement of 7 ohms for 13 meters give a resistivity of:</p>
<p><span>$$\rho = \frac {R A}{L} = \frac {7\Omega \cdot \pi \cdot (0.5 \mathrm{mm})^2} {13 \mathrm m} = 4.23 \times 10^{-7} \Omega \cdot \mathrm m$$</span></p>
<p>which seems to be in the right range according to <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/UmranUgur.shtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> and other sources, so your measurement seems reasonable. But you didn&#39;t say how you&#39;re doing the measurement.</p>
<p>Resistance is linear with distance -- halve the length of the wire and you halve its resistance. Double the length of the wire and you double its resistance. Two wires in parallel will have half the resistance of one, three wires will have a third of the resistance of one, and so forth. Your wire seems to be <span>\$0.5385\ \Omega/\mathrm m\$</span>. If you want to make a cable with around 1 ohm of resistance, you could use:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.85 meters of 1 wire</li>
<li>3.7 meters of 2 wires in parallel</li>
<li>7.4 meters of 4 wires in parallel</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to carry your large 15 amp current, you&#39;ll need to go lower. Maybe a 0.1 ohm cable can work:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 meter of 6 wires in parallel</li>
<li>2 meters of 12 wires in parallel</li>
<li>4 meters of 24 wires in parallel</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison, copper&#39;s resistivity is around <span>\$1.7 \times 10^{-8} \Omega\cdot\mathrm m\$</span>. Your steel&#39;s resistivity is around 25 times higher.</p>
<p>Aluminum is almost as good as copper at <span>\$2.7 \times 10^{-8} \Omega\cdot\mathrm m\$</span>, so if you find any aluminum wire (or long strips of aluminum if you get desperate) that would be much better than steel. Be sure to insulate -- high currents can be just as dangerous as high voltages if they get shorted out or the connection suddenly breaks.</p>
<p>Good luck! I hope your situation improves soon.</p>
