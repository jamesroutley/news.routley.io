I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in our lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it. AI has the potential to create opportunities — from the everyday to the extraordinary — for people everywhere. It will bring new waves of innovation and economic progress and drive knowledge, learning, creativity and productivity on a scale we haven’t seen before.</p><p data-block-key="3ffsc">That’s what excites me: the chance to make AI helpful for everyone, everywhere in the world.</p><p data-block-key="6sa5">Nearly eight years into our journey as an AI-first company, the pace of progress is only accelerating: Millions of people are now using generative AI across our products to do things they couldn’t even a year ago, from finding answers to more complex questions to using new tools to collaborate and create. At the same time, developers are using our models and infrastructure to build new generative AI applications, and startups and enterprises around the world are growing with our AI tools.</p><p data-block-key="fafvp">This is incredible momentum, and yet, we’re only beginning to scratch the surface of what’s possible.</p><p data-block-key="chghs">We’re approaching this work boldly and responsibly. That means being ambitious in our research and pursuing the capabilities that will bring enormous benefits to people and society, while building in safeguards and working collaboratively with governments and experts to address risks as AI becomes more capable. And we continue to invest in the very best tools, foundation models and infrastructure and bring them to our products and to others, guided by our <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/" rt-link-type="external">AI Principles</a>.</p><p data-block-key="akdk1">Now, we’re taking the next step on our journey with Gemini, our most capable and general model yet, with state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks. Our first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company. I’m genuinely excited for what’s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people everywhere.</p><p data-block-key="87ult">– Sundar</p></div>

Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I’ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways.</p><p data-block-key="i7i7">This promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we’ve wanted to build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive — an expert helper or assistant.</p><p data-block-key="98mu4">Today, we’re a step closer to this vision as <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini" rt-link-type="external">we introduce Gemini</a>, the most capable and general model we’ve ever built.</p><p data-block-key="aka6e">Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video.</p></div>

        <div><h2 data-block-key="dapif">Built with responsibility and safety at the core</h2><p data-block-key="6pvob">At Google, we’re committed to advancing bold and responsible AI in everything we do. Building upon Google’s <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/" rt-link-type="external">AI Principles</a> and the robust safety policies across our products, we’re adding new protections to account for Gemini’s multimodal capabilities. At each stage of development, we’re considering potential risks and working to test and mitigate them.</p><p data-block-key="4rc0o">Gemini has the most comprehensive safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date, including for bias and toxicity. We’ve conducted <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/an-early-warning-system-for-novel-ai-risks/" rt-link-type="external">novel research into potential risk areas</a> like cyber-offense, persuasion and autonomy, and have applied Google Research’s best-in-class <a href="https://blog.research.google/2023/11/responsible-ai-at-google-research_16.html" rt-link-type="external">adversarial testing techniques</a> to help identify critical safety issues in advance of Gemini’s deployment.</p><p data-block-key="1tti2">To identify blindspots in our internal evaluation approach, we’re working with a diverse group of external experts and partners to stress-test our models across a range of issues.</p><p data-block-key="9hpod">To diagnose content safety issues during Gemini’s training phases and ensure its output follows our policies, we’re using benchmarks such as <a href="https://allenai.org/data/real-toxicity-prompts" rt-link-type="external">Real Toxicity Prompts</a>, a set of 100,000 prompts with varying degrees of toxicity pulled from the web, developed by experts at the Allen Institute for AI. Further details on this work are coming soon.</p><p data-block-key="1ovh">To limit harm, we built dedicated safety classifiers to identify, label and sort out content involving violence or negative stereotypes, for example. Combined with robust filters, this layered approach is designed to make Gemini safer and more inclusive for everyone. Additionally, we’re continuing to address known challenges for models such as factuality, grounding, attribution and corroboration.</p><p data-block-key="6cdjb">Responsibility and safety will always be central to the development and deployment of our models. This is a long-term commitment that requires building collaboratively, so we’re partnering with the industry and broader ecosystem on defining best practices and setting safety and security benchmarks through organizations like <a href="https://mlcommons.org/" rt-link-type="external">MLCommons</a>, the <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-microsoft-openai-anthropic-frontier-model-forum/" rt-link-type="external">Frontier Model Forum</a> <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-microsoft-openai-anthropic-frontier-model-forum/" rt-link-type="external">and</a> its <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-microsoft-anthropic-open-ai-frontier-model-forum-executive-director/" rt-link-type="external">AI Safety Fund</a>, and our <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/introducing-googles-secure-ai-framework/" rt-link-type="external">Secure AI Framework (SAIF)</a>, which was designed to help mitigate security risks specific to AI systems across the public and private sectors. We’ll continue partnering with researchers, governments and civil society groups around the world as we develop Gemini.</p></div>
