				<p>Did you know that German genre publishers used to insert paid product placement into domestic translations of popular international writers? Yes, it’s true. And here’s exhibit A (via <a href="https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/1443548156147367939" target="_blank">this Neil Gaiman thread</a>).</p>
<p>Apparently the reason beloved sci-fi writer Terry Pratchett left his German publisher back in the early 90s was because they inserted an ad for Maggi soup into a scene he’d written! (Without his permission, obviously.) <a href="https://gmkeros.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/terry-pratchett-and-the-maggi-soup-adverts/" target="_blank">According to Pratchett</a>:</p>
<p>There were a number of reasons for switching to Goldmann, but a deeply personal one for me was the way Heyne (in <em>Sourcery</em>, I think, although it may have been in other books) inserted a soup advert in the text … a few black lines and then something like “Around about now our heroes must be pretty hungry and what better than a nourishing bowl…” etc, etc. My editor was pretty sick about it, but the company wouldn’t promise not to do it again, so that made it very easy to leave them.</p>
<p>Apparently this practice had been policy at Heyne for decades, and was used to ensure that pulp genre titles earned back their acquisition costs. If you are an executive at a big four publishing corporation, please forget everything you just read: I do not want to be reading page-long elegies to LL Bean duck boots in the next Jonathan Franzen.</p>
