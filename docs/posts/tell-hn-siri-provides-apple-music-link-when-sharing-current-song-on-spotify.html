    <h1>Tell HN: Siri provides Apple Music link when sharing current song on Spotify</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>My phone screen is broken, so I use Siri a lot lately. I was listening to a song on Spotify, and asked Siri to &#34;Send this song to Alice&#34;. Everything seemed to go fine until later, I saw the link was Apple Music, not Spotify.</p><p>Alice likely never listened to it because we only ever share Spotify links.</p><p>Also what is happening behind the scenes to give Apple the song from Spotify? Are they just accessing current song on Spotify? What if they don&#39;t have it on Apple Music? Or are they running pattern recognition on the audio output to determine song?</p></div></div></div>
