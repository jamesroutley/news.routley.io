Well, here&#39;s my new choice for that superlative: <i>Escape</i>. I would love to meet someone who could possibly get anywhere with it. Seriously, all of you, go and <a href="http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-escape_32356.html">download it right now</a>. The instructions are right there on that page. It works okay in Steem, better in Hatari. Try to last five minutes with it, and if you succeed, return here and tell me about yourself in the comments. I think about my own feeble attempts to learn the piano, and then I watch someone play Rachmaninoff&#39;s sonata no. 2 in B-flat minor, and I can accept that humanity has such wondrous diversity that such a gulf in talents is possible. But I cannot accept that humanity is so diverse that some people out there could possibly succeed at, let alone enjoy, <i>Escape</i>. I need evidence.</span></span></p><p><i>Escape</i> is an easy game to explain. I think its root inspiration is John Palevich&#39;s <i>Dandy</i> (1983), but the author introduces enough roguelike elements that I think it could be called a &#34;roguelite.&#34; I only hesitate to use that term because roguelites are usually easier than <i>Rogue</i>, which <i>Escape</i> definitely isn&#39;t. You&#39;re an unnamed hero who starts in a room in a large one-floor dungeon. Your goal is--you probably saw this coming--to escape. To do this, you must battle through monsters and use various helpful items that you find along the way. Between you and the exit are 20 numbered doors unlocked by numbered keys.</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwa7ttDkDMyKLlGqhK__PvJPLoPnGYEt8GQO3VEDHWFXSgJeUVsKZRFhNLL6wNPbfLqpQL6G_M5wzpkPq949OTHbjnXsQpvSU5XxbHhzKYsegiw9kzLKp4kJyxKEPqsrBFHneKNrqaOUuWhMKzZnf1yMxfbxZl-CoqhL4sh8Banpmo8zmYHP32aSBp/s1040/escgp3.PNG"><img data-original-height="497" data-original-width="1040" height="191" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwa7ttDkDMyKLlGqhK__PvJPLoPnGYEt8GQO3VEDHWFXSgJeUVsKZRFhNLL6wNPbfLqpQL6G_M5wzpkPq949OTHbjnXsQpvSU5XxbHhzKYsegiw9kzLKp4kJyxKEPqsrBFHneKNrqaOUuWhMKzZnf1yMxfbxZl-CoqhL4sh8Banpmo8zmYHP32aSBp/w400-h191/escgp3.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>A few minutes into it. Enemies are tigers and cubes. I think the black holes with eyes are just there to confuse you. I can see some gold, some Band-aids, a bomb, and a missile scroll. I&#39;m carrying another missile scroll and potions of strength and speed and a scroll of protection.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table>       <br/></div><p>What I can&#39;t convey from that description is the utter chaos inherent in gameplay. Everything occurs in real-time, not based on turns. There are traps everywhere that weaken, paralyze, sleep, slow, poison, curse, and confuse you, plus bombs that damage you. Enemies spawn constantly. Movement is with a joystick, but to pick up and use items, you have to use the number and function keys. I&#39;ve never understood the purpose of a joystick if you have to sit at the keyboard at the same time.</p><p>Most importantly, the game is <i>fast</i>. I ultimately turned it down to 50%, the slowest that the emulator would accommodate, and it was still far too fast. It&#39;s not so bad when you&#39;re in corridors, but when you hit a large open room, and you&#39;re trying to avoid enemies, avoid traps, and pick up useful items . . . well, it&#39;s a lot like hitting all the notes right in a Rachmaninoff composition, particularly since when there are a lot of enemies on the screen--which is always--the game doesn&#39;t always register your movement inputs.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6e_CaAk5JNVgv5PBBSrJ4mIbDQGXDWcfh7-bIpUbnlAJxl_v5XD-UqBYV9KEE29ZCBQvJ_2UQ4M9xi_b3RmH1l31KCRSkVvsYmdkBtlblnuUzi7h8gTZqbYXmcUQtz7ZNqlBmSLGzSKAM-KK8ZhgmdlLmyIjYSlvYPwf2HhY3tNkzth_H1kJr-qUA/s1111/escgp6.PNG"><img data-original-height="605" data-original-width="1111" height="217" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6e_CaAk5JNVgv5PBBSrJ4mIbDQGXDWcfh7-bIpUbnlAJxl_v5XD-UqBYV9KEE29ZCBQvJ_2UQ4M9xi_b3RmH1l31KCRSkVvsYmdkBtlblnuUzi7h8gTZqbYXmcUQtz7ZNqlBmSLGzSKAM-KK8ZhgmdlLmyIjYSlvYPwf2HhY3tNkzth_H1kJr-qUA/w400-h217/escgp6.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Later. It  would be nice to get into that room with the Band-Aids.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Inventory keys are particularly hard. You have eight inventory slots. When you step over an item and you want to pick it up, you type the number corresponding with the slot. If you want to drop an item, you hit the number again. When you want to use the item, you hit the function key corresponding with that slot. If that sounds easy, all I can say is try it. I was constantly hitting the wrong key and dropping an item in an existing slot instead of picking up a new item, or dropping an item when I wanted to use it, or using an item when I wanted to drop it. Eventually, I got to the point where I gave up trying to keep any kind of inventory, and I just kept two fingers of my left hand on 1 and F1, using any item that I picked up immediately. This isn&#39;t a bad strategy because there are a ton of items and you almost always need them.</p><p>Useful items include healing items (Band-Aids, potions of healing, and healing kits), Potions of Strength, Potions of Speed, Scrolls of Protection, Scrolls of Dispel (negative effects), scrolls that freeze all enemies for a few seconds (priceless), and scrolls that kill all nearby enemies (almost equally priceless, though they&#39;re quickly replaced). You also get one weapon slot, one armor slot, and one wearable slot, with consequent effects on your strength, weapon strength, and armor strength. There are missile weapons, but I found them impossible to use effectively. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhlADHcJ0bfswibmWYbwc1pZd08Z4ewQB3VrY8YPSbmjwgo8dFaFudcYqR77XQaSxHsJpIIYwLGRpWrYvq8wEqjotOdTxXPQFe4V-ywU1zive3SLX1JEI-PyRU604Wly8g71klq0htUGVX2gupOnVdRbMDfWuIGF_1-oOPK_XXIvJi0IuGQa_dPdhP/s1031/escperished.PNG"><img data-original-height="541" data-original-width="1031" height="210" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhlADHcJ0bfswibmWYbwc1pZd08Z4ewQB3VrY8YPSbmjwgo8dFaFudcYqR77XQaSxHsJpIIYwLGRpWrYvq8wEqjotOdTxXPQFe4V-ywU1zive3SLX1JEI-PyRU604Wly8g71klq0htUGVX2gupOnVdRbMDfWuIGF_1-oOPK_XXIvJi0IuGQa_dPdhP/w400-h210/escperished.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>You get this screen a lot.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The monsters you fight are unnamed. You start with cats and weird cubes with faces and progress through things that look like blobs, aliens, dragons, giant spiders, and plenty more. The most diabolical are mimics that look like healing kits. Whoever came up with that deserves to be hit over the head with some kind of award. Monsters spawn everywhere and swarm you from all sides. The important thing is that you try to be the aggressor. Once they get adjacent to you, they start sapping your hit points, but if you&#39;re moving in their direction, you can kill them before they can wound you. Again, this is somewhat easy in a corridor but very hard in a room where you&#39;re simultaneously trying to avoid traps and bombs, and monsters are coming from every direction.</p><p>Kills add to your maximum hit points. You begin the game with only a single hit point, and surviving these opening stages is a damned nightmare. Mid-game, when you have a few hundred hit points, it feels like things are improving, but then you hit a period in which almost every section of the game is a huge room where you have to thread your way extremely carefully through fields of bombs while enemies are pounding at you and you just want to curl up into a ball and cry.   </p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqm9YWVHpcwpIF9lJpCVPzbYaCX41eHXxhBT-_nqXFUsdkUtMWTopUR7p-d_eIa22k1bC_Mnqi6WOoaxgvNsn5UAk1_JbYjjqbrqNk2Kws6u5v6TQBuDxn0v3EXySB130b5bMGdACxt4yTPN8TxbDlSS9meSfaIVrdxJvS_mUlVsWJ47730YWj-Qqo/s1157/esceric.PNG"><img data-original-height="555" data-original-width="1157" height="193" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqm9YWVHpcwpIF9lJpCVPzbYaCX41eHXxhBT-_nqXFUsdkUtMWTopUR7p-d_eIa22k1bC_Mnqi6WOoaxgvNsn5UAk1_JbYjjqbrqNk2Kws6u5v6TQBuDxn0v3EXySB130b5bMGdACxt4yTPN8TxbDlSS9meSfaIVrdxJvS_mUlVsWJ47730YWj-Qqo/w400-h193/esceric.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>This screen shows spider webs (which do nothing), money, A Scroll of Missiles, a scroll whose name and purpose I never learned, three pentagrams (do nothing), three bombs, two curse traps (envelopes), a slow trap, a paralysis trap (&#34;stop&#34;), a teleportation arrow, and 20 foes.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><p>The worst part is that the game not only enforces permadeath, you can&#39;t even save it for later play. If you&#39;re going to win (legitimately), you have to do it all in a single session. Again, I can&#39;t believe this was ever achieved. I could barely do it with 50% speed and hundreds of reloads using save states. </p><p>The only thing you have that really helps you is that action pauses when you hit the SPACE bar. At first, I just used this to go to the bathroom and take screenshots. By the end of the game, I was using it to turn <i>Escape</i> into almost a turn-based game, pausing essentially after every move to re-study the board and plan the next move. Maybe this is how it was meant to be played, but trust me, it still doesn&#39;t make it easy.</p><p>There are only a couple of navigation puzzles in the dungeon. The most important is that you need to find a series of 20 keys to open a bunch of locked doors. The doors and keys are clearly labeled with numbers, but it&#39;s easy to miss keys because you need to keep your attention on your immediate surroundings (again, frequent pausing helps). I had a few times where I had missed a key and had to do a lot of backtracking, which sucks because enemies keep respawning but you&#39;ve already used all the items in those areas.</p><p>Second, there are occasional teleportation arrows that always send you four squares in their indicated direction, often through walls (so you can&#39;t return). For all of that, I didn&#39;t get lost as much as you might expect given the size of the dungeon (my best guess is that it&#39;s around 130 x 130). It winds and twists throughout it&#39;s space, but it&#39;s relatively linear.</p><p>There are arrows that shoot from the walls at regular intervals, but they&#39;re not much of a problem until the final area. Gold on the ground simply adds to your score.<br/></p><p>There are two things about the game that I don&#39;t understand:</p><div><ul><li>There are a lot of symbols on the floor that look bad but don&#39;t seem to do anything. They include these black maws, spider webs, pentagrams, and diamond symbols. My best guess is that they&#39;re just there to confuse things visually--to make it even harder to pick out enemies, items, and movement paths.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>When I start the game in Steem, it resizes the window so that it&#39;s 2.5 times as wide as it is tall. The graphics look &#34;correct&#34; at this ratio. Was the Atari ST really capable of supporting such a resolution?</li></ul></div><p>You&#39;re getting towards the endgame when you start finding keys in the late teens. There&#39;s one section of the game in which you have to traverse a room three tiles high that extends across the entire bottom of the dungeon. Threading through this area and staying alive was nearly impossible for me even abusing emulation speed and save states. And you have to go through it three times--from east to west to get a key, from west back to east to use the key on a door, behind which you find another key, and then back west again to use the second key. </p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4QepJ5jQgb09ZAdj5Xtmr5I4Pbvz9ZWGrr4KoLH-NOR-20135hwEYz7lgC0ryG8voNcNyysZZJu9HFPfFi_pirJIkjLBdWsj7mfKvX5_cu8gJr96OZgsV7KJwCZsN7zJ5w0kJa7ANQzru9-HP2CuYSImhTprfXtMBcYi1SnFKyLUCPhCtMPb4bPyf/s1056/esclongroom.PNG"><img data-original-height="476" data-original-width="1056" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4QepJ5jQgb09ZAdj5Xtmr5I4Pbvz9ZWGrr4KoLH-NOR-20135hwEYz7lgC0ryG8voNcNyysZZJu9HFPfFi_pirJIkjLBdWsj7mfKvX5_cu8gJr96OZgsV7KJwCZsN7zJ5w0kJa7ANQzru9-HP2CuYSImhTprfXtMBcYi1SnFKyLUCPhCtMPb4bPyf/w400-h180/esclongroom.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>This room went about 110 squares east to west, and each row was full of treasures, traps, and foes.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table>     <br/></div><p>But this area is nothing compared to the endgame room, which opens to key #20. It&#39;s 8 x 10 and full of the toughest monsters in the game--monsters who easily sap 100 hit points per attack. (One of the toughest monsters is represented by the word &#34;Eric,&#34; the author&#39;s name.)  If you don&#39;t have a couple of &#34;Freeze&#34; scrolls and ideally a couple of &#34;Kill&#34; scrolls when you get to this area, there&#39;s absolutely no way you would make it.<br/></p><p>A square marked &#34;EXIT&#34; is in the middle of the room, but most of the time, it&#39;s hidden by a monster. With a single &#34;Freeze&#34; spell, I had to take a save state and explore the room in columns, reloading when I died, until I finally found the one that had the exit. Your reward is a bland message that fails to recognize that it&#39;s basically impossible to have ever gotten it. The screen doesn&#39;t even recognize your score, making all the gold collection a particular waste of time.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh77IHwSA6sm2xsQANBvtjDtNdtDryrUgCG5x2ZU0gh-I98Oeu1RitLCHxjcrTGnUVvjcogk4bJLRFWlg_3RlQLa20Oez_v5r-YuTjgjHFdiIX5Xcpg4lfdTUBqFSuSD2loDyU3N280dlzojY57kIfaVn2GT7_ota5fgrx7YMtt983mn7Pc_CRI_3xp/s1251/escfinalroom.PNG"><img data-original-height="540" data-original-width="1251" height="173" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh77IHwSA6sm2xsQANBvtjDtNdtDryrUgCG5x2ZU0gh-I98Oeu1RitLCHxjcrTGnUVvjcogk4bJLRFWlg_3RlQLa20Oez_v5r-YuTjgjHFdiIX5Xcpg4lfdTUBqFSuSD2loDyU3N280dlzojY57kIfaVn2GT7_ota5fgrx7YMtt983mn7Pc_CRI_3xp/w400-h173/escfinalroom.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>The final room. I can&#39;t even tell which one is my character.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>At 50% speed and using dozens of save states, it took me five hours to win the game. A GIMLET for the game is a waste of time; it&#39;s as far from what I&#39;m looking for in a CRPG as a game possibly can be. Even if you enjoy . . . what? Action roguelikes? . . . I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;d enjoy the exhausting pace and punishing difficulty that this game offers. I&#39;ll enter an 8 in the spreadsheet, representing a few 1s and 2s for having combat and equipment and a quest, but 0s for NPCs, game world, economy, and gameplay.</p><p><i>Escape</i> was written by an Eric B. Lindros. It would be delightful to think that this is the former NHL player, who has that middle initial and would have been 15 in 1988. But the hockey star grew up in Canada, and this Eric Lindros was in Carpinteria, California, and I think would have been about 26 when he wrote the game. He asked $5 for the game, or $10 if you wanted the source code. He offered a $50 reward for the best suggestion for <i>Escape II</i>.  I can&#39;t find any evidence that <i>Escape II</i> was ever produced, but then again, <i>Escape</i> is only attested on a couple of sites.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN2qsG1IDwbE-Vzl6WH4llrAgiVBNJ12F8XO52F6e7UwZC-40QaJw7cFK1Fy-IDgkfEgUgO9pgmCy1ZL9QeosorrB5qyPUNVgLXkC7lvb3bIXLqjNv9HhKaz8H_LTVh1Qdy-aPUny_jzy6bmfsEPbYHdxy_o0Ci9ZDP9EpdmMBJPFR9g-coY3IF5q5/s1357/escyouwin.PNG"><img data-original-height="539" data-original-width="1357" height="159" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN2qsG1IDwbE-Vzl6WH4llrAgiVBNJ12F8XO52F6e7UwZC-40QaJw7cFK1Fy-IDgkfEgUgO9pgmCy1ZL9QeosorrB5qyPUNVgLXkC7lvb3bIXLqjNv9HhKaz8H_LTVh1Qdy-aPUny_jzy6bmfsEPbYHdxy_o0Ci9ZDP9EpdmMBJPFR9g-coY3IF5q5/w400-h159/escyouwin.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>The winning screen. <br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table>      <br/></div><p>Lindros also has a game called <i>MegaMaze</i> from the same year. I took a look at it, and it seems like a prototype of <i>Escape</i>, a lot closer to <i>Dandy</i> (which also inspired <i>Gauntlet</i>). It has fewer monsters, no traps, no strength, weapon, or armor statistics, and items (of which there are fewer) are consumed immediately instead of requiring you to pick up and then use them. There are some of the same enemy icons, but far fewer of them, and they respawn much more slowly. <i>MegaMaze</i> oddly gets a lot more search hits and database entries than <i>Escape</i>.<br/></p><p>Truth be told, I could have rejected this one--<i>should</i> have rejected it--since the only form of character development is extra health. The &#34;strength&#34; score changes only based on inventory. It&#39;s occasionally good to reaffirm the fundamental difference between RPGs and &#34;Gauntlesque&#34; games, but in the future, when it comes to this sub-genre, I&#39;m always going to be looking for (drum roll) an escape.<br/></p></div>

For some reason, FTL, a San Diego-based studio, decided to develop the sequel for the PC-98 first. (And for some reason, the Japanese version lacked the words &#34;The Legend of&#34; in the subtitle. I&#39;ll try to sort these questions for the final entry.) The result is that the 1995 DOS port I&#39;m playing feels almost premature. It has noticeably better graphics and sound than the 1993 games I&#39;ve been playing. Still, many of the game&#39;s elements seem already dated for 1993 and particularly so for 1995. I doubt the two-year delay did FTL any favors when it came to U.S. reviews.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhejjB63g-y2b9YkGQfxPynVV_SjpRZVA2g6IHpZz1UZHWbhCTMerHY413MwKas8LyJ8G7cCH5UoAunPNL9lqhKVZ3a4xA9tivLmYjLVrnpKj-rCIJHjzAhkN12OHjLr6pCDwXNnMSKrexlU9tRpVDsvmwE7XLu2PJka-AmF5R-ypdYEPOObL_yMbSe/s897/dm2manual.PNG"><img data-original-height="897" data-original-width="555" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhejjB63g-y2b9YkGQfxPynVV_SjpRZVA2g6IHpZz1UZHWbhCTMerHY413MwKas8LyJ8G7cCH5UoAunPNL9lqhKVZ3a4xA9tivLmYjLVrnpKj-rCIJHjzAhkN12OHjLr6pCDwXNnMSKrexlU9tRpVDsvmwE7XLu2PJka-AmF5R-ypdYEPOObL_yMbSe/w248-h400/dm2manual.PNG" width="248"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>By the power of Skullkeep!<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The backstory for <i>Skullkeep</i> has nothing to do with the original <i>Dungeon Master</i>. I&#39;m not even sure they&#39;re set in the same world, which here is called Zalk. Skullkeep is a long-abandoned fortress on a remote island, rumored to hold the remains of some kind of machine called the Zo Link. A young warrior named Torham Zed has been sent to the island by his uncle, Mylius, who serves on some kind of governing body called the World Council. Torham discovers that evil is stirring in Skullkeep. Weird, evil little orbs keep teleporting into the world &#34;from the Void&#34; and then flying directly into the castle.</p><p>Torham meets an old woman who initially mistakes him for Mylius. Just before one of the orbs kills her, she talks about someone trying to &#34;cross the Void&#34; and enter the world, and she begs Torham to put the machine back together, use it to somehow cross the Void himself, and &#34;attack him there before he attacks us here!&#34; Torham&#39;s problem is that Skullkeep is sealed with a lock that requires four keys, and no one knows where the keys are.<br/></p><p>As far as I can tell, nothing has changed when it comes to <i>Dungeon Master</i>&#39;s character classes and methods of character development. Every character is some mix of fighter, ninja, wizard, and priest, with their strengths indicated by ordinal levels in each of those classes. The first four levels are, in order, neophyte, novice, apprentice, and journeyman. As with the original, you don&#39;t create characters but choose them. Torham himself is a non-negotiable member of the party. He is a fighter first (apprentice), priest and wizard second (novice), and a ninja last (neophyte). He begins with a dagger, leather armor (jerkin, pants, and boots), a canteen, three gold coins, a silver coin, and a gem.<br/></p><p>Gameplay opens with Torham in what the manual calls the &#34;Hall of Champions,&#34; but which just looks like a bunch of caves. There, Torham can walk up to a variety of what looks like cryo-stasis machines and view the inventories and statistics of the occupants. (This sequel, in both the backstory and in-game graphics, seems to suggest a greater fusion of fantasy and science-fiction than its predecessor; there were times during the opening hour that it reminded me of <i>Perihelion</i>.) There are 15 potential champions to choose from, each with different stats (strength, dexterity, wisdom, vitality, anti-magic, and anti-fire, plus maximum health, stamina, and mana), levels, and inventories.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqfxcacpzgj7bzxI3k9IeqolV7EXFb6u1qadysomQKtMLHi_G-RnTnDFROz2dj5BQULg9TB7j0GSUO6VHw9qVtQysuTTG5uHQj5WTW7HCpHScZfVGerm5fu5vTWkXgPhoJRsxmLymVdHSnHYnFNPjCm2OXXdoPoGzWRa8oMg_fjMr07MIqE9kYac2G/s320/skull_000.png"><img data-original-height="200" data-original-width="320" height="250" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqfxcacpzgj7bzxI3k9IeqolV7EXFb6u1qadysomQKtMLHi_G-RnTnDFROz2dj5BQULg9TB7j0GSUO6VHw9qVtQysuTTG5uHQj5WTW7HCpHScZfVGerm5fu5vTWkXgPhoJRsxmLymVdHSnHYnFNPjCm2OXXdoPoGzWRa8oMg_fjMr07MIqE9kYac2G/w400-h250/skull_000.png" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>I&#39;m not looking at that face for dozens of hours.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table>       <br/></div><p>The champions don&#39;t have explicit races.

Bane Blade Cleaver is some kind of goblin. I have no idea what Cletus is--a monster with facial horns and a third eye or gem in the middle of his head. Anders Light Wielder has pointy ears. <br/></p><p>I went with Cletus (primarily a fighter), Seri Flamehair (primarily a priest), and Saros Shadow Follower (primarily a wizard). You can rename all the heroes, including Torham, once they&#39;re in the party, although I didn&#39;t.

Unfortunately, this extends to the use of the keyboard, which again offers nothing except movement and the use of number keys to see character portraits. The only major change is the fusing of the attack, formation, and spellcasting elements into a single complex panel. Apparently influenced by <i>Eye of the Beholder</i>, the panel now depicts hands when the character is unarmed and the regular weapon icon when armed. You can dual-wield, which I don&#39;t think was possible in the original. More on magic and combat later.</p><p>The inventory screen is entirely unchanged. Almost immediately, I get annoyed by the inventory system all over again. Saros has a &#34;Cloak of Night.&#34; What does that mean? Cletus has an &#34;Illumulet.&#34; Does that provide light? Nothing seems to change if I take it off. Then again, I remind myself, I probably would have had the same objections to <i>Eye of the Beholder</i> except that I&#39;m more familiar, from other games, with what standard  <i>D&amp;D</i> magical items do. </p><p>One minor change is that a sound option has been added to the inventory screen, with the ability to adjust the volume of sound effects and music independently. This is one element that makes the game feel more like it exists in its port year of 1995. By 1993, not only do few games offer the ability to mute music without muting sound, hardly any game has volume settings for either. Being able to lower the music volume without muting it means I&#39;m less likely to turn it off completely. In the caves, the music was unobjectionable anyway--more atmospheric than melodic (again, I can&#39;t help but compare it to <i>Perihelion</i>, although I realize there&#39;s little chance of any direct influence). This changed on the next level, with a highly repetitive and annoying (to me) melody, and the music went off. I&#39;ll periodically give it a try in later areas.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdf9uPfP8uE1MU-aETABIdfC9fRA6bzXJ6QjRFVLBCW3s-fAFL1Vo6ChFPo-Mx0cHkjpgEHkzf6pIwhj1NPQxtyr-gkHMLtKHIb_p4SFWA2WjBI7gnt4Ghm1wbll0oxUivQAa5sD4fUJj5ofN3srAe4IyiWJJmR9xB4N6sWYCXDf5xuQcBa0whFTFS/s320/skull_009.png"><img data-original-height="200" data-original-width="320" height="250" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdf9uPfP8uE1MU-aETABIdfC9fRA6bzXJ6QjRFVLBCW3s-fAFL1Vo6ChFPo-Mx0cHkjpgEHkzf6pIwhj1NPQxtyr-gkHMLtKHIb_p4SFWA2WjBI7gnt4Ghm1wbll0oxUivQAa5sD4fUJj5ofN3srAe4IyiWJJmR9xB4N6sWYCXDf5xuQcBa0whFTFS/w400-h250/skull_009.png" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>I had a lot of paragraphs with no images in between, so here&#39;s a shot of a window where you can click on the curtains to open and close them.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As I move around, I notice an unwelcome interface element. Perhaps in a nod to the growing influence of continuous-movement games, <i>Skullkeep</i> introduces a half-step when you move forward. You don&#39;t have to hit the forward key twice or anything; the game just automatically moves you half a square, then half a square again. I find it as awkward as the transitions used in <i>Lands of Lore</i>, but at least there you could turn it off. The stuttering is not there if you strafe. I find myself wondering if this is going to affect the famous combat waltz.</p><p>The Cave of Champions is a small 5 x 8, so I don&#39;t bother to map it. I had an entire paragraph here where I noted that the lack of an automap, while not particularly bothersome to me, was unusual for 1993 and particularly for 1995. Then I discovered the game does have a map of your surroundings, in the form of a &#34;magic map&#34; that you find on the next level. I do enjoy mapping, but I&#39;ve also just come off a few long games that required it extensively (not to mention the aborted <i>Tygus Horx</i>), so I might see how far I can get without mapping, at least for the introductory areas.<br/></p>        </div>

It was published via a disk attached to a 1990 issue of <i>64&#39;</i>er magazine.

There are no monster graphics. Even though you start with no weapons and armor, survival in the early game is far easier than in <i>The Bard&#39;s Tale</i>, which is good because the encounter frequency is heavy. Escaping combat works about 95% of the time, so you can select your battles. The enemies themselves are just easier. Finally, your party always acts first in combat, always in reverse order of the roster. As in classic Interplay-style combat, you specify an action for each character and watch as the actions execute in a slow scroll.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxKnVOoWSTHVeeI8OQDtb4QeJJjOFLmBMmh3mOy7MPos4is8S4E_I1ur4fB0nMJ70FUtakAEemXkrqmyEWGbkqlBumb6CoimvAe4mBWgpE8AHjucuOCPXfwnejASJuB5WJXS0XvzJNmMjgMWpeH64MUVzS_w3GxdmKn125nt2IPuHCoKgmJePZk0vT/s668/thcombat.PNG"><img data-original-height="402" data-original-width="668" height="241" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxKnVOoWSTHVeeI8OQDtb4QeJJjOFLmBMmh3mOy7MPos4is8S4E_I1ur4fB0nMJ70FUtakAEemXkrqmyEWGbkqlBumb6CoimvAe4mBWgpE8AHjucuOCPXfwnejASJuB5WJXS0XvzJNmMjgMWpeH64MUVzS_w3GxdmKn125nt2IPuHCoKgmJePZk0vT/w400-h241/thcombat.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Watching the combat messages scroll by.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are six spell levels per spellcasting class.

COFL (&#34;Conjuror&#39;s Flame&#34;) and BOFI (&#34;Bolan&#39;s Fire&#34;) are first-level conjuror spells, while the first-level mage gets TEPL (&#34;Tell Place,&#34; a locate spell), HEPO (&#34;Help Power&#34;), and ORHL (&#34;Orla&#39;s Healing Power&#34;). There is no equivalent of &#34;Trap Zap&#34; because the game has no traps, making the rogue a weird inclusion. There are no summoning spells.</p><p>At the end of combat, you find gold and occasionally items. Slowly, you build experience and an inventory of weapons and armor. There are some oddities here.

Although it was originally released only in Japan, I checked to see if anyone had made an English translation, and it turns out that it did. (There isn&#39;t much text in the game anyway.) In fact, it was translated as early as 1998 by an outfit calling itself J2E Translations; they don&#39;t seem to have been active since 2004. When I saw how long it was going to take, I nearly dumped it, but I unexpectedly found myself enjoying it. I dipped into it once or twice a week over the summer and just recently managed to finish it. It was a decent contrast to the other games on my plate this summer.</p><p>The game is based on a 1990-1991 Japanese animated television series of the same name, translated for English release as <i>Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water. </i>This is the name that the translators chose for the game&#39;s title screen, but I understand the Japanese title means something closer to <i>Nadia of the Mysterious Seas</i>. In any event, the show is set in the late 1800s and draws themes and characters from Jules Verne&#39;s <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>. (I got a copy of the book when I was eight, but it took me nearly another 40 years to realize that the 20,000 leagues are how far the <i>Nautilus</i> traveled, not how deep it traveled.) The 14-year-old heroine has a secret past and carries a mysterious jewel called the Blue Water. She and her inventor friend, Jean, hook up with Captain Nemo and an assortment of other characters to battle a warlord named Gargoyle, who seeks to restore the dominance of Atlantis.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgL6-aCc7ksMOfpFqSZ11sN0dNOMrf9kHAFOT7DoFvIWoIcICk6UDZ3Hz5R9MQN8uLU3lkrJR7gXBd6AHE0ub30hHcGrKeXuHC5AFPODFt11AYsVH61kEvCrBOCBACw5RzGCjThq3QBSwiByfdrh_kGXckpdb2MI-Ew2kFMtRM60lZ6ETfXYOvrKWjU/s359/nadiaanime.jpg"><img data-original-height="359" data-original-width="323" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgL6-aCc7ksMOfpFqSZ11sN0dNOMrf9kHAFOT7DoFvIWoIcICk6UDZ3Hz5R9MQN8uLU3lkrJR7gXBd6AHE0ub30hHcGrKeXuHC5AFPODFt11AYsVH61kEvCrBOCBACw5RzGCjThq3QBSwiByfdrh_kGXckpdb2MI-Ew2kFMtRM60lZ6ETfXYOvrKWjU/w360-h400/nadiaanime.jpg" width="360"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>A promotional image for the show.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>There were adventure games of the same name released for the SEGA Genesis and Japanese PCs around the same time, but those don&#39;t have anything to do with this <i>Nadia. </i>Frankly, the game has as much to do with the show as C3P0&#39;s cereal had with <i>Star Wars</i>.
 Characters drawn from the show face off across a variety of different 
landscapes, but they could have easily been swapped with different icons
 and names to draw from a different framing story. In fact, given the quick turnaround time (the series ended the same year this game was published), I have to wonder if the game wasn&#39;t originally developed as a non-licensed title, with some last-minute text and icon swapping.<br/></p><p>Without any introduction, the player is given a list of 50 scenarios, organized into 10 groups: Streets of Paris, Stone Circle, Gargoyle Castle, Bunglegun Soil, Warehouse, Pipe-Line, Ocean Floor, Antarctic, Cave, and Temple. Each one has a slightly different map, but the goal is always the same: move at least one of your characters across the map and engage and kill the emperor before the Neo-Atlantean forces engage and kill Nadia on your side. If you have two controllers, you can have a second player control the Atlanteans. The names of both allies and enemies are drawn from the show. Allied characters include Nadia, Jean, Nemo, Grandis, Electra, a lion named King, a whale, and the <i>Nautilus</i> itself. Enemies include Gargoyle, Garfish, Canrobot, a tank, and (for some reason) the Tower of Babel. I don&#39;t know if their various strengths and skills have any basis in the show.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjh78KWIgVho71CLCIui0dvbYlw7qXZWXMShrvnHTr0D_t2kh3NYzyj89-LMh-QaYfZVyM4v3mifkbuBe6_aZFXCKVQILwz5iaAZHgiS9yBHgA7vQ0uDwTBSAkHzthQz1FOgi0jNaR94LulQ7gWvEn5mMw3QmHFEBjBXWgoShoZYS5u3bAWtSTlQVTQ/s581/funoptions.PNG"><img data-original-height="443" data-original-width="581" height="305" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjh78KWIgVho71CLCIui0dvbYlw7qXZWXMShrvnHTr0D_t2kh3NYzyj89-LMh-QaYfZVyM4v3mifkbuBe6_aZFXCKVQILwz5iaAZHgiS9yBHgA7vQ0uDwTBSAkHzthQz1FOgi0jNaR94LulQ7gWvEn5mMw3QmHFEBjBXWgoShoZYS5u3bAWtSTlQVTQ/w400-h305/funoptions.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Considering my options on one of the &#34;Antarctic&#34; maps.

Each round, you can move only one character. Each character is capable of different movement paths and distances. Some can move one or two squares in any direction (assuming there are no obstacles); others can move all the way across the map, but only straight across a row, or only diagonally. The emperor, taking the role of the king in chess, is usually somewhat protected, and you have to maneuver your pieces in such a way that you can reach him. There are no automatic captures as in chess; every engagement between pieces results in an RPG-like combat on a separate screen. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXDra4AXqBf_Iq5F9KQBx6Fpz4GbCgnDM7LLuSxR9-DTRuAQ7c0QgJMBr1lO-_xYQC5NixFkCK1oIkN1YuXBzMc1tUt_YH5U6n7yNPjD49tellQEdPrGgjosdvN2q55crmtdgWjwBb61iyrFvwcL3nLA9lxv81zDGdRFXg4-OBOezTRL72XWDfMRUn/s582/funchess.PNG"><img data-original-height="369" data-original-width="582" height="254" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXDra4AXqBf_Iq5F9KQBx6Fpz4GbCgnDM7LLuSxR9-DTRuAQ7c0QgJMBr1lO-_xYQC5NixFkCK1oIkN1YuXBzMc1tUt_YH5U6n7yNPjD49tellQEdPrGgjosdvN2q55crmtdgWjwBb61iyrFvwcL3nLA9lxv81zDGdRFXg4-OBOezTRL72XWDfMRUn/w400-h254/funchess.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>This character can move as far as he wants, but only in his existing row or column.

If you end a round adjacent to two enemies, you fight both of them. One good way to protect Nadia is to ensure that she can&#39;t be approached without engaging at least one other character at the same time. Since you can only move one character at a time, you can never offensively attack with more than one character. <br/></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjVzVuu3Gnw8tEq8nIS3Wg7wCZ1anEVSR4pN98z4WpOn_p8jWHTLRszsjGBkoiM1wo8vx9h0s8xGRcb7uLkVrFx7ys8HZU-keDRLmjhtEXHVEVufZbSqvnBkwCKfo9eDO1Fg3oUVeMDAJa6xnbrI0-M58_ptWnWIo--4zGnTI7oexAWMHZljaZpadW7/s564/funcombat1.PNG"><img data-original-height="426" data-original-width="564" height="303" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjVzVuu3Gnw8tEq8nIS3Wg7wCZ1anEVSR4pN98z4WpOn_p8jWHTLRszsjGBkoiM1wo8vx9h0s8xGRcb7uLkVrFx7ys8HZU-keDRLmjhtEXHVEVufZbSqvnBkwCKfo9eDO1Fg3oUVeMDAJa6xnbrI0-M58_ptWnWIo--4zGnTI7oexAWMHZljaZpadW7/w400-h303/funcombat1.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>On the combat screen, Captain Nemo attacks a tank.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are other RPG elements.

Most are used in the combat screen, but some, like a long-distance ranged attack called &#34;Long,&#34; can be used on the main screen in lieu of engaging someone in combat. And while you move around the map, useful objects pop up at random, inviting you to grab them to gain an edge in combat.

After I got some experience, I realized that the enemy AI is so poor that you don&#39;t really have to play the game the way it&#39;s clearly intended. (Obviously, that wouldn&#39;t be true with a skilled second player.) The enemy fails to take obvious chances to kill Nadia and doesn&#39;t do a very good job protecting his emperor. Thus, you&#39;re encouraged to build up only one or two characters and just send those powerful allies directly across the map to the emperor, leaving the rest behind to do nothing, rather like decimating a chess opponent by playing nothing but your queen. You occasionally lose this way--there&#39;s a lot of randomness in combat--but losing just means you have to play the scenario again. I found that I rarely died. Most characters level up after every couple of combats, which completely restores hit points and magic points. You don&#39;t have to conserve your resources when you know you&#39;re getting them all back every two or three combats.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyrfHVUWwhTBrjyHKD3lYblQTrp63_GpyAa5HY2QutCWkvxNBi5uaeI9RXwF9USB_eJ9PSblvrF81CkA4-Y9VfnKbz2KAul_65icvCfhh1QdRuinhDLdSyLt2p_973imZgDO9IryS70CTSDnB_OFOOBs6LUUX4dq9qXAhbFkHXPI8a5bQisb7QMyOR/s583/funlong.PNG"><img data-original-height="450" data-original-width="583" height="309" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyrfHVUWwhTBrjyHKD3lYblQTrp63_GpyAa5HY2QutCWkvxNBi5uaeI9RXwF9USB_eJ9PSblvrF81CkA4-Y9VfnKbz2KAul_65icvCfhh1QdRuinhDLdSyLt2p_973imZgDO9IryS70CTSDnB_OFOOBs6LUUX4dq9qXAhbFkHXPI8a5bQisb7QMyOR/w400-h309/funlong.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>The enemy uses a &#34;Long&#34; spell to lob a cannonball at one of my characters. It&#39;s one of the few ways you can attack from the main screen instead of the combat screen.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>One thing I liked about the game is how tactics continually evolve. In the early levels, strength is paramount. No one has enough spell points to use magic more than once or twice per scenario. Items like &#34;Boosters&#34; (despite the name, they&#39;re an offensive weapon) and shotguns are so much more powerful than your own attacks that you run around the map collecting them. &#34;Boxes,&#34; which restore magic points, are worth their weight in gold.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYTOnx8tM0EeGFhUUIZ0j8gwwLDSDH-XUMyTUBk9JGMeDfMcPwZ31O-qHPMqq6c4k18PCk2W5Mpz2F_wPMv-hn7e5WXvewwP87FsfnIcQICk8Za4QOtRrQ9lZtzkCsW1QkMyPBRmkIinDDeQxHjCC20l5AyJqgej8dg60_PjBzFVJHJL67puPr4PgK/s584/funchetwins.PNG"><img data-original-height="448" data-original-width="584" height="306" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYTOnx8tM0EeGFhUUIZ0j8gwwLDSDH-XUMyTUBk9JGMeDfMcPwZ31O-qHPMqq6c4k18PCk2W5Mpz2F_wPMv-hn7e5WXvewwP87FsfnIcQICk8Za4QOtRrQ9lZtzkCsW1QkMyPBRmkIinDDeQxHjCC20l5AyJqgej8dg60_PjBzFVJHJL67puPr4PgK/w400-h306/funchetwins.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>I win a scenario!<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the late game, physical attacks are nothing. Spells like &#34;Freeze,&#34; &#34;Charm&#34; (which just stuns), and of course &#34;Heal&#34; are vital. There are a lot of offensive spells like &#34;Throw&#34; and &#34;Long&#34; that do massive amounts of damage but also have a high chance of failing. Adding to the mix, you don&#39;t exactly &#34;take turns&#34; in combat; sometimes, you or the enemy gets two, three, or even four moves in a row. You can never tell, so you have to plan for the worst and hope for the best.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGVGt0CNfxQ3evHO-vYMIZWkhyiXUBtRdWfcazyVe6aCZTrcAGcgWUX-6HTw_aZeo6wFf6zHCi3k5JCtOhKeSr74I0vMBbEKsvNz2g8Jj6dxteJt2-UF99epms0_ySfitWyQ2_-wzIkEjQ1lwuPAtCqFqJHNRmFEUq1uHbnqQ87Sfmv2uVwTt80BXV/s566/funtwofoes.PNG"><img data-original-height="436" data-original-width="566" height="309" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGVGt0CNfxQ3evHO-vYMIZWkhyiXUBtRdWfcazyVe6aCZTrcAGcgWUX-6HTw_aZeo6wFf6zHCi3k5JCtOhKeSr74I0vMBbEKsvNz2g8Jj6dxteJt2-UF99epms0_ySfitWyQ2_-wzIkEjQ1lwuPAtCqFqJHNRmFEUq1uHbnqQ87Sfmv2uVwTt80BXV/w400-h309/funtwofoes.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>If this spell works, I should be able to kill the emperor in one hit.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Fifty is a lot of scenarios, and at higher levels, they get particularly tedious since almost every character (enemies included) has healing spells. There&#39;s nothing more frustrating than whittling 500 hit points away from your enemy only to watch him restore 300 of them with 10 magic points--and he still has another 250 magic points to go. Having more hit points also gives enemies more time to decide to flee, at which point they appear in some random part of the map. When the emperor does this after you&#39;ve spent 20 minutes trying to reach him, it&#39;s maddening.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPhVnzORPDxvJ_YILS7mnYzjoWjI3t8Au5BPnGqzhCGvvQwXSCc0mw_BItAQBTQXJ5zrTi0P4Y360OW9ExmGHY_-2yrHEFKpBTSpQNhQa8vo-PHZtsVuJumYFLqT82sg-OuEdl00IDRfsNout-N2SkZuWLRNofaV6P8lqAp5L2QLRp5ZZ31cSx_q5o/s572/funshutup.PNG"><img data-original-height="362" data-original-width="572" height="254" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPhVnzORPDxvJ_YILS7mnYzjoWjI3t8Au5BPnGqzhCGvvQwXSCc0mw_BItAQBTQXJ5zrTi0P4Y360OW9ExmGHY_-2yrHEFKpBTSpQNhQa8vo-PHZtsVuJumYFLqT82sg-OuEdl00IDRfsNout-N2SkZuWLRNofaV6P8lqAp5L2QLRp5ZZ31cSx_q5o/w400-h254/funshutup.PNG" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>An enemy casts a &#34;Silence&#34; spell on my whale.<br/></i></td></tr></tbody></table>      <br/></div><p>Still, I enjoyed the scenarios overall, in limited duration.

I thought maybe the game was just about the individual scenarios. I skipped some of them and replayed others.

I have written and deleted a couple thousand words on the subject; I keep finding holes in my logic. I suppose I ought not to write anything at all about chess, which I don&#39;t like and am horrible at. (I&#39;ve never known which of these is the <i>x</i> variable and which is the <i>y</i>.) Suffice to say, it seems to me that a game in which you move only one piece per turn is fundamentally different from a game in which all units can act per turn, but every time I try to articulate the consequences of this distinction, I get lost in a morass. Maybe some of you can point me to existing writings on the subject or offer your own thoughts.<br/></p><p>For now, I&#39;ll just say that <i>because</i> I suck at chess, I&#39;m always envisioning ways to change the rules more to my liking, such as introducing dice--rolling to capture another piece instead of the capture happening automatically. Or giving each player a list of &#34;spells&#34; they can apply at their discretion, once per game, like a spell that lets a particular piece double its movement, or a spell that resurrects a lost piece. <i>Nadia</i> basically represents these ideas come to life. It turns out what I&#39;ve always wanted from chess is to make it more like an RPG. How astonishing.<br/></p></div>
