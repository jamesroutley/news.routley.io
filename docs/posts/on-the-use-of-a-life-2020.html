In a recent discussion on
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, a commenter posted
the following question:
</p><blockquote>
Okay, so, what do we think about TarSnap? Dude was obviously a genius, and
spent his time on backups instead of solving millennium problems. I say
that with the greatest respect. Is this entrepreneurship thing a trap?
</blockquote><p>
I considered replying in the thread, but I think it deserves an in-depth
answer — and one which will be seen by more people than would notice
a reply in the middle of a 100+ comment thread.
</p><p>
First, to dispense with the philosophical argument: Yes, this is my life,
and yes, I&#39;m free to use — or waste — it however I please; but
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with asking if this is how my time
could be best spent.  That applies doubly if the question is not merely
about the choices I made but is rather a broader question: Is our society
structured in a way which encourages people to make less than the greatest
contribution they could?
</p><p>
That said, I do object somewhat to the premise of the question —
specifically the statement that I &#34;spent [my] time on backups&#34;.
</p><p>
On one hand, it is true:
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a>
has been my full time job since 2006.  I
do occasional consulting — more in the early years than I have
recently — but financially speaking that&#39;s a rounding error; it&#39;s
Tarsnap which pays the bills (including allowing me to buy the house which
I&#39;ll be moving into next week).  On the other hand: My work on Tarsnap has
extended considerably into adjacent fields.
</p><p>
In 2009, having had many users ask for passphrase-protected Tarsnap key
files, and having determined that the current state of the art of password
based key derivation was sorely lacking, I invented
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html">scrypt</a> — and in the
process, opened up a whole new field of cryptography.  Sure, I was doing
this because it was something I could do to make Tarsnap more secure; but
it would be a stretch to place this under the umbrella of &#34;spending my
time working on backups&#34;.
</p><p>
In 2011, wanting to connect daemons on disparate hosts together securely,
and not being happy with the existing TLS-based options, I wrote
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/spiped.html">spiped</a>.  While I think
it remains largely underappreciated by the world at large, I nonetheless
consider it a significant contribution to computer security — and,
like scrypt, while I created it to serve Tarsnap&#39;s needs, it would be a
stretch to place such a general-purpose open-source tool under the narrow
umbrella of &#34;working on backups&#34;.
</p><p>
Around the same time, I started working on
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/kivaloo.html">kivaloo</a>, my high
performance key-value data store.  This may be the least used of all of
the software I&#39;ve written — I&#39;m not aware of anyone else using it
at present (although being open source software that doesn&#39;t necessarily
preclude the possibility) — but I consider it to be some of my best
code and I think it may become used in more niches than merely Tarsnap in
the future.
</p><p>
Starting in 2006, and accelerating significantly after Amazon launched the
&#34;M3&#34; family of HVM-enabled EC2 instances in 2012,
<a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2018-02-12-FreeBSD-EC2-history.html">I&#39;ve
been creating and maintaining the FreeBSD/EC2 platform</a>.  While I don&#39;t have
any precise statistics on its usage, a survey last year found that
<a href="https://twitter.com/cperciva/status/1129018019689246722">44% of people
running FreeBSD in the cloud use Amazon EC2</a>; so — despite the fact that
only 22 people currently
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cperciva">provide sponsorship for my efforts</a>
— it&#39;s clear that my work here has been productive.  Again, while I was
working on this because I wanted to run FreeBSD in EC2 for Tarsnap, I don&#39;t
think it can be placed entirely into the category of &#34;working on backups&#34;.
</p><p>
Of course, the question at hand isn&#39;t whether I&#39;ve done anything useful, but
rather whether this was the <em>most</em> useful way I could have spent these
years.  Judging by the reference to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">Millennium
Problems</a>, I imagine that the specific alternative they had in mind was a
research career; indeed, between my Undergraduate studies in number theory
under the late Peter Borwein and my Doctoral studies in Oxford I might have
considered seriously working on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture">Birch
and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture</a> had my life taken a different path.  (A very
different BSD from the one with which I am currently involved!)
</p><p>
So why am I not an academic?  There are many factors, and starting Tarsnap is
certainly one; but most of them can be summarized as &#34;academia is a lousy
place to do novel research&#34;.  In 2005, I made the first publication of the use
of shared caches in multi-threaded CPUs as a cryptographic side channel, and
in 2006 I hoped to continue that work.  Having recently received my doctorate
from Oxford University and returned home to Canada, I was eligible for a
post-doctoral fellowship from Canada&#39;s
<a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">National Sciences and Engineering
Research Council</a>, so I applied, and... I didn&#39;t get it.  My supervisor
cautioned me of the risks of doing work which was overly novel as a young
academic: Committees don&#39;t know what to make of you, and they don&#39;t have any
reputational prior to fall back upon.  Indeed, I ran into this issue with my
side channel attack: Reviewers at the Journal of Cryptology didn&#39;t understand
why they were being asked to read a paper about CPU design, while reviewers
at a computer hardware journal didn&#39;t understand why they were being asked
to read about cryptography.  It became clear, both from my own experiences
and from advice I received, that if I wanted to succeed in academia I would
need to churn out incremental research papers every year — at very least
until I had tenure.
</p><p>
In many ways, starting my own company has given me the sort of freedom which
academics aspire to.  Sure, I have customers to assist, servers to manage (not
that they need much management), and business accounting to do; but professors
equally have classes to teach, students to supervise, and committees to
attend.  When it comes to research, I can follow my interests without
regard to the whims of granting agencies and tenure and promotion committees:
I can do work like scrypt, which is now widely known but languished in
obscurity for several years after I published it; and equally I can do work
like kivaloo, which has been essentially ignored for close to a decade, with
no sign of that ever changing.
</p><p>
Is there a hypothetical world where I would be an academic working on the
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture right now?  Sure.  It&#39;s probably a world
where high-flying students are given, upon graduation, some sort of
&#34;mini-Genius Grant&#34;.  If I had been awarded a five-year $62,500/year grant
with the sole condition of &#34;do research&#34;, I would almost certainly have
persevered in academia and — despite working on the more interesting
but longer-term questions — have had enough publications after those
five years to obtain a continuing academic position.  But that&#39;s not how
granting agencies work; they give out one or two year awards, with the
understanding that those who are successful will apply for more funding
later.
</p><p>
In short, academic institutions systemically promote exactly the sort
of short-term optimization of which, ironically, the private sector is
often accused.  Is entrepreneurship a trap?  No; right now, it&#39;s one of
the only ways to avoid being trapped.
