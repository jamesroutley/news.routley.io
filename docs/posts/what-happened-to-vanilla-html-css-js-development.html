    <h1>Ask HN: What happened to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS development?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I&#39;m not a web developer, but I dabble in it because I find it interesting. I went through some courses like The Odin Project and others to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, and I thought it made a lot of sense: HTML structures the page, CSS handles the style, and JS handles the functionality.<p>However, after working for software companies for a few years, it seems like almost nobody uses these technologies in the way they&#39;re presented on websites like w3schools to make web applications. Instead, they use component-based frameworks like React. To me, these frameworks seem way more complicated than HTML/CSS/JS, and I don&#39;t understand what problem they&#39;re trying to solve. What makes the trade-off of all that extra complexity and abstraction worth it? Aren&#39;t HTML/CSS/JS perfectly fine and time-tested tools for web development on their own?</p></div></div>
