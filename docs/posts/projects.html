<p>Didn’t intend to make this when I was thinking of recurse projects, but three days in drowning in and struggling express so many ideas, it seemed crucial! I originally intended to build it from scratch with Next.js, but after some very good advice from my brother <a href="https://noahlk.medium.com/">Noah<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>realized there were many, many easier ways.

<p>This could be a lot of things, but hopefully all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An online multiplayer setup for multiple open worlds</li>
<li>A persistent ecosystem that can be explored <em>on</em> those worlds and exists with our without player involvement</li>
</ul>

<p>An input device that is worn as a glove and allows the user to output a different signal for every pad of their finger by pressing their thumb against it. This signal can be augmented with the angle of the hand, detected by an accelerometer/gyroscope sensor, and feedback to the user (like that a signal was created as desired) can be provided using small haptic feedback motors.</p></article><hr/></div></div></div>
