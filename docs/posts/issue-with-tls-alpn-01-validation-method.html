    <h1>Issue with TLS-ALPN-01 Validation Method</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>At 16:48 UTC on Tuesday Jan 25, 2022, a third party informed Let’s Encrypt / ISRG that, while examining the Boulder codebase, they had noticed two irregularities in our implementation of the “TLS Using ALPN” validation method (BRs 3.2.2.4.20, RFC 8737). As a result, we have made <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/changes-to-tls-alpn-01-challenge-validation/170427">two changes</a> to the way that our TLS-ALPN-01 challenge validation works.</p>
<p>All active certificates that were issued and validated with the TLS-ALPN-01 challenge before 00:48 UTC on 26 January 2022 when our fix was deployed are considered mis-issued. In compliance with the Let’s Encrypt CP, we have 5-days to revoke and will begin to revoke certificates at 16:00 UTC on 28 January 2022. We estimate &lt;1% of active certificates are affected. Subscribers affected by revocations will receive e-mail notifications if their ACME account contains a valid e-mail address. If you are affected by this revocation and need help renewing your certificate please ask questions in this <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/questions-about-renewing-before-tls-alpn-01-revocations/170449">thread</a></p>
<p>We will be providing more details about this incident in the next few days.</p>
