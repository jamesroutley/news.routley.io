                            <h3>The key is Automation</h3>
                            <p>Isn’t it sad to have a lot of data and not use it because it’s too much work? Thanks to MISP you can store your IOCs in a structured manner, and thus enjoy the correlation, automated exports for IDS, or SIEM, in STIX or OpenIOC and synchronize to other MISPs. You can now leverage the value of your data without effort and in an automated manner. <a href="https://www.misp-project.org/features">Check out MISP features</a>.</p>

                            <h3>Simply Threats</h3>
                            <p>The primary goal of MISP is to be used. This is why simplicity is the driving force behind the project. Storing and especially using information about threats and malware should not be difficult. MISP is there to help you <a href="https://www.misp-project.org/features">get the maximum out</a> of your data without unmanageable complexity.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>By giving you will receive</h3>
                            <p>Sharing is key to fast and effective detection of attacks. Quite often similar organizations are targeted by the same Threat Actor, in the same or different Campaign. MISP will make it easier for you to share with, but also to receive from trusted partners and trust-groups. Sharing also enabled collaborative analysis and prevents you from doing the work someone else already did before.</p>

                            <h3>Visualization</h3>
                            <p>Having access to a large amount of Threat information through MISP Threat Sharing communities gives you outstanding opportunities to aggregate this information and take the process of trying to understand how all this data fits together telling a broader story to the next level. We are transforming technical data or indicators of compromise (IOCs) into cyber threat intelligence. MISP comes with many visualization options helping analysts find the answers they are looking for.</p>

                <p>
                  The MISP Threat Sharing project consists of multiple initiatives, from software to facilitate threat analysis and sharing to freely usable structured Cyber Threat Information and Taxonomies.

                            <p>The MISP is an open source software solution for collecting, storing, distributing and sharing cyber security indicators and threats about cyber security incidents analysis and malware analysis. MISP is designed by and for incident analysts, security and ICT professionals or malware reversers to support their day-to-day operations to share structured information efficiently.</p>
