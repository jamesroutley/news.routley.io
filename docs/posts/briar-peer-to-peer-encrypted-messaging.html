    <h1>Briar: Peer-to-Peer Encrypted Messaging</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"> <div id="container">

<p>Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone
else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike
traditional messaging apps, Briar doesn’t rely on a central server -
messages are synchronized directly between the users’ devices. If the
internet’s down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the
information flowing in a crisis. If the internet’s up, Briar can sync
via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from
surveillance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://briarproject.org/quick-start">quick start guide</a> and
the <a href="https://briarproject.org/manual">manual</a> describe how to use Briar
and the features that are available.</p>
<p>Technical details are available on
the <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar/wikis">wiki</a>
and explained in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKuljekMzTc">video</a>.</p>

<p>Briar provides private messaging, public forums and blogs that are
protected against the following surveillance and censorship threats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metadata surveillance.</strong> Briar uses the Tor network to prevent
eavesdroppers from learning which users are talking to each other.
Each user’s contact list is encrypted and stored on her own device.</li>
<li><strong>Content surveillance.</strong> All communication between devices is
encrypted end-to-end, protecting the content from eavesdropping
or tampering.</li>
<li><strong>Content filtering.</strong> Briar’s end-to-end encryption prevents
keyword filtering, and because of its decentralized design there are
no servers to block.</li>
<li><strong>Takedown orders.</strong> Every user who subscribes to a forum keeps a
copy of its content, so there’s no single point where a post can
be deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of service attacks.</strong> Briar’s forums have no central server
to attack, and every subscriber has access to the content even if
they’re offline.</li>
<li><strong>Internet blackouts.</strong> Briar can operate over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
to keep information flowing during blackouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Briar is designed to resist surveillance and censorship by an adversary
with the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>All long-range communication channels (internet, phone network, etc)
are comprehensively monitored by the adversary.</li>
<li>The adversary can block, delay, replay and modify traffic on
long-range communication channels.</li>
<li>The adversary has a limited ability to monitor short-range
communication channels (Bluetooth, WiFi, etc).</li>
<li>The adversary has a limited ability to block, delay, replay and
modify traffic on short-range communication channels.</li>
<li>The adversary can deploy an unlimited number of devices
running Briar.</li>
<li>There are some users who can keep their devices secure - those who
can’t are considered, for the purposes of the threat model, to be
controlled by the adversary.</li>
<li>The adversary has a limited ability to persuade users to trust the
adversary’s agents - thus the number of social connections between
the adversary’s agents and the rest of the network is limited.</li>
<li>The adversary can’t break standard cryptographic primitives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our long-term plans go far beyond messaging: we’ll use Briar’s data
synchronization capabilities to support secure, distributed applications
including crisis mapping and collaborative document editing. Our goal is
to enable people in any country to create safe spaces where they can
debate any topic, plan events, and organise social movements.</p>
