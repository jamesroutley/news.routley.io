            <h2>Big Tech is harming EU consumers and businesses</h2>
            <p>Microsoft is integrating 365 deeper and deeper in their service and software portfolio, including Windows. OneDrive is pushed wherever users deal with file storage and Teams is a default part of Windows 11. This makes it nearly impossible to compete with their SaaS services. In the wider context, you see that over the last years, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have grown their market share to 66% of the total European market, with local providers contracting from 26% to 16%. Behavior like this is at the core of this growth of the tech giants and has to be stopped.</p>
            <p>This is a similar situation than in the late 90s when Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with Windows to compete with Netscape. This is not an incident. Other Big Tech firms like Google and Amazon are doing the same thing and the EU should take a stand.</p>
            <h2>Our demands</h2>
            <p>The companies in this coalition say: this behavior is harming the IT industry and is limiting customer choice. We want government to take action and force Microsoft to allow for a level playing field.</p>
            <p>We demand the EU ensures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No gate keeping (by bundling, pre-installing or pushing Microsoft services) for a level playing field.</li>
                <li>Open standards and interoperability that make an easy migration possible. This gives consumers a free choice.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Consumers should have a free choice and competition should have a fair chance!</strong></p>
            <h2>Anti-competitive behavior complaint</h2>
            <p>The European Directorate-General for Competition exists precisely for the purpose of preventing this kind of behavior and keeping the market competitive and equal for all players. In early 2021, <a href="https://nextcloud.com/about">Nextcloud GmbH</a> filed an official complaint with the EU Directorate-General for Competition about the behavior of Microsoft. Nextcloud has also filed a similar complaint with the German anti-trust authorities and we are working with our coalition members in France to file a complaint there.</p>

            <p>A quickly growing coalition of dozens of European SMB organizations support these efforts to push back to Big Tech and create a level playing field, supporting innovation and local businesses.</p>
