He <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/roaring-kitty-no-longer-has-financial-broker-license-filing-2021-03-02" target="_blank">no longer</a> works in marketing at insurer MassMutual.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The Massachusetts securities regulator is still probing Gill&#39;s activities around the Reddit rally, a spokeswoman said. But in April, a court dismissed a lawsuit alleging Gill violated securities laws by inciting the rally in GameStop and causing “huge losses” for investors.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Known as &#34;Roaring Kitty&#34; on YouTube and &#34;DeepF***ingValue&#34; on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msblc3/gme_yolo_update_apr_16_2021_final_update" target="_blank">Reddit&#39;s popular WallStreetBets</a> forum, Gill was a key figure in the so-called &#34;Reddit rally&#34; which saw shares of GameStop surge 1600% at one point in Jan. 2021.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The stock, which peaked at $482.95 a share when hedge funds that had shorted GameStop were forced to buy at any price, has come back to earth. But it is still at about $112 a share, compared to less than $20 on Jan. 1, 2021.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">With colorful YouTube streams and Reddit <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-roaringkitty/famed-gamestop-bull-roaring-kitty-is-a-massachusetts-financial-advisor-idUSKBN29Y0AF" target="_blank">posts touting</a> his GameStop positions, Gill made the bull case for GameStop, helping to attract a flood of retail cash into the beleaguered bricks-and-mortar retailer.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">The furious rally in GameStop and other &#34;memestocks&#34; burned hedge funds, rocked Wall Street and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-sec-is-cracking-down-equity-market-after-gamestop-saga-2022-01-27" target="_blank">drew scrutiny</a> from state and federal regulators. Gill and other traders and financial executives were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-testimony-reddit/gamestop-fan-roaring-kitty-to-tell-congress-i-like-the-stock-idUSKBN2AH2Y2" target="_blank">grilled</a> in the U.S. Congress.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Gill faded away almost as quickly as he shot to fame. His last posts on WallStreetBets via his ‘DeepF**ingValue’ handle and his Roaring Kitty YouTube stream were on April 16, 2021. The last tweet from his <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/with_replies" target="_blank">@TheRoaringKitty</a> handle, a video of a kitten, was on June 18, 2021.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">A public records search indicates Gill has no new business ventures. Gill did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">But in <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210218/111207/HHRG-117-BA00-Wstate-GillK-20210218.pdf" target="_blank">testimony</a> last year to Congress, he denied the notion that he used social media to profit by promoting GameStop to unwitting investors.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">&#34;I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks,&#34; he told lawmakers, adding his investment thesis focused purely on GameStop&#39;s fundamentals.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">&#34;We’ve learned just what someone like that can do to the market and to investors,&#34; said Joshua Mitts, an associate professor at Columbia Law School who has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-shorts-insight/short-distort-the-ugly-war-between-ceos-and-activist-critics-idUSKCN1R20AW" target="_blank">researched</a> the use of social media to influence stocks.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Mitts said the meme stock rally was driven by an unusual combination of factors: an army of new retail traders, easy money thanks to pandemic stimulus and low interest rates, and Gill&#39;s purportedly massive and consistent profits.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">Still, he said, it could happen again.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">“What I expect to see going forward is social media personalities making money by driving prices in one direction or another -- not necessarily in the magnitude that we had.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on whether it was probing, or ever had probed, Gill&#39;s actions.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses &amp; Singer, said it remained unclear whether Gill broke any laws. Yet he said his fanatical following among retail traders appeared to be based on &#34;tribal identity&#34; rather than economics, and was troubling.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">&#34;It might be too early to determine whether that was simply a fad that has now run its course, or whether it represents a fundamental alteration of market practice.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">Gill began sharing his positions on WallStreetBets in September 2019, posting a screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in GameStop. By late Jan. 2021, Gill was up over 4,000% on stock and options in the company, with his GameStop position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his posts.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">In his last April 16 post on WallStreetBets, Gill shared screen shots showing he had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/roaring-kitty-acquires-more-shares-gamestop-bloomberg-2021-04-17" target="_blank">exercised call</a> options on GameStop to acquire 50,000 more shares in the retailer, sparking thousands of comments lauding the punchy move.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">&#34;He made the history books,&#34; wrote one Reddit user with the handle zammai. &#34;Just retire a legend and go off grid.&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Michelle Price; additional reporting by Chris Prentice and Katanga Johnson; Editing by David Gregorio</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
