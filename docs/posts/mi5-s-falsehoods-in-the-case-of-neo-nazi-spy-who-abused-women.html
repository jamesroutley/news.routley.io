A panel of judges said they would consider the issue of contempt of court proceedings against individuals once that was complete.</p><p>Now we can detail how, over the past few months leading up to the judgment, MI5 continued to provide misleading evidence and tried to keep damning material secret.</p><p>The material gives an unprecedented insight into the internal chaos at MI5 as it responded to what has become a major crisis and test of its credibility.</p><p>At the heart of the case is the violent abuse of a woman by a state agent under MI5&#39;s control. After the BBC began investigating, MI5 attempted to cover its tracks - scattering a trail of false and misleading evidence.</p><p>The case started very simply: I was investigating a neo-Nazi, who I came to understand was also an abusive misogynist and MI5 agent.</p><p>After I contacted this man - known publicly as X - in 2020 to challenge him on his extremism, a senior MI5 officer called me up and tried to stop me running a story.</p><p>The officer said X had been working for MI5 and informing on extremists, and so it was wrong for me to say he was an extremist himself.</p><p>It was this disclosure, repeated in a series of phone calls, which the Security Service would later lie about to three courts as it attempted to keep X&#39;s role and identity shrouded in secrecy.</p><p>During the phone calls with me, MI5 denied information I had about X&#39;s violence, but I decided to spend more time investigating. What I learned was that X was a violent misogynist abuser with paedophilic tendencies who had used his MI5 role as a tool of coercion.</p><p>He had attacked his girlfriend - known publicly as &#34;Beth&#34; - with a machete, and abused an earlier partner, whose child he had threatened to kill. He even had cannibal fantasies about eating children.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16de/live/0661e360-ea4b-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Beth, pictured in a blurred silhouette against a high window, looking out onto tall buildings stretching into the distance on an overcast day"/></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Beth, who was terrorised and coerced by X, has called for a public apology from MI5</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>When I challenged both X and MI5 with our evidence, the government took me and the BBC to court in early 2022. They failed to stop the story but did win legal anonymity for X.</p><p>Arguing for secrecy in a succession of court proceedings, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its core policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) informants&#39; identities, including during conversations with me. Crucially, this stance allowed it to keep evidence secret from &#34;Beth&#34;, who had taken MI5 to court.</p><p>The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue - including a recording of one of the calls with a senior MI5 officer.</p><p>Finally accepting it had provided false evidence, MI5&#39;s director general Sir Ken McCallum said: &#34;We take our duty to provide truthful, accurate and complete information very seriously, and have offered an unreserved apology to the court.&#34;</p><p>Two investigations were commissioned: an internal MI5 disciplinary inquiry, and an external review by Sir Jonathan Jones KC, who was once the government&#39;s chief lawyer. This latter review was personally commissioned by the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and MI5&#39;s director general.</p><p>Both of these concluded that the original false evidence was not due to dishonesty by MI5 or any of its officers. They effectively put it down to mistakes, both personal and systemic.</p><p>But these two inquiries quickly began to fall apart.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2>Not fair or accurate</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government initially refused to provide both reports in full to the court.</p><p>Like many cases involving MI5, this one was held partly in secret to allow the government to use evidence which it says is too sensitive to be discussed in open hearings.</p><p>Access to the secret, closed part of the case was only available to the government, the judge and security-cleared barristers known as special advocates who were representing the BBC - but who were not allowed to communicate directly with us.</p><p>The government said it would not be providing any closed evidence about the two inquiries to the judge or the special advocates.</p><p>Instead, it provided an &#34;open&#34; version of Sir Jonathan&#39;s external review, with apparently sensitive material edited out, and it purported to provide a full account of the internal inquiry in a witness statement by MI5&#39;s director general of strategy - known as Witness B.</p><p>Sir Jonathan wrote that he was &#34;satisfied&#34; that the open version was a &#34;fair and accurate&#34; account of his full review. Witness B, third-in-command at the Security Service, said in his statement: &#34;I am satisfied that there is nothing in the closed material that has been excluded from the open report which prevents MI5 from providing the court with a frank and accurate account.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f53d/live/0ceb2790-5824-11f0-931b-77dc92982b8b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images An exterior view of the Royal Courts of Justice where the High Court sits, with the neo-Gothic building featuring many spires, turrets, arched windows and a central rose window pictured in sunshine against blue skies."/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The High Court ruled that the explanations for MI5&#39;s false evidence were &#34;deficient&#34;</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>During hearings, the government argued against disclosing secret material to the court.

In it, the officer insisted he did not depart from NCND and gave a melodramatic account of my &#34;long pauses&#34;  as I said I needed the story, before I eventually became cooperative and said I had &#34;seen the light&#34;. </p><p>This was all untrue.
