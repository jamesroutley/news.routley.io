Intriguingly however, for technical reasons, most of these black and white recordings actually
contain remnants of the PAL colour-coding signal - but until recently it was not thought possible to

in the past month have demonstrated practical image-processing colour-recovery approaches.

</p><h3>Introduction</h3>

Numerous BBC television programmes of cult and classic status from the late 1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s
which were originally made in colour on videotape now only exist in the form of black and white
&#39;telerecordings&#39;. These programmes include a number of episodes of &#34;Doctor Who&#34;, &#34;Steptoe and Son&#34;,
and &#34;Dad&#39;s Army&#34;. In the old days, videotape was extremely expensive, and therefore there was a
strong temptation to reuse it. Actors&#39; unions imposed limits on repeat-showings of programmes, to
ensure that actors were not done out of their jobs. One way and other the BBC had various policies
of junking videotapes, which continued until 1978. Many programmes were lost forever while others
exist only as black-and-white &#39;tele-recordings&#39; (essentially a high-quality black-and-white 16mm
film recording of a black-and-white monitor) which were made by the BBC for the export market.
<p>
It has long been believed that we&#39;d never again see these programmes in their original colour.
Intriguingly however, for technical reasons, most of these black and white recordings actually
contain remnants of the PAL colour-coding signal - so-called &#39;chromadots&#39;, but until recently it
was not thought possible to decode them.
</p><p>
As I explain in slightly more detail on my earlier PAL decoding pages
(<a href="http://www.techmind.org/vd/paldec.html">Software-based PAL colour decoding</a>), colour
for traditional analog television systems is encoded as modulated 4.43MHz subcarrier which lies on
top of an essentially black-and-white picture. This encoded colour appears as very fine cross-hatching
if the colour TV signal is watched on a simple black-and-white monitor. This same cross-hatching or
&#39;chromadots&#39; are also present on many tele-recordings of these old programmes.
</p><p>
Quoting from my <a href="http://www.techmind.org/vd/paldec.html">Software-based PAL colour decoding</a> page:
</p><blockquote>
The transmitted colour TV signal is effectively a black-and-white
picture but with areas of fine patterning the strength of which is proportional to
the saturation of the colour portrayed. Of note, U-axis colours (pure yellows or
blues) appear as diagonal stripes \\\, while V-axis colours (pure reds or greens)
appear as diagonals ///. Mixture colours, such as orange (red+yellow) give rise to
a superposition of the two, ie cross-hatching. These patterns can be seen on a
black-and-white monitor fed with a colour TV signal. (See figure below)

</p></blockquote>
<p>
It is not just the pattern of these &#39;chromadots&#39; but also their <i>phase</i> (their absolute position
in the picture) which is needed to decode the colour. In a normal TV signal this is quite easy, but
with the telerecordings the usual phase-reference &#39;burst&#39; (which exists off the left-margin of normal
TV pictures) is not recorded. Furthermore because of the recording off a cathode-ray-tube TV
screen the geometry of the picture is distorted, again making it almost impossible to establish the
exact phase of the signal at any arbitrary place on the image. For these reasons, most engineers would
not even contemplate the possibility of recovering the colour from the telerecordings.
</p><p>
James Insell, archivist at the BBC (formerly of BBC R&amp;D), on the other hand has clearly found
these remnants of colour-coding tantalising, and for some years has been trying to generate interest
in decoding the colour from these old recordings. In April 2007, he formed the Colour Recovery Working
Group as a Wikispace, and a year later (via a round-about route) I stumbled across it.
</p><p>
Having worked (as a hobby) on PAL decoding almost 10 years ago, I felt that if anyone could recover
the colour from these films, I could. I joined the Colour-Recovery group, obtained some source images, and within a
week or two had some very nice demonstrations of (partially-) recovered colour.

There was also an article in the Guardian newspaper, at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/mar/06/research.bbc">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/mar/06/research.bbc</a>
which helped to bring this Colour Recovery idea to a broader audience. The article mistakenly says that
this process is already being used - this was absolutely not true at the time the article was written.
The process was extremely experimental at that stage, but did show some promise that &#34;something&#34; was there.

<h3>Summary</h3>
Jonathan Wood and James Insell initially provided me with just two still frames from an experimental
high-definition (1920x1080 pixel) telecine of the original negative from an old telerecording. These
were from an episode of Top of the Pops from 1970. I later found out that the whole 45-minute programme
exists on the black-and-white film &#39;telerecording&#39;, but that only about 15-minutes-worth of the
programme is still available from the original colour videotape.
<hr/>
<i>This (now historical) article was written in year 2008, about colour-recovery development work performed in the same year. <b>With the benefit of hindsight</b>, it is unfortunate and regrettable that the images used for the initial work described in this article (below) show a TV presenter whose despicable true character has since come to light (2011-12). However, the particular section of telerecording and video from ToTP 1970, had technical characteristics without which the whole colour-recovery ball may never have got rolling. <b>We cannot re-write history.</b></i>

Besides the geometric distortions and lack of subcarrier phase-reference already mentioned, even in
the high-definition telecine the adjacent scanlines of the original recording merge into one another.
These lines partially merge because of a &#39;spot wobble&#39; process originally employed to reduce the
visibility of the line structure when the telerecording was made. Further, the original full frame
(two interleaved interlaced fields) comprises 576 scanlines, but when scanned at &#39;only&#39; 1080 lines
aliassing occurs and (even theoretically, because 1080 is less than twice 576) the lines cannot be
fully resolved. This adds further complications to the colour recovery. If the recovery process is
developed to the point of viability for programmes then it is hoped that higher resolution scans
(1920x1440 or 1920x1556) could be made.
