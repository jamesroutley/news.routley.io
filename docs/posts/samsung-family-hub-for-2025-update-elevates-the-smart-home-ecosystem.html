<h5><strong>Unified Experience Across Screens</strong></h5>
<p>The refreshed <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-one-ui-to-home-appliances-bringing-unified-software-experience-across-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One UI design</a> that was first seen on <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/bespoke/smart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung’s 2025 Bespoke AI appliances</a> will be coming to 2024 Family Hub™ models. This advances Samsung’s vision to bring a unified, seamless experience across the screens of its ecosystem of smart TVs, mobile devices and home appliances. In addition to enabling intuitive navigation and region-specific settings, users will get convenient access to features like <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartthings/?msockid=346b7ad39f7a64000dcd6c559e5f650b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Care, Pet Care</a> and <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartthings/?msockid=346b7ad39f7a64000dcd6c559e5f650b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Care</a><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Family Hub’s™ Cover screen themes are also being updated with new features, including the addition of a Daily Board theme, that offers a new way to see useful information at a glance.</p>
<h5><strong>Smarter Food Tracking with AI Vision Inside Refrigerators</strong></h5>
<p><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/all-refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Hub™ refrigerators</a><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> with AI Vision Inside technology will receive upgrades to enable recognition of frequently used packaged foods and even more fresh fruits and vegetables to help families reduce food waste and save money.

<h5><strong>Personalized Intelligence for Every User</strong></h5>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/bixby/?msockid=346b7ad39f7a64000dcd6c559e5f650b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bixby</a> gets new Voice ID<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> capabilities, allowing it to recognize who is speaking and switches to their Samsung account. This makes it easy for users to access their calendar<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and view their photos<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> or find a misplaced phone, even when it’s on silent<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Voice ID also enhances accessibility by syncing the refrigerator’s display with the visual settings on a user’s Samsung Galaxy phone, such as color inversion or grayscale<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. And for quicker access, users can now activate Bixby with a simple double tap on the screen.</p>
<h5><strong>New Widget Pilot for Cover Screen Themes</strong></h5>
<p>As part of the Family Hub™ software update, we are piloting a new widget for select Cover screens themes of <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/all-refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Hub™ refrigerators</a>. The widget will display useful day-to-day information such as news, calendar and weather forecasts, along with curated advertisements.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/all-refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Family Hub™</a> owners will have the option to turn off Cover screen ads in the Advertisements tab of the Settings menu. Ads can also be dismissed on the Cover screen, meaning that specific ads will not appear again during the campaign period. Advertising will not appear when Cover screen displays Art or Album themes.</p>

<h5><strong>Advanced Security That Works Quietly in the Background</strong></h5>
<p>Samsung is also expanding the reach of <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/knox-matrix-10-years-of-samsung-knox-security-and-samsungs-vision-for-a-safer-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knox Matrix</a>, its advanced security solution built on private blockchain technology, to more of its smart home lineup. The protection now extends beyond Family Hub™+ refrigerators to include compatible Wi-Fi–enabled<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Samsung fridges, washers and dryers launched in 2024<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> — creating a safer, more connected home ecosystem.</p>
<p>With Knox Trust Chain, these appliances can now monitor each other’s security status, ensuring every connected device stays protected. The Bespoke AI Family Hub™+ will also receive enhanced security features, including encrypted Credential Sync, Passkey support and the new Knox Security Dashboard introduced on 2025 models, giving users an easy, real-time view of their connected devices’ security status.</p>
<h5><strong>How to Update Your Family Hub™</strong></h5>
<p>Once the update is available for your fridge, you will receive a notification on the fridge’s screen asking to opt in to the latest software update. Enhancements will become available as soon as you accept the terms and complete the update.</p>
