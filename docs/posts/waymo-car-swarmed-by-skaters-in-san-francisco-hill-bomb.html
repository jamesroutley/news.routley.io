            <p>A Waymo car nearly met its maker when a group of young people with skateboards, White Claws and red flags swarmed it and danced on top of it by <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/local/">Dolores Park</a> Saturday evening, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cf2FPFsPZeD/">videos show</a>. </p>
    
            <p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4axv7g/waymo-vehicle-mobbed-by-skateboarders-during-annual-san-francisco-hill-bomb-event">Motherboard</a> reported that the car, which was not in driverless mode and had a real person operating the vehicle, got ensnared in a “<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/hill-bomb-San-Francisco-skateboarders-Dolores-St-14090264.php">hill bomb</a>” event: a common, often word-of-mouth gathering where skateboarders launch themselves down steep hills by the park while large crowds watch. (A Waymo spokesperson told Motherboard that the driver got out safely.)</p>
    <div id="paywall">
            <p>The video, posted on the popular Bay Area Instagram account, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsthebay/">itsthebay</a>, has gathered nearly 500 comments and reactions from mostly supportive users. “Waymo just got WAY MO LIT,” said one user.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.boardrap.com/a-history-of-san-francisco-hill-bombing-straight-lining-to-skateboard-glory/">Board Rap</a>, an independent skateboarding magazine, says that it&#39;s a significant <a href="http://www.boardrap.com/?s=hill+bomb">part of skateboarding history</a>, especially in a city known for its notoriously steep hills. And while the local skating community celebrates this underground sport and the parties that follow, longtime residents who live near Dolores Park are unhappy about “hill bombing” around their neighborhood.</p>

            <p>“We’re just very, very angry, let’s put it that way,” Linda Rothfield, a neighborhood resident, says. “Like what’s going on?” Rothfield says she was in an Uber passing 18th Street around 10 p.m. when she saw what she described as a “mob” of young people obstructing the road and detonating fireworks. Despite making multiple calls to authorities, she said San Francisco police never showed — even after local supervisors warned them ahead of time. </p>

            <p>“After a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, we suspected the annual &#39;Dolores Hill Bomb&#39; would happen last weekend and reached out in advance to SFPD and SFMTA to be prepared,” wrote a representative from District 8 Supervisor Rafael Mandelman’s office. “It appears that law enforcement were overwhelmed by the crowds and not able to safely resolve the situation what with the staffing resources they had available.”</p>
    
            <p>A spokesperson for SFPD denies this and says that they had extra staffing on hand and responded to a &#34;number of calls,&#34; including a medical call for a skateboarder who was injured, a car crash, and two reports of vandalism. &#34;Mission Station is aware that this event typically occurs in the month of July and worked with city agencies and local stakeholders to prepare for the incident, should it occur,&#34; the spokesperson wrote. <strong><br/></strong></p>
