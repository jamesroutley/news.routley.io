    <h1>PSA: Don&#39;t Download Take Home Challenges from Untrusted Recruiters</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pzvo25/psa_be_aware_when_opening_take_home_challenges/">Reddit post</a> where a developer received a &#34;take home challenge&#34; from a recruiter that contained a malicious VSCode autorun task. Had they opened the project, it would&#39;ve silently downloaded obfuscated JavaScript and run it on their machine—likely stealing sensitive data.</p>
<p>This is one reason I avoided most recruiter outreach during my <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-04_job-search-results">2025 job search</a>. It&#39;s hard to verify who you&#39;re talking to, and the consequences of getting it wrong are serious.</p>
<h2 id="job-recruitment-scams-are-becoming-more-prevalent">Job recruitment scams are becoming more prevalent</h2>
<p>Job recruitment scams are becoming more prevalent. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024">FTC reports show job scam losses escalated from $90 million to $501 million</a> between 2020 and 2024. About 60% of job seekers encountered at least one fake recruiter and <a href="https://www.passwordmanager.com/1-in-4-job-seekers-fell-for-hiring-scams-in-2025-many-shared-passwords-and-lost-money/">1 in 4 fell for hiring scams</a> in 2025.</p>
<p>The tech industry is a prime target with lots of remote workers, high number of job seekers, and higher potential of storing sensitive data digitally - like holding a crypto wallet, keys, or ids on your computer.</p>
<h2 id="two-common-attack-vectors">Two common attack vectors</h2>
<h3 id="malicious-code-in-coding-challenges">Malicious code in coding challenges</h3>
<p>The VSCode autorun attack works via a <code>.vscode/tasks.json</code> file which can execute code the moment you open a folder. But there are other versions of this kind of attack in the wild.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.daviddodda.com/how-i-almost-got-hacked-by-a-job-interview">David Dodda</a> received a LinkedIn message from someone claiming to be &#34;Chief Blockchain Officer&#34; at a company called Symfa. They asked him to complete a standard React/Node coding test.</p>
<p>Hidden in <code>userController.js</code> was an obfuscated function that would fetch a remote payload when executed. It was designed to steal environment variables, database credentials, and crypto wallet data.</p>
<p>He caught it because he asked his AI coding assistant to scan for suspicious patterns before running <code>npm start</code>.</p>
<h3 id="identity-theft-via-fake-hiring">Identity theft via fake hiring</h3>
<p>Scams don&#39;t always involve downloading malware.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shaaahs_jobscam-identitytheft-hiringscam-activity-6965366767665774592-rkvj">Splunk case</a>, a candidate received what looked like a legitimate interview invitation from Splunk. She was fast-tracked through the process, received an offer, and was asked for her driver&#39;s license, direct deposit form, and background check authorization.</p>
<p>The red flag she missed: the email came from <code>splunkcareers.us</code>, not Splunk&#39;s actual <code>.com</code> domain.</p>
<h2 id="why-job-recruitment-scams-are-getting-worse">Why job recruitment scams are getting worse</h2>
<p>A few factors:</p>
<p><strong>Hard job markets breed desperation.</strong> 2025 has been rough for software engineers. When you&#39;re stressed about finding work, you&#39;re more likely to click that link or run some code without thinking twice.</p>
<p><strong>AI makes scams cheaper.</strong> Realistic LinkedIn profiles, professional documentation, legitimate-looking company branding are all much easier to fake now. Deepfakes for video interviews are also becoming more common so seeing is no longer believing.</p>
<p><strong>Developers are uniquely vulnerable.</strong> We download and run code all the time - GitHub repos, npm packages, coding challenges. So it&#39;s not that weird to be asked to download and run a repo.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How to protect yourself</h2>
<p><strong>Prefer applying directly.</strong> Anyone can pose as a recruiter. When possible, go through company career pages instead of responding to outreach. If a recruiter contacts you, verify them: check that the email domain matches the company, look up their LinkedIn history, or call the company&#39;s HR directly. This is what I did for <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-04_job-search-results">2025 job search</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t blindly run code.</strong> Most legitimate interviews use online platforms like CoderPad, not local execution. If you do need to run something locally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for <code>.vscode/tasks.json</code> before trusting the workspace</li>
<li>Review the <code>package.json</code> scripts section</li>
<li>Ask an AI assistant to scan for suspicious patterns</li>
<li>Consider using a sandbox or disposable VM for untrusted projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Never share sensitive info prematurely.</strong> SSN, bank accounts, and driver&#39;s licenses should only go through official portals after you&#39;re actually hired. Legitimate companies don&#39;t collect this over email and Zoom is also rare. When in doubt, slow down and try to verify.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>Job searches are stressful enough - avoid allowing that to push you into a scam. If something feels off, it probably is. Apply directly, verify everything, and double check before running untrusted code.</p>
