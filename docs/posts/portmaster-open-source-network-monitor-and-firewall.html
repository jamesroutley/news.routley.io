                  Yes, we highly recommend to continue using adblockers, such as uBlock Origin, uMatrix, or similar. They give you more fine grained control over domains. iE you can allow certain domains to allow css files &amp; images while blocking cookies &amp; javascripts. The Portmaster cannot make this distinction.
