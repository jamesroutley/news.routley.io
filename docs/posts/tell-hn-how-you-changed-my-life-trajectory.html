    <h1>Tell HN: How you changed my life trajectory</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>HN has a few idiosyncrasies, but to me it&#39;s the last bastion of high-quality discussion on the internet with a shared front-page.</p><p>For years I&#39;ve kept a tab open and refreshed a dozen times a day. But what I didn&#39;t expect is that this community would actively change the course of my life.</p><p>Over the years, I have amassed a graveyard of side projects, and in 2021 I launched a new one. The MVP had zero users, and my finger was hovering over the big red button once again...</p><p>I posted to Show HN just for kicks, and braced for the onslaught. But to my astonishment, the constructive and energizing feedback I received went on to power my indie dev journey over the past two and a half years [0]</p><p>And now... I just officially quit my day job to work on that passion project full-time! [1]</p><p>Historically I have not thought of myself as an entrepreneur. Nor a risk-taker. I have worked a stable mid-tier SWE job for nearly a decade, abiding all the stand-ups, bureaucracy, and revectoring.</p><p>I&#39;m just a guy that likes to make things in my free time, and who never dared to believe one of those projects could grow into something real.</p><p>But after building on nights and weekends for the past 2.5 years and reaching 2,500 paid customers, I realized that even in the worst case, I would rather fail pursuing a dream than let a promising small business die on the vine and always wonder what might have been.</p><p>So although this jump to full-time is earlier than my personal financial modeling showed a robust chance of success for, it&#39;s time to set aside a few of the worries and risk mitigation tactics, and take a step into the unknown.</p><p>I never imagined my career taking this course, and without that early support and encouragement from this community... it simply would not have.</p><p>So I&#39;d like to say a thank you to HN. Not just for being my favorite news source, or for being one of the only platforms not chalk full of formulaic engagement-optimized posts, but for helping me personally find the courage to leave the corporate world, set out on a new path, and chase a dream :)</p><p>[0] most recent Show HN: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849502">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849502</a></p><p>[1] <a href="https://x.com/_knolan/status/1724142406352646601?s=20" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://x.com/_knolan/status/1724142406352646601?s=20</a></p></div></td></div></div>
