    <p>I grew up on the internet. I&#39;m old enough to remember when my news feeds actually ended. Remember the times before infinite scroll was engineered? I remember when algorithms weren&#39;t good enough to keep me in a trance-like state for eternity.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, I experience firsthand the horrible effects of the algorithms. We weren&#39;t meant to read the thoughts of 100s of people all at once. It&#39;s also not possible to fully check out from social media.</p>
<p>What is the solution?</p>
<p>Actively rebel against weaponized addictive technology. I&#39;m going to read more books, watch more movies, talk to people, go out for walks (without airpods) and be more present without the constant noise of a YouTube video playing in the background.</p>
<p>How am I doing it?</p>
<p>Using tech to fight tech. Extensions to block out feeds. Uninstalling social media from my phone. I have also started using &#34;one sec&#34; an app that briefly makes you pause before you access an application. This has helped me tremendously. Buying physical books to avoid screens. And actively calling my friends and family to talk to them.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I want to rebel. I want to take control of my brain. I want to be the kid that used to read a book a week. I want to be less anxious. No, I don&#39;t want to know what&#39;s happening all around the world in real-time.</p>
<p>I refuse to go down without a fight.</p>
