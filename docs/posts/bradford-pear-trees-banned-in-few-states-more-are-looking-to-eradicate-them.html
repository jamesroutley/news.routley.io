Birds and mammals eat the fruit and poop out the seeds, often far from the tree from which it came.</p><p>So that Bradford pear tree in your yard or along Main Street looks innocent – despite <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/14/why-bradford-pear-trees-smell-bad-and-how-and-why-to-get-rid-of-them/72934322007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">the pungent scent its blooms exude to attract pollinators</a>. But the seeds may be spread far and wide by creatures snacking on the fruit (not edible for humans).</p><p>The progeny are creating bigger problems as an invasive species that overwhelms native plants and is hard to eradicate. &#34;When it was introduced here it did well, a little too well,&#34; Chamberlin said. &#34;We&#39;re now realizing it is aggressively invading our natural areas.&#34;</p><h2>Why are states banning Callery pear trees?</h2><p>Callery pear trees grow fast and once they get into a location they can steal nutrients, sun and moisture from native plants. Unlike the Bradford pear trees, these have tough thorns and, as they spread, create dense thickets.</p><p>&#34;They will pop tires so it makes it tricky, when it comes time to harvest timber or getting equipment in for management activities,&#34; said David Coyle, an assistant professor in Clemson University&#39;s Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation.</p><p>&#34;So you&#39;ve got to get machines with metal tracks on them. These things will also really quickly take over pastures and old fields. So it makes it really hard if you&#39;ve got livestock.&#34;</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/20/USAT/73047739007-img-6460.JPG?crop=3024,4032,x0,y0&amp;width=300&amp;height=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/20/USAT/73047739007-img-6460.JPG?crop=3024,4032,x0,y0&amp;width=600&amp;height=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Thorns on a Callery pear tree.
