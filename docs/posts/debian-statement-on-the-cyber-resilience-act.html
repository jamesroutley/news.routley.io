    <h1>Debian Statement on the Cyber Resilience Act</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
The Debian project has <a href="https://www.debian.org/vote/2023/vote_002">completed a
general-resolution vote</a>, adopting a statement expressing concern about
the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) pending in the European Union.
</p><blockquote>
	Even if only &#34;commercial activities&#34; are in the scope of CRA, the
	Free Software community - and as a consequence, everybody - will
	lose a lot of small projects. CRA will force many small enterprises
	and most probably all self employed developers out of business
	because they simply cannot fulfill the requirements imposed by
	CRA. Debian and other Linux distributions depend on their work. If
	accepted as it is, CRA will undermine not only an established
	community but also a thriving market. CRA needs an exemption for
	small businesses and, at the very least, solo-entrepreneurs
