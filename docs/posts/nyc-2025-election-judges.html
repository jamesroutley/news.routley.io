<p data-block-key="9432q">Early voting in New York City&#39;s 2025 general election started today. <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2025/nyc-2025-election-ballot-proposals/">Yesterday I posted about the six ballot proposals</a>; today I share some recommendations and links about the seven competitive judicial races (that is, races where there are actually more candidates than open positions). They&#39;re all in Manhattan, Queens, or Staten Island; no Bronx or Brooklyn judicial elections are competitive this year. For each candidate in those elections, I did a little web searching and decided on some recommendations. For a few Queens candidates I have some more detail because I got to meet them in person this month.</p><p data-block-key="2ai54"><a href="#judicial-queens"><b>Queens</b></a>: several.

Greenberg has done a lot of <a href="https://www.qgazette.com/articles/sunnyside-chamber-holds-special-meeting-on-real-estate/">local service in Community Board, Chamber of Commerce</a>, etc. as his <a href="https://trellis.law/judge/ira.r.greenberg">resume</a> <a href="https://nmcdn.io/e186d21f8c7946a19faed23c3da2f0da/9e87ade568e94518ac464a0fa759a32c/files/Judge-Resumes/Ira-Greenberg-CV.pdf">says</a>. In 2018, <a href="https://www.ny-ijeqc.org/ratings/2018.Final.Rated.Candidates.pdf">a ratings panel called Greenberg &#34;qualified&#34; for Civil Court for the 11th District</a>. His QCBA rating this year: Qualified. NYC Bar Association rating: Approved. I got to hear him speak at a local Democratic Club and thought he sounded even-tempered, thoughtful, and so on. For example, he mentioned how he takes care to refer to &#34;unrepresented&#34; defendants rather than &#34;pro se&#34; which is an inscrutable Latin phrase to most of them. <b>I suggest: enthusiastic yes.</b></li><li data-block-key="ugul"><b>Gary F. Miret</b>: QCBA rating: Well Qualified. NYC Bar Association rating: Approved. Currently sitting; <a href="https://judges.scrutinize.org/judge/gary-f-miret">Scrutinize</a> shows us he publishes more than most judges do. I got to hear him speak and he was a blowhard, dismissively criticizing Kids These Days And Their Phones, aggressively repeating that he wouldn&#39;t apologize for having had a Catholic education (no one was asking him to!) and praising the physical punishments he&#39;d received as a child for giving him a work ethic. However, he did emphasize that, as a judge who sees mostly felony DWI cases, he tries to divert most of them into treatment programs instead of just being punitive. That, plus the Bar Association ratings, make the difference for me:<b> I suggest: reluctant yes.</b></li><li data-block-key="bvs47"><b>Sandra Perez</b>: QCBA rating: Qualified.
