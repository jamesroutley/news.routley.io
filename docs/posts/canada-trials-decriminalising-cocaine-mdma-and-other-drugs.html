Instead, they will be offered information on available health and social services</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In its request to the federal government last year, BC said it asked for the drug laws exemption in order &#34;to remove the shame that often prevents people from reaching out for life-saving help&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Federal minister of mental health and addictions Carolyn Bennett said on Tuesday that &#34;for too many years, the ideological opposition to harm reduction has cost lives&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We are doing this to save lives, but also to give people using drugs their dignity and choices.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart said the decision &#34;marks a fundamental rethinking of drug policy that favours healthcare over handcuffs&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The programme will run from 31 January 2023 to 31 January 2026.

Over 9,000 people have died of drug overdose in the province since 2016. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There have been growing calls for a shift in drug policy towards a public health approach from regions across the country. That has included support for some decriminalisation from a number of public health officials as well as the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Bennett said the scheme in BC could become &#34;a template for other jurisdictions across Canada&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In 2020, Oregon became the first US state to drop criminal penalties for the possession of some illicit drugs. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The state saw a drop in drug arrests though there has been debate as to whether it has prompted more drug users to seek help for their substance use. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Canada legalised the use of recreational cannabis for adults nationwide in 2018. </p></div><div data-component="media-block"><figure><div><div data-chromatic="ignore"><div height="0"></div></div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Vancouver&#39;s unusual approach offers opioid users injection sites, antidotes and even heroin on prescription.</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
