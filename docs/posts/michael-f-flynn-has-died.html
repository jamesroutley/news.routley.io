Flynn.  </p><p>It is with sorrow and regret that I inform you that my father passed away yesterday, Sept 30, 2023. </p><p>He was sleeping peacefully in the home that he loved. His father built the home 70 years ago and my dad had an outsized attachment to it. Many happy memories of his childhood and of his parents, and his brothers, especially Dennis, were contained herein.  </p><p>If you met or corresponded or conversed with Dad then you know that he was interested in a great many things in the world. If he asked you a question about something, it was because he really wanted to know, he wasn&#39;t just being polite.  He liked to take the &#34;devil&#39;s advocate&#34; position in debates and arguments, especially political ones, much to the annoyance of my mother and probably many others. Dad was looking for a robust exercise in intellectual and rhetorical swordplay; he just didn&#39;t always see that sometimes people just want to have a conversation without being en garde. <br/></p><p>He had the ultimate dad sense of humor, and had an endless supply of terrible jokes, puns, and groaners, even when he was in the hospital in July. In &#34;real life,&#34; he was a very easy going person. I could probably count on one hand the number of times I have heard my dad yell or curse. <br/></p><p>At his death, he had a lot of tabs open on his browser, on a variety topics. He always sought to learn about different things. Some of it was for his writing, some for the extensive family research he has always done, and some of it was just because he wanted to learn more about the universe, the planet we live on, and the people around him. </p><p>So if you take anything away from your time reading his works, his blog, interacting with him on social media or elsewhere, forget the politics and social commentary and the devil&#39;s advocacy, but take away that he was someone who just wanted to learn and engage with others, and keep that piece with you in your lives. </p><p>- His Daughter. <br/></p>
