        <p>December 15, 2024 at  9:45 AM by Dr. Drang</p>
        <p><a href="file:///Users/mark/git/blog-preview/post-preview.html">A recent episode</a> of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads"><em>In Our Time</em> podcast</a> is about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>, which you’ve probably heard of. It’s a bronze device that dates back to the first century BCE and was found by divers on an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in the early 1900s. It’s main purpose, as determined by slow study over the past hundred years, was to track the positions of the “planets,” which in its time were the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.</p>

<p>The show is very good, covering both the mechanism itself and the development of what’s known about it. There’s also some fun speculation on who made it and who owned it. This post expands on a couple of numerical/astronomical/calendrical things mentioned by the guests.</p>

<hr/>

<p>At about the 32-minute mark, <a href="https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/emeritus/michael-g-edmunds">Mike Edmunds</a> talks about a large wheel in the mechanism that has, he says, 233 teeth, equal to the number of lunar months in the Saros cycle, which is used to predict eclipses. I mention it here for two reasons:</p>

<p>First, Prof. Edmunds misspoke slightly. The Saros cycle is 223 lunar months, not 233. And it’s worth mentioning that what I’m calling a <em>lunar month</em> is also known as a <em>synodic month</em> and a <em>lunation</em>, depending on which reference you’re looking at. It’s the time between one new moon and the next,<sup id="fnref:full"><a href="#fn:full" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which is about 29½ days</p>

<p>Second, so you could see the spelling of Saros in case you wanted to do your own searching on the topic. If so, I recommend <a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros.html">this article</a> by Fred Espenak on NASA’s website. It includes two other month definitions, <em>anomalistic</em> and <em>draconic</em>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Earlier in the show, at about the 14-minute mark, <a href="https://jomarchant.com/">Jo Marchant</a> talked about a particular gear train in the mechanism, in which</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the first six gear wheels… convert the speed by a ratio of 254 over 19, which… harmonizes the motion of the Sun and the Moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was out on a walk as I first listened to the episode, and I misheard this part. I thought she said 354 instead of 254. So my instinct was that the 19 came from the length, in years, of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle">Metonic cycle</a> and that the 354 came from the number of days in 12 lunar months (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mn>12</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>29.5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>354</mn></math>). I knew that the Metonic cycle was the period it took for a lunar calendar and a solar calendar to get back in sync,<sup id="fnref:sync"><a href="#fn:sync" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but I didn’t understand what that had to do with the number of days in 12 lunar months.</p>

<p>When I got home and listened to that chunk of the show again, I realized that I had misheard, but hearing it right led to another question. The Metonic cycle is 19 years or 235 lunar months—where does the 254 come from?</p>

<p>After some thinking, I realized that although there are 235 lunar months in a Metonic cycle, that’s <em>not</em> how many times the Moon orbits the Earth in 19 years. A new moon occurs when the Moon is directly between the Sun and Earth. Because the Earth has gone nearly 30° around the Sun in one lunar month, that means the Moon has gone nearly 390° around the Earth in that time. Over the course of a year, the Moon has made one more orbit of the Earth than you would think if you just divided the number of days in a year (<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=tropical+year">365.2421881</a>) by the number of days in a lunar month (<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=lunar+month">29.53058891</a>).</p>

<p>If you’re used to thinking in terms of sidereal time, or if you watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg">this Veritasium video</a> on a screwed-up SAT question, you know that if there are 235 lunar months and 19 years in a Metonic cycle, the Moon must have orbited the Earth <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mn>235</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>19</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>254</mn></math> times. Therefore, the number of Moon orbits and the number of Earth orbits must be in a ratio of 254:19.</p>

<p>If this still is still puzzling, a picture might help. Here are the Sun, Earth and Moon at two successive new moons, as viewed from “above” the solar system.</p>

<p>The angle that the Earth goes through in one lunar month is</p>

<p>I can think of three objections to this calculation. Let’s go through them.</p>

<p><strong>Elliptical orbits</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sidereal vs tropical year</strong></p>

The precession adjustment is only about 1 part in 26,000.</p>

<p><strong>Heliocentric motion</strong></p>

<p>I’ve always liked blogging about calendrical things, but I don’t remember doing anything on the Metonic cycle before. If I had written faster, I could’ve published it on <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2012/07/friday-the-13th-frequency/">Friday the 13th</a>. Too bad.</p>
