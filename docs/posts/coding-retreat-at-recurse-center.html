              <p>
                In February and March, I did a six-week programming retreat at
                <a href="https://recurse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a>. The way I&#39;ve described this to people is that it&#39;s like an
                artist residency, but for coding (although you can also make
                code-based art!) Recurse Center, a.k.a. RC, has a revolving
                roster of participants who join a &#34;batch&#34; for six or
                twelve weeks. Every six weeks, some people start a batch, others
                finish one, and yet others continue on for another six weeks.
                One can participate in-person in Downtown Brooklyn, or remotely
                ‚Äî or any combination of the two. (I did a combination so I could
                spend some time at home in New Haven, and some staying with
                friends in NYC).
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspired by the open-ended learning methods of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unschooling</a>, there is no formal curriculum. Instead, participants
                self-organize and pursue personal goals, while being encouraged
                to collaborate and discuss their projects. Everyone who joins a
                batch already has some programming experience, so it&#39;s up to you
                how you want to spend your time: you might focus on developing
                new skills or strengthening existing ones, or build a project
                that is useful or whimsical. I had interesting conversations
                every day with very excited and thoughtful people, which I think
                is one of the best ways to learn.
              </p>
              <p>During my batch, I worked on two main projects:</p>
              <photo-grid>
                <a href="https://alexharri.com/img/lab-1713w-CweyjJIUuq.jpeg"><img alt="Screenshot of The Lab site" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://alexharri.com/img/lab-1440w-CweyjJIUuq.jpeg" width="1440" height="842"/></a>
              </photo-grid>
              
              <p>
                <strong>The Lab</strong> - a new, text-adventure themed section
                of my website that houses various web-based experiments. I built
                it with Eleventy (the same static site generator I used to make
                this site!), and it includes an assortment of animations and
                interactive elements made with P5.js, Three.js, and fragment
                shaders.

              </p>
              <p>
                This project was really an excuse to just experiment and play
                with web-based media and see what happened. I included some
                elements that I created in pair programming sessions. I&#39;m
                interested in playing around more with web-based animations and
                the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element; as experiment more in
                the future, I&#39;ll add more &#34;rooms.&#34;

              <p>
                <strong>Subtle Cards</strong> - a web app for pulling virtual
                tarot card spreads. It&#39;s a full-stack app with a React frontend
                (deployed on Netlify), Tailwind CSS, a Flask API (deployed on
                Heroku), and Supabase as the database. I batch-edited the tarot
                card images with
                <a href="https://imagemagick.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imagemagick</a>
                (one of my favorite tools), created card animations with
                <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">framer-motion</a>, and used
                <a href="https://random.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Random.org</a>&#39;s true-random number API to randomize the tarot card pulls.
                Each spread of cards has a unique URL. There are also dynamic
                moon-phase icons (using
                <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SunCalc</a>).

                Building <em>Subtle Cards</em> was the largest project of my
                batch. I love building static websites, but I wanted to push
                myself to build a more dynamic web app with modern standard
                frontend tools. It took me longer than expected (I thought I
                could finish it in one week), but I was proud of the result, and
                happy that I finished in time to share the project in the final
                <em>presentations</em> session of my batch. I&#39;m particularly
                proud of the way the cards animate on screen, simulating that
                moment of pause in a real tarot card pull. For page transitions,
                I used the new browser standard
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view transition API</a>, which is not yet implemented in Firefox, but provides a nice
                progressive enhancement for Chrome and Safari.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned a lot while working on this, and I am now very ready
                to move on to new projects (and to try other frameworks besides
                React), but there are two things I&#39;d like to add at some point:
                an animation for the background of the splash page, and the
                ability to pull cards from additional tarot decks. (I
                deliberately built the backend with this in mind, and I plan to
                add some decks of my own design when they are finished!)
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, working on my own projects was only one aspect of my
                Recurse Center experience. I also participated in lots of group
                events, coffee chats, pairing sessions, and general banter. I
                joked with someone that RC is basically a bunch of people who
                enjoy explaining things to each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since I had my video equipment with me in the city (to play the
                shows I wrote about in my last post!) during my final week of
                batch, I brought it in to show it to people during Demo Palooza,
                an event where people set up interactive projects to show each
                other.
              </p>
              <p>
                Conveniently, there was already a CRT monitor in RC&#39;s retro
                computing corner, so I brought in my modular synth and my
                custom-mapped controller for Resolume, and spent a fun afternoon
                demo-ing video synthesis as people rotated through my station.
                After over an hour of this, I finally also got the chance to
                walk around and check out everyone else&#39;s projects. (There were
                far too many to list here, but seeing and discussing what other
                people were working on was one of the most fascinating and
                inspiring aspects of the retreat.)

                (Note: the retro computers visible in the background were not
                part of my setup ‚Äî though they certainly contributed to the
                vibe.)
              </p>
              <p>
                As I mentioned, many events at RC are organized by the
                participants. During the first weeks of my batch, I frequently
                heard people mention their use of AI coding tools, but I noticed
                a lack of critical conversation around how to engage with these
                tools in a thoughtful and ethical way. The internet is brimming
                with articles and discourse on the topic, but much of it is
                almost pure fluff, serving either to overhype the technologies,
                or to proclaim them as the source of our doom as a species
                (another side of the same coin). Because of my irritation with
                the popular conversation around AI, I had previously avoided the
                topic, but during my batch, I felt it was time to start engaging
                with it in a more deliberate way. This led me to organize a
                weekly meeting called <em>Critical AI Discussion Group</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                These meetings provided a space to voice our concerns, share
                anecdotes and experiences related to AI (in the workplace,
                classroom, etc.), and discuss practical matters ‚Äî such as the
                tech debt accrued by using large swaths of generated code ‚Äî and
                philosophical matters ‚Äî such as the nature of creativity and
                authorship of one&#39;s own work. I facilitated four meetings before
                stepping down at the end of my batch. However, other members of
                RC have jumped in to continue the meetings, with a rotating
                facilitator each week, so I&#39;ve continued to attend as an alum.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, I had an amazing time during my six weeks at Recurse
                Center. I think their open-ended approach to learning was
                perfect for me, since I&#39;m very self-motivated. I really did feel
                like I became a &#34;dramatically better programmer,&#34;
                which is one of RC&#39;s stated goals. Now that I&#39;ve built my first
                full-stack web app from scratch, I feel much more confident as a
                developer. I feel empowered to continue programming, to really
                commit to it as my main profession, and to continue building
                interesting personal projects. And last but not least, I met a
                lot of cool, curious, creative people. I look forward to
                continuing to participate in the RC alumni community, and
                hopefully doing another batch at some point when I have time.
