    <h1>Tell HN: OpenAI now requires ID verification and won&#39;t refund API credits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Just frustrated here: I credited my OpenAI API account with credits, and then it turns out I have to go through some verification process to actually use the API, which involves disclosing personal data to some third-party vendor, which I am not prepared to do. So I asked for a refund and am told that that refunds are against their policy.</p><p>So I&#39;ll be cancelling my chatgpt plus sub, disputing the card payment, and moving to deepseek.</p><p>Edit: Deepseek seems to be a lot cheaper than OpenAI</p><p>Edit 2: seems verification is only needed for gpt-5, gpt-4o seems to work without it</p></div></div></div>
