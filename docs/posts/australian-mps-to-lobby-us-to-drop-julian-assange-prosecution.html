    <h1>Australian MPs to lobby US to drop Julian Assange prosecution</h1>

The trip is being funded by the Assange campaign.</p><p>Assange remains in Belmarsh prison in London as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jun/17/julian-assange-extradition-to-us-approved-by-priti-patel" data-link-name="in body link">fights a US attempt to extradite him</a> to face charges in connection with the publication of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cable-leak-diplomacy-crisis" data-link-name="in body link">hundreds of thousands of leaked documents</a> about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars as well as diplomatic cables.</p><p>Greg Barns SC, an adviser to the Assange campaign, said on Tuesday that it was “not an ordinary run-of-the-mill extradition case”. He said freedom of speech was “an important theme in the US”.</p><p>“You’ve got China chasing journalists around the world, and you’ve got the Russians who have recently arrested journalists,” Barns told Guardian Australia.</p><p>“You’ve now got China using the Assange case as a sort of moral equivalence argument. So the message [of the Australian delegation] is going to be: this is very dangerous for journalists around the world and a race to the bottom that’s going on.”</p><p>China’s foreign ministry spokesperson has discussed the issue at the daily press conference in Beijing at least five times since early last year, including to say Assange should not “stand trial for telling people the truth”.</p><p>China has also argued the extradition bid “is a mirror” that “reflects the hypocrisy of the US and the UK on ‘press freedom’”.</p><ul>

</ul><p>The state-affiliated Global Times has regularly covered the case, including publishing an op-ed titled: “Can the Assange question tip toward a more independent foreign policy for Australia?”</p><p>Barns said: “The US likes to preach democratic standards and human rights standards around the world. And yet, because of this case, it’s allowed the Chinese to be able to say, ‘Well, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.’”</p><p>He said the cross-party trip to the US – whose delegates include the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce and the independent MP Monique Ryan – was “very timely” because it was a month before Albanese’s state visit to the US.</p><p>“There’s a very clear message being sent that this is not simply a matter where Australia would politely request that some action be taken – this has now gone beyond that,” Barns said.</p><figure id="76508506-8b6b-41c3-8f79-8904cbf5d78e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3a579bd5db20b10215a53ed4f6b70e985c3fce/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3a579bd5db20b10215a53ed4f6b70e985c3fce/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3a579bd5db20b10215a53ed4f6b70e985c3fce/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3a579bd5db20b10215a53ed4f6b70e985c3fce/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3a579bd5db20b10215a53ed4f6b70e985c3fce/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3a579bd5db20b10215a53ed4f6b70e985c3fce/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Julian Assange’s brother Gabriel Shipton" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3a579bd5db20b10215a53ed4f6b70e985c3fce/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Julian Assange’s brother Gabriel Shipton, says Anthony Albanese should appeal to Biden personally for ‘goodwill between friends’.</span> Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>“There is no better ally of the United States in the region and, in that context, this is not a big ask.”</p><p>Assange’s brother, Gabriel Shipton, said the prime minister should tell Biden that “this is an issue for us back at home; we need some goodwill between friends on this”.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-18" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Shipton said he spoke often with Assange’s wife, Stella. “He’s doing OK, all things considered,” Shipton said.</p><p>“He’s got the support of his family, the visits from Stella, the phone calls – that’s his lifeline, keeping him going, his connection to the outside world.
