    <h1>Ask HN: Weird archive.today behavior?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>archive.today has recently (I noticed this, like, 3 days ago) started automatically making requests to someone&#39;s personal blog on their CAPTCHA page.  Here&#39;s a screenshot of what I&#39;m talking about: https://files.catbox.moe/20jsle.png</p><p>The relevant JS is:</p><pre><code>   setInterval(function() {
     fetch(&#34;https://gyrovague.com/?s=&#34; + Math.round(new Date().getTime() % 10000000), {
       referrerPolicy: &#34;no-referrer&#34;,
       mode: &#34;no-cors&#34;
     });
   }, 300);
</code></pre><p>
Looking at this blog, there seems to be exactly one article mentioning archive.today - &#34;archive.today: On the trail of the mysterious guerrilla archivist of the Internet&#34; (https://gyrovague.com/2023/08/05/archive-today-on-the-trail-of-the-mysterious-guerrilla-archivist-of-the-internet/), where the person running the blog digs up some information about archive&#39;s owner.</p><p>So perhaps this is some kind of revenge/DOS attack attempt/deliberately wasting their bandwidth in response to this article?  Maybe an attempt to silence them and force to delete their article?  But if it is, then I have so many questions.  Like, why would the owner of the archive do that <i>2.5 years</i> after the article was published?  Or why would they even do that in the first place, do they not know about Streisand effect?</p><p>I&#39;m confused.</p></div></div></div>
