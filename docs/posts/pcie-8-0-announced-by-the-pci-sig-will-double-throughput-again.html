            <!-- content --><p>The PCI-SIG announced this week that it is not going to stop. Targeting a 2028 release, the PCIe 8.0 specification will double the throughput over PCIe 7.0. With the release, the PCI-SIG also shared two neat charts.<span id="more-88673"></span></p>
<h2>PCIe Gen8 Announced by the PCI-SIG Will Double Throughput Again</h2>
<p>The PCI-SIG has this graphic to show what is happening to I/O bandwidth. It says that the I/O bandwidth is doubling every three years.</p>
<figure id="attachment_88674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-88674"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=88674" rel="attachment wp-att-88674"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-800x481.jpeg" alt="PCIe Gen8 IO Bandwidth Doubling" width="696" height="418" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-800x481.jpeg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-400x241.jpeg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-1536x924.jpeg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-2048x1232.jpeg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-698x420.jpeg 698w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-696x419.jpeg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-1068x642.jpeg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Gen8-IO-Bandwidth-Doubling-1920x1155.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-88674">PCIe Gen8 IO Bandwidth Doubling</figcaption></figure>
<p>Something to also keep in mind is that this is very device and interface centric. From a processor and system point of view, the number of controllers and lanes is also increasing at the same time the link speeds increase. So from a system standpoint, the cumulative I/O bandwidth is increasing at an even faster rate.</p>
<p>Now for the chart that many of our readers will want to have handy. This shows the PCIe bandwidth by generation and link width. The headline feature is that the PCIe Gen8 x16 link will have 1TB/s of bandwidth available, up from 128GB/s in todayâ€™s PCIe Gen5.</p>
<figure id="attachment_88675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-88675"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=88675" rel="attachment wp-att-88675"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-800x532.jpeg" alt="PCIe Bandwidth By Generation And Link Width" width="696" height="463" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-800x532.jpeg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-400x266.jpeg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-1536x1021.jpeg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-2048x1361.jpeg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-632x420.jpeg 632w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-696x463.jpeg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-1068x710.jpeg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PCIe-Bandwidth-by-Generation-and-Link-Width-1920x1276.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-88675">PCIe Bandwidth By Generation And Link Width</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, this is the kind of table that is a good reference for folks who want to compare bandwidth across generations and lane configurations. The best part is that it not only looks back to the original PCIe implementation, but it also goes to the PCIe generation that we will be using at the end of the decade.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>This is certainly forward-looking. We are on PCIe Gen5 today. PCIe Gen6 is the generation that we are starting to see more often, with some solutions already hitting the market, like the NVIDIA ConnectX-8 NIC and NVIDIA B300 generation. PCIe Gen7 is still a few years off. Still, with so much investment in the AI build-out, there is a major push in the industry to continue to increase the speed of interconnects.</p>
