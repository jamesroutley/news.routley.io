I left my computer on the top of my desk during the night and the next day I opened it the screen had 2 small cracks on the right which damaged the functioning of the screen. I contacted an authorized apple center which told me apple warranty would not cover it as it is a contact point crack; as if I have left something the size of a rice berry between the screen and the keyboard... It is absurd as I have nothing like it on my desk and the computer was properly closed as usual and didn’t move the whole night. More than the price of repairing it , it is frustrating that apple doesn’t believe its costumers.</p><p>I wonder if anyone had the same problem or if it is due to a design flaw, I have several Mac product  and never had a similar problem, my last Mac lasted 10 years with no issues. </p></div>
