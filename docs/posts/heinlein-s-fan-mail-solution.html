    <h1>Heinlein&#39;s Fan Mail Solution</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-column">

			
<p>
I found this letter in a folder of old correspondence from my days when I was editing at the Whole Earth Catalog. It is from the science fiction master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>.
</p>

Heinlein engineered his own nerdy solution to a problem common to famous authors: how to deal with fan mail.  In the days before the internet, Heinlein’s solution was fabulous. He created a one page FAQ answer sheet –  minus the questions. Then he, or rather his wife Ginny, checked off the appropriate answer and mailed it back.  While getting a form letter back might be thought rude, it was much better than being ignored, and besides, the other questions you did not ask were also answered! Indeed, it is both remarkable and heartwarming that Heinlein replied at all to most mail. Can you imagine other great authors doing the same — even with a form letter? Heinlein’s form is very entertaining to read because you are forced to reconstruct the missing requests.

<form mt:asset-id="2205"><a href="https://kk.org/ct2/heinlein.php" onclick="window.open(&#39;https://kk.org/ct2/heinlein.php&#39;,&#39;popup&#39;,&#39;width=800,height=1017,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false"><img src="https://kk.org/ct2/heinlein-thumb-450x572.jpg" width="450" height="572" alt="heinlein.jpg"/></a></form>

But progress marches on, even in science fiction author’s households. Ginny Heinlein said that by 1984, “with the advent of computerization in our household, we no long use the form letter to answer fan mail. I find that it is possible now, with the computer, to write individual letters in reply to fan mail faster than I could check off the answer on the form.”</p>
