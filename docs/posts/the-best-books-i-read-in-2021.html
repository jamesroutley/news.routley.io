<ul>
  <li><b>The Scholomance</b> (series) by <i>Naomi Novik</i> - Magical boarding school books, but extra horrifying and dark and well done.</li>
  <li><b>Uhura’s Song</b> by <i>Janet Kagan</i> - Easily the best Star Trek novel I’ve ever read (and I’ve read plenty), with lots of interesting linguistics/cultural nuance.</li>
  <li><b>Black Water Sister</b> by <i>Zen Cho</i> - My favorite novel of hers so far. Queer Malay Chinese girl moves back to Malaysia and gets possessed by the ghost of her grandmother.</li>
  <li><b>Spirits Abroad</b> by <i>Zen Cho</i> - Mostly a reread but this edition has a few new stories, still brilliant</li>
  <li><b>Legendborn</b> by <i>Tracy Deonn</i> - An actually clever, non-boring Arthur novel!</li>
  <li><b>The Midnight Bargain</b> by <i>C.L. Polk</i> - Bit on the nose but really well done. When a female sorceress marries, she is literally locked in a collar that seals away her magic (because a fetus could otherwise get possessed)</li>
  <li><b>The Jasmine Throne</b> by <i>Tasha Suri</i> - Another very dark one, lots of burning people to death (including children), but excellent world-building.</li>
  <li><b>An Unkindness of Ghosts</b> by <i>Rivers Solomon</i> - Generation ship, major class abuse issues, autistic-seeming doctor-ish protagonist. Very violent. The end a bit weak, but I really liked it until then.</li>
  <li><b>Gideon the Ninth</b> by <i>Tamsyn Muir</i> - I put off reading this for ages, and then liked it so much more than I thought I would! Not precisely an unreliable protagonist, but one whose perspective makes trying to understand the plot like looking through a cracked, cloudy window from a distance. Plus queer and funny!</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li><b>The Devil Comes Courting</b> by <i>Courtney Milan</i> - Touches on colonialism and cross-racial adoption and brilliant female engineering</li>
  <li><b>The Duke Who Didn’t</b> by <i>Courtney Milan</i> - British Chinese regency romance, with a culinary theme and a list-making protagonist</li>
  <li><b>Cotillion</b> by <i>Georgette Heyer</i> - The doofy dandy love interest is hilariously great, not the hero we’d expect but a hero nonetheless</li>
  <li><b>The Chai Factor</b> by <i>Farah Heron</i> - Engineer protagonist, love interest is a member of the annoying barbershop quartet that moved into her family’s basement</li>
  <li><b>Book of Love</b> by <i>Erin Satie</i> - Pranks and politics</li>
  <li><b>The Brown Sisters</b> (series) by <i>Talia Hibbert</i> - Protagonists with fibromyalgia, autism</li>
  <li><b>Salt Magic, Skin Magic</b> by <i>Lee Welch</i> - m/m selkie mystery romance!</li>
  <li><b>The Lady Hellion</b> by <i>Joanna Shupe</i> - Protagonist poses as a man to solve crimes, love interest grapples with agoraphobia and some sort of other panic attacks</li>
  <li><b>How to Find a Princess</b> by <i>Alyssa Cole</i> - Latest book in a great series full of great poc characters, this one is f/f and protagonist is somehow neurodivergent</li>
  <li><b>The Perks of Loving a Wallflower</b> by <i>Erica Ridley</i> - Lesbian romance, heists, cryptography</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li><b>What did you eat yesterday?</b> (series) by <i>Fumi Yoshinaga</i> - manga mostly about cooking with bits and pieces of cozy m/m romance in between the recipes</li>
  <li><b>Dial A For Aunties</b> by <i>Jesse Q. Sutanto</i> - Protagonist accidentally kills her handsy date, then her mother and 3 aunts help her hide the body while running a massive indo-chinese wedding. Cute funny hijinks ensue.</li>
  <li><b>The Weight of Our Sky</b> by <i>Hanna Alkaf</i> - Reread. Still really brilliant, about a girl dealing ocd or perhaps a djinn during malaysian race riots</li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li><b>A Charm of Magpies</b> (series) by <i>KJ Charles</i> - Particularly charming m/m fantasy romance.</li>
  <li><b>Saint of Steel</b> (series) by <i>T. Kingfisher</i> - Solid comfort food fantasy trilogy for me this past month</li>
  <li><b>Such A Fun Age</b> by <i>Kiley Reid</i> - mostly here for some really upsetting bits that stick in my head, about the importance of someone helping a child feel most loved</li>
  <li><b>Satisfaction Guaranteed</b> by <i>Karelia Stezt-Waters</i> - cute artsy f/f romance, odd couple trope</li>
  <li><b>The Empire of Gold</b> by <i>S.A. Chakraborty</i> - last book in an enjoyable fantasy series</li>
  <li><b>Hench</b> by <i>Natalie Zina Walschots</i></li>
  <li><b>Born in Fire</b> by <i>Nora Roberts</i> - Romance. The love interest annoyed me, but I really liked that the protagonist is a glassblower and how lovingly her art is described</li>
</ul>
