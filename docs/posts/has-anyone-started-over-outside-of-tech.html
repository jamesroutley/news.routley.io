    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone started over outside of tech?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Some days I think that I just want to basically check out of technology on a day to day basis and either develop a skill I have or learn a new one and work maybe part or full-time doing something totally different. Something totally unrelated to sitting in front of a computer.</p><p>Thanks to tech I have a lot of savings. Not enough to retire on early, though maybe starting to be fairly close, so I feel like I could do something like this in the next few years fairly safely, and I wouldn&#39;t feel as much the loss of income if I didn&#39;t have the savings.</p><p>Has anyone here done this and have a story to share, either positive or negative? What did you switch to? How did it work out?</p></div></div></div>
