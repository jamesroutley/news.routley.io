		<p>I noticed something strange earlier this month when I pulled up the Uber app and requested a ride.
</p><ul><li>I had my monthly $15 American Express Uber credit in my account<br/>
</li><li>The price for the ride was displayed net of this credit (rather than full price, just showing the Uber credit as a payment method later)<br/>
</li><li>And the fare seemed higher than usual.  It was also much higher than Lyft.</li></ul>
<p>My hypothesis was that Uber seemed to be picking a higher price <i>because I had credits in my account</i>.  I might be willing to spend more because my ‘real’ out of pocket cost was less, and those credits were trapped <i>anyway</i>.</p>
<p>I decided to use my Uber credits for Uber Eats instead.  That pricing seemed normal.  I need to keep my eye on this.</p>
<p>Reader <b>Charles</b> says he noticed something similar.</p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<ul><li>He regularly pre-books rides with Uber – between the same locations at the same time of day – and generally finds the price to be stable ~ $20 and a bit cheaper than Lyft.
</li><li>He bought Uber gift cards at Costco for a 20% discount to face value.  That’s when things got weird.</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>Loaded first $50 card in my uber account, everything behaved normal. I loaded another $200 before taking Uber to airport, then was surprised to find uber won’t allow payment with uber cash loaded in the account this way for rides scheduled ahead of time. </p>
<p>…then stranger things happened: for same ride I book regularly increased from about $20 to $30!  Just as a sanity check, Lyft is still ~$20 for same ride.</p></blockquote>
<p>He went a step farther and did something I didn’t: he checked Uber prices “with someone else’s phone” who did not have a balance in their Uber account – and Uber was pricing the route at the usual $20 for them.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what’s happening here, but something seems strange and – unsurprisingly – not in a customer-friendly way. At the same time, I’m also not the first person to experience (or think they experienced) this.  Have you seen anything like it?  I’d be curious your experiences, especially once you get Uber credits in your account.  My theory, and it is definitely just that, is this is something they’re testing on a subset of users to learn how customers respond.</p>
<p>Remember when Uber brought in Dara Khosrowshahi from Expedia to be their new CEO, to become kinder and gentler and friendler?  At the time I figured things would get worse because he was literally in charge <i>at Expedia</i>.  But drivers now seem to earn less, even though (because of) tipping.  It’s more expensive to customers, too.  And there’s no more “surge pricing” – they just charge you higher and higher amounts without <i>telling you</i> they’re doing it.</p>
