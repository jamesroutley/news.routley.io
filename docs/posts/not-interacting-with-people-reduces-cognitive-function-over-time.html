    <h1>Not interacting with people reduces cognitive function over time</h1>

<p>Not interacting with people reduces cognitive function over time as studies over the years show that being a part of a group can enhance happiness and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>But sadly, there are lots of lonely or socially isolated people. And if the human brain did indeed develop for social interaction, then we should anticipate this to have a substantial impact.</p>
<p>A recent study published in Neurology indicates that social isolation increases the risk of dementia in older people and is as well associated with changes in brain structure and cognition, which is the mental process of learning.</p>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
<p>The social brain hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the human brain specifically evolved to support social interactions, is already well supported by a large body of research.</p>
<p>In one investigation, the social interaction-related brain areas of almost 7,000 individuals were mapped. It demonstrated a strong relationship between brain regions consistently involved in various social interactions and networks that underpin cognition.</p>
<p>This also includes the default mode network – active when we are not paying attention to the outside world, the salience network, the subcortical network, which is involved in memory, emotion and motivation as well as the central executive network, which enables us to regulate our emotions.</p>
<p>The goal of this research is to learn more about the impact of social isolation on grey matter, which is made up of neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from the UK Biobank which contains information on nearly 500,000 individuals with an average age of 57 was used.</p>
<p>Socially isolated as defined in this case is  a person who lived alone, interacted with other people less frequently than once a month and engaged in social activities less frequently than once a week.</p>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
<p>Approximately 32,000 individuals’ neuroimaging (MRI) results were also included in the study. This demonstrated that those who are socially isolated have lower levels of cognition, including memory and reaction time as well as less grey matter in several areas of the brain.</p>
<p>These regions included the hippocampus, which is a crucial area involved in learning and memory that is typically disrupted early in Alzheimer’s illness, the temporal region, which processes sounds and aids in memory encoding and the frontal lobe, which is involved in attention, planning and complex cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>Future research has to focus more on social isolation to  pinpoint the precise mechanisms underlying its tremendous impact on the brain.</p>  
<p>However, it is evident that if one is alone or lonely, the person may have chronic stress. This has a significant effect on both his or her physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>Another aspect might be that an individual loses some of the functionality of certain brain regions if they don’t use them. According to a study carried out on taxi drivers, the more they memorized addresses and routes, the more their hippocampus volume grew.</p>
<p>So, if one doesn’t participate in social conversation on a regular basis, for instance, it’s probable that the person’s ability to use language and other cognitive functions like attention and memory will decline.</p>
<p>Also, due to the fact that memory and attention are essential for complex cognitive thinking generally, this may impair one’s capacity to perform numerous complicated cognitive tasks.</p>

<h3>Social Isolation Triggers</h3>
<p>What conditions might trigger social isolation or loneliness? A national poll on loneliness conducted in 2019 found that living alone or far from family members increased the chance of loneliness. People who are unsatisfied with their social and family lives are also more likely to say they are lonely than people who are not.</p>
<p>In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness include having a partner, having meaningful daily interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few examples of factors that keep people from socializing and connecting with others.</p>
<h4>Social Isolation and Health</h4>
<p>The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality as an outcome. A considerable body of evidence has accumulated over the last four decades, consisting of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316">numerous meta-analyses</a> and hundreds of large-scale prospective epidemiological investigations.</p>
<p>According to this data, having a strong social network greatly lowers the probability of dying young from any cause. By way of illustration, a meta-analysis of 148 prospective studies discovered that social connection (averaged across a range of criteria) enhances survival probabilities by 50%.</p>
<p>The study “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35676089/">Associations of Social Isolation and Loneliness With Later Dementia”</a> was authored by Chun Shen, Wei Cheng, Guiying Dong, Xing Ming Zhao, Barbara Shahakian, Jianfeng Feng, Edmund Rolls, Jujiao Kang and Chao Xie.</p>
