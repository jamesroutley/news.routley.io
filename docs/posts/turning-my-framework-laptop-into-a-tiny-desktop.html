<p>Many industry pundits were skeptical when the new laptop company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/framework-startup-designed-a-thin-modular-repairable-13-inch-laptop/">Framework announced a repair-friendly, upgrade-ready laptop in 2021</a>. Could you really swap parts between laptops—reasonably thin and lightweight laptops—year over year? Would that even work as a business model?</p>
<p>Framework <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/">released the first edition</a> of its machine, and we found that it lived up to its promises. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/">followed through</a> with a second-generation laptop, and we reviewed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-framework-laptops-13th-gen-intel-upgrade-helps-fix-its-battery-problem/">the third iteration</a> as &#34;a box of parts&#34; that upgraded the previous version. The upgrade experiment has been a success. All that&#39;s left are, well, the parts left behind.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 2023, and those who have Framework&#39;s first generation of laptops, containing Intel&#39;s 11th-generation Core processor) might be itching to upgrade, especially with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/framework-gives-its-modular-laptops-13th-gen-intel-cpus-and-finally-an-amd-option/">an AMD model around the corner</a>. Or maybe, like me, they find that system&#39;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/">middling battery life</a> and <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/high-battery-drain-during-suspend-windows-edition/4421">tricky-to-tame sleep draining</a> (since improved, but not entirely fixed) make for a laptop that doesn&#39;t feel all that portable. Or they&#39;re just ready for something new.</p>
<p>What can you do with these old internal organs? You can always list them for sale. Or, like me, you could buy a custom-printed Cooler Master case (or <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/294573-3d-printable-mainboard-case">3D-print your own</a>), transfer your laptop&#39;s mainboard, memory, and storage over, and create a desktop that easily fits on top of your actual desk. I can&#39;t recommend it enough as a small weekend project, as a way to get more value out of your purchase, and as a thought experiment in what kind of job you can give to a thin little slab of Framework.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Gathering your parts and tools</h2>
<p>It was easy to miss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652939/framework-cooler-master-sff-pc-case">the announcement</a> earlier this year that Framework would <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mainboard-case/framework/">collaborate with Cooler Master</a> to design and sell <a href="https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case">a $40 mainboard case</a>. It&#39;s custom-built to the Framework board&#39;s persistent shape, so it works for whatever version of the Framework 13 laptop you have. It has smoked translucent plastic on the front and inoffensive light gray/beige on the back, and it has all the slots necessary for fan intake and exhaust, the Framework&#39;s USB-C expansion modules, and VESA mounts or a tiny rubberized stand. And there&#39;s a little power button.</p>

<p>I had an 11th-gen i7 Framework, plus a good number of expansion ports. One issue I knew I&#39;d see was the Intel AX200-series card inside, which I&#39;ve seen some Linux-based systems (including ChromeOS) complain about. So I added <a href="https://frame.work/products/ethernet-expansion-card">Framework&#39;s own Ethernet expansion card</a> to my order. This was far from necessary, as I could have used any Ethernet-to-USB-C converter and plugged it into the USB-C receiver for an expansion card. But I preferred the clear plastic to the dongle, so I added it to my order.</p>
<p>There&#39;s room in the case to bring over your audio board (i.e., headphone jack) and a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card, though you&#39;ll have to buy your own SMA antenna cable setup. If you know you aren&#39;t going to use the Framework chassis again and really want Wi-Fi inside your new slab, you could probably pluck the antennae from inside the case, hinge, and monitor bezel, but there&#39;s <a href="https://guides.frame.work/c/Framework_Laptop">no repair guide for that</a> yet.</p>
