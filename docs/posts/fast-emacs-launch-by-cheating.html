    <h1>Fast Emacs Launch (by cheating)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p>TIL about the option to run <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html&lt;em&gt;node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html" target="&lt;/em&gt;blank">emacs as a daemon</a>. It turns out that if you, like me, have sluggish emacs startup times (mine range from 2-3s), you don&#39;t have to settle with waiting each time launch your editor. This solution doesn&#39;t <em>actually</em> speed up startup time, but it allows you to skip startup at most or all launches. This is particularly impactful if you find yourself frequently opening and closing emacs.</p>

<p>There are a couple of options listed in the documentation linked above. I&#39;m trying out <code>emacsclient -c --alternate-editor=&#34;&#34;</code> as my emacs launcher command to lazily start the daemon at first &#34;launch&#34; of emacs (note the <code>-c</code> flag tells <code>emacsclient</code> to launch a new frame instead of opening an existing frame). Alternatively, <code>systemctl</code> can be used to launch the daemon at boot to make the first client launch snappy as well.</p>

<p>I believe this should work for emacs running on most Linux distros. I&#39;m unsure how viable this is to help with startup times on MacOS or Windows.</p>
