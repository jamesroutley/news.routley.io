    <h1>An update on another feed reader from its author</h1>
    
    
<p>
I&#39;ve been hearing from feed reader authors as a result of the whole
&#34;feed reader score&#34; project.  Last week, it was 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/08/03/feedback/">NetNewsWire,</a>
and this week I have an update for Unread Cloud.
</p>
<p>
The author put up a 
<a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/2024/08/feed-polling-for-unread-cloud/">post</a>
which looks at what&#39;s been going on, and explains what happened with the 
poll frequency for a while on that one test instance.  It also has some 
interesting graphs built from the raw &#34;hits&#34; table in the report.
</p>
<p>
I should point out how overwhelmingly reasonable everyone has been for 
this project.  It&#39;s the sort of thing that could go over very badly - 
trust me, I&#39;ve been in the position of &#34;detecting badness&#34; over the 
years at various jobs, and a lot of people do not appreciate it!
</p>
<p>
Instead, we&#39;ve been slowly patching up a few small issues here and there 
across the collective fleet of feed readers, and hopefully this will 
benefit readers and writers both.  Writers get lower &#34;background 
radiation&#34; for their servers, and readers get quicker updates without 
tripping rate limiters.  Everyone wins.
</p>
<p>
To everyone, thank you for your efforts in this ecosystem.
