    <h1>What&#39;s making me happy 2024-01-07</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ok, new year, new attempt at getting back on the<a href="https://github.com/tag/happy"> #happy</a> train. Some content I consumed and enjoyed this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resumed my watching of <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24369">Komi-san</a>. This show continues to be one of the greatest feel-good anime. It&#39;s an interesting look at anxiety, with some wacky anime hijinks thrown in.</li>
<li>I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_and_the_Heron">The Boy and The Heron</a>. Not Ghibli&#39;s best work, but beautiful art and an interesting allegory for grief.</li>
<li>Started this seasons anime of <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=26000">Solo Leveling</a> (action), <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=26334">Frieren</a> (feel good fantasy) and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=27141">The Apothecary Diaries</a> (historical drama / comedy). All three look like they&#39;re going to have great seasons.</li>
<li>Continued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series)">For All Mankind</a>. This show continues to be absolutely wild and some of the best Science Fiction on TV right now.</li>
<li><a href="https://tim.blog/2023/12/29/matt-mullenweg-2/">Matt Mullenweg on the Tim Ferris show</a> was a nice listen. Normally Tim Ferris drives me a bit up the wall, but I enjoyed this discussion.</li>
<li>Listened to a few great episodes of Longform <a href="https://longform.org/player/longform-podcast-555-evan-hughes">Evan Hughes</a>, <a href="https://longform.org/player/longform-podcast-559-craig-mod">Craig Mod</a> and <a href="https://longform.org/player/longform-podcast-562-daisy-alioto">Daisy Alito</a>.</li>
<li>Really enjoyed learning about the history of Intellijel from the podcast <a href="https://www.whywebleep.com/whywebleep/2023/wwbintellijel">Why We Bleep 040: Intellijel</a>.</li>
<li>Also read the latest volume of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29237226-saga-volume-11">Saga</a> which continues to be good, even if it&#39;s getting really weird.</li>
<li>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200089888-blue-lock-vol-22">Blue Lock vol. 22</a> which is getting really boring. It might be time to drop the series.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not really keeping track of newsletters or blog posts I read anymore, that should go into my todo at some point this year. But for now, this is a good starting place.</p>
<p>Hope you all had a good week, happy 2024!</p>
<p>/Nat</p></div></div>
