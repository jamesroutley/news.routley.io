    <h1>Ask HN: Have you experienced “hiring fraud?”</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I put hiring fraud in quotes because I&#39;m not sure what else to call this and there isn&#39;t enough space in a title to explain it.</p><p>Basically my company interviewed a candidate who was fantastic. Checked all the boxes, nailed the interview, and had extremely relevant work experience. We made an offer. He accepted. A few weeks later on his first day the guy in the Zoom was definitely not the guy I interviewed. All the other interviewers agreed. Not the same guy.</p><p>We&#39;ve had a number of candidates in the pipeline who seemed to be obviously lying about their identities who didn&#39;t make it to an offer but this case seemed different somehow. I cant quite put my finger on it.</p><p>I&#39;m just curious to hear how many of you have experienced something similar. Is it common? Is there something obvious I&#39;m not thinking of to help avoid these situations?</p><p>We may have passed on other candidates because of the strength of this one guy. This has put us in a pretty unfortunate position.</p><p>Some maybe noteworthy facts: we&#39;re a 100% remote company. The candidate was US based and said they didn&#39;t need visa sponsorship. They only spoke to one in house recruiter, an HR rep, and 3 people in engineering for the interviews. I discovered after the fact that one of the name brand companies on their resume was actually not the company we thought it was but one with the exact same name in a different industry.</p></div></div></div>
