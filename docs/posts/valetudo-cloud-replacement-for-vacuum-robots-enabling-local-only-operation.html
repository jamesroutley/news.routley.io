    <h1>Valetudo: Cloud replacement for vacuum robots enabling local-only operation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

      <p>
  <h2>Free your vacuum from the cloud</h2>
</p>

<p>Valetudo is an opinionated software solution for cloud-free vacuum robots installed on thousands of robots.</p>

<p>Valetudo is made, managed, maintained and more by me,
<a href="https://hypfer.de" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sören Beye</a>, with occasional contributions by
<a href="https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/graphs/contributors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">these awesome people</a>.</p>

<p>As there is no telemetry built-in and no commercial interest to change that, I can’t tell you how many users exactly are there,
however judging by download counts and support group members, I’d guesstimate that there are a few thousand.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about why someone would want to use something like Valetudo, check out the <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/why-valetudo.html">Why Valetudo?</a> page.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about why someone would <strong>not</strong> want to use something like Valetudo, check out the <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/why-not-valetudo.html">Why not Valetudo?</a> page.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about why I’m building Valetudo, the answer is actually pretty simple:</p>

<p>Valetudo is licensed under the Apache-2.0 open-source license, because you need to be able to know what your smart
devices are doing and also alter (some parts of) it without being dependent on some vendor and/or third party.
The only way of truly achieving that is by being able to see and modify the code.</p>

<p>The Apache-2.0 license is a very permissive license and a lot of work is being shared for free here, so I trust people to not take
advantage of that and sell Valetudo; especially not as their own work.</p>

<p>These are the Valetudo Docs.
Simply use the navigation menu on the left to find what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/getting-started.html">getting started guide</a> is a good place to start.</p>

<h3 id="valetudo-is-a-garden-">Valetudo is a garden <a id="garden"></a></h3>
<p>This project is the hobby of some random guy on the internet. There is no intent to commercialize it, grow it
or expand the target audience of it. In fact, there is intent to explicitly not do that.</p>

<p>Think of Valetudo as a privately-owned public garden. You can visit it any time for free and enjoy it.
You can spend time there, and you can bring an infinite amount of friends with you to enjoy it.
You can walk the pathways built there. You can sit on some patch of grass and maybe watch a Duck or something.
You can leave a tip in the tip jar at the entrance if you really enjoy it and want to support it flourish.</p>

<p>You can take inspiration from it and bring that home to your own garden, giving it a personal twist and adapting it as needed.
You can even make friendly suggestions if you have a really good idea that ties into the vision that is already there.</p>

<p>But, at the end of the day, you must understand that it is still privately-owned. You’re on someone else’s property
over which you have no power at all. You will have to show the necessary respect. And - most importantly - you need to
understand that letting you into this garden is a gift and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>If you don’t like this garden because you don’t like how it’s structured, or you feel like it’s missing something, or maybe
I choose the wrong flowers to plant over there that’s fine. It’s just not for you then. You can leave at any time.</p>

<p>There is simply no ground to stand on to demand change to the garden. It doesn’t matter if it would attract more people
or if all the other gardens in town are doing something in a specific way. It doesn’t matter if your idea of what gardens
even are differs.</p>

<p>When it comes to software development, <em>everyone</em> has access to infinite plots of undeveloped land that they can claim at any time.
Therefore, a garden being build with a specific vision does not take away the ability for anyone else to build their own garden with a different vision.</p>
