    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="my_modal_3" data-svelte-h="svelte-16yiloh"><div> <h3>Welcome to this Visual Sudoku Solver</h3> <p>This app lets you solve Sudoku puzzles by simply pointing your camera at them. It&#39;s a project I built to learn and experiment with computer vision and machine learning.</p> <h3>How to use</h3> <ol><li>Point your camera at the Sudoku puzzle.</li> <li>Make sure the whole grid is visible in the camera frame.</li> <li>Hold still for a few seconds while the app works its magic and fills in the missing numbers.</li></ol> <h3>Tips for best results</h3> <ul><li><strong>Lighting</strong></li> <li><strong>Angle</strong></li> <li><strong>Focus</strong></li></ul> <h3>Known issues</h3> <p>I built this mainly for my own learning, so it&#39;s definitely not perfect. Some more common issues are:</p> <ul><li>Sometimes, the app has trouble recognizing the grid, especially if the lighting is uneven or the puzzle isn&#39;t clear.</li> <li>It might occasionally misread parts of the grid, leading to some errors.</li></ul> <h3>Learn more</h3> <p>If you&#39;d like to learn more about how I built this, I documented a lot of the progress in python notebooks which are <a href="https://github.com/Taiters/sudoku-solver/tree/main/notebooks">available on Github</a>.</p></div></div></div>
