						<p>Apple’s former senior director of corporate law and corporate secrecy has officially admitted to partaking in an insider trading scheme. Gene Levoff was first <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/24/former-top-apple-lawyer-ironically-indicted-for-insider-trading/">indicted for insider trading</a> in 2019, and while he was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/27/fired-apple-lawyer-insider-trading-fight/">initially</a> fighting the charges, he has now admitted to his role in these insider trading transactions. </p>

<p>Levoff started at Apple in 2008 and served as a senior director of corporate law from 2013 until 2018. The trades in question were made between 2011 and 2016, the indictment says.</p>
<p>As reported by <em>Law360</em>, Levoff has admitted to misappropriating nonpublic information about Apple’s financial information; he would then use this information to make trades with Apple stock. In total, the scheme allowed Levoff to generate $227,000 in profit and avoid $377,000 in losses. </p>
<p>When Levoff would know that Apple had strong revenue and net profit for a given financial quarter, he would purchase large quantities of AAPL stock and sell it once the rest of the market reacted to the news. </p>
<p>As we’ve said before, this case is incredibly ironic: one of Levoff’s responsibilities at Apple included enforcing the company’s insider trading policy. In fact, he even informed Apple employees about a trading blackout period for AAPL stock, while also buying and selling the stock himself.</p>
<p>The details of the punishment Levoff will face are still unclear, but each count in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.</p>
