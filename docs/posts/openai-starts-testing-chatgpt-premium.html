            <div><p>Elon Musk-founded research body, Open AI has hinted towards making its viral AI chatbot - ChatGPT a paid service. OpenAI, in an announcement on the company’s official Discord server, said that it’s “starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT” as one of the ways to “ensure long-term viability.”</p>

<p>The paid version of this chatbot will be called ChatGPT Professional. The company has also made a waitlist through Google forms which asks users about the range of prices at which they would like the ChatGPT service to be available and how upset would one be if they can never use the bot again.</p>

<p>OpenAI said that those who fill out the waitlist form may be selected to pilot ChatGPT Professional. However, the program is in the experimental stages and won’t be made widely available “at this time.”</p>

<p>OpenAI&#39;s President &amp; Co-Founder Greg Brockman tweeted the link to the waitlist and said, &#34;Working on a professional version of ChatGPT; will offer higher limits &amp; faster performance.&#34;</p>

<p>This comes over a month after co-founder Sam Altman had said that the service will eventually be monetized.</p>
