<p>During Games Done Quick 2022, <a href="https://twitter.com/Savestate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SaveState</a>, a world record Ocarina of Time speedrunner, showcased many of the elements of the game from the beta version that never made it into the official release.</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t done with a special leaked build of the game, instead, it was pulled off by performing many glitches as well as altering some code in the game. </p>
<p>The many glitches allowed beta content to be added to the game, as well as fan-made content, including the beta version of the Great Fairy, and even a story arc with the Running Man that saw him become a mini-boss fight. The elements that can be found in this speedrun are using cut content from the game, however some of these have been modified to create a new plot for the game, it really can be difficult to know what was in the original beta and what is fan made because it was so well executed. </p>
<p>All of this however was building towards the grand finale which left both the tens of thousands of viewers watching live and the attendees in the venue speechless, with the speedrun ending in a standing ovation from the crowd. </p>
<p><strong>There will be spoilers for the ending of the speedrun from here on. </strong></p>
<p>After learning the Overture of Sages, a song that was rumored to be in the game but it ended up being a hoax, Link was instructed to go and play the song in front of the Master Sword in the Temple of Time. </p>
<p>By doing this, Link was given the option to go to the Sacred Realm, which SaveState did. However, the custom code altered the end of the game in ways no one saw coming.</p>

<p>After a cutscene, Link arrived in a room where he receives the Triforce from a chest. Many viewers assumed this was part of the original ending of the game, but it soon became apparent that it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>The game then displayed a message that after 23 years, millions of players finally saw Link receive the Triforce, indicating that this wasn’t part of the original game. </p>
<p>Link was then granted a wish, with the choices being to become the King of Hyrule, be given lots of Rupees, or see into the future.</p>

<p>SaveState chose to see the future, which is when things got really crazy. The game then transported the viewers to a custom version of Skyward Sword that was being rendered on the Nintendo 64 console in real time. </p>
<p>Zelda then instructed the Twitch chat to type “Here Together”, with thousands of viewers fulfilling her request. The game then began displaying these messages in the game, before the game ended and the credits began rolling.</p>

<p>It was then revealed that a group of 25 fan developers had been working on this for three years, naming it Triforce%. The crowd in the venue then gave a standing ovation, with many Twitch viewers calling it the greatest thing they’ve ever seen in gaming. And to think, it took place during a random Ocarina of Time speedrun with no prior announcement that something exciting was going to happen. </p>
<p>The good news is, if you want to experience this for yourself, the source files have been made public and can be downloaded from the <a href="https://gettriforce.link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer’s website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/triforce-percent/triforce-percent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub page</a> for the source files describes it as,</p>
<blockquote><p>“By modifying the game programming and assets, beta content cut from the final version of OoT is restored and brought to life on screen. A new plot is constructed based on this beta content and on urban legends from the late ’90s, culminating in Link obtaining the Triforce.”</p></blockquote>
