<p>Public awareness of legal sports betting has grown in recent years – and so has the perception that it is a bad thing for society and sports, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.</p>

<p>Today, 43% of U.S. adults say the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a <strong>bad thing for society. </strong>That’s up from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/14/as-more-states-legalize-the-practice-19-of-u-s-adults-say-they-have-bet-money-on-sports-in-the-past-year/">34% in 2022</a>. And 40% of adults now say it’s a <strong>bad thing for sports,</strong> up from 33%.</p>



<p>Despite these increasingly critical views of legal sports betting, many Americans continue to say it has neither a bad nor good impact on society and on sports. Fewer than one-in-five see positive impacts.</p>



<details><summary>About this research</summary>
<p>This Pew Research Center analysis examines recent changes in Americans’ awareness of, attitudes about and personal experiences with sports betting. It comes as more states <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">legalize the practice</a>.</p>



<h4 id="2c86970a0dfb1a0fb6143626d475626a">Why did we do this?</h4>



<p>The Center conducts high-quality research to inform the public, journalists and decision-makers. Studying the public’s views of and experiences with sports betting is part of our long-standing research on social trends, technology and related topics.</p>

<h4 id="61af5ad1ffc78809f7ec505aec15ab69">How did we do this?</h4>



<p>This analysis is based on findings from a survey of 9,916 U.S. adults who are part of the Center’s American Trends Panel. The survey was conducted from July 8 to Aug. 3, 2025. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 1.3 percentage points.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the share of Americans who have bet money on sports in the past year has not changed much since 2022.</p>



<p>Today, 22% of adults say they’ve<strong> personally bet money on sports in the past year.</strong> That’s a slight uptick from 19% three years ago. This figure includes betting in any of three ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>With friends or family, such as in a private betting pool, fantasy league or casual bet</li>



<li>Online with a betting app, sportsbook or casino</li>



<li>In person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this increase has come through <strong>online sports betting:</strong> 10% of adults now say they’ve placed a bet this way in the past year, up from 6% in 2022. There has been no change in the shares of adults who have bet on sports with family or friends or in person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk.</p>



<p>Commercial sports betting has spread rapidly across the United States since a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">Supreme Court ruling in 2018</a> gave states the green light to legalize it. At least 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico now allow commercial sports betting in some form, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>



<p>In our new survey, 63% of adults say they’ve heard or read a lot or a little about the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the U.S. That’s up from 56% in 2022. The increase in public awareness comes as betting-related advertisements <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/44716101/sports-betting-ads-tv-versus-alcohol-study-fantasy-spending-volume">have become common during sports broadcasts</a>.</p>



<p>The rest of this analysis takes a closer look at Americans’ views of and experiences with sports betting. It’s based on the survey of 9,916 U.S. adults, conducted in July and August.</p>

<p>Since 2022, Americans in many demographic groups have become more likely to view the widespread legalization of sports betting as a bad thing for society, as well as for sports.</p>



<p>This is true for men and women; college graduates and non-college graduates; and upper-, middle- and lower-income Americans alike. It is also the case among Democrats and Republicans, as well as among those who have personally placed a sports bet in the past year and those who have not.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest shifts in attitudes about sports betting’s societal impact have come among young Americans – especially young men. <strong>Today, 47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.</strong> Women under 30 have also become more likely to express this view: 35% see legal sports betting as bad for society, up from 25% three years ago.</p>



<p>The legalization of sports betting has <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/state/sports-betting-tax-revenue/">generated revenue for state governments and gambling operators</a>, but it has also raised concerns about <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sports-gambling_NCPGLitRvwExecSummary.pdf">gambling addiction</a> and other societal harms. Critics have also cautioned that it may <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2025/08/bad-bets-the-new-culture-of-sports-gambling/">compromise the integrity of sports</a>. In recent years, several professional and college athletes and team personnel have been punished for violating betting rules.</p>



<details><summary>Recent betting violations in professional sports</summary>
<p>The largest professional sports leagues in North America – including the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) – ban players, and often coaches and other personnel, from betting on their own sports. In some cases, there are also rules about betting on <em>other</em> sports. Punishments for violating the rules range from fines or suspensions to lifetime bans.</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">U.S. Supreme Court’s 2018 decision to allow sports betting</a>, at least 20 professional athletes in these five leagues – as well as one NFL coach and one MLB umpire – have faced disciplinary action for violating their leagues’ gambling policies. All but four of these disciplinary actions took place in 2023 and 2024, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of league announcements and media reports.</p>



<p>More than half of the athletes who have faced disciplinary action (11 of 20) were from the NFL. The rest involved players from MLB (five), MLS (two), the NBA (one) and the NHL (one).</p>



<p>In most cases, players received suspensions, ranging from several games to indefinite. However, in 2024, an <a href="https://abc7news.com/post/tucupita-marcano-gets-lifetime-mlb-ban-betting-baseball/14909938/">MLB player</a> and an <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/jontay-porter-banned-from-nba">NBA player</a> each received permanent bans for betting on their own teams’ games.</p>

<p>As was the case in 2022, some groups of Americans are more likely than others to say they’ve personally bet money on sports in the past year in any of the ways we asked about.</p>



<p><strong>Young adults are more likely than older Americans to say they’ve placed a sports bet in the past year.</strong> Some 31% of adults under 30 say this, including 36% of men and 29% of women in this age group. Sports betting is less common in all older age groups.</p>



<p><strong>Black and Hispanic adults are also especially likely to have bet money on sports in the past year:</strong> 30% and 27%, respectively, say they have done so. Roughly two-in-ten Asian (22%) and White (19%) adults say the same.</p>



<p>There are no differences between college graduates and non-college graduates on this question. In each group, 22% say they have bet on sports in the past year. Nor are there major partisan differences: 24% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they have done so, as have 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners.</p>



<h4 id="who-has-placed-an-online-sports-bet-in-the-past-year">Who has placed an online sports bet in the past year?</h4>



<p>When it comes to <em>online </em>sports betting, young adults and Black Americans again stand out.</p>



<p>Overall, 17% of adults under 30 – including 21% of men and 16% of women in this age group – say they’ve placed an online sports wager in the past year. Three years ago, 7% of those under 30 had done so – including 9% of men and 6% of women.</p>



<p>Among Black adults, 19% say they’ve placed an online sports bet in the past year, up from 10% in 2022. Smaller shares of Hispanic (12%), Asian (11%) and White (8%) adults say they’ve done this in the past year.</p>
