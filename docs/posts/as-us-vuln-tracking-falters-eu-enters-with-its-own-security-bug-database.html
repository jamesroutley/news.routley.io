    <h1>As US vuln-tracking falters, EU enters with its own security bug database</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The European Vulnerability Database (EUVD) is now fully operational, offering a streamlined platform to monitor critical and actively exploited security flaws amid the US struggles with budget cuts, delayed disclosures, and confusion around the future of its own tracking systems.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/">full-fledged version of the website</a> is up and running.</p>
<p>&#34;The EU is now equipped with an essential tool designed to substantially improve the management of vulnerabilities and the risks associated with it,&#34; ENISA Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said in a statement announcing the EUVD. </p>

    

<p>&#34;The database ensures transparency to all users of the affected ICT products and services and will stand as an efficient source of information to find mitigation measures,&#34; Lepassaar continued.</p>

        


        

<p>The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) first announced the project in June 2024 under a mandate from the EU&#39;s Network and Information Security 2 Directive, and quietly rolled out a limited-access beta version last month during a period of uncertainty surrounding the United States&#39; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/25/cve_board_funding/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program</a>. </p>
<p><em>Register</em> readers — especially those tasked with vulnerability management — will recall that the US government&#39;s funding for the CVE program was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/16/homeland_security_funding_for_cve/">set to expire</a> in April until the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, aka CISA, swooped in at the 11th hour and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/16/cve_program_funding_save/">renewed the contract</a> with MITRE to operate the initiative.</p>

        

<p>More broadly, Uncle Sam has been hard at work <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/06/cisa_budget_cuts/">slashing CISA</a> and other <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/08/cisa_cuts_threat_intel/">cybersecurity funding</a> while key federal employees responsible for the US government&#39;s secure-by-design program have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/22/top_cisa_officials_jump_ship/">jumped ship</a>. </p>
<p>Plus, on Monday, CISA said it would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/12/cisa_vulnerabilities_updates_x/">no longer</a> publish routine alerts - including those detailing exploited vulnerabilities - on its public website. Instead, these updates will be delivered via email, RSS feeds, and the agency&#39;s account on X.</p>
<p>With all this, a cybersecurity professional could be forgiven for doubting the US government&#39;s commitment to hardening networks and rooting out vulnerabilities.</p>

        

<p>Enter the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/">EUVD</a>. The EUVD is similar to the US government&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a> (NVD) in that it identifies each disclosed bug (with both a CVE-assigned ID and its <a href="https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/faq" rel="nofollow">own EUVD identifier</a>), notes the vulnerability&#39;s criticality and exploitation status, and links to available advisories and patches.</p>
<p>Unlike the NVD, which is still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/14/security_in_brief/">struggling with a backlog of vulnerability submissions</a> and is not very easy to navigate, the EUVD is updated in near real-time and highlights both critical and exploited vulnerabilities at the top of the site.</p>

<p>The EUVD provides three dashboard views: one for critical vulnerabilities, one for those actively exploited, and one for those coordinated by members of the <a target="_blank" href="https://csirtsnetwork.eu/" rel="nofollow">EU CSIRTs network</a>.</p>
<p>Information is sourced from open-source databases as well as advisories and alerts issued by national CSIRTs, mitigation and patching guidelines published by vendors, and exploited vulnerability details.</p>
<p>ENISA is also a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/another-step-forward-towards-responsible-vulnerability-disclosure-in-europe" rel="nofollow">CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)</a>, meaning it can assign CVE identifiers and coordinate vulnerability disclosures under the CVE program. Even as an active CNA, however, ENISA seems to be in the dark about what&#39;s next for the embattled US-government-funded CVE program, which is only under contract with MITRE until next March.</p>
<p>The launch announcement notes that &#34;ENISA is in contact with MITRE to understand the impact and next steps following the announcement on the funding to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program.&#34; ®</p>
