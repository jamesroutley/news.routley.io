    <h1>French firm Gouach is pitching an Infinite Battery with replaceable cells</h1>

<p>&#34;It was really a setback for the company [Gouach] at the time,&#34; Vallette said. &#34;But we knew that the technology itself was good, so we designed our own casing.&#34; Gouach&#39;s casing is now rated IP67, Vallette said, and meets <a href="https://www.relionbattery.com/blog/what-is-ul2271">UL 2271 standards</a>.</p>

<h2>Unexpected resistance</h2>
<p>There are three avenues for selling the Infinite Battery, as Vallette sees it. One is working with e-bike makers to incorporate Gouach&#39;s tech. Another is targeting e-bike owners and small bike shops who, this far into e-bikes&#39; history, might be dealing with dead batteries. And then there are folks looking to build their own e-bikes.</p>
<p>The Infinite Battery will be made available in 36 V and 48 V builds, and Gouach&#39;s app promises to help owners connect it to a wide variety of bikes. Actually fitting the battery case onto your bike is a different matter. Some bikes can accommodate the Gouach kit where their current battery sits, while others may end up mounting to a rack, or through creative, but hopefully secure, frame attachments.</p>
<p>One of the biggest compatibility challenges, Vallette said, was finding a way to work with Bosch&#39;s mid-drive motors. The communications between a Bosch motor and battery are encrypted; after &#34;a serious effort,&#34; Gouach&#39;s app and battery should work with them, Vallette said.</p>
<p>Gouach, having raised more than $220,000 on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo from about 500 backers, and <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/02/bordeaux-based-gouach-gets-a-e3-3-million-boost-to-launch-its-repairable-batteries-and-bolt-into-the-micro-mobility-market/">$3.5 million in venture funding</a>, is getting close to offering the batteries through its own storefront. Gouach&#39;s <a href="https://gouach.com/pages/roadmap">roadmap</a> puts them in mass production at the moment, with assorted bugs, certifications, and other matters to clear. EU-based backers should get their kits in June, with the US, and an open online store, to follow, barring whatever happens next in international trade. Vallette said in mid-May that the US&#39;s momentary 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports disrupted their plans, but work was underway.</p>
<p>If nothing else, Gouach&#39;s DIY kit shows that a different way of thinking about e-bike batteries—as assemblages, not huge all-in-one consumables—is possible.</p>
