		<p>Set up calls with two corporate recruiters, one who hit me up last week via inMail, one responding to me applying via LinkedIn. Really starting to appreciate Calendly. It eliminates a lot of back and forth in scheduling.</p>
<p>Got a call with blank caller ID except for the state. Sent it to voice mail. They called back a few seconds later. Sent them to voicemail again.</p>
<p>The voicemail they left was basically: “Hello, I’m calling about an HR opportunity. Call me back at XXX-XXX-XXX.” No company, not their own name, no details on what the role might be. Guess who’s not getting called?</p>
<p>Thanks to an Amazon SDM who took some time to sit down with me and talk about the DevEx his developers have: onboarding and ramp up, problems they solve, CI/CD tooling. Any other devs or SDMs who’d be willing to sit down with me and broaden my knowledge on DevEx by talking about their orgs, please DM via <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/gregbulmash">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/LetMyPeopleCode">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h3><b>On the Spam Side</b></h3>
<p>For giggles, I put my resume on Monster with a Google Voice number that is set to “do not disturb.” 2 voicemails and 6 emails. ALL were from boiler room operations where they never check if the role matches your qualifications OR location, and all were automatically filtered to my spam folder without me needing to manually mark them as spam. </p>
<p>And yes, half had “urgent requirement” in the subject line. I don’t know if these recruiters know that’s a red flag. I’ve been telling developers to filter any email with “urgent requirement” in the subject because 99 times out of 100, it’s going to be useless.</p>
