    <h1>Wine on Wayland year-end update: improved functionality and stability</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It has been just over a year since we first <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2021/12/22/wine-on-wayland-year-end-update-improved-functionality-stability/news-and-blog/news-and-events/a-wayland-driver-for-wine.html">announced</a> our effort to implement a Wayland driver for Wine. Since then a lot of work has been done to improve the functionality and stability of the driver, and to provide a cleaner and more upstreamable patchset. This work continues as we expand our testing and receive valuable feedback from the community.</p>
<p>The Wine Wayland driver currently supports (minus any bugs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Window state handling: resizing, maximization, minimization (often no proper minimized window contents, though), fullscreen.</li>
<li>OpenGL and Vulkan (including using WineD3D and DXVK).</li>
<li>Display mode changes (emulated with Wayland compositor scaling, rather than real display hardware mode changes).</li>
<li>Multiple monitors.</li>
<li>Mouse capture/clipping/relative motion (but note that Wayland compositors don&#39;t tend to deal with non-fullscreen cases very well).</li>
<li>Popups, menus and other transient windows (except when cross-process, see below).</li>
<li>Keymaps set/updated from the Wayland compositor should work transparently.</li>
<li>HiDPI scaling (configurable to use either application/Wine or Wayland compositor scaling).</li>
<li>Copy/paste both ways, drag and drop in the direction from native Wayland to Wine.</li>
<li>Systray (minus right-click menu positioning)</li>
</ul>
<p>A currently open issue is related to cross-process rendering, which is particularly relevant for Chromium/CEF based applications, like some game stores applications. For now, such applications require workarounds to function properly, but we have a few ideas about how to resolve these issues, which we plan to explore in the coming months.</p>
<p>For more information about known issues (and their workarounds), the current state of the Wayland driver and the next steps, we encourage you to visit the related <a href="https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2021-December/203035.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion</a> in the wine-devel mailing list.</p>
<p>Below is video of some applications and games running on the latest version of the Wine Wayland driver. Enjoy!</p>
