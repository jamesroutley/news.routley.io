    <h1>Social Media</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>I’m sorry for my lack of posts. I’ll keep things brief, I’ve had a really
really hard time after coming out, and trying to find a stable life. I’ve been struggling with depression and I’ve been courting suicide. But I have good support now, a little chosen family, and I’m getting better.</p><p>I like how social media connects us when we are isolated, but I dont like how the technology constantly demands our attention, especially when you need more of your energy and focus for healing. I’ve put together a few quick hacks for creating some space between you, your iphone, and social media apps.</p><h2 id="creating-mindful-breaks-with-shortcuts">Creating Mindful Breaks with Shortcuts</h2><p>I begin by introducing moments of pause. I use the Shortcuts app to create a sequence that reminds me to breathe for 60 seconds before opening apps like Instagram or Signal.</p><ol><li><strong>Open Shortcuts App</strong>: Create a new shortcut.</li><li><strong>Set a Notification</strong>: Add a ‘Show Notification’ action for a breathing reminder.</li><li><strong>Pause</strong>: Insert a ‘Wait’ action for 60 seconds.</li><li><strong>Open the App</strong>: Add the ‘Open App’ action for your choice, and choose Instagram.</li><li><strong>Homescreen</strong>: Add the shortcut to your homescreen to replace Instagram.</li></ol><h2 id="managing-usage-with-screen-time">Managing Usage with Screen Time</h2><p>Next I set boundaries for my app usage with Screen Time.</p><ol><li><strong>Enable Screen Time</strong>: Find it in your Settings.</li><li><strong>App Limits</strong>: Set daily limits for specific apps.</li><li><strong>Downtime</strong>: Schedule periods where only essential apps are available.</li></ol><h2 id="organizing-to-hide-apps">Organizing To Hide Apps</h2><p>Finally, I organize my apps to hide them from my Home Screen.</p><ol><li><strong>Create Folders</strong>: Drag one app onto another to create folders. Name them meaningfully.</li><li><strong>Move Apps to Different Home Screens</strong>: Drag apps to the edge of the screen to move them to another Home Screen.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope these tips help someone. I’m going to try to write and make more. Sending kindness to my reader. I hope you are well.</p></div></div>
