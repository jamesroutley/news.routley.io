The judge said the artists could file an amended complaint against the two companies, whose systems utilize Stability&#39;s Stable Diffusion text-to-image technology.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Orrick also dismissed McKernan and Ortiz&#39;s copyright infringement claims entirely. The judge allowed Andersen to continue pursuing her key claim that Stability&#39;s alleged use of her work to train Stable Diffusion infringed her copyrights.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The same allegation is at the heart of <a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/legal/john-grisham-other-top-us-authors-sue-openai-over-copyrights-2023-09-20/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">other lawsuits</a> brought by artists, authors and other copyright owners against generative AI companies.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;Even Stability recognizes that determination of the truth of these allegations – whether copying in violation of the Copyright Act occurred in the context of training Stable Diffusion or occurs when Stable Diffusion is run – cannot be resolved at this juncture,&#34; Orrick said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The artists&#39; attorneys Joseph Saveri and Matthew Butterick said in a statement that their &#34;core claim&#34; survived, and that they were confident that they could address the court&#39;s concerns about their other claims in an amended complaint to be filed next month.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">A spokesperson for Stability declined to comment on the decision. Representatives for Midjourney and DeviantArt did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">The artists said in their <a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/legal/transactional/lawsuits-accuse-ai-content-creators-misusing-copyrighted-work-2023-01-17/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">January complaint</a> that Stability used billions of images &#34;scraped&#34; from the internet, including theirs, without permission to teach Stable Diffusion to create its own images.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Orrick agreed with all three companies that the images the systems actually created likely did not infringe the artists&#39; copyrights. He allowed the claims to be amended but said he was &#34;not convinced&#34; that allegations based on the systems&#39; output could survive without showing that the images were substantially similar to the artists&#39; work.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">The judge also dismissed other claims from the artists, including that the companies violated their publicity rights and competed with them unfairly, with permission to refile.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Orrick dismissed McKernan and Ortiz&#39;s copyright claims because they had not registered their images with the U.S. Copyright Office, a requirement for bringing a copyright lawsuit.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The case is Andersen v. Stability AI Ltd, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, No. 3:23-cv-00201.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">For the artists: Joseph Saveri of Joseph Saveri Law Firm; and Matthew Butterick</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">For Stability: Paul Schoenhard of Fried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">For Midjourney: Angela Dunning of Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">For DeviantArt: Andy Gass of Latham &amp; Watkins</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Read more:</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17"><a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/legal/transactional/lawsuits-accuse-ai-content-creators-misusing-copyrighted-work-2023-01-17/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">Lawsuits accuse AI content creators of misusing copyrighted work</a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-18"><a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/legal/ai-companies-ask-us-court-dismiss-artists-copyright-lawsuit-2023-04-19/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">AI companies ask U.S. court to dismiss artists&#39; copyright lawsuit</a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-19"><a data-testid="Link" href="https://ntietz.com/legal/litigation/us-judge-finds-flaws-artists-lawsuit-against-ai-companies-2023-07-19/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">US judge finds flaws in artists&#39; lawsuit against AI companies</a></p><p data-testid="Body">Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington</p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p><div><address><p data-testid="Body">Blake Brittain reports on intellectual property law, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, for Reuters Legal.
