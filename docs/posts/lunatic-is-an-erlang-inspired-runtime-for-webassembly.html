    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="about"><strong>Lunatic</strong> is an Erlang-inspired runtime for WebAssembly</p><p>Lunatic is a<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic/releases" target="_blank">single executable</a> <!-- -->and runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It spawns lightweight processes from WebAssembly modules that have their own heap/stack. These processes are preemptively scheduled on a multi-threaded executor.</p><h2>Processes</h2><p>Lunatic&#39;s design is all about super <em>lightweight</em> <!-- -->processes. Processes are fast to create, have a small memory footprint and a low scheduling overhead. They are designed for massive concurrency.</p><h2>Isolation</h2><p>Lunatic sits between your operating system and the running processes. This allows it to decide on a per process basis what<!-- --> <em>syscalls</em> are going to be forwarded to the operating systems.</p></div></div>
