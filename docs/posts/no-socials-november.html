    <h1>No Socials November</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>November seems to be a ripe month for challenges. Some people grow facial hair. Some people write many words daily hoping to come out with a novel on the other side. I’m sure there are five other such efforts that I’m not aware of.</p>
<p>For me, I’m going to <a href="https://bjhess.com/posts/unplugging-two-weeks-later">continue</a> my push away from social networks. I’ve logged out of all personal accounts, set my YouTube to stop suggesting to me via algorithm, and even found myself logged out of Reddit yesterday. I’m set to have a no socials November!</p>
<p>Maybe some of you reading my blog are also finding yourself overly pulled by the lure of social networking and tempted to take a break? Perhaps join me and see how it feels? Log out, delete the apps from your phone, and start the challenging process of breaking that muscle memory today. I believe in a week you’ll feel pretty good about the decision.</p>
<p>No pressure to stay off socials after November is over. You may decide you want to go back to your same relationship with social networking in December. You may decide you want to go back, but differently. You may decide you want to stay away.</p>
<p>I might try to blog more. I might not. We’ll see! If you’d like to try blogging as an alternative, I recommend  my good friend, <a href="https://pika.page/">Pika</a>. In solidarity with #nosocialsnovember, there’s even a NOSOCIALSNOVEMBER coupon code for 15% off your first year of the service.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts to share about stepping away from socials, email me via the link below. And if you’re blogging, let me know! I’d love to follow what you’re writing.</p>
