<h4><a name="tag_20_146_03" id="tag_20_146_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This utility shall be provided on systems that both support the User Portability Utilities option and define the
POSIX2_CHAR_TERM symbol. On other systems it is optional.</p>
<p>The <i>vi</i> (visual) utility is a screen-oriented text editor. Only the open and visual modes of the editor are described in
POSIX.1-2024; see the line editor <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> for additional editing capabilities used in
<i>vi</i>. The user can switch back and forth between <i>vi</i> and <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> and execute
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> commands from within <i>vi</i>.</p>
<p>This reference page uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe the current working text. No specific implementation is implied
by this term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no changes to it shall affect any file until an editor
command writes the file.</p>
<p>When using <i>vi</i>, the terminal screen acts as a window into the editing buffer. Changes made to the editing buffer shall be
reflected in the screen display; the position of the cursor on the screen shall indicate the position within the editing
buffer.</p>
<p>Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to support the complete <i>vi</i> definition. When these commands
cannot be supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an error message such as &#34;not an editor command&#34; or
report a syntax error. The implementation may either accept the commands and produce results on the screen that are the result of
an unsuccessful attempt to meet the requirements of this volume of POSIX.1-2024 or report an error describing the terminal-related
deficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the terminal does not have the capabilities necessary to support an unspecified portion of the <i>vi</i> definition,
implementations shall start initially in <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> mode or open mode. Otherwise, after
initialization, <i>vi</i> shall be in command mode; text input mode can be entered by one of several commands used to insert or
change text. In text input mode, &lt;ESC&gt; can be used to return to command mode; other uses of &lt;ESC&gt; are described later
in this section; see <a href="#tag_20_146_13_16">Terminate Command or Input Mode</a>.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_13_01" id="tag_20_146_13_01"></a>Initialization in ex and vi</h5>

<h5><a name="tag_20_146_13_02" id="tag_20_146_13_02"></a>Command Descriptions in vi</h5>
<p>The following symbols are used in this reference page to represent arguments to commands.</p>
<dl compact="">
<dd></dd>
<dt><i>buffer</i></dt>
<dd>See the description of <i>buffer</i> in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section of the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a>
utility; see <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html#tag_20_40_13_10"><i>Command Descriptions in ex</i></a>.
<p>In open and visual mode, when a command synopsis shows both [<i>buffer</i>] and [<i>count</i>] preceding the command name, they
can be specified in either order.</p>
</dd>
<dt><i>count</i></dt>
<dd>A positive integer used as an optional argument to most commands, either to give a repeat count or as a size. This argument is
optional and shall default to 1 unless otherwise specified.
<p>The Synopsis lines for the <i>vi</i> commands &lt;control&gt;-G, &lt;control&gt;-L, &lt;control&gt;-R, &lt;control&gt;-],
<b>%</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>^</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>U</b>, and <b>ZZ</b> do not have <i>count</i> as
an optional argument. Regardless, it shall not be an error to specify a <i>count</i> to these commands, and any specified
<i>count</i> shall be ignored.</p>
</dd>
<dt><i>motion</i></dt>
<dd>An optional trailing argument used by the <b>!</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, and <b>y</b> commands, which
is used to indicate the region of text that shall be affected by the command. The motion can be either one of the command
characters repeated or one of several other <i>vi</i> commands (listed in the following table). Each of the applicable commands
specifies the region of text matched by repeating the command; each command that can be used as a motion command specifies the
region of text it affects.
<p>Commands that take <i>motion</i> arguments operate on either lines or characters, depending on the circumstances. When operating
on lines, all lines that fall partially or wholly within the text region specified for the command shall be affected. When
operating on characters, only the exact characters in the specified text region shall be affected. Each motion command specifies
this individually.</p>
<p>When commands that may be motion commands are not used as motion commands, they shall set the current position to the current
line and column as specified.</p>
<p>The following commands shall be valid cursor motion commands:</p>
<pre><tt>&lt;apostrophe&gt;       (    -    j    H
&lt;carriage-return&gt;  )    $    k    L
&lt;comma&gt;            [[   %    l    M
&lt;control&gt;-H        ]]   _    n    N
&lt;control&gt;-N        {    ;    t    T
&lt;control&gt;-P        }    ?    w    W
&lt;grave-accent&gt;     ^    b    B
&lt;newline&gt;          +    e    E
&lt;space&gt;            |    f    F
&lt;zero&gt;             /    h    G
</tt></pre>
<p>Any <i>count</i> that is specified to a command that has an associated motion command shall be applied to the motion command. If
a <i>count</i> is applied to both the command and its associated motion command, the effect shall be multiplicative.</p>

<dt><i>bigword</i></dt>
<dd>In the POSIX locale, <i>vi</i> shall recognize four kinds of <i>bigwords</i>:

<li>
<p>A maximal sequence of non-&lt;blank&gt; characters preceded and followed by &lt;blank&gt; characters or the beginning or end of
a line or the edit buffer</p>

</dd>
<dt><i>word</i></dt>
<dd>In the POSIX locale, <i>vi</i> shall recognize five kinds of words:
<ol>
<li>
<p>A maximal sequence of letters, digits, and underscores, delimited at both ends by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Characters other than letters, digits, or underscores</p>

<p>In the remainder of the description of the <i>vi</i> utility, the term &#34;buffer line&#34; refers to a line in the edit buffer and
the term &#34;display line&#34; refers to the line or lines on the display screen used to display one buffer line. The term &#34;current
line&#34; refers to a specific &#34;buffer line&#34;.</p>
<p>If there are display lines on the screen for which there are no corresponding buffer lines because they correspond to lines that
would be after the end of the file, they shall be displayed as a single &lt;tilde&gt; (<tt>&#39;~&#39;</tt>) character, plus the
terminating &lt;newline&gt;.</p>
<p>The last line of the screen shall be used to report errors or display informational messages. It shall also be used to display
the input for &#34;line-oriented commands&#34; (<b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>:</b>, and <b>!</b>). When a line-oriented command is executed,
the editor shall enter text input mode on the last line on the screen, using the respective command characters as prompt
characters. (In the case of the <b>!</b> command, the associated motion shall be entered by the user before the editor enters text
input mode.) The line entered by the user shall be terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;, a non-&lt;control&gt;-V-escaped
&lt;carriage-return&gt;, or unescaped &lt;ESC&gt;. It is unspecified if more characters than require a display width minus one
column number of screen columns can be entered.</p>
<p>If any command is executed that overwrites a portion of the screen other than the last line of the screen (for example, the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> <b>suspend</b> or <b>!</b> commands), other than the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> <b>shell</b> command, the user shall be prompted for a character before the screen is
refreshed and the edit session continued.</p>
<p>&lt;tab&gt; characters shall take up the number of columns on the screen set by the <b>tabstop</b> edit option (see <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a>), unless there are less than that number of columns before the display margin that will cause
the displayed line to be folded; in this case, they shall only take up the number of columns up to that boundary.</p>
<p>The cursor shall be placed on the current line and relative to the current column as specified by each command described in the
following sections.</p>
<p>In open mode, if the current line is not already displayed, then it shall be displayed.</p>
<p>In visual mode, if the current line is not displayed, then the lines that are displayed shall be expanded, scrolled, or redrawn
to cause an unspecified portion of the current line to be displayed. If the screen is redrawn, no more than the number of display
lines specified by the value of the <b>window</b> edit option shall be displayed (unless the current line cannot be completely
displayed in the number of display lines specified by the <b>window</b> edit option) and the current line shall be positioned as
close to the center of the displayed lines as possible (within the constraints imposed by the distance of the line from the
beginning or end of the edit buffer). If the current line is before the first line in the display and the screen is scrolled, an
unspecified portion of the current line shall be placed on the first line of the display. If the current line is after the last
line in the display and the screen is scrolled, an unspecified portion of the current line shall be placed on the last line of the
display.</p>
<p>In visual mode, if a line from the edit buffer (other than the current line) does not entirely fit into the lines at the bottom
of the display that are available for its presentation, the editor may choose not to display any portion of the line. The lines of
the display that do not contain text from the edit buffer for this reason shall each consist of a single <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt>
character.</p>
<p>In visual mode, the editor may choose for unspecified reasons to not update lines in the display to correspond to the underlying
edit buffer text. The lines of the display that do not correctly correspond to text from the edit buffer for this reason shall
consist of a single <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> character (plus the terminating &lt;newline&gt;), and the &lt;control&gt;-R command shall cause
the editor to update the screen to correctly represent the edit buffer.</p>
<p>Open and visual mode commands that set the current column set it to a column position in the display, and not a character
position in the line. In this case, however, the column position in the display shall be calculated for an infinite width display;
for example, the column related to a character that is part of a line that has been folded onto additional screen lines is offset
from the display line column where the buffer line begins, not from the beginning of a particular display line.</p>
<p>The display cursor column in the display is based on the value of the current column, as follows, with each rule applied in
turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the current column is after the last display line column used by the displayed line, the display cursor column shall be set
to the last display line column occupied by the last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the current line; otherwise, the display cursor column
shall be set to the current column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the character of which some portion is displayed in the display line column specified by the display cursor column requires
more than a single display line column:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If in text input mode, the display cursor column shall be adjusted to the first display line column in which any portion of that
character is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the display cursor column shall be adjusted to the last display line column in which any portion of that character is
displayed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The current column shall not be changed by these adjustments to the display cursor column.</p>
<p>If an error occurs during the parsing or execution of a <i>vi</i> command:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The terminal shall be alerted. Execution of the <i>vi</i> command shall stop, and the cursor (for example, the current line and
column) shall not be further modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specified by the following command sections, it is unspecified whether an informational message shall be
displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any partially entered <i>vi</i> command shall be discarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <i>vi</i> command resulted from a <b>map</b> expansion, all characters from that <b>map</b> expansion shall be discarded,
except as otherwise specified by the <b>map</b> command (see <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <i>vi</i> command resulted from the execution of a buffer, no further commands caused by the execution of the buffer
shall be executed.</p>
</li>

<p>If the input line contains no non-&lt;newline&gt; characters, it shall be equivalent to a line containing only the last regular
expression encountered. The enhanced regular expressions supported by <i>vi</i> are described in <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html#tag_20_40_13_58"><i>Regular Expressions in ex</i></a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the line shall be interpreted as one or more regular expressions, optionally followed by an address offset or a
<i>vi</i> <b>z</b> command.</p>
<p>If the regular expression is not the last regular expression on the line, or if a line offset or <b>z</b> command is specified,
the regular expression shall be terminated by an unescaped <tt>&#39;/&#39;</tt> character, which shall not be used as part of the regular
expression. If the regular expression is not the first regular expression on the line, it shall be preceded by zero or more
&lt;blank&gt; characters, a &lt;semicolon&gt;, zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, and a leading <tt>&#39;/&#39;</tt> character, which
shall not be interpreted as part of the regular expression. It shall be an error to precede any regular expression with any
characters other than these.</p>
<p>Each search shall begin from the character after the first character of the last match (or, if it is the first search, after the
cursor). If the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option is set, the search shall continue to the character before the starting cursor
character; otherwise, to the end of the edit buffer. It shall be an error if any search fails to find a match, and an informational
message to this effect shall be displayed.</p>
<p>An optional address offset (see <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html#tag_20_40_13_02"><i>Addressing in ex</i></a>) can be specified
after the last regular expression by including a trailing <tt>&#39;/&#39;</tt> character after the regular expression and specifying the
address offset. This offset shall be from the line containing the match for the last regular expression specified. It shall be an
error if the line offset would indicate a line address less than 1 or greater than the last line in the edit buffer. An address
offset of zero shall be supported. It shall be an error to follow the address offset with any other characters than &lt;blank&gt;
characters.</p>
<p>If not used as a motion command, an optional <b>z</b> command (see <a href="#tag_20_146_13_86">Redraw Window</a>) can be
specified after the last regular expression by including a trailing <tt>&#39;/&#39;</tt> character after the regular expression, zero or
more &lt;blank&gt; characters, a <tt>&#39;z&#39;</tt>, zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, an optional new <b>window</b> edit option
value, zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, and a location character. The effect shall be as if the <b>z</b> command was executed
after the <b>/</b> command. It shall be an error to follow the <b>z</b> command with any other characters than &lt;blank&gt;
characters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>See the RATIONALE for <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> for more information on <i>vi</i>. Major portions of the
<i>vi</i> utility specification point to <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> to avoid inadvertent divergence. While
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> and <i>vi</i> have historically been implemented as a single utility, this is not
required by POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<p>It is recognized that portions of <i>vi</i> would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement satisfactorily on a block-mode
terminal, or a terminal without any form of cursor addressing, thus it is not a mandatory requirement that such features should
work on all terminals. It is the intention, however, that a <i>vi</i> implementation should provide the full set of capabilities on
all terminals capable of supporting them.</p>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> exited immediately if the standard input was not a terminal. POSIX.1-2024 permits, but does not require,
this behavior. An end-of-file condition is not equivalent to an end-of-file character. A common end-of-file character,
&lt;control&gt;-D, is historically a <i>vi</i> command.</p>
<p>The text in the STDOUT section reflects the usage of the verb <i>display</i> in this section; some implementations of <i>vi</i>
use standard output to write to the terminal, but POSIX.1-2024 does not require that to be the case.</p>
<p>Historically, implementations reverted to open mode if the terminal was incapable of supporting full visual mode. POSIX.1-2024
requires this behavior. Historically, the open mode of <i>vi</i> behaved roughly equivalently to the visual mode, with the
exception that only a single line from the edit buffer (one &#34;buffer line&#34;) was kept current at any time. This line was normally
displayed on the next-to-last line of a terminal with cursor addressing (and the last line performed its normal visual functions
for line-oriented commands and messages). In addition, some few commands behaved differently in open mode than in visual mode.
POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p>Historically, <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> and <i>vi</i> implementations have expected text to proceed in the
usual European/Latin order of left to right, top to bottom. There is no requirement in POSIX.1-2024 that this be the case. The
specification was deliberately written using words like &#34;before&#34;, &#34;after&#34;, &#34;first&#34;, and &#34;last&#34; in order to permit
implementations to support the natural text order of the language.</p>
<p>Historically, lines past the end of the edit buffer were marked with single &lt;tilde&gt; (<tt>&#39;~&#39;</tt>) characters; that is, if
the one-based display was 20 lines in length, and the last line of the file was on line one, then lines 2-20 would contain only a
single <tt>&#39;~&#39;</tt> character.</p>
<p>Historically, the <i>vi</i> editor attempted to display only complete lines at the bottom of the screen (it did display partial
lines at the top of the screen). If a line was too long to fit in its entirety at the bottom of the screen, the screen lines where
the line would have been displayed were displayed as single <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> characters, instead of displaying part of the line.
POSIX.1-2024 permits, but does not require, this behavior. Implementations are encouraged to attempt always to display a complete
line at the bottom of the screen when doing scrolling or screen positioning by buffer lines.</p>
<p>Historically, lines marked with <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> were also used to minimize output to dumb terminals over slow lines; that is,
changes local to the cursor were updated, but changes to lines on the screen that were not close to the cursor were simply marked
with an <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> sign instead of being updated to match the current text. POSIX.1-2024 permits, but does not require this
feature because it is used ever less frequently as terminals become smarter and connections are faster.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_01" id="tag_20_146_18_01"></a>Initialization in ex and vi</h5>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> always had a line in the edit buffer, even if the edit buffer was &#34;empty&#34;. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> command <b>=</b> executed from visual mode wrote &#34;1&#34; when the buffer was
empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writes from visual mode of an empty edit buffer wrote files of a single character (a &lt;newline&gt;), while writes from
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> mode of an empty edit buffer wrote empty files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put and read commands into an empty edit buffer left an empty line at the top of the edit buffer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For consistency, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit any of these behaviors.</p>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> did not always return the terminal to its original modes; for example, ICRNL was modified if it was not
originally set. POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_02" id="tag_20_146_18_02"></a>Command Descriptions in vi</h5>
<p>Motion commands are among the most complicated aspects of <i>vi</i> to describe. With some exceptions, the text region and
buffer type effect of a motion command on a <i>vi</i> command are described on a case-by-case basis. The descriptions of text
regions in POSIX.1-2024 are not intended to imply direction; that is, an inclusive region from line <i>n</i> to line <i>n</i>+5 is
identical to a region from line <i>n</i>+5 to line <i>n</i>. This is of more than academic interest—movements to marks can be in
either direction, and, if the <b>wrapscan</b> option is set, so can movements to search points. Historically, lines are always
stored into buffers in text order; that is, from the start of the edit buffer to the end. POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>
<p>Historically, command counts were applied to any associated motion, and were multiplicative to any supplied motion count. For
example, <b>2cw</b> is the same as <b>c2w</b>, and <b>2c3w</b> is the same as <b>c6w</b>. POSIX.1-2024 requires this behavior.
Historically, <i>vi</i> commands that used bigwords, words, paragraphs, and sentences as objects treated groups of empty lines, or
lines that contained only &lt;blank&gt; characters, inconsistently. Some commands treated them as a single entity, while others
treated each line separately. For example, the <b>w</b>, <b>W</b>, and <b>B</b> commands treated groups of empty lines as
individual words; that is, the command would move the cursor to each new empty line. The <b>e</b> and <b>E</b> commands treated
groups of empty lines as a single word; that is, the first use would move past the group of lines. The <b>b</b> command would just
beep at the user, or if done from the start of the line as a motion command, fail in unexpected ways. If the lines contained only
(or ended with) &lt;blank&gt; characters, the <b>w</b> and <b>W</b> commands would just beep at the user, the <b>E</b> and <b>e</b>
commands would treat the group as a single word, and the <b>B</b> and <b>b</b> commands would treat the lines as individual words.
For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 requires that all <i>vi</i> commands treat groups of empty or blank
lines as a single entity, and that movement through lines ending with &lt;blank&gt; characters be consistent with other
movements.</p>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> documentation indicated that any number of double-quotes were skipped after punctuation marks at
sentence boundaries; however, implementations only skipped single-quotes. POSIX.1-2024 requires both to be skipped.</p>
<p>Historically, the first and last characters in the edit buffer were word boundaries. This historical practice is required by
POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> attempted to update the minimum number of columns on the screen possible, which could lead to misleading
information being displayed. POSIX.1-2024 makes no requirements other than that the current character being entered is displayed
correctly, leaving all other decisions in this area up to the implementation.</p>
<p>Historically, lines were arbitrarily folded between columns of any characters that required multiple column positions on the
screen, with the exception of tabs, which terminated at the right-hand margin. POSIX.1-2024 permits the former and requires the
latter. Implementations that do not arbitrarily break lines between columns of characters that occupy multiple column positions
should not permit the cursor to rest on a column that does not contain any part of a character.</p>
<p>The historical <i>vi</i> had a problem in that all movements were by buffer lines, not by display or screen lines. This is often
the right thing to do; for example, single line movements, such as <b>j</b> or <b>k</b>, should work on buffer lines. Commands like
<b>dj</b>, or <b>j.</b>, where <b>.</b> is a change command, only make sense for buffer lines. It is not, however, the right thing
to do for screen motion or scrolling commands like &lt;control&gt;-D, &lt;control&gt;-F, and <b>H</b>. If the window is fairly
small, using buffer lines in these cases can result in completely random motion; for example, <b>1</b>&lt;control&gt;<b>-D</b> can
result in a completely changed screen, without any overlap. This is clearly not what the user wanted. The problem is even worse in
the case of the <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and <b>M</b> commands—as they position the cursor at the first non-&lt;blank&gt; of the line,
they may all refer to the same location in large lines, and will result in no movement at all.</p>
<p>In addition, if the line is larger than the screen, using buffer lines can make it impossible to display parts of the line—there
are not any commands that do not display the beginning of the line in historical <i>vi</i>, and if both the beginning and end of
the line cannot be on the screen at the same time, the user suffers. Finally, the page and half-page scrolling commands
historically moved to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; in the new line. If the line is approximately the same size as the screen, this
is inadequate because the cursor before and after a &lt;control&gt;-D command will refer to the same location on the screen.</p>
<p>Implementations of <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> and <i>vi</i> exist that do not have these problems because the
relevant commands (&lt;control&gt;-B, &lt;control&gt;-D, &lt;control&gt;-F, &lt;control&gt;-U, &lt;control&gt;-Y,
&lt;control&gt;-E, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and <b>M)</b> operate on display (screen) lines, not (edit) buffer lines.</p>
<p>POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior by default because the standard developers believed that users would find it too
confusing. However, historical practice has been relaxed. For example, <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> and <i>vi</i>
historically attempted, albeit sometimes unsuccessfully, to never put part of a line on the last lines of a screen; for example, if
a line would not fit in its entirety, no part of the line was displayed, and the screen lines corresponding to the line contained
single <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> characters. This behavior is permitted, but not required by POSIX.1-2024, so that it is possible for
implementations to support long lines in small screens more reasonably without changing the commands to be oriented to the display
(instead of oriented to the buffer). POSIX.1-2024 also permits implementations to refuse to edit any edit buffer containing a line
that will not fit on the screen in its entirety.</p>
<p>The display area (for example, the value of the <b>window</b> edit option) has historically been &#34;grown&#34;, or expanded, to
display new text when local movements are done in displays where the number of lines displayed is less than the maximum possible.
Expansion has historically been the first choice, when the target line is less than the maximum possible expansion value away.
Scrolling has historically been the next choice, done when the target line is less than half a display away, and otherwise, the
screen was redrawn. There were exceptions, however, in that <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> commands generally always
caused the screen to be redrawn. POSIX.1-2024 does not specify a standard behavior because there may be external issues, such as
connection speed, the number of characters necessary to redraw as opposed to scroll, or terminal capabilities that implementations
will have to accommodate.</p>
<p>The current line in POSIX.1-2024 maps one-to-one to a buffer line in the file. The current column does not. There are two
different column values that are described by POSIX.1-2024. The first is the current column value as set by many of the <i>vi</i>
commands. This value is remembered for the lifetime of the editor. The second column value is the actual position on the screen
where the cursor rests. The two are not always the same. For example, when the cursor is backed by a multi-column character, the
actual cursor position on the screen has historically been the last column of the character in command mode, and the first column
of the character in input mode.</p>
<p>Commands that set the current line, but that do not set the current cursor value (for example, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b>) attempt to
get as close as possible to the remembered column position, so that the cursor tends to restrict itself to a vertical column as the
user moves around in the edit buffer. POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to historical practice, requiring that the display location
of the cursor on the display line be adjusted from the current column value as necessary to support this historical behavior.</p>
<p>Historically, only a single line (and for some terminals, a single line minus 1 column) of characters could be entered by the
user for the line-oriented commands; that is, <b>:</b>, <b>!</b>, <b>/</b>, or <b>?</b>. POSIX.1-2024 permits, but does not
require, this limitation.</p>
<p>Historically, &#34;soft&#34; errors in <i>vi</i> caused the terminal to be alerted, but no error message was displayed. As a general
rule, no error message was displayed for errors in command execution in <i>vi</i>, when the error resulted from the user attempting
an invalid or impossible action, or when a searched-for object was not found. Examples of soft errors included <b>h</b> at the left
margin, &lt;control&gt;-B or <b>[[</b> at the beginning of the file, <b>2G</b> at the end of the file, and so on. In addition,
errors such as <b>%</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>}</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>n</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>T</b> failing to
find the searched-for object were soft as well. Less consistently, <b>/</b> and <b>?</b> displayed an error message if the pattern
was not found, <b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>N</b>, and <b>n</b> displayed an error message if no previous regular expression had been
specified, and <b>;</b> did not display an error message if no previous <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, or <b>T</b> command had
occurred. Also, behavior in this area might reasonably be based on a runtime evaluation of the speed of a network connection.
Finally, some implementations have provided error messages for soft errors in order to assist naive users, based on the value of a
verbose edit option. POSIX.1-2024 does not list specific errors for which an error message shall be displayed. Implementations
should conform to historical practice in the absence of any strong reason to diverge.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_03" id="tag_20_146_18_03"></a>Page Backwards</h5>
<p>The &lt;control&gt;-B and &lt;control&gt;-F commands historically considered it an error to attempt to page past the beginning
or end of the file, whereas the &lt;control&gt;-D and &lt;control&gt;-U commands simply moved to the beginning or end of the file.
For consistency, POSIX.1-2024 requires the latter behavior for all four commands. All four commands still consider it an error if
the current line is at the beginning (&lt;control&gt;-B, &lt;control&gt;-U) or end (&lt;control&gt;-F, &lt;control&gt;-D) of the
file. Historically, the &lt;control&gt;-B and &lt;control&gt;-F commands skip two lines in order to include overlapping lines when
a single command is entered. This makes less sense in the presence of a <i>count</i>, as there will be, by definition, no
overlapping lines. The actual calculation used by historical implementations of the <i>vi</i> editor for &lt;control&gt;-B was:</p>
<pre><tt>((current first line) - count x (window edit option)) +2
</tt></pre>
<p>and for &lt;control&gt;-F was:</p>
<pre><tt>((current first line) + count x (window edit option)) -2
</tt></pre>
<p>This calculation does not work well when intermixing commands with and without counts; for example, <b>3</b>&lt;control&gt;-F is
not equivalent to entering the &lt;control&gt;-F command three times, and is not reversible by entering the &lt;control&gt;-B
command three times. For consistency with other <i>vi</i> commands that take counts, POSIX.1-2024 requires a different
calculation.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_04" id="tag_20_146_18_04"></a>Scroll Forward</h5>
<p>The 4BSD and System V implementations of <i>vi</i> differed on the initial value used by the <b>scroll</b> command. 4BSD
used:</p>
<pre><tt>((window edit option) +1) /2
</tt></pre>
<p>while System V used the value of the <b>scroll</b> edit option. The System V version is specified by POSIX.1-2024 because the
standard developers believed that it was more intuitive and permitted the user a method of setting the scroll value initially
without also setting the number of lines that are displayed.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_05" id="tag_20_146_18_05"></a>Scroll Forward by Line</h5>
<p>Historically, the &lt;control&gt;-E and &lt;control&gt;-Y commands considered it an error if the last and first lines,
respectively, were already on the screen. POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to historical practice. Historically, the
&lt;control&gt;-E and &lt;control&gt;-Y commands had no effect in open mode. For simplicity and consistency of specification,
POSIX.1-2024 requires that they behave as usual, albeit with a single line screen.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_06" id="tag_20_146_18_06"></a>Clear and Redisplay</h5>
<p>The historical &lt;control&gt;-L command refreshed the screen exactly as it was supposed to be currently displayed, replacing
any <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> characters for lines that had been deleted but not updated on the screen with refreshed <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> characters.
The intent of the &lt;control&gt;-L command is to refresh when the screen has been accidentally overwritten; for example, by a
<b>write</b> command from another user, or modem noise.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_07" id="tag_20_146_18_07"></a>Redraw Screen</h5>
<p>The historical &lt;control&gt;-R command redisplayed only when necessary to update lines that had been deleted but not updated
on the screen and that were flagged with <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> characters. There is no requirement that the screen be in any way refreshed
if no lines of this form are currently displayed. POSIX.1-2024 permits implementations to extend this command to refresh lines on
the screen flagged with <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> characters because they are too long to be displayed in the current framework; however, the
current line and column need not be modified.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_08" id="tag_20_146_18_08"></a>Search for tagstring</h5>
<p>Historically, the first non-&lt;blank&gt; at or after the cursor was the first character, and all subsequent characters that
were word characters, up to the end of the line, were included. For example, with the cursor on the leading &lt;space&gt; or on the
<tt>&#39;#&#39;</tt> character in the text <tt>&#34;#bar@&#34;</tt>, the tag was <tt>&#34;#bar&#34;</tt>. On the character <tt>&#39;b&#39;</tt> it was
<tt>&#34;bar&#34;</tt>, and on the <tt>&#39;a&#39;</tt> it was <tt>&#34;ar&#34;</tt>. POSIX.1-2024 requires this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_09" id="tag_20_146_18_09"></a>Replace Text with Results from Shell Command</h5>
<p>Historically, the <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, and <b>!</b> commands considered most cursor motions other than line-oriented
motions an error; for example, the command <b>&gt;/foo&lt;CR&gt;</b> succeeded, while the command <b>&gt;l</b> failed, even though
the text region described by the two commands might be identical. For consistency, all three commands only consider entire lines
and not partial lines, and the region is defined as any line that contains a character that was specified by the motion.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_10" id="tag_20_146_18_10"></a>Move to Matching Character</h5>
<p>Other matching characters have been left implementation-defined in order to allow extensions such as matching <tt>&#39;&lt;&#39;</tt>
and <tt>&#39;&gt;&#39;</tt> for searching HTML, or <b>#ifdef</b>, <b>#else</b>, and <b>#endif</b> for searching C source.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_11" id="tag_20_146_18_11"></a>Repeat Substitution</h5>
<p>POSIX.1-2024 requires that any <b>c</b> and <b>g</b> flags specified to the previous substitute command be ignored; however, the
<b>r</b> flag may still apply, if supported by the implementation.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_12" id="tag_20_146_18_12"></a>Return to Previous (Context or Section)</h5>
<p>The <b>[[</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>(</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>{</b>, and <b>}</b> commands are all affected by &#34;section boundaries&#34;, but in
some historical implementations not all of the commands recognize the same section boundaries. This is a bug, not a feature, and a
unique section-boundary algorithm was not described for each command. One special case that is preserved is that the sentence
command moves to the end of the last line of the edit buffer while the other commands go to the beginning, in order to preserve the
traditional character cut semantics of the sentence command. Historically, <i>vi</i> section boundaries at the beginning and end of
the edit buffer were the first non-&lt;blank&gt; on the first and last lines of the edit buffer if one exists; otherwise, the last
character of the first and last lines of the edit buffer if one exists. To increase consistency with other section locations, this
has been simplified by POSIX.1-2024 to the first character of the first and last lines of the edit buffer, or the first and the
last lines of the edit buffer if they are empty.</p>
<p>Sentence boundaries were problematic in the historical <i>vi</i>. They were not only the boundaries as defined for the section
and paragraph commands, but they were the first non-&lt;blank&gt; that occurred after those boundaries, as well. Historically, the
<i>vi</i> section commands were documented as taking an optional window size as a <i>count</i> preceding the command. This was not
implemented in historical versions, so POSIX.1-2024 requires that the <i>count</i> repeat the command, for consistency with other
<i>vi</i> commands.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_13" id="tag_20_146_18_13"></a>Repeat</h5>
<p>Historically, mapped commands other than text input commands could not be repeated using the <b>period</b> command. POSIX.1-2024
requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p>The restrictions on the interpretation of special characters (for example, &lt;control&gt;-H) in the repetition of text input
mode commands is intended to match historical practice. For example, given the input sequence:</p>
<pre><tt>iab&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-Hdef&lt;escape&gt;
</tt></pre>
<p>the user should be informed of an error when the sequence is first entered, but not during a command repetition. The character
&lt;control&gt;-T is specifically exempted from this restriction. Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> ignored &lt;control&gt;-T
characters that were input in the original command during command repetition. POSIX.1-2024 prohibits this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_14" id="tag_20_146_18_14"></a>Find Regular Expression</h5>
<p>Historically, commands did not affect the line searched to or from if the motion command was a search (<b>/</b>, <b>?</b>,
<b>N</b>, <b>n</b>) and the final position was the start/end of the line. There were some special cases and <i>vi</i> was not
consistent. POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior, for consistency. Historical implementations permitted but were unable to
handle searches as motion commands that wrapped (that is, due to the edit option <b>wrapscan</b>) to the original location.
POSIX.1-2024 requires that this behavior be treated as an error.</p>
<p>Historically, the syntax <tt>&#34;/RE/0&#34;</tt> was used to force the command to cut text in line mode. POSIX.1-2024 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p>Historically, in open mode, a <b>z</b> specified to a search command redisplayed the current line instead of displaying the
current screen with the current line highlighted. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit
this behavior.</p>
<p>Historically, trailing <b>z</b> commands were permitted and ignored if entered as part of a search used as a motion command. For
consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_15" id="tag_20_146_18_15"></a>Execute an ex Command</h5>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> implementations restricted the commands that could be entered on the colon command line (for example,
<b>append</b> and <b>change</b>), and some other commands were known to cause them to fail catastrophically. For consistency,
POSIX.1-2024 does not permit these restrictions. When executing an <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> command by entering
<b>:</b>, it is not possible to enter a &lt;newline&gt; as part of the command because it is considered the end of the command. A
different approach is to enter <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> command mode by using the <i>vi</i> <b>Q</b> command
(and later resuming visual mode with the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> <b>vi</b> command). In <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> command mode, the single-line limitation does not exist. So, for example, the following is
valid:</p>
<pre><tt>Q
s/break here/break\
here/
vi
</tt></pre>
<p>POSIX.1-2024 requires that, if the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> command overwrites any part of the screen that
would be erased by a refresh, <i>vi</i> pauses for a character from the user. Historically, this character could be any character;
for example, a character input by the user before the message appeared, or even a mapped character. This is probably a bug, but
implementations that have tried to be more rigorous by requiring that the user enter a specific character, or that the user enter a
character after the message was displayed, have been forced by user indignation back into historical behavior. POSIX.1-2024
requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_16" id="tag_20_146_18_16"></a>Shift Left (Right)</h5>
<p>Refer to the Rationale for the <b>!</b> and <b>/</b> commands. Historically, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> commands sometimes
moved the cursor to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; (for example if the command was repeated or with <b>_</b> as the motion command),
and sometimes left it unchanged. POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this inconsistency, requiring instead that the cursor always move to
the first non-&lt;blank&gt;. Historically, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> commands did not support buffer arguments, although some
implementations allow the specification of an optional buffer. This behavior is neither required nor disallowed by
POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_17" id="tag_20_146_18_17"></a>Execute</h5>
<p>Historically, buffers could execute other buffers, and loops, infinite and otherwise, were possible. POSIX.1-2024 requires
conformance to historical practice. The *<i>buffer</i> syntax of <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> is not required in
<i>vi</i>, because it is not historical practice and has been used in some <i>vi</i> implementations to support additional
scripting languages.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_18" id="tag_20_146_18_18"></a>Reverse Case</h5>
<p>Historically, the <b>~</b> command ignored any associated <i>count</i>, and acted only on the characters in the current line.
For consistency with other <i>vi</i> commands, POSIX.1-2024 requires that an associated <i>count</i> act on the next <i>count</i>
characters, and that the command move to subsequent lines if warranted by <i>count</i>, to make it possible to modify large pieces
of text in a reasonably efficient manner. There exist <i>vi</i> implementations that optionally require an associated motion
command for the <b>~</b> command. Implementations supporting this functionality are encouraged to base it on the <b>tildedop</b>
edit option and handle the text regions and cursor positioning identically to the <b>yank</b> command.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_19" id="tag_20_146_18_19"></a>Append</h5>
<p>Historically, <i>count</i>s specified to the <b>A</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>i</b> commands repeated the input of the first
line <i>count</i> times, and did not repeat the subsequent lines of the input text. POSIX.1-2024 requires that the entire text
input be repeated <i>count</i> times.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_20" id="tag_20_146_18_20"></a>Move Backward to Preceding Word</h5>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> became confused if word commands were used as motion commands in empty files. POSIX.1-2024 requires that
this be an error. Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> had a large number of bugs in the word movement commands, and they varied
greatly in behavior in the presence of empty lines, &#34;words&#34; made up of a single character, and lines containing only
&lt;blank&gt; characters. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_21" id="tag_20_146_18_21"></a>Change to End-of-Line</h5>
<p>Some historical implementations of the <b>C</b> command did not behave as described by POSIX.1-2024 when the <b>$</b> key was
remapped because they were implemented by pushing the <b>$</b> key onto the input queue and reprocessing it. POSIX.1-2024 does not
permit this behavior. Historically, the <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>, and <b>s</b> commands did not copy replaced text into the numeric
buffers. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 requires that they behave like their respective <b>c</b>
commands in all respects.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_22" id="tag_20_146_18_22"></a>Delete</h5>
<p>Historically, lines in open mode that were deleted were scrolled up, and an <b>@</b> glyph written over the beginning of the
line. In the case of terminals that are incapable of the necessary cursor motions, the editor erased the deleted line from the
screen. POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to historical practice; that is, if the terminal cannot display the <tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt>
character, the line cannot remain on the screen.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_23" id="tag_20_146_18_23"></a>Delete to End-of-Line</h5>
<p>Some historical implementations of the <b>D</b> command did not behave as described by POSIX.1-2024 when the <b>$</b> key was
remapped because they were implemented by pushing the <b>$</b> key onto the input queue and reprocessing it. POSIX.1-2024 does not
permit this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_24" id="tag_20_146_18_24"></a>Join</h5>
<p>An historical oddity of <i>vi</i> is that the commands <b>J</b>, <b>1J</b>, and <b>2J</b> are all equivalent. POSIX.1-2024
requires conformance to historical practice. The <i>vi</i> <b>J</b> command is specified in terms of the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> <b>join</b> command with an <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> command <i>count</i>
value. The address correction for a <i>count</i> that is past the end of the edit buffer is necessary for historical compatibility
for both <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> and <i>vi</i>.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_25" id="tag_20_146_18_25"></a>Mark Position</h5>
<p>Historical practice is that only lowercase letters, plus backquote and single-quote, could be used to mark a cursor position.
POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to historical practice, but encourages implementations to support other characters as marks as
well.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_26" id="tag_20_146_18_26"></a>Repeat Regular Expression Find (Forward and Reverse)</h5>
<p>Historically, the <b>N</b> and <b>n</b> commands could not be used as motion components for the <b>c</b> command. With the
exception of the <b>cN</b> command, which worked if the search crossed a line boundary, the text region would be discarded, and the
user would not be in text input mode. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this
behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_27" id="tag_20_146_18_27"></a>Insert Empty Line (Below and Above)</h5>
<p>Historically, counts to the <b>O</b> and <b>o</b> commands were used as the number of physical lines to open, if the terminal
was dumb and the <b>slowopen</b> option was not set. This was intended to minimize traffic over slow connections and repainting for
dumb terminals. POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior, requiring that a <i>count</i> to the open command behave as for other
text input commands. This change to historical practice was made for consistency, and because a superset of the functionality is
provided by the <b>slowopen</b> edit option.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_28" id="tag_20_146_18_28"></a>Put from Buffer (Following and Before)</h5>
<p>Historically, <i>count</i>s to the <b>p</b> and <b>P</b> commands were ignored if the buffer was a line mode buffer, but were
(mostly) implemented as described in POSIX.1-2024 if the buffer was a character mode buffer. Because implementations exist that do
not have this limitation, and because pasting lines multiple times is generally useful, POSIX.1-2024 requires that <i>count</i> be
supported for all <b>p</b> and <b>P</b> commands.</p>
<p>Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> were widely known to have major problems in the <b>p</b> and <b>P</b> commands,
particularly when unusual regions of text were copied into the edit buffer. The standard developers viewed these as bugs, and they
are not permitted for consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>
<p>Historically, a <b>P</b> or <b>p</b> command (or an <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> <b>put</b> command executed
from open or visual mode) executed in an empty file, left an empty line as the first line of the file. For consistency and
simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_29" id="tag_20_146_18_29"></a>Replace Character</h5>
<p>Historically, the <b>r</b> command did not correctly handle the <i>erase</i> and <i>word erase</i> characters as arguments, nor
did it handle an associated <i>count</i> greater than 1 with a &lt;carriage-return&gt; argument, for which it replaced <i>count</i>
characters with a single &lt;newline&gt;. POSIX.1-2024 does not permit these inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Historically, the <b>r</b> command permitted the &lt;control&gt;-V escaping of entered characters, such as &lt;ESC&gt; and the
&lt;carriage-return&gt;; however, it required two leading &lt;control&gt;-V characters instead of one. POSIX.1-2024 requires that
this be changed for consistency with the other text input commands of <i>vi</i>.</p>
<p>Historically, it is an error to enter the <b>r</b> command if there are less than <i>count</i> characters at or after the cursor
in the line. While a reasonable and unambiguous extension would be to permit the <b>r</b> command on empty lines, it would require
that too large a <i>count</i> be adjusted to match the number of characters at or after the cursor for consistency, which is
sufficiently different from historical practice to be avoided. POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_30" id="tag_20_146_18_30"></a>Replace Characters</h5>
<p>Historically, if there were <b>autoindent</b> characters in the line on which the <b>R</b> command was run, and
<b>autoindent</b> was set, the first &lt;newline&gt; would be properly indented and no characters would be replaced by the
&lt;newline&gt;. Each additional &lt;newline&gt; would replace <i>n</i> characters, where <i>n</i> was the number of characters
that were needed to indent the rest of the line to the proper indentation level. This behavior is a bug and is not permitted by
POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_31" id="tag_20_146_18_31"></a>Undo</h5>
<p>Historical practice for cursor positioning after undoing commands was mixed. In most cases, when undoing commands that affected
a single line, the cursor was moved to the start of added or changed text, or immediately after deleted text. However, if the user
had moved from the line being changed, the column was either set to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;, returned to the origin of the
command, or remained unchanged. When undoing commands that affected multiple lines or entire lines, the cursor was moved to the
first character in the first line restored. As an example of how inconsistent this was, a search, followed by an <b>o</b> text
input command, followed by an <b>undo</b> would return the cursor to the location where the <b>o</b> command was entered, but a
<b>cw</b> command followed by an <b>o</b> command followed by an <b>undo</b> would return the cursor to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;
of the line. POSIX.1-2024 requires the most useful of these behaviors, and discards the least useful, in the interest of
consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_32" id="tag_20_146_18_32"></a>Yank</h5>
<p>Historically, the <b>yank</b> command did not move to the end of the motion if the motion was in the forward direction. It moved
to the end of the motion if the motion was in the backward direction, except for the <b>_</b> command, or for the <b>G</b> and
<b>&#39;</b> commands when the end of the motion was on the current line. This was further complicated by the fact that for a number of
motion commands, the <b>yank</b> command moved the cursor but did not update the screen; for example, a subsequent command would
move the cursor from the end of the motion, even though the cursor on the screen had not reflected the cursor movement for the
<b>yank</b> command. POSIX.1-2024 requires that all <b>yank</b> commands associated with backward motions move the cursor to the
end of the motion for consistency, and specifically, to make <b>&#39;</b> commands as motions consistent with search patterns as
motions.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_33" id="tag_20_146_18_33"></a>Yank Current Line</h5>
<p>Some historical implementations of the <b>Y</b> command did not behave as described by POSIX.1-2024 when the <tt>&#39;_&#39;</tt> key
was remapped because they were implemented by pushing the <tt>&#39;_&#39;</tt> key onto the input queue and reprocessing it. POSIX.1-2024
does not permit this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_34" id="tag_20_146_18_34"></a>Redraw Window</h5>
<p>Historically, the <b>z</b> command always redrew the screen. This is permitted but not required by POSIX.1-2024, because of the
frequent use of the <b>z</b> command in macros such as <b>map n nz.</b> for screen positioning, instead of its use to change the
screen size. The standard developers believed that expanding or scrolling the screen offered a better interface for users. The
ability to redraw the screen is preserved if the optional new window size is specified, and in the &lt;control&gt;-L and
&lt;control&gt;-R commands.</p>
<p>The semantics of <b>z^</b> are confusing at best. Historical practice is that the screen before the screen that ended with the
specified line is displayed. POSIX.1-2024 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p>Historically, the <b>z</b> command would not display a partial line at the top or bottom of the screen. If the partial line
would normally have been displayed at the bottom of the screen, the command worked, but the partial line was replaced with
<tt>&#39;@&#39;</tt> characters. If the partial line would normally have been displayed at the top of the screen, the command would fail.
For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p>Historically, the <b>z</b> command with a line specification of 1 ignored the command. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p>Historically, the <b>z</b> command did not set the cursor column to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; for the character if the first
screen was to be displayed, and was already displayed. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1-2024 does not
permit this behavior.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_35" id="tag_20_146_18_35"></a>Input Mode Commands in vi</h5>
<p>Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> did not permit the user to erase more than a single line of input, or to use normal
erase characters such as <i>line erase</i>, <i>worderase</i>, and <i>erase</i> to erase <b>autoindent</b> characters. As there
exist implementations of <i>vi</i> that do not have these limitations, both behaviors are permitted, but only historical practice
is required. In the case of these extensions, <i>vi</i> is required to pause at the <b>autoindent</b> and previous line
boundaries.</p>
<p>Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> updated only the portion of the screen where the current cursor character was displayed.
For example, consider the <i>vi</i> input keystrokes:</p>
<pre><tt>iabcd&lt;escape&gt;0C&lt;tab&gt;
</tt></pre>
<p>Historically, the &lt;tab&gt; would overwrite the characters <tt>&#34;abcd&#34;</tt> when it was displayed. Other implementations
replace only the <tt>&#39;a&#39;</tt> character with the &lt;tab&gt;, and then push the rest of the characters ahead of the cursor. Both
implementations have problems. The historical implementation is probably visually nicer for the above example; however, for the
keystrokes:</p>
<pre><tt>iabcd&lt;ESC&gt;0R&lt;tab&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;
</tt></pre>
<p>the historical implementation results in the string <tt>&#34;bcd&#34;</tt> disappearing and then magically reappearing when the
&lt;ESC&gt; character is entered. POSIX.1-2024 requires the former behavior when overwriting erase-columns—that is, overwriting
characters that are no longer logically part of the edit buffer—and the latter behavior otherwise.</p>
<p>Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> discarded the &lt;control&gt;-D and &lt;control&gt;-T characters when they were entered
at places where their command functionality was not appropriate. POSIX.1-2024 requires that the &lt;control&gt;-T functionality
always be available, and that &lt;control&gt;-D be treated as any other key when not operating on <b>autoindent</b> characters.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_36" id="tag_20_146_18_36"></a>NUL</h5>
<p>Some historical implementations of <i>vi</i> limited the number of characters entered using the NUL input character to 256
bytes. POSIX.1-2024 permits this limitation; however, implementations are encouraged to remove this limit.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_37" id="tag_20_146_18_37"></a>&lt;control&gt;-D</h5>
<p>See also Rationale for the input mode command &lt;newline&gt;. The hidden assumptions in the &lt;control&gt;-D command (and in
the <i>vi</i> <b>autoindent</b> specification in general) is that &lt;space&gt; characters take up a single column on the screen
and that &lt;tab&gt; characters are comprised of an integral number of &lt;space&gt; characters.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_38" id="tag_20_146_18_38"></a>&lt;newline&gt;</h5>
<p>Implementations are permitted to rewrite <b>autoindent</b> characters in the line when &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-return&gt;,
&lt;control&gt;-D, and &lt;control&gt;-T are entered, or when the <b>shift</b> commands are used, because historical
implementations have both done so and found it necessary to do so. For example, a &lt;control&gt;-D when the cursor is preceded by
a single &lt;tab&gt;, with <b>tabstop</b> set to 8, and <b>shiftwidth</b> set to 3, will result in the &lt;tab&gt; being replaced
by several &lt;space&gt; characters.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_39" id="tag_20_146_18_39"></a>&lt;control&gt;-T</h5>
<p>See also the Rationale for the input mode command &lt;newline&gt;. Historically, &lt;control&gt;-T only worked if no
non-&lt;blank&gt; characters had yet been input in the current input line. In addition, the characters inserted by
&lt;control&gt;-T were treated as <b>autoindent</b> characters, and could not be erased using normal user erase characters. Because
implementations exist that do not have these limitations, and as moving to a column boundary is generally useful, POSIX.1-2024
requires that both limitations be removed.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_40" id="tag_20_146_18_40"></a>&lt;control&gt;-V</h5>
<p>Historically, <i>vi</i> used <b>^V</b>, regardless of the value of the literal-next character of the terminal. POSIX.1-2024
requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p>The uses described for &lt;control&gt;-V can also be accomplished with &lt;control&gt;-Q, which is useful on terminals that use
&lt;control&gt;-V for the down-arrow function. However, most historical implementations use &lt;control&gt;-Q for the
<i>termios</i> START character, so the editor will generally not receive the &lt;control&gt;-Q unless <b>stty ixon</b> mode is set
to off. (In addition, some historical implementations of <i>vi</i> explicitly set <b>ixon</b> mode to on, so it was difficult for
the user to set it to off.) Any of the command characters described in POSIX.1-2024 can be made ineffective by their selection as
<i>termios</i> control characters, using the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/stty.html"><i>stty</i></a> utility or other methods described in
the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024.</p>
<h5><a name="tag_20_146_18_41" id="tag_20_146_18_41"></a>&lt;ESC&gt;</h5>
<p>Historically, SIGINT alerted the terminal when used to end input mode. This behavior is permitted, but not required, by
POSIX.1-2024.</p>
