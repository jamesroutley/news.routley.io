      <p>
        It is no secret that I like mechanical displays.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> While scheming to realize my
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display">split-flap display</a> dreams, I encountered <a href="https://www.fliposcope.com/about">Fliposcope</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fliposcope is a mechanical flipbook kit produced by artists <a href="https://www.mechanicalflipbook.com/#about-mechanical">Marvel &amp; Rosen</a>. Their kits contain a cardboard box display, a plastic axel-with-crank, a set of blank
        split-flap cards, and a set of blank stickers sized to fit the split-flap cards. Each kit results in a 40-frame physical animation. Folks have used these kits to make some really awesome, creative art:
      </p>
      
      <p>For my birthday my parents gifted me one of these kits, and I’ve been sitting on it for awhile, <del>paralyzed by indecision and perfectionism</del> waiting for inspiration to strike. And here we are!</p>
      <h2 id="parallaxxing-in-cuttle">Parallaxxing in Cuttle</h2>
      <p>I wanted my flipbook to use drawings I’d made myself, but I also did not want to hand-draw 40 frames of an incrementally shifting scene. Parallax (and programming) to the rescue!</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Parallax: the apparent displacement or the difference in apparent direction of an object as seen from two different points not on a straight line with the object.</em> [<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parallax">Merriam-Webster</a>]
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Basically, relative motion between different objects or scenes provides information about how far away their respective contents are from one another and the viewer. If you look out the window of a train, the foreground view changes
        rapidly—trees whip by!—while the background view changes slowly: those mountains in the distance don’t change much at all for long periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parallax is a broadly applicable phenomenon,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and is commonly exploited in animation: moving background and foreground content at different speeds to
        add depth to a scene. Once you start recognizing it, you’ll see it everywhere: in cartoons and video games and real life, when staring out the window of a moving vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my own use of parallax in animation, I used <a href="https://cuttle.xyz/">Cuttle</a> a web-based parametric CAD software that I love and have written about <a href="https://hannahilea.com/cuttle-obsession/">previously</a>. Here is my initial
        proof-of-concept prototype:<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/cuttle-obsession/assets/parallax.gif" alt="“Animation of Cuttle template with sketch of gnome dancing”"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In the polished Cuttle implementation, I sketched out and uploaded a couple of background layers (the background ocean, the foreground shore) and a main character (the seagull).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/raw-drawings.png" alt="“Sketches of seagull, beach, and horizon”"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Just rotating the gull back and forth didn’t give the gull the movement I wanted, so I ended up giving it independently-moving legs: I cropped the legs from the original sketch, and then added them in as their own objects and gave
        those objects a rotation of a few degrees for every frame increment.
      </p>
      <p>This is what the final animation looked like in Cuttle:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/gull-cuttle.gif" alt="“Screenshot of animated seagull running”"/>
      </figure>
      <h2 id="digital-frames-to-physical-frames">Digital frames to physical frames</h2>
      <p>
        To convert a frame (a single still shot) of the digital animation into a frame of the physical Fliposcope, it must be printed onto the accompanying stickers, and then stuck onto the kit’s split-flap cards. A single animation frame
        is split horizontally across two stickers (the top half and bottom half of the image). Furthermore, an single sticker contains the the top and bottom frames from two <em>consecutive</em> frames, rather than the same frame, as each
        sticker is folded around a single split-flap card.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Fliposcope provides a conversion tool for formatting a short video (or set of frames) to be printed onto the kit’s sticker-sheets, I figured I was already far enough down the Cuttle path that I might as well do that piece
        myself. I set up a Cuttle object that formatted my frames <del>correctly</del><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> for the sticker paper.
      </p>

        <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/sticker-template.png" alt="“Screenshot of single sticker sheet template”"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I then printed the frames onto the stickers,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> put on some good music, and painted them with watercolor paints.
      </p>

      <p>After the paint had dried, I put the stickers on the flaps, put the flaps in the Fliposcope spool, and hey presto! A running gull!</p>

      <p>Womp womp—my gull was running backwards. 😭</p>
      <h2 id="running-with-the-gulls-forwards-edition">Running with the Gull<del>s</del>, forwards edition</h2>
      <p>I <del>sulked a bit,</del> fixed up my Cuttle template, reviewed that fix several times, reprinted all the stickers, re<em>painted</em> all the stickers,</p>

      <p>Huzzah!</p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Overall, the challenging pieces of this project were:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Staying motivated to repaint 40 frames of running gull, after I realized I’d botched the first round, and</li>
        <li>Configuring print settings for printing accurately to the sticker paper from my not-that-great secondhand printer.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Additionally, the relatively low-resolution 40-frame setup of the Fliposcope meant that my parallax animation was less obvious than I would have preferred, as a full loop of each layer had to fit into 40 frames. If I make another,
        I’ll probably simplify the background layer and remove any significant objects from it (i.e., not include the sailboat or cloud clusters). If you make your own—and I encourage you to do so!—keep this in mind when you design your own
        layers.
      </p>
      <p>Would it have been faster to just draw everything by hand from the start? Perhaps! But that is besides the point.</p>
