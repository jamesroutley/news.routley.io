    <h1>OLED, Not for Me</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<p>When I switched from an iMac to a Mac mini in late 2024 I choose an <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/displays-desktops/monitors/proart/proart-display-5k-pa27jcv/techspec/">ASUS ProArt 5K PA27JCV</a> (24″, 60 Hz) for the monitor and while it looked great, it died after 14 months, seemingly with a backlight or power supply problem. ASUS’ warranty support requires shipping the monitor back, potentially waiting 3-4 weeks, and then getting a replacement. And worse, the replacement could have dead pixels, as the ASUS warranty doesn’t consider ≤5 dark pixels a problem.</p>



<p>The old <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/details/hp-zr2440w-24-inch-led-backlit-ips-monitor/5163690">HP ZR2440w</a> that I swapped in as a spare wasn’t cutting it, so with an indeterminate wait ahead of me, potentially receiving something with bad pixels, and my being vaguely interested in something larger and with a faster refresh rate I went looking at new monitors.</p>



<p>Coming to the realization that 4K is probably fine I picked up a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-plus-4k-qd-oled-monitor-s3225qc/apd/210-brvv/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED Monitor – S3225QC</a> from Costco for $499. It was well reviewed online and looked pretty good when I played with one for about 20 minutes at Micro Center. When I got home and sat in front of it doing my normal things it looked a bit… different… almost as if my glasses weren’t working quite right. But I figured new monitor tech just needed some time for me to get accustomed to. After all, it had a very high contrast ratio and sharp pixels; maybe it’s just that?</p>



<p>After a few days it still didn’t feel right, so I began looking for a solution. Costco has a 90-day return window for computer monitors, so I had some time, but this didn’t look good; I wanted an answer soon.</p>



<p>I was fortunate to be able to borrow a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u3223qe/apd/210-bdph/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell UltraSharp 32 4K USB-C Hub Monitor U3223QE</a> for the weekend, which was perfect as being a being a high end display with the same resolution and panel size as the S3225QC I could compare them side by side. And in the end the LCD just looked better.</p>

<p>I took some macro photos of both displays and it turns out that what was bothering me was <a href="https://pcmonitors.info/articles/qd-oled-and-woled-fringing-issues/">fringing</a>, a problem common to OLEDs. It was hard to point out during normal use other than text-is-a-bit-blurry-and-weird , or like an oversharpened image, or almost like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact">artifacted text in a JPEG</a> image, but with photos it was much easier to see what’s going on. And better, the cause: the arrangement of the subpixels; the little red/blue/green dots that make up a pixel.</p>



<p>As shown above, the subpixles in the Dell S3225QC QD-OLED form a square with green on the top, a larger red pixel in the lower left, and smaller blue in the lower right. The Dell U3223QE, a typical LCD, has three vertical stripes making a square. The result being that high contrast edges look very different on an OLED, often with a strong off-color border — or fringe — along horizontal and vertical lines.</p>



<p>In the photos above, note the vertical part of the 1 which has red and green dots along its right side, and large red dots along the top of the 6 with green along the bottom. These are the strongly colored fringes. (On the LCD they appear white as the three equal size subpixels pixels act equally.)</p>



<p>This meant that things that I tend to do, text or fine lines in maps or CAD-type drawing, are not right at all on the pixel pattern found in this OLED panel. Beyond the pixel pattern, I also suspect that the much crisper pixels (defined points of light) contribute to the fringing having an artifacting-like effect.</p>



<p>This was much more pronounced when looking at light text on a dark background; the way that I read most websites. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> does a wonderful job demonstrating this problem:</p>

<p>This gets at why OLEDs make great TVs and gaming monitors. The contrast is outstanding, color is excellent, and high refresh rates are ideal for moving images and fast-response games. And there’s no noticeable fringing because edges are constantly moving across pixels; almost nothing is still. They also work great on small devices like phones where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density">pixel density</a> is so high that fringing is too small to see.</p>



<p>But on desktop monitors for still things — text and fine lines — OLEDs currently just aren’t great; I guess that’s why office and productivity type monitors are still LCDs. Even though I don’t like being that person who returns computer stuff just because they don’t like it, I ended up returning the monitor after only four days of using it. The S3225QC and it’s QD-OLED just doesn’t work for me; it made my eyes feel funny to use.</p>



<p>Within the past few weeks <a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/en/2025/12/lg-display-unveils-worlds-first-240hz-rgb-stripe-oled-panel/">LG has announced RGB stripe OLED panels</a> which will resolve this problem, but there aren’t currently any monitors available using these panels, so back to an LCD I’ll go. (It looks like <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/news/ces-2026-first-rgbstripe-qdoleds-from-msi-asus-can-finally-fix-text-fringing">ASUS and MSI will some them available soon, but only as wide-screen gaming monitors</a>. And I suspect the first ones available will be fairly expensive.)</p>



<p>Whether this’ll be buying my own U3223QE, perhaps a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-thunderbolt-hub-monitor-u3225qe/apd/210-bqhs/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell U3225QE</a> (adds 120 Hz scanning, an ambient light sensor, and a Thunderbolt dock), or just waiting for an ASUS PA27JCV to come back, I’m not sure… But whatever I end up using will, for now, will be an LCD, not an OLED.</p>
