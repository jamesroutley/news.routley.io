    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    


This is the web page for the Standard ML Family GitHub
project (organization name: SMLFamily).  This site is very much &#34;under
construction&#34;, and it replaces the earlier
SourceForge web site for standardml.org (which now redirects to this
page).  Contributions, corrections, and suggestions for additional
information are very much welcomed.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
The Standard ML Family project provides a home for online versions
of various formal definitions of Standard ML, including the
&#34;Definition of Standard ML, Revised&#34; (Standard ML 97).
The site also supports coordination between different
implementations of the Standard ML (SML) programming language by
maintaining common resources such as the documentation for the
<a href="https://miccah.io/posts/Basis/index.html">Standard ML Basis Library</a>
and standard test suites. The goal is to increase compatibility
and resource sharing between Standard ML implementations.
</p>
<p>
The site includes a <a href="#History">history section</a> devoted to
the history of ML, and of Standard ML in particular. This section will
contain a collection of original source documents relating to the
design of the language.
</p>

<h2>Definitions of Standard ML</h2>

<p>With the permission of MIT Press, we are able to make
<a href="https://miccah.io/posts/sml90-defn.pdf">The Definition of Standard ML</a> (SML &#39;90)
and
<a href="https://miccah.io/posts/sml97-defn.pdf">The Definition of Standard ML, Revised</a>
(SML &#39;97) available for downloading as pdf files.  These are
(currently) formatted for US letter page size.  Printed copies
of the SML &#39;97 definition are available from
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/definition-standard-ml">MIT Press.</a>
</p>

<p>
The SML &#39;90 definition is complete, including the index, but we are still
working on recreating the index for the SML &#39;97 definition.
</p>

<!--
<p>
The source LaTeX files for the SML '90 and SML '97 definitions are
now maintained at GitHub under the organization SMLFamily. Contact
<a href="mailto:dmacqueen@mac.com>David MacQueen</a> if you wish to
join this organization and have access to the repositories.

Both of these design critiques are somewhat outdated because they
predate the revised Definition.

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>
The SourceForge project hosts two mailing lists relating to Standard
ML. Visit the info page for a list to subscribe.

<h2>Successor ML</h2>
<p>
Recently discussions of improvements and extensions of the Standard ML design
have resumed, under the working title &#34;Successor ML&#34;.  This project
includes a subsidiary site
<a href="https://miccah.io/posts/successor-ml/index.html">Successor ML</a> devoted to this
ongoing work. Earlier discussions on the successor-ml.org wiki are
available there, and a new wiki has been started for future
discussions.

  <p>OCaml is an industrial strength programming language supporting functional,
  imperative and object-oriented styles.  It is a close relative of the SML
  family that is enjoying considerable adoption in industry, and inspiring new
  dialects in the ML family, such as F#.

  <li>
  <a href="http://fsharp.org"><strong>F#</strong></a>
  <p>F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming
  language which empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing
  problems with simple, maintainable and robust code.  Originally derived from
  O&#39;Caml, F# is a full-scale industrial-strength language in the ML family that
  is now open source.
