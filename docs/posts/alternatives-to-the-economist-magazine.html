    <h1>Ask HN: Alternatives to The Economist Magazine?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve be a pretty avid reader of the Economist for a number of years. It doesn&#39;t align exactly with my political values but I&#39;ve always found the writing to be of high quality, even if I don&#39;t agree with their opinions per-se. I feel like it has a good selection of articles on local and geo-politics, culture, technology, and of course finance/economics. In the last year, I&#39;ve found the quality of it to have plummeted. I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s a changing of the guard and the new generation of journalists doesn&#39;t mesh with my sensibilities anymore, or perhaps my radar for spotting narrative manipulation and tabloid click-bait has grown more pronounced with all the journalistic malpractice in recent years. Either way, I&#39;ve not found myself enjoying it as much as I used.</p><p>As such, I&#39;m debating on an alternative that fills the niche it has beside my morning coffee. My question to you all is, does anyone have favorite of theirs that is comparable in quality, breadth, and is available in print not just digital? Preferably something with a UK/Euro/Global focus, not just US. Anything that keeps me relatively well informed, while sparking some intellectual curiosity, and teaching me something I didn&#39;t already know.</p><p>So far the Financial Times, Foreign Affairs, the Jacobin, le Monde Diplomatique, and the New Statesman are all in the running, so I&#39;d like opinions from readers of those and how it compares. Tech-first magazines are also interesting to me, but I&#39;d like at least some political news scattered within if possible.</p></div></div></div>
