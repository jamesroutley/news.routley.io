    <h1>Athena landed in a dark crater where the temperature was minus 280° F</h1>

          <p>The <em>Athena</em> spacecraft was not exactly flying blind as it approached the lunar surface one week ago. The software on board did a credible job of recognizing nearby craters, even with elongated shadows over the terrain. However, the lander&#39;s altimeter had failed.</p>
<p>So while <em>Athena</em> knew where it was relative to the surface of the Moon, the lander did not know how far it was above the surface.</p>
<p>An important detail, that. As a result, the privately built spacecraft struck the lunar surface on a plateau, toppled over, and began to skid across the surface. As it did so, the lander rotated at least once or twice before coming to a stop in a small, shadowed crater.</p>
<p>&#34;The landing was kind of like sliding into second base,&#34; Steve Altemus, chief executive officer of Intuitive Machines, which built the lander, said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<h2>Cold and lonely</h2>
<p>It has been a busy and tiring week for the chief of a company that seeks to help lead the development of a lunar economy. Expectations were high for this, the company&#39;s second lunar landing attempt after its <em>Odysseus</em> vehicle became the first private spacecraft to ever make a soft landing on the Moon, last year, before toppling over.</p>
<p>In some ways, this mission was even more disappointing. Because <em>Athena</em> skidded across the lunar surface, it dredged up regolith. When it came to a stop, some of this material was blown up into the solar panels—already in a sub-optimal location on its side. The spacecraft&#39;s power reserves, therefore, were limited. Almost immediately, the team at Intuitive Machines knew their spacecraft was dying.</p>
<p>&#34;We knew we had slid into a slightly shadowed crater, and the temperature was very cold,&#34; Altemus said. &#34;The solar arrays had regolith on them, and they weren&#39;t charging, the ones pointing up, enough to give us sufficient power to power the heaters to keep it warm enough to survive.&#34;</p>
