<h2>Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing</h2>

<hr/></p><div>
<p>Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM) is a room-temperature 3D metal printing technology that produces complex, dense metal parts without thermal processing. ECAM builds rapidly at the atomic level from a water-based feedstock containing dissolved metal ions. The electrochemical approach allows for micron-scale feature resolution, complex internal features, high-purity materials, and rapid scalability to support mass manufacturing. We are  working to broaden the market for metal additive manufacturing by providing advanced manufacturing services that displace traditional manufacturing.
