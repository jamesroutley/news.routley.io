<p>During the summer of 2022, Google engaged NCC Group to conduct a security assessment of VPN by Google One. VPN by Google One is a service that increases connection security and privacy to end users. Google provides several clients covering the most widely used operating systems; these VPN clients provide both encrypted transit and IP address dissociation for packets between users’ devices and the VPN servers.</p>



<p>The product’s security and privacy goals, as stated in the product’s <a href="https://www.gstatic.com/subscriptions/marketing_page/vpn/white_paper_4f995ab5d7c7edc3d3f14f2e0593f790.pdf">whitepaper</a>, are:</p>



<ul>
<li>“We focus on three core principles: keeping our users’ information secure, treating it responsibly, and putting our users in control.”</li>



<li>“With VPN by Google One, we will never use the VPN connection to track, log, or sell your online activity.”</li>



<li>“A Google-grade VPN that provides additional security and privacy to online connectivity without undue performance sacrifices.”</li>
</ul>
