<p id="27269e24-c57f-4c83-8834-4cad8309250e">Given how quickly the evolution of AI has upended technology across the globe and is affecting various markets, it&#39;s nigh impossible to accurately predict where anything might be headed. There&#39;s no shortage of predictions, ranging from utopia to ultimate doom for established industries. An NYT columnist, however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/opinion/openai-ai-bubble-financing.html" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/opinion/openai-ai-bubble-financing.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">has one specific bet</a>: OpenAI will be destitute in 18 months in the wake of its AI endeavors.</p><p>According to an external report last year, OpenAI was projected to burn through $8 <em>billion </em>in 2025, rising to $40 billion in 2028. Given that the company reportedly predicts profitability by 2030, it&#39;s not hard to do the math.</p><p id="27269e24-c57f-4c83-8834-4cad8309250e-2" aria-hidden="true">Altman&#39;s venture projects spending $1.4 <em>trillion</em><strong> </strong>on datacenters. As Sebastian Mallaby, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, notes, even if OpenAI rethinks those limerence-influenced promises and &#34;pays for others with its overvalued shares&#34;, there&#39;s still a financial chasm to cross. Mallaby isn&#39;t the only one thinking along these lines, as Bain &amp; Company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/bain-says-compute-demand-is-outpacing-capital" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/bain-says-compute-demand-is-outpacing-capital">reported last year</a> that, even with the best outlook, there&#39;s at least a $800 billion black hole in the industry.</p><p aria-hidden="true">The financial guru contextualizes the situation adeptly, broadly stating that it&#39;s not a matter of whether end-user AI will become technologically entrenched, but rather whether the economics of developing it will make sense in the mid- to long-term.</p><p aria-hidden="true">The analyst points out that in theory, investors would &#34;bridge the gap between the emergence of a great technology and eventual profits&#34;, except that many AI companies seem to be burning cash far faster than they can generate income. Mallaby remarks that the newcomers are in a much worse position than &#34;legacy&#34; companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> or Meta, given that the old-timers already had money-making businesses before AI came about and can (literally) afford to wait out the necessary period until the clankers deliver the fruits.</p><p aria-hidden="true">According to him, the majority of people are using free services and have no qualms switching to a competitor once their usual bot adds ads or usage limits, a fact corroborated by the myriad options available right now for all sorts of tasks.</p><p aria-hidden="true">He sees this as a temporary problem for AI providers, though, as agentic AI becomes more entrenched in daily people&#39;s lives, it&#39;ll become harder to switch, as the bots should eventually have all your shopping preferences, aspirations, and emotional profile mapped out —perhaps even better than yourself.</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-YKHdS2vV3aH5qfj8aSKujC"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get Tom&#39;s Hardware&#39;s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div></div></div><p aria-hidden="true">Mallaby does praise OpenAI&#39;s CEO Sam Altman&#39;s dollar-attracting gravitational field that raised $40 billion in investment, an amount bigger than any other private funding round in history — even more than Saudi Aramco&#39;s $30 billion. The difference is that Aramco, along with other IPO&#39;d enterprises, had a business model and profitability, neither of which OpenAI currently enjoys.</p><p aria-hidden="true">The AI financial ouroboros certainly looks poised to eat its own tail, but there&#39;s an argument that the ophidian will only lose its newer part. There would be some irony in the AI market losing one or more of the players that started it all.</p>
