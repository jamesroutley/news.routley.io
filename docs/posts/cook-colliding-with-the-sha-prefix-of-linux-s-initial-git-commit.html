Kees Cook <a href="https://people.kernel.org/kees/colliding-with-the-sha-prefix-of-linuxs-initial-git-commit">describes
his work</a> resulting in a kernel documentation commit whose ID shares the
same first 12 characters as the initial commit in the kernel&#39;s repository.
</p><blockquote>
	This is not yet in the upstream Linux tree, for fear of breaking
	countless other tools out in the wild. But it can serve as a test
	commit for those that want to get this fixed ahead of any future
	collisions (or this commit actually landing).

When I first met Case, it was at a conference in San Diego, when he was plugging in a WiFi router he brought with him from home into an outlet in the hallway. His stated reason was to hope that the SSID is added to the Apple/Google tracking databases, so next time someone drives by his house in Portland and registers his home wifi signal, the tracker would be confused.</p></div>
