  <p>If you look around the world today with a defensive layer of detached irony, lest you really see it and get a little nauseous, this one’s for you. Wake the fuck up. It’s time to get serious. The government is on fire. It’s in no small part Mark Zuckerberg’s fault. It’s time to leave these reactionary fascists in the dust. It’s time to do the hard thing. Leave the oligopoly of corporate social media. Take your friends with you. Show them this post. Tell them I sent you. Does that seem cringe to you? Too bad. That’s because you’re a victim of corporate social media’s extremely well-resourced marketing and PR departments. But the choice is yours: cringe or Nazi?</p>

<p>I can’t blast this message loudly enough. If you don’t like what’s happening right now it’s time to get off of Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, Substack, etc. If these platforms and their owners haven’t crossed a red line for you yet, when will they?</p>

<p>As a reminder, the invitation is still open for friends and family of mine to join the Mastodon instance I’ve set up at <a href="http://meta.illegible.club">illegible.club</a>. For others, Mastodon’s <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">official website</a> offers more details on what the platform is and how you can join it.</p>

<p>Small actions compound when they’re done in mass. Hope to see you on the other side.</p>
