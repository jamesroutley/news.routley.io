    <h1>Row erupts over wreck in US waters identified as Captain Cook’s Endeavour</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0" id="maincontent"><div><p>A 22-year partnership between US and Australian researchers to identify James Cook’s ship the Endeavour has descended into a row after the Australian Maritime Museum announced the discovery.</p><p>The museum’s chief executive, Kevin Sumption, announced on Thursday he was satisfied that a shipwreck in waters off Rhode Island in the US was “the final resting place of one of the most important and contentious vessels in Australia’s maritime history”.</p><p>But the museum’s US partner organisation, the Rhode Island Marine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Archaeology</a> Project (Rimap), said the claim the Endeavour had been identified was a breach of contract, and blamed “Australian emotions or politics” for the “premature” announcement.</p><p>The museum responded that it was not in breach of any commitments, and that Sumption was “confident” the wreck was the Endeavour.</p><p>Cook sailed the ship around the South Pacific before landing on the east coast of Australia in 1770. It was scuttled in Newport Harbor by British forces in 1778, during the American War of Independence.</p><figure id="08e6d13e-9d4c-43cb-b59e-7a0565ccf675"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:5,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/18/how-to-kill-a-god-captain-cook-myth-shows-how-heroes-of-empire-will-fall&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;How to kill a god: the myth of Captain Cook shows how the heroes of empire will fall&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;08e6d13e-9d4c-43cb-b59e-7a0565ccf675&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-5 | 5" data-component="rich-link" data-name=""></div></gu-island></figure><p>Since 1999 maritime archaeologists have been investigating several 18th-century shipwrecks in the area.</p><p>Announcing the positive identification on Thursday, Sumption paid tribute to Rimap and its head, Dr Kathy Abbass, for their “commitment to the site and its history”.</p><p>But Abbass said Rimap was the lead organisation for the study and that while the shipwreck was consistent with “what might be expected of the Endeavour”, there was no “indisputable data” to prove it.</p><p>“There are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification,” she said in a statement provided to Guardian Australia.</p><p>“When the study is done, Rimap will post the legitimate report on its website. Rimap recognises the connection between Australian citizens of British descent and the Endeavour, but Rimap’s conclusions will be driven by proper scientific process and not Australian emotions or politics.”</p><p>In a statement, the Australian museum said it had worked with Abbass for 22 years and acknowledged “that she is entitled to her own opinion regarding the vast amount of evidence that we have accumulated”.</p><p>“As stated today, our director Kevin Sumption is confident that the preponderance of evidence identifies shipwreck site RI 2394 in Newport Harbor as the last resting place of Endeavour,” the statement said.</p><figure id="12411ddd-a3d2-448d-bc4c-2b0eaf88c52a"><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source
