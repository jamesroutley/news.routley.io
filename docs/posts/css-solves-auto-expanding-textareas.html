<p>I‚Äôll cut to the chase before I type too many more words:</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>textarea</span> {
  <span>form-sizing</span>: normal;
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
<p>I came across it via <a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/textarea-auto-increase-height/">an Amit Merchant blog post</a>. Then followed the thread a little. It all <a href="https://github.com/argyleink/open-props/issues/416">started with a discussion</a>, as these things tend to in this modern world. I think it‚Äôs a super weird name choice, but I‚Äôm sure if you were super involved in that discussion it would all make sense.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see it already in Chrome Canary with the ‚Äúweb experiments‚Äù flag enabled. Of course <a href="https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/WNLzyJK">Adam is all over it</a>:</p>

<p>So useful, good job CSS. </p>
<p>Who knows when that will be usable across all browsers, or if it will definitely ship just like that. I tend to agree with Lea Verou earlier in the discussion that <code>height: max-content</code> feels like a very elegant choice, but I‚Äôm not privy to why they didn‚Äôt go that way. Also like Lea, if this opens the door for horizontally growing single-line inputs, that‚Äôs a win.</p>
<p>My favorite trick of doing this <em>before</em> was using CSS grid. You‚Äôd take the text inside the textarea and propagate it to a hidden psuedo element overlaid exactly on top. That stack technique is a classic:</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-2" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>.grid</span> {
  <span>display</span>: grid;
  <span>grid</span>: stack;
  &gt; *, &amp;::after {
    <span>grid-area</span>: stack;
  }
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-2"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>

<p>Credit to Stephen Shaw on the original idea for that. </p>
