Individual teams will pick an additional third day for in-person work.</p><p>The move is a sign that Apple remains committed to in-person work. Apple&#39;s culture has always heavily emphasized in-person meetings and demos, and it develops and sells hardware, which requires employees to be physically present.</p><p>Over the summer, Apple employees have been working from their offices two days a week. Apple had planned to move to a system in which employees would work from the office three days a week earlier this year before it delayed the move in May, citing rising Covid cases.</p><p>Apple&#39;s head of software, Craig Federighi, said September would be the &#34;true start&#34; of Apple&#39;s hybrid work pilot in an email to staff, according <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/15/23307268/apple-hybrid-working-model-return-to-office-september" target="_blank">to The Verge</a>.</p><p>An Apple representative declined to comment. <br/></p></div></div></div>
