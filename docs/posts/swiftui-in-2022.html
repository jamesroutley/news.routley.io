That being said, I have run into odd behaviors and challenging problems that make me want to tear my hair out at times.  One such issue, which at first seems trivial, is how to dismiss the keyboard when a user taps an area on the screen that is outside the bounds of a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield">TextField</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/texteditor">TextEditor</a> view.

<p>In March I also released a 100% SwiftUI app.</p>

<p>There is a very strong argument to make that declarative UI frameworks are always going to be a case of ‚Äúfaster to get to good, difficult to get to great‚Äù</p>
<p>Building great software requires fine-grained control over the UI, but that‚Äôs kind of the antithesis of declarative UI.</p>
