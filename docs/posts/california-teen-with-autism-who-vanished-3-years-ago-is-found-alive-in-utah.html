Andrew Wright with the Summit County Sheriff’s Office said Friday. “It’s just a really miraculous discovery if you will.”</p><p>Several weeks before Oswalt&#39;s identity was confirmed, residents in the area began calling the sheriff&#39;s office to report seeing a homeless person pushing a cart. Wright said they did not have a lot of transients in the area because it gets very cold because of its high elevation. </p><p>Deputies made contact with the person several times and offered to help him find shelter, but he always refused and would not give his name, Wright said.</p><p>On April 9, a person called the sheriff&#39;s office and said a young man was sleeping outside a gas station. When deputies arrived, the person was cold so they let him warm up in a patrol vehicle. This time, deputies scanned the person&#39;s fingerprint. </p><p>Wright said they got a hit for an arrest warrant out of Nevada for assault on a police officer. The warrant was issued in February but spelled Oswalt&#39;s last name wrong, according to Wright. </p><p>Suspecting that there was more to the story, deputies did some more digging and came across a missing person poster for Oswalt in the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children database. When contacted, both Clearlake police and Oswalt&#39;s mother confirmed that he was still missing. </p><p>Immediately, Oswalt&#39;s family drove from Idaho Falls, Idaho, where they had relocated, to Utah to be reunited with him. </p><p>Details about how long Oswalt was in Utah or how he arrived there remain unclear. Clearlake police said Friday that they believed he was a runaway. </p><p>Oswalt&#39;s mother, Suzanne Flint, was not immediately available for comment. </p></div><div><div><p>Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>
