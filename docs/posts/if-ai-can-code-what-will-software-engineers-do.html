    <h1>If AI can code, what will Software Engineers do?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://github.com/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p><a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-06_career-in-programming-languages">I&#39;ve worked as a software engineer professionally for 9 years</a>. AI has taken the world by storm this year and it can code. How well depends on the usecase, technologies (and available training data), and your own expertise - but it can certainly <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_vibe-coded-csharp-library">pump out small features in mainstream programming languages</a>.</p>
<p>Of course it&#39;s gotten me thinking about what the future of this profession holds. After all, if AI can code why do companies need software engineers? If those companies aren&#39;t employing software engineers, do I need to find <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-04_job-search-results">another job</a>?</p>
<p>That&#39;s what we&#39;ll be exploring in this post.</p>

<h2 id="new-technologies-and-job-change">New Technologies and Job Change</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve seen this pattern numerous times throughout history. A new technology comes along that fixes a common problem and wipes out whole categories of human roles because now it can be done faster, cheaper, and with more consistency.</p>
<p><em>Quality is another matter entirely but I think most will agree with me that humans are not the most consistent entities on the planet. If anything, we resemble non-deterministic pattern matchers with a bit of emotion splashed in for personality. Hm, what does that remind me of?</em></p>
<p>You&#39;ve probably noticed this when you see old movies / news reels and there&#39;s background characters doing smth odd. What was normal then is now extinct because modern life has changed so much.</p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Computer</strong> - Everyone can type so no need for typists</li>
<li><strong>Calculator</strong> - Everyone can do perfect calculations, no need for human calculators</li>
<li><strong>Global supply chain</strong> - Everyone can get milk at their grocery store, no need for a milk man</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - Everyone can email anyone else, no need for in-office couriers (my parents recently told me ab office couriers and how mailrooms were necessary to send messages to other departments)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s just a few of them.</p>
<p>The point is that new technologies regularly deprecate human roles because they are faster, cheaper, and more consistent. In most cases, we look back and barely remember those roles a generation on. This change happens but it&#39;s <em>been</em> happening for decades.</p>
<h2 id="how-ai-is-different">How AI is different</h2>
<p>I think AI is mostly the same. It raises the floor on common tasks which removes the need for whole categories of roles cause now anyone can do them w new tools.</p>
<p>It feels different in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s software
<ul>
<li>Can be updated and deployed quickly around the globe</li>
<li>Has been repurposed to impact many industries</li>
<li>Has potential to be plugged into basically anything that&#39;s software - and the world has been eaten by software</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The amount of money going in is unfathomable - multiple $100B deals whipped around</li>
</ul>
<p>But it&#39;s not like we&#39;ve never seen stuff like this before (and recently!):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rise of the internet</li>
<li>Dotcom bubble</li>
<li>Rise of smartphones</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s scary because it&#39;s exponential but we&#39;ve been on an exponential growth curve for centuries so it&#39;s not that weird we&#39;d unlock additional exponential growth to keep the curve going.</p>
<p><em>I got this idea from <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">Andrej Karpathy&#39;s (OpenAI cofounder) Dwarkesh podcast</a>. He believes AGI will be exponential but it will blend into the 2.5 centuries of 2% GDP growth we&#39;ve seen.</em></p>
<h2 id="ai-engineers-and-coders">AI, Engineers, and Coders</h2>
<p>Software engineers will go a similar route. AI is a new technology that raises the floor on coding. Anyone can go to a mainstream AI, tell it to build them an app, and AI will spit out a thousand line working webapp in seconds.</p>
<p>This is a huge change! Previously you&#39;d need to hire someone to do that and humans are expensive. Not to mention most of the world still doesn&#39;t really know how code works so the code was a black box bottleneck and therefore could charge extra for its creatoin.</p>
<p>So of course it&#39;s going to impact this profession. But I think it&#39;s going to impact different roles differently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Software Engineer</strong> - Takes problems / requirements and executes the technical side e2e</li>
<li><strong>Coder</strong> - Handed a task and codes it</li>
</ul>
<p>The former solves a problem e2e with technology. The latter is given instructions and follows them.</p>
<p>AI can already code so I think there&#39;s little present or future for coders. That&#39;s like having a personal typist in 2025 - you can already type (or dictate to your device) - so having a human in the loop is generally wasteful.</p>
<p>What&#39;s going to set engineers apart is what they can do that the AI / new technology cannot yet do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deciding on priorities, direction, and tradeoffs</li>
<li>Planning large projects</li>
<li>Splitting, sequencing, and delegating tasks</li>
<li>Interfacing with the human world - humans, tools, intuition</li>
<li>Upholding quality</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I&#39;m so big on <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-07_stop-vibe-coding">vibe engineering over vibe coding</a> - if you can vibe code it then there&#39;s no reason for you to be in the loop. Vibe engineering is leveraging the tool for what it&#39;s good for while adding value yourself.</p>
<h2 id="ai-and-other-roles">AI and other roles</h2>
<p>As we&#39;ve mentioned, AI seems different from previous technology advancements because its impacts are so widespread - across industries, B2C, and B2B.</p>
<p>The generalization for how this affects human roles across industries I think is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI raises the floor so jobs that were only doing the floor work are unnecessary - AI can do it faster, cheaper, and likely better than them</li>
<li>Those who use AI will be able to leverage it to achieve greater outputs than they could individually</li>
<li>The market will rearrange itself to this new equilibrium, shutting out jobs that are unnecessary and growing in areas where bottlenecks exist.</li>
<li>New jobs will unfold around those bottlenecks - we&#39;re not sure what they are but they will appear (think computer repair, mobile app developers, and influencers - all things that didn&#39;t exist widely until the rise of computers, smart phones, and the internet respectively)</li>
<li>As AI continues to improve, the bottleneck will continue to be identifying opportunities, executing on them, and redirecting based on the outcomes</li>
<li>AI will continue to raise the floor so the staying factor is to raise the ceiling - in depth (specialize super deep in a few areas such that you beat the AIs) or breadth (become a good generalist so you can leverage these tools across layers to achieve outcomes they can&#39;t)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>AI is going to change everything. But everything is already changing. It&#39;s been changing for hundreds and thousands of years. This time will be different but it will also be the same.</p>
<p>The strategy remains: Learn the new tools, adapt to the new environment, and carry on.</p>
