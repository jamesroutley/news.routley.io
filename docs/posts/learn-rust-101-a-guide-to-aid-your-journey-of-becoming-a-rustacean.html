<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a> is a modern systems programming language with safety in mind as one of its core goals and strengths. Systems programming is programming within a resource contrained environment. However, as a lot of our services run now in paid-for-usage cloud environments, we can also consider them as resource constrained environments. This is why Rust is a great fit for more use cases then people might realize.</p>
<p dir="auto">As it is a modern language and has taken the lessons from many other languages before it, it is also surprisingly pleasant to use once you get the hang of it. Its type system also allows expressive code that can help you exclude a great categories of bugs beyond the benefits that static typing can bring.</p>
<p dir="auto">The goal of this guide is to introduce Rust to you as an individual or an entire organization. Should this not be sufficient you can also contact me for 1-on-1 coaching or workshops for your organization, by emailing me at <a href="mailto:glen@plabayo.tech">glen@plabayo.tech</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.glendc.com/" rel="nofollow">Glen De Cauwsemaecker</a> created this Educational track to help you get started with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a> from an absolute beginner all the way until you’re an expert in it. He is open to mentor people, lead workshops and more. If you’re a team lead that wants to introduce Rust to their team, feel free to talk to him. Glen started with Rust around 2015, when Rust was still unstable and fast moving. Coming from a C++ background in a system programming job the benefits were immediately clear to him. In the meanwhile things have changed a lot and many companies have been starting to adopt Rust in their toolset:</p>

<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has used Rust since 2017 for its serverless computing offerings, AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate. With that, Rust has gained further inroads. The company has written the Bottlerocket OS and the AWS Nitro System to deliver its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.</li>
<li>Cloudflare develops many of its services, including its public DNS, serverless computing, and packet inspection offerings with Rust.</li>
<li>Dropbox rebuilt its backend warehouse, which manages exabytes of storage, with Rust.</li>
<li>Google develops parts of Android, such as its Bluetooth module, with Rust. Rust is also used for the crosvm component of Chrome OS and plays an important role in Google’s new operating system, Fuchsia.</li>
<li>Facebook uses Rust to power Facebook’s web, mobile, and API services, as well as parts of HHVM, the HipHop virtual machine used by the Hack programming language.</li>
<li>Microsoft writes components of its Azure platform including a security daemon for its Internet of Things (IoT) service in Rust.</li>
<li>Mozilla uses Rust to enhance the Firefox web browser, which contains 15 million lines of code. Mozilla’s first two Rust-in-Firefox projects, its MP4 metadata parser and text encoder/decoder, led to overall performance and stability improvements.</li>
<li>GitHub’s npm, Inc., uses Rust to deliver “upwards of 1.3 billion package downloads per day.”</li>
<li>Oracle developed a container runtime with Rust to overcome problems with the Go reference implementation.</li>
<li>Samsung, via its subsidiary SmartThings, uses Rust in its Hub, which is the firmware backend for its Internet of Things (IoT) service.</li>
<li><a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-identified-as-safer-coding-tool-by-nist/" rel="nofollow">The U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has added Rust to its list of “Safer Languages” as part of its Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The language and its ecosystem have also very matured. Concepts like Async have also landed and Async runtimes such as Tokio have become stable and can be used without fear. While it was harder to convince companies to jump on the Rust wagon in the past, by now it should be a lot easier to sell. Is it one language to replace them all? Of course not, but neither should it be overlooked. Are you not sure how Rust might benefit your team for one thing or another? Contact <a href="https://www.glendc.com/" rel="nofollow">Glen</a> and figure it out together.</p>

<p dir="auto">ⓘ <strong>Hardcore</strong> alternative</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/" rel="nofollow">Programming Rust, 2nd Edition</a> (O’Reilly Publishing) is a big book and will take you some time to get through. It is not for the faint of heart. However… If you do choose for this route as an alternative to <a href="#1-learn-rust">(1) Learn Rust</a>, you will absolutely not regret it. In fact, your entire rest of the Journey will be a breeze.</p>
<p dir="auto">The “Programming Rust, 2nd Edition” book is a gem and in case you can handle big dry Technical books such as these it is one that will give you just as much love back as the energy that you put into it. Take your time, get through it, play with it, and enjoy. In fact, it can be easily paired with Rustlings by doing the exercises linked to the content you’re reading. Rust by Example can also be added on top of that to see some more code related to the stuff your learning.</p>
<p dir="auto">Soak it in. It’s a hardcore alternative, but if you’re up for it, it’s there for you to grab.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you’ve never done any Systems programming before, this will be an especially helpful book given it will explain a lot of the magic you’ve encountered in your very protected professional life so far. You’re welcome.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once you went through the resources in the previous two chapters you might want to start working on a real project to start applying and solidifying your knowledge. A classic way to do this is by porting a small specialized codebase from one language to Rust, keeping in mind to not 1-to-1 map the lines of code but to instead focus on porting the logic with the “Rust way to do things” in mind.</p>
<p dir="auto">Should you want some inspiration or a more guided approach, here are some resources that could help you out with this extra optional, but recommended step:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424/" rel="nofollow">Command-Line Rust</a>: build a cli tool such as grep in rust, using test driven development (TDD), all to learn Rust</li>
<li><a href="https://lborb.github.io/book/applications.html" rel="nofollow">Rust Application Books - The Little Book of Rust Books</a>: lists a lot of different books, including ones that allow you to develop small projects using Rust, usually in a well guided fashion;
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">Introduction - PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project</a> is an especially fun small project. It allows you to apply the knowledge that you learned above in a very narrow program, that is for once not network related. At the end you’ll have a cli tool that allows you to encode and decode “hidden” messages in a PNG image;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://tfpk.github.io/macrokata/index.html" rel="nofollow">Introduction - MacroKata</a>: Macro’s are in general not very covered in the resources above, as it is not that common that you have to write your own macros. They can however be convenient in certain situations. This book can be seen as a bootstrap tutorial to get you started with one kind of Rust macros.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you are interested in (also) learning procedural macros you can perhaps consult the following resources:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop">GitHub - dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop: Learn to write Rust procedural macros [Rust Latam conference, Montevideo Uruguay, March 2019]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geovSK3wMB8" rel="nofollow">Procedural Macros in Rust (part 1)</a></li>
<li>Check out &#34;<a href="https://diesel.rs/" rel="nofollow">Diesel is a Safe, Extensible ORM and Query Builder for Rust</a>&#34; if you want to see a very cool example of macros (besides all the derives, formatting and printing you might already have been doing)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/macro.json.html" rel="nofollow">json in serde_json - Rust</a> is another neat example as it allows you to quickly define a Json value directly in Rust
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Taking a couple of hours is also a life well spent reading through this codebase as it will teach you a lot of nice things about Rust, especially given how simple and scoped the problem of json serialization is. It will really show you and teach you how serde works and why it works;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most web frameworks (if not all) in Rust also heavily make use of Macro’s to give you a very neat and clean API</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And of course do not forget to consult the “classic” macro Rust book: <a href="https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/index.html" rel="nofollow">The Little Book of Rust Macros</a></li>
<li>If you want to get a quick intro and overview of Macros this video can help a lot as well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWRPYBoCEaY" rel="nofollow">Rust&#39;s Witchcraft</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you have a lot of free time at your hand and you want to build something really cool that is totally useless, here are some more ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Build your own Gameboy (classic) emulator: <a href="https://rylev.github.io/DMG-01/public/book/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">Introduction - DMG-01: How to Emulate a Game Boy</a></li>
<li>Build your own CHIP-8 (8-bit computer) interpreter: <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM" rel="nofollow">Cowgod&#39;s Chip-8 Technical Reference</a> (no Rust guidance, directly from the CHIP-8 specification instead, you can do it, I believe in you)</li>
<li>Build your own Ray Tracer (not a Rust tutorial, but can easily be implemented in Rust as well): <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series</a> (fun if you always had the dream to start dabbling into the world of Graphics Programming)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Seriously though, do not consider the above recommended or mandatory in any way. If you however really like to develop stuff and you do like to do it extensively in your free time, then, and only then, I do believe that the above are a great way to really solidify your current Rust knowledge and give yourself a great (pragmatic) foundation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once you get at this point you are around the level of a beginner or intermediate Rust programmer. At this point you could already start to tackle stuff like <a href="#6-study-using-the-rust-for-rustaceans-idiomatic-programming-for-experienced-developers-book">“Rust for Rustaceans” of step (6)</a>. However it might be a bit much.</p>
<p dir="auto">Therefore while you go through the next couple of sections it could be helpful to now and then (e.g. while washing dishes or instead of Netflix) an education Rust code video. In the appendix at the bottom of this page there a couple of such suggestions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Particular to this context you might want to save <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAl-9HwD858&amp;list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa" rel="nofollow">the “Crust of Rust” playlist</a>. Each video will go over a specific topic, e.g. Lifetimes, macros, Atomics, … No need to watch them one by one, feel free to jump to them in whatever orders and only those that interest you (which is the same tip that I can give for the &#34;Rust for Rustaceans&#34; book).</p>

Learn Async Rust</h2>
<p dir="auto">There is no standard / official Asynchronous runtime. This in contrast to actual CPU threads <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html" rel="nofollow">which you can create from within the std library</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The most popular and recommended by many Async Runtime is <a href="https://tokio.rs/" rel="nofollow">the Tokio runtime</a>. Which brings us to the next chapter:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>To start with your Async Learning Journey you might want to start with: <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/" rel="nofollow">Getting Started - Asynchronous Programming in Rust</a>;</li>
<li>Afterwards you can finally start going through the Tokio <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial" rel="nofollow">learning journey Tutorial | Tokio - An asynchronous Rust runtime</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Please also join the Tokio Discord community as part of your async Journey, a place where you can ask any questions you want as well: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tokio" rel="nofollow">https://discord.com/invite/tokio</a>. It will be a place you want to be in once you start working for the Crawler team on RSProxy and its dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">As an extra you may also want to read and develop alongside the following articles:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-http-crash-course-nobody-asked-for" rel="nofollow">The HTTP crash course nobody asked for</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep" rel="nofollow">Understanding Rust futures by going way too deep</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">ⓘ Note: Tokio also provides support to <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/" rel="nofollow">the new Linux kernel io_uring concept</a>, a new powerful way to allow async programming on Linux. Support for it can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-uring">GitHub - tokio-rs/tokio-uring: An io_uring backed runtime for Rust</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Synacktiv made an IO network scanner using io_uring as can be seen at <a href="https://github.com/synacktiv/io_uring_scanner">GitHub - synacktiv/io_uring_scanner: io_uring based network scanner written in Rust</a>, using tokio’s low level userspace bindings to io_uring.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once you step into the world of Async Rust, Tokio and Web Services you&#39;ll sooner or later come across <a href="https://github.com/tower-rs/tower">Tower</a>, in a similar fashion as <a href="https://serde.rs/" rel="nofollow">Serde</a> blew your mind away for your serialization needs. Yes it did, you can admit it, this is a safe space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Tower is a library of modular and reusable components for building robust networking clients and servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">With <a href="https://github.com/tower-rs/tower">Tower</a> everything is a service. A service takes in a request and outputs either an error or a response.
What the actual types for these request-response pairs are, is up to you and depend mostly on the layer it is used.</p>
<p dir="auto">In tower it is typical that a service wraps another service, called &#34;layers&#34;, as such all your services and middleware will stack on top of each other,
like a... <em>tower</em>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>if you are new to Tower you can start learning how to use it by building your own tower middleware from scratch by following the guide at: <a href="https://github.com/tower-rs/tower/blob/master/guides/building-a-middleware-from-scratch.md">https://github.com/tower-rs/tower/blob/master/guides/building-a-middleware-from-scratch.md</a>;
<ul dir="auto">
<li>if you are not convinced on the usefulness of Tower you perhaps read to <a href="https://tokio.rs/blog/2021-05-14-inventing-the-service-trait" rel="nofollow">the &#34;inventing your own Service trait&#34; guide</a>.</li>

<p dir="auto">Understanding concurrency, the primitives used to do so safely and how it all works “under the hood” (e.g. the OS level) is not critical but it will help you big time the rest of your Async professional career.</p>
<p dir="auto">The book “<a href="https://marabos.nl/atomics/" rel="nofollow">Rust Atomics and Locks</a>” by O’Reilly is an amazingly good book by Mara Bos, an important Rust Contributor. Going through the book will take you some time despite its smaller size, but doing so is very rewarding. As with any technical book it is best to read this book as well as do its exercises and apply its knowledge using one program or another. Learn, Apply, Repeat. Play with it, Understand it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This book is so good, that even Go, Python or JS developers that will never ever touch Rust, might want to learn Rust just to understand the knowledge that can be found in this Gem of a book. Read it. You won’t regret it.</p>
<p dir="auto">As it is more advanced knowledge it can however be seen as “Extra”, so in case you are in a hurry to finish <a href="#3-learn-async-rust">section (3) of the Rust track</a>, feel free to skip it. But even if so, keep its existence in mind and come perhaps back to it when you start to get yourself into trouble.</p>

<p dir="auto">Contribute to an open source project that you like or may want to strongly depend upon in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto">Many projects have a <code>good first issue</code> label, which is a good place to start. You can also look for issues that are labeled <code>help wanted</code> or <code>easy</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">There&#39;s also the Rust Mentorship program, which pairs up new contributors with experienced Rustaceans.

Install Rust</h3>
<p dir="auto">In order to start using Rust you have to install and configure its tooling on your machinery.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The Rust compiler (<code>rustc</code>), standard library and tooling (e.g. <code>cargo</code>) are all managed using <code>rustup</code>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You can learn how to get started by going to: Getting started</li>
<li>Once you finished with this you’ll have Rust ready on your machine out of the box. Each time there is a new version of Rust you can update it, simply by running <code>rustup update</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">With this installed you should now be able to run the following command:</p>

<p dir="auto">Which will output something like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo 1.67.1 (8ecd4f20a 2023-01-10)"><pre><code>cargo 1.67.1 (8ecd4f20a 2023-01-10)
</code></pre></div>

WebAssembly (WASM)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://webassembly.org/" rel="nofollow">https://webassembly.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">WebAssembly on itself is completely isolated from Rust, but it must be said that among the WASM community, the Rust part is probably the biggest and most active one. Compiling Rust to WASM is a true pleasure and allows for browser client code to be written in Rust, be it a small library to be used from JS or an entire web client. WASM projects can also be used to quickly deploy web services (in the backend). These are similar to lambda functions but are even faster to use and in a way also safer.</p>

Native Apps</h3>
<p dir="auto">Native apps are applications written for a specific platform. While that could be any platform, it usually refers to anything that is not the “web” and even more so, these days, it pretty much always refers to Desktop, Mobile or the combination of. Cross platform apps mean that multiple platforms are supported, which could be any set of web or non-web platforms.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Tauri</strong> is the toolset you want to check out if you want to build native apps with a Gui in Rust. You can find all information about it on their official website: <a href="https://tauri.app/" rel="nofollow">https://tauri.app/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Build an optimized, secure, and frontend-independent application for multi-platform deployment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Tauri applications can be compared to Electron, but it uses a very different approach. Multiple rendering engines are supported, with web view like rendering engines being the default. But this is still different then shipping a Node runtime and Chromium with each and one of your apps. Meaning your desktop applications can be as small as a couple of megabytes, compared to the usually bloated 150MB apps. And once running they will also be a lot less resource hungry compared to your topical Electron app.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mobile applications are not yet officially supported, but they will soon get support as well, as the underlying technology for it is already more or less ready.</p>
<p dir="auto">In case you want to write applications that work on both the web and a non-web platform you can achieve this by splitting of your business logic from your minimal front-end logic, such that you can write one front-end in any of the available front-end approaches (e.g. leptos or perseus) and another one using Tauri, with most of your code being available as one or more Rust libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto">The front-end logic can be written using any web application front-end framework, e.g. Svelte.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also opt to go fully native by using plugins such as tauri-egui: <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-egui">https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-egui</a></p>

Rust in the background</h3>
<p dir="auto">As with any (new) language, there’s no point in replacing every existing technology written before, with a new implementation written in Rust. While at times there are benefits such as with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> instead of grep, this is not a generally useful strategy not a desired one.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In <a href="#appendix-i-install-rust">Appendix I.</a> we already saw that Rust can be compiled to WASM, and as such you can build an entire WebApp in Rust. However instead of replacing your entire WebApp, it is also just as well possible that you only replace the components of your App where it makes sense, e.g. where you need to do a lot of computations;</li>
<li>In <a href="#appendix-ii-webassembly-wasm">Appendix II.</a> we learned about Tauri to build native apps with Rust, and also here noted that it can be done while at the same time building your core frontend logic in the frameworks you are used to;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">At times however you might be able to incorporate the benefits of Rust in your existing benefits without having to expose the language to anyone:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm">FNM</a> is a replacement for NVM. While the latter is more powerful the first is a lot faster, which speeds up terminal start up times by a lot, just to give one benefit;</li>
<li><a href="https://deno.land/" rel="nofollow">Deno</a> can be used as a replacement for NodeJS, and can not only run javascript but also typescript (for which you would otherwise use something like ts-node). It is not a 1-to-1 replacement, and it will require some effort, but it is already today a faster and more secure alternative;</li>
<li><a href="https://swc.rs/" rel="nofollow">SWC</a> is a speedy light alternative to babel, with the first outperforming the last with its eyes closed and 1 foot still in the bed;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">These give just a small taste of what Rust can mean for Web developers even if they do not know or use Rust themselves directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">A language is a tool, but a tool is not to be applied to any problem. Rust has its advantages and use cases, it would be foolish not to use it where desirable.</p>

Python / Javascript Developers</h3>
<p dir="auto">In case you come from Python or Javascript you can alternatively replace the first four steps of this learning guide with a single book. <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/rust-web-programming-second-edition/9781803234694" rel="nofollow">Rust Web Programming</a> (Packt Publishing) aims to get web developers (including Python developers) get started with Rust and has a very pragmatic approach.</p>
<p dir="auto">Given how important Async is in our work environment it is still worth to go through section <a href="#3-learn-async-rust">(3) “Learn Async Rust”</a> to make sure you do really grasp that very well. It is also where a lot of your Rust knowledge starts to come together, so if you get that you know you’re on the right track.</p>
<p dir="auto">Should you after completing this book (even if partly) want to have some more hands on experience you can opt to never the less do section (4) as well and go through <a href="#4-study-using-the-zero-to-production-in-rust-book">the “Zero to Production in Rust” book</a></p>
<p dir="auto">However, in case you are confident you did get all the foundational concepts of Rust and want to just develop stuff already and get it “into your fingers” you might want to opt to after this (and before jumping onto section (5)) read <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action" rel="nofollow">“Rust In Action”</a> first. It gives a lot of fun things to build. Alternatively you can check the “Learn More Rust: Extra” part of <a href="#2-learn-more-rust">section (2) Learn more Rust</a>, where we also go over many ideas for you to get more experience and help you solidify your Rust knowledge.</p>
<p dir="auto">The “Rust in Action” book can also be seen as yet another alternative all together, as it is also aimed at introducing Rust to people who never did any Systems programming, So you could also do it instead of the Rust Web Programming book.</p>

<li>If you like to learn by watching you can find a Rust streaming list at <a href="https://github.com/jamesmunns/awesome-rust-streaming/">https://github.com/jamesmunns/awesome-rust-streaming/</a></li>
<li>Interesting youtube channel with a lot of great stuff to learn about Rust: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate</a></li>
<li>If any of the basic (textual) learning resources from the actual learning journey didn’t quite work for you, you might find a video course more useful. If so, here are two of them:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/" rel="nofollow">Ultimate Rust Crash Course</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-2/" rel="nofollow">Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you need inspiration on things you can build with Rust to get the language in your fingers as well as learn how software that you use is implemented, you might want to check out: <a href="https://app.codecrafters.io/tracks/rust" rel="nofollow">https://app.codecrafters.io/tracks/rust</a></li>
<li>Learn Full Stack Rust Interactively: <a href="https://rustinsight.com/" rel="nofollow">Rust Insight! - an interactive book for practicing Rust on the laptop</a> (early access)</li>
<li>A big index of many more learning resources, named aptly “How to learn Modern Rust — A Guide to the adventurer”: <a href="https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen/How_to_learn_modern_Rust">https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen/How_to_learn_modern_Rust</a>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Do not take the list as-is and use mostly as inspiration. No need to really do all on that list, but if you need more learning resources, there is plenty of good content and inspiration in there!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Black Hat Rust book: <a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust" rel="nofollow">https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust</a> (could be nice for inspiration on some hands-on experience while becoming more familiar with Rust)</li>
<li>If you want to test your Rust concept skills you might also enjoy taking <a href="https://dtolnay.github.io/rust-quiz/" rel="nofollow">the Rust Quiz</a>. The more answers you have wrong the better, as it means you’ll learn new things from the explanation :)</li>
<li>If you want to learn by doing by contributing to an existing Rust OSS project (including the Rust language and tooling) you can try to find a mentor to help you for free online in achieving this, by going to Awesome Rust Mentors: <a href="https://rustbeginners.github.io/awesome-rust-mentors/" rel="nofollow">https://rustbeginners.github.io/awesome-rust-mentors/</a></li>
