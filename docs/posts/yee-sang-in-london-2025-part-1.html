<p><span id="more-21368"></span>From the title of this post you can guess that I am in London this Chinese New Year. A combination of some minor but nevertheless niggling health issues have grounded both me and Mr Gochugaru. At the end of the work day we watch the medical show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)">House</a>, hoping we never develop the kinds of illnesses and complications that the patients present in each episode. If we do, then we would insist on being treated by a tenacious doctor like Gregory House who will get to the bottom of the problem.</p>
<p>Every year around Chinese New Year time the family gathers round to toss the fresh and colourful salad known as <em>yee sang</em>. Since the CNY always falls between 21 January and 20 February, we tend to include Mr Gochugaru&#8217;s birthday (January 22) or Niece No 2&#8217;s birthday (February 15) at the same time. Two celebrations for the price of one, we say.</p>
<p>Here are the creations from Junior 2 + Co for the following animal years: <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2024/02/yee-sang-in-london-2024/">Dragon</a> in 2024, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2023/01/yee-sang-in-london-2023/">Rabbit</a> in 2023, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2022/02/chinese-new-year-in-london-2022-part-2/">Tiger</a> in 2022, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2021/02/chinese-new-year-in-london-2021/">Lockdown Ox</a> in 2021, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2020/02/chinese-new-year-in-london-2020/">Rat</a> in 2020, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2019/02/chinese-new-year-in-london-2019/">Pig</a> in 2019, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2018/03/marching-on/">Dog</a> in 2018 and <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2016/02/chinese-new-year-yee-sang-in-london/">Monkey</a> in 2016. We missed a family gathering in the Year of the Rooster in 2017 due to my travelling, as my father was receiving treatment for cancer at the time. This year, 2025, is the Year of the Snake. As I am not partial to snakes, I banned a snake-shaped yee sang. Next year would also be a challenge as it is the Year of the Horse. Maybe we can commission a horseshoe-shaped design.</p>

<p>Depending on numbers, sometimes we make two platters of yee sang.Â This year we started with a large 46 cm tray (from <a href="https://avenidahome.com">Avenida Home</a>) which we lined on the rim with salad leaves. The centre of the tray was then built up with other vegetables and fruit which were sliced or spiralized. I have also previously used a large 54 cm tea tray which was hand-carried home from Marrakesh. For making two platters, we use our metal Alessi trays.</p>

<p>Our family version of yee sang is vegan and oil-free, although drizzling over a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil at the end would be a fragrant addition. The vegetables are shredded fresh on the day, unlike commercial yee sang served in restaurants where most of the vegetables are dry, pickled or coloured and deep-fried. It takes some time to make this salad but it gives so much pleasure to everyone involved in tossing it to bring good fortune. In my busyness this year I forgot to shred the mango and red chilli, but have included it in the recipe below. This year we had a special addition of purple carrots from <a href="https://www.riverford.co.uk">Riverford</a>. I have two more dinners with friends and relatives, and am happily anticipating making the salads again. More photos and a run through of the ingredients in the next post.</p>

<p>Yee Sang in a Nutshell:</p>
<p>The shopping list is long and colourful. It would easily help towards your <a href="https://zoe.com/learn/30-plants-per-week">30 plants a week</a>: red and green salad leaves, orange and purple carrot, white daikon/mooli, unripe yellow mango, pink or cream pomelo, red pomegranate seeds, fresh green coriander, spring onion, pickled sushi ginger, pickled silverskin onions, roasted unsalted peanuts, toasted sesame seeds, red and green chillies, lime leaves, plum jam, limes and rice vinegar. The crackers are deep-fried sliced gyoza skins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yee Sang in Detail:</p>
<p>Wash and refresh one or two heads of red salad leaves e.g. radicchio, red oak leaf, red chicory or ruby gem lettuce. Sometimes we add green salad leaves e.g. rocket, little gem or butter lettuce. This will line the tray.</p>
<p>Start with sensible quantities of spiralized carrot, daikon/ mooli and shredded unripe mango. This will form the backbone of the dish. Sometimes we add finely shredded red cabbage.</p>
<p>For a burst of flavour add small quantities of peeled pomelo, pomegranate seeds, fresh coriander leaves and shredded spring onion.</p>
<p>For additional sweet-sour flavours add pickled sushi ginger and thinly sliced pickled silverskin onions.</p>
<p>For nuttiness add chopped roasted unsalted peanuts and toasted sesame seeds.</p>
<p>For real crunchiness slice some dumpling skin and deep-fry to make the crackers. I have found that gyoza dumpling skins are better for this than wantan dumpling skins as they are thicker and puff up attractively.</p>
<p>Add sliced chillies (one red and one green) for a shot of heat.</p>
<p>Finally for theÂ <i>je ne sais quoi</i> moment, add the secret ingredient of finely shredded lime leaves. You need to take the centre stem off the leaf then place them in a stack and using your sharpest knife, slice them as thinly as you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Dressing (for a 6 person salad, so please double or triple as necessary)</p>
<p>200g plum jam (I use Bonne Mamanâs Mirabelle Plum Jam)<br />
2 tablespoons lime juice<br />
Lime zest<br />
1Â½ teaspoons rice vinegar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Chinese Zodiac animals in order: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram (or goat), monkey, rooster, dog and pig.
