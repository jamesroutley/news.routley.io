    <h1>Counted B-Trees (2017)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
B-trees are one of the best known algorithms around. A full
treatment of them is available in any good algorithms book. They are
a means of storing a sorted list of items, in such a way that
single-item insertion, deletion and lookup all operate in
<code>log(N)</code>
time. They can be optimised for in-memory access (2-3-4 trees) or
optimised to be used as an on-disk database, but the algorithms are
essentially the same either way.

</p><p>
This page describes a small enhancement to the B-tree algorithm
which allows lookups on numeric position as well as key value.
Applied to an already sorted B-tree, it enables you to find
arbitrary ordering statistics (median, percentiles) in log time, or
to step through the tree five hundred items at a time, or other such
things. It also allows you to construct an <em>unsorted</em> B-tree,
where you specify a numeric position when inserting a new item. This
structure behaves a lot like an array, except that you can insert
and delete items efficiently.

</p><p>
(I&#39;m not posting this idea here because I think it&#39;s new and
innovative. It was so obvious to me that I&#39;d be astonished if nobody
else had ever thought of it. But a lot of people seem not to know
about it, so it does qualify as unusual and not widely known.)

</p><h2><a name="algorithm">Algorithm Description</a></h2>

<p>
To recap on B-trees themselves: a B-tree is a fixed-depth tree (any
path from the root to a leaf is the same length) with variable size
nodes. An internal node can contain between <code>N</code> and
<code>2N</code> links to subtrees, or fewer if it&#39;s the root
of the tree. Between every pair of links to subtrees is an element.
(Elements are the things stored by the tree.) Leaf nodes have the
same size restrictions as internal nodes, but all their subtree
links are null.

</p><p>
Here is an example B-tree, containing the letters of the alphabet.

<p>
The change we introduce for a counted B-tree is simply this:
alongside every link to a subtree, we store a count of the number of
elements stored in that <em>whole</em> subtree. For example, this is
what might happen to the tree shown above.

<p>
Then it&#39;s easy to look up the <code>i</code>th element in the tree: you
can look at the root node and work out which subtree the element is
in (or whether it&#39;s one of the elements <em>in</em> the root node),
and then recurse down to the next node adjusting your count. In full:
</p><ul>
<li>
We begin with <code>i</code> giving the index within the tree of the
element we want. Let&#39;s assume that the tree is indexed from zero. We
start our search at the root node.
</li><li>
So we&#39;re looking at a node. Let&#39;s call its subtree links
<code>S0, S1, S2, ...</code>,
and the associated element counts
<code>C0, C1, C2, ...</code>,
and the elements in between <code>E0, E1, ...</code>. The number
<code>i</code> denotes the index of the element we&#39;re looking for,
within the subtree starting from this node. (So we adjust
<code>i</code> every time we narrow our search to a new subtree.)
</li><li>
So the layout of the node is:
<ul>
<li>
the subtree below <code>S0</code> covers elements
<code>0..C0-1</code> of the tree
</li><li>
element <code>E0</code> is element number <code>C0</code> of the tree
</li><li>
the subtree below <code>S1</code> covers elements
<code>C0+1..C0+C1</code> of the tree
</li><li>
element <code>E1</code> is element number <code>C0+C1+1</code> of
the tree
</li><li>
the subtree below <code>S1</code> covers elements
<code>C0+C1+2..C0+C1+C2+1</code> of the tree
</li><li>
element <code>E2</code> is element number <code>C0+C1+C2+1</code> of
the tree
</li><li>
... and so on.
</li></ul>
</li><li>
So if <code>i &gt;= 0</code> and <code>i &lt;= C0-1</code>,
then we will descend through
<code>S0</code> and leave <code>i</code> as it is.
</li><li>
If <code>i = C0</code>, then we return <code>E0</code>.
</li><li>
If <code>i &gt;= 1+C0</code> and <code>i &lt;= C0+C1</code>, then
we will descend through <code>S1</code>, and subtract
<code>C0+1</code> from <code>i</code>.
</li><li>
If <code>i = C0+C1+1</code>, then we return <code>E1</code>.
</li><li>
... and so on. If we haven&#39;t found the node already, we will have
found a node to descend to, and an adjustment of <code>i</code> to
make it denote the index <em>within</em> the subtree we are
descending to.
</li></ul>

<p>
It&#39;s also easy to do an ordinary lookup by key and provide, as an
extra return value, the numeric index of the element you return.
Simply set a counter <code>K</code> to zero before beginning the
lookup. Then, every time you recurse down to another node, you
update <code>K</code> to reflect the number of elements
<em>before</em> the beginning of the subtree you are recursing into.

</p><p>
The adjustments to the B-tree insertion and deletion algorithms are
pretty much trivial. When you split a node into two, you must add up
the subtree counts in each half to determine what to put in the
subtree counts of the new links to that node. When you add or remove
a subtree in the middle of a node, you need to adjust the count in
the link to that node.

</p><p>
The insertion routine can be modified so that instead of using a
sorted lookup to determine where to insert the new element, it uses
the numeric lookup described above. Then you have the ability to
deliberately insert an element into a B-tree at an arbitrary index.
Using this, you can implement an unsorted B-tree with no comparison
routine at all - inserting an item requires a given index, and
lookups are only done numerically.

</p><p>
One further enhancement, for special purposes, might be this: if
each of the elements in your tree has some notion of &#34;size&#34; in
itself, you could store the total <em>size</em> of all the elements
in a subtree instead of the total <em>number</em> of elements. This
would enable a slightly different type of index lookup.

</p><h2><a name="complexity">Complexity</a></h2>

<p>
The adjustments to existing B-tree algorithms don&#39;t change the
<code>O(log N)</code> complexity. The new types of lookup are also
<code>O(log N)</code>. So this data structure keeps all the existing
desirable properties of a B-tree and also adds new ones.

</p><h2><a name="applications">Applications</a></h2>

<p>
Unsorted counted B-trees are an ideal way to store the contents of
an editor buffer. You have the ability to step back and forth within
the structure (moving up and down), to jump to an arbitrarily
numbered item (index lookup), and to insert and delete items with
great efficiency. So you can do all the normal editing operations in
log time. The only thing that can be done faster any other way is
special cases of cut-and-paste: if your buffer were a linked list,
you&#39;d be able to unlink a section and link it in somewhere else in
constant time, but with counted B-trees you have to move each item
about one by one. However, the <em>general</em> case of cut and
paste is necessarily linear-time in any case, because users often
want to copy rather than cutting, and when you paste you can&#39;t just
link the paste buffer into the document because the user will expect
the paste buffer still to contain a copy afterwards.

</p><p>
<em>Sorted</em> counted B-trees, with the ability to look items up
<em>either</em> by key or by number, could be useful in
database-like algorithms for query planning. For example, suppose
you have one set of records, indexed on two keys by two separate
B-trees. Suppose you want to find all records whose first key is in
one range and whose second is in another. You will have to either
look up all records satisfying the first condition and then test
them to see if they satisfy the second, or vice versa. But which is
more efficient?

</p><p>
If your B-trees are counted, you can quickly find out the number of
records satisfying the condition on the first key, and the number
satisfying the condition on the second. Based on this, you can
decide whether it would be quicker to iterate through the first
index testing the second condition, or the other way round.

</p><p>
Finally, a counted B-tree allows you to easily extract order
statistics from a changing data set: percentiles and medians. I
can&#39;t think of any circumstances in which you might want to insert
and remove items from a data set while keeping a running track of
the median value, but if you need to do it, counted B-trees will let
you.

A full implementation of counted 2-3-4 trees (B-trees with
<code>N=2</code>) in C is provided for download here.

<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/tree234.h">tree234.h</a>.

</p><p>
This code should be fit for production use, although of course
nothing is guaranteed. It&#39;s a derivative of the ordinary (uncounted)
B-tree code used in
<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>.
It&#39;s available for use under the free MIT licence: see the top of
each source file for details.

</p><p>
It supports both sorted and unsorted trees. For sorted trees, you
can look up by index or by key, and delete elements by index or by key
as well. Key lookups can be inexact: for example, you can ask for
the largest element that&#39;s less than or equal to <code>x</code>, or the
smallest element greater than <code>x</code>, as well as just finding a
specific element.

</p><p>
This code does not support elements with a notion of size: it only
stores the <em>count</em> of elements.

</p><p>
If you define the macro <code>TEST</code> when compiling, it will
generate a reasonably thorough stand-alone self-test.
