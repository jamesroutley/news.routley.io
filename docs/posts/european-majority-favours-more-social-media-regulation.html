This may be less to do with political ideology and more to do with partisanship – it is possible that such voters expect that tighter regulation might be used to disadvantage their parties. Notably, in Italy – currently governed by the far-right Fratelli d’Italia – this party’s voters are the <i>most</i> likely to think regulations are too relaxed.</p><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></section></yg-cms-content></div></div>
