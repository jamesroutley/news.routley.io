    <h1>Big endian and little endian</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every time I run into endianness, I have to look it up.
Which way do the bytes go, and what does that mean?
Something about it breaks my brain, and makes me feel like I can&#39;t tell which way is up and down, left and right.</p>
<p>This is the blog post I&#39;ve needed every time I run into this.
I hope it&#39;ll be the post you need, too.</p>

<p>The term comes from Gulliver&#39;s travels, referring to a conflict over cracking boiled eggs on the big end or the little end<sup id="fr-obvious-1"><a href="#fn-obvious">[1]</a></sup>.
In computers, the term refers to the order of bytes within a segment of data, or a word.
Specifically, it only refers to the order of <em>bytes</em>, as those are the smallest unit of addressable data: bits are not individually addressable.</p>
<p>The two main orderings are big-endian and little-endian.
Big-endian means you store the &#34;big&#34; end first: the most-significant byte (highest value) goes into the smallest memory address.
Little-endian means you store the &#34;little&#34; end first: the least-significant byte (smallest value) goes into the smallest memory address.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the number 168496141 as an example.
This is 0x0A0B0C0D in hex.</p>
<p>If we store 0x0A at address <em>a</em>, 0x0B at <em>a+1</em>, 0x0C at <em>a+2</em>, and 0x0D at <em>a+3</em>, then this is <em>big-endian</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turing.ac.uk/images/endian/endian-01.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>And then if we store it in the other order, with 0x0D at <em>a</em> and 0x0A at <em>a+3</em>, it&#39;s <em>little-endian</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turing.ac.uk/images/endian/endian-02.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>And... there&#39;s also mixed-endianness, where you use one kind within a word (say, little-endian) and a different  ordering for words themselves (say, big-endian).
If our example is on a system that has 2-byte words (for the sake of illustration), then we could order these bytes in a mixed-endian fashion.
One possibility would be to put 0x0B in <em>a</em>, 0x0A in <em>a+1</em>, 0x0D in <em>a+2</em>, and 0x0C in <em>a+3</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turing.ac.uk/images/endian/endian-03.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>There are certainly <em>reasons</em> to do this, and it comes up on some ARM processors, but... it feels so utterly cursed.
Let&#39;s ignore it for the rest of this!</p>
<p>For me, the intuitive ordering is big-ending, because it feels like it matches how we read and write numbers in English<sup id="fr-conlang-1"><a href="#fn-conlang">[2]</a></sup>.
If lower memory addresses are on the left, and higher on the right, then this is the left-to-right ordering, just like digits in a written number.</p>

<p>Given some number, how do I know which endianness it uses?</p>
<p>You don&#39;t, at least not from the number entirely by itself.
Each integer that&#39;s valid in one endianness is still a valid integer in another endianness, it just is a <em>different value</em>.
You have to see how things are used to figure it out.</p>
<p>Or you can figure it out from the system you&#39;re using (or which wrote the data).
If you&#39;re using an x86 or x64 system, it&#39;s <em>mostly</em> little-endian.
(There are some instructions which enable fetching/writing in a big-endian format.)
ARM systems are bi-endian, allowing either.
But perhaps the most popular ARM chips today, Apple silicon, are little-endian.
And the major microcontrollers I checked (AVR, ESP32, ATmega) are little-endian.
It&#39;s thoroughly dominant commercially!</p>
<p>Big-endian systems used to be more common.
They&#39;re not really in most of the systems I&#39;m likely to run into as a software engineer now, though.</p>
<p>You <em>are</em> likely to run into it for some things, though.
Even though we don&#39;t use big-endianness for processor math most of the time, we use it constantly to represent data.
It comes back in networking!</p>
<p>Most of the Internet protocols we know and love, like TCP and IP, use &#34;network order&#34; which means big-endian.
This is mentioned in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1700">RFC 1700</a>, among others.
Other protocols do also use little-endianness again, though, so you can&#39;t always assume that it&#39;s big-endian just because it&#39;s coming over the wire.</p>
<p>So... which you have?
For your processor, probably little-endian.
For data written to the disk or to the wire: who knows, check the protocol!</p>

<p>I mean, ultimately, it&#39;s <em>somewhat</em> arbitrary.
We have an endianness in the way we write, and we could pick either right-to-left or left-to-right.
Both exist, but we need to pick <em>one</em>.
Given that, it makes sense that both would arise over time, since there&#39;s no single entity controlling all computer usage<sup id="fr-anarchy-1"><a href="#fn-anarchy">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are advantages of each, though.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting advantages is that little-endianness lets us pretend integers are whatever size we like, within bounds.</p>
<p>If you write the number 26<sup id="fr-1a-1"><a href="#fn-1a">[4]</a></sup> into memory on a big-endian system, then read bytes from that memory address, it will represent <em>different</em> values depending on how many bytes you read.
The length matters for reading in and interpreting the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turing.ac.uk/images/endian/endian-05.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>If you write it into memory on a <em>little-endian</em> system, though, and read bytes from the address (with the remaining ones zero, very important!), then it  is the <em>same</em> value no matter how many bytes you read.
As long as you don&#39;t truncate the value, at least; 0x0A0B read as an 8-bit int would <em>not</em> be equal to being read as a 16-bit ints, since an 8-bit int can&#39;t hold the entire thing.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turing.ac.uk/images/endian/endian-04.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>This lets you read a value in the size of integer you need for your calculation without conversion.</p>
<p>On the other hand, big-endian values are easier to read and reason about as a human.
If you dump out the raw bytes that you&#39;re working with, a big-endian number can be easier to spot since it matches the numbers we use in English.
This makes it pretty convenient to store values as big-endian, even if that&#39;s not the native format, so you can spot things in a hex dump more easily.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#39;s all kind of arbitrary.
And it&#39;s a pile of standards where everything is made up, nothing matters, and the big-end is obviously the right end of the egg to crack.
You monster.</p>

<p>The correct answer is obviously the big end.
That&#39;s where the little air pocket goes.

<li id="fn-anarchy">
<p>If ever there were, maybe different endianness would be a contentious issue.
Maybe some of our systems would be using big-endian but eventually realize their design was better suited to little-endian, and then spend a long time making that change.
And then the government would become authoritarian on the promise of eradicating endianness-affirming care and—Oops, this became a metaphor. <a href="#fr-anarchy-1">↩</a></p>

<p>26 in hex is 0x1A, which is purely a coincidence and not a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First Amendment</a>.
This is a tech blog, not political, and I definitely stay in my lane.
If it were a reference, though, I&#39;d remind you to exercise their 1A rights<sup id="fr-not-us-1"><a href="#fn-not-us">[5]</a></sup> <em>now</em> and call your elected officials to ensure that we <em>keep</em> these rights.
I&#39;m scared, and I&#39;m staring down the barrel of potential life-threatening circumstances if things get worse.
I expect you&#39;re scared, too.
And you know what?
