    <h1>TreeSheets: Open Source Free Form Data Organizer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <td>
            <p>A &#34;hierarchical spreadsheet&#34; that is a great replacement for spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners, PIMs,
              text editors and small databases.</p>
            <p>Suitable for any kind of data organization, such as todo lists, calendars,
              project management, brainstorming, organizing ideas, planning, requirements
              gathering, presentation of information, etc.
            </p>
            <p>It&#39;s like a spreadsheet, immediately familiar, but much more suitable
              for complex data because it&#39;s hierarchical.
              </p>
            <p>Have a quick look at what the application looks like on the
              <a href="https://strlen.com/treesheets/docs/screenshots.html">screenshots</a> page, see how easy it is to use in the
              <a href="https://strlen.com/treesheets/docs/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>, then give it a download (above).

            <p>TreeSheets is exceptionally small &amp; fast, so can sit in your system
              tray at all times: with several documents loaded representing the equivalent
              of almost 100 pages of text, it uses only 5MB of memory on Windows
              7 (!)</p>
            <p>TreeSheets is free &amp; open source. Enjoy!</p>
