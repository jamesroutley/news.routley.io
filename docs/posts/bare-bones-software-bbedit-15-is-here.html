<h3>What&#39;s new in BBEdit 15?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/notes-15.0.html">Lots.</a> We encourage you to read the complete change notes for all of the <a href="https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/archived_notes.html">BBEdit 15 releases</a>. (We spent a lot of time writing those notes, so it would be great for someone to read them. Be that someone.)</p>

<p>To help catch up, there are also the notes from any <a href="https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/archived_notes.html" target="_blank">older versions</a> that we&#39;ve released since the last time you&#39;ve looked.</p>

<hr/>


<p>Here are just a few of the things that are new or improved in BBEdit 15:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Minimap</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>A new Minimap palette shows a high-level overview of the active text document. This facilitates visualization of the document&#39;s overall structure, as well as navigation within larger documents.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Expandable “Cheat Sheets”</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Building on the concept of the Grep Cheat Sheet used in its Find windows, BBEdit 15 introduces the ability to create and use your own Cheat Sheets, which are functional references for text markup and editing. Included are cheat sheets for basic Markdown syntax and for BBEdit&#39;s clippings placeholders.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ChatGPT Worksheets</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>BBEdit 15’s joins BBEdit’s unique “worksheet” interface to <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, so that you can have conversations with ChatGPT right in BBEdit itself — no application switching or awkward copy/paste from a web browser. Each chat worksheet that you create maintains its own history, so that you can easily refer back to past conversations, or keep a conversation going across an extended period of time.</p>

<p>(<em>Note</em>: In order to use this feature, you will need a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT account</a>, and an <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">API key</a>.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Project Workspace and Settings Improvements</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>BBEdit project documents gain an awareness of the “workspace root”, which for a given project is the “most important directory” in the project. A configured workspace root allows BBEdit to automatically select the correct directory for source control operations, and improves the behavior and completion accuracy of <a href="https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/lsp-notes.html">Language Server Protocol</a> servers which support workspaces.</p>

<p>Additionally, web site settings are more easily available in the project window itself, improving efficiency and productivity as and when changes are needed.</p>

<hr/>


<ul>
<li><strong>New Interface for Text Factories</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>BBEdit’s unique “Text Factory” feature has been reimagined for version 15. All available transformations are listed for easy access, and assembling a factory requires fewer steps. A new “Run Unix Command” operation improves factory portability by storing the Unix command in the factory itself.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>...and much, much more</strong> Of course, these few things aren&#39;t all that&#39;s new in BBEdit 15. In total, BBEdit 15 contains nearly two hundred additions, changes, and refinements. The <a href="https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/notes-15.0.html">detailed change notes</a> contain complete information on what is new and changed in this version.</li>
