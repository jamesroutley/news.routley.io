<p>It has never been <em>too</em> hard for someone with the right amount of time, desperation, or flexible scruples to get around Windows XP&#39;s activation scheme. And yet XP activation, the actual encrypted algorithm, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/memory-lane-before-everyone-loved-windows-xp-they-hated-it/">loathed</a> since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2001/02/wpa/">before it started</a>, has never been truly broken, at least entirely offline. Now, far past the logical end of all things XP, the solution exists, floating around the web&#39;s forum-based backchannels for months now.</p>
<p>On the blog of tinyapps.org (first spotted by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/windows_xp_activation_cracked/">The Register</a>), which provides micro-scale, minimalist utilities for constrained Windows installations, a blog post appropriately titled &#34;<a href="https://tinyapps.org/blog/202304230700_xp_wpa.html">Windows XP Activation: GAME OVER</a>&#34; runs down the semi-recent history of folks looking to activate Windows XP more than 20 years after it debuted, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/xpocalypse-now-windows-xp-support-has-ended/">nine years after its end of life</a>, and, crucially, <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1502796/how-do-i-activate-windowsxp-now-that-support-has-ended">some years</a> after Microsoft turned off its online activation servers (or maybe they just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.3.0-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D1942506%26action%3Dedit&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fold.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwindowsxp%2Fcomments%2Fwwjy5j%2Fwindows_xp_web_activation_is_finally_dead%2Fillm8jz%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=7088dccf3462a17919b7612882ef763d&amp;xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D">swapped certificates</a>).</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>xp_activate32.exe, a 18,432-byte program (hash listed on <a href="https://tinyapps.org/blog/202304230700_xp_wpa.html">tinyapps&#39; blog post</a>), takes the code generated by Windows XP&#39;s phone activation option and processes it into a proper activation key (Confirmation ID), entirely offline. It&#39;s persistent across system wipes and re-installs. It is, seemingly, the same key Microsoft would provide for your computer.</p>
<p>Tools for generating keys that Windows XP would accept existed long before this entirely offline little program—lots and lots of them. But they were typically software hacks or brute-force decryption tools that, while locally accepted, would not validate with Microsoft (for what that&#39;s worth now). Another tool, <a href="https://github.com/TheMCHK/WindowsXPKg">WindowsXPKg</a>, deliciously hosted on the GitHub servers Microsoft owns, can generate keys but requires an external server that, as of this posting, no longer seems to be operating.</p>
<p>Most people won&#39;t actually, hopefully <em>need</em> this tool. Fully functional XP images that you can sandbox inside a virtual machine exist in many places, including Microsoft&#39;s own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/01/windows-xp-mode/">Windows XP Mode for Windows 7</a>. And, of course, installing a highly unsupported XP on a device that&#39;s connected to the modern Internet is malice aforethought. Let us all enjoy this for the rhetorical, mathematical victory that it is, while we say a small prayer for those dealing with hardware that truly needs XP.</p>
