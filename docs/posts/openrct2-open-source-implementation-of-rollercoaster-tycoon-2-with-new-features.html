    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" poster="/assets/videos/home.png"><source src="/assets/videos/home.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p><em>OpenRCT2</em> is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2), expanding the game with <a href="https://openrct2.org/features">new features</a>, <a href="https://openrct2.org/changelog">fixing bugs</a> and raising game limits. The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.</p></section></div></div>
