      When EU lawmakers voted to <a href="https://cnn.com/2022/06/08/business/eu-climate-vote-energy-intl/index.html" target="_blank">ban the sale</a> of new combustion engine cars in the bloc by 2035, it was a landmark victory for climate. In February, the European Parliament approved the law.<strong> </strong>All<strong> </strong>that was needed was a rubber stamp from the bloc’s political leaders.

      In a reversal that stunned many EU insiders, the German government decided to push for a loophole that would allow the sale of combustion engine cars beyond the 2035 deadline — as long as they run on synthetic fuels.

      It’s an exception that could put the European Union’s green credentials at risk. The bloc is legally obliged to become <a href="https://cnn.com/2021/06/28/europe/eu-climate-change-law-net-zero-intl/index.html" target="_blank">carbon-neutral by 2050</a>. With cars and vans responsible for around 15% of its total greenhouse gas emissions, a phase-out of polluting vehicles is a key part of EU climate policy.

      The ban on internal combustion engine cars is one of the centerpieces of the European Union’s ambitious plan to cut its emissions to net zero by 2050 — which means removing from the air at least as much planet-heating pollution as the bloc emits. 
  </p>

      The law envisions a total ban on the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2035. The European Union argues that the deadline is necessary because the average car’s lifespan is around 15 years — so to get a fleet that produces no carbon pollution by 2050, sales of combustion engine cars must end by 2035.
