    <h1>Tell HN: Repurposing old iPads as home security cameras</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Last month I asked[0] what could be done with an old iPad; the responses led me to discover Alfred Home Security[0] and It&#39;s exactly what I was looking for. The winning feature being, you can repurpose any old iOS device as a camera.</p><p>I have since used the app with 2 old iPads, and an iPhone 7 Plus. Works better than I expect, really nicely done app.</p><p>The motion detection is spot-on. I&#39;ve been mostly using this to see what our new very shy kitten is up to since we&#39;ve only seen him twice in 5 weeks; basically he&#39;s impossible to find during the day and only comes out to play after we&#39;re asleep. The videos are super fun / cute, and it&#39;s nice to see he&#39;s having fun and in good health! [3]</p><p>Alfred Security also make a impressive, very inexpensive camera ($34 US, 1080P, night vision, 130 degree viewing angle and easy to mount). I just received 3 of the 4.</p><p>TLDR: last month I wanted to know what was the best use for old iPads /iOS devices, and I&#39;ve since discovered Alfred Home Security[1].</p><p>Supported Devices[2]:</p><p>Android: Android 4.4 or above (For a better experience, operating systems above Android 5 are highly recommended)</p><p>iOS: iOS 10 or above</p><p>Original post:</p><p>[0] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34165418" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34165418</a></p><p>[1] <a href="https://alfred.camera/" rel="nofollow">https://alfred.camera/</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://alfredcamera.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039755571-What-devices-and-systems-do-AlfredCamera-support-" rel="nofollow">https://alfredcamera.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039755...</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://alfred.camera/tv/9IHo74Mj5" rel="nofollow">https://alfred.camera/tv/9IHo74Mj5</a></p><p>* I have nothing to do, nor any affiliation with Alfred other than pay for and use their products.

* Updated with devices / link, and kitty video link (this is off an old iPad, not the Alfred Camera), and formatting.</p></div></div></div>
