<p>This week I returned from a business trip overseas for the past few weeks. This is why I haven&#39;t been able to blog this month until now. But now I am back, and my pre-ordered Mega 65 computer has arrived!</p><p><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjGGCm5rDRKy1VHasm7gR_45aU018dIZHHbCxJdS-jFyfbqQS2cmLBLxGCx2g19a7JIcV674isKGgMsVhqJsmypnlmePcv2J-RkhsVts9mCVrCyABWAKhJH75UJd90GUfe56mTBH0ERgniqurEjnVg1eUESQZLG4u00qgmF-iRzm2kWBWvcjav4yY/w640-h480/IMG_5367.jpeg" width="640"/></p><p>So what is a Mega 65? </p><p>Back in the 1980&#39;s, Commodore released the famous Commodore 64 (8 bit computer), and then followed it up with the Commodore 128, and Amiga (16 bit computers).</p><p>Commodore was quietly developing a successor to the Commodore 64 called the Commodore 65, combining improvements on the Commodore 64 (and backwardly compatible), along with some advancements learnt from the Amiga systems. You can read more about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_65" target="_blank">Commodore 65 on Wikipedia here</a>.</p><p>The idea (from my understanding) was to have a low-cost 8 bit system as an entry level machine, while leaving the 16 bit Amiga line of systems at more expensive entry price points.</p><p>Ultimately Commodore made a few Commodore 65 prototype systems internally, but the project was abandoned. Some of the developer units were sold off when Commodore went bankrupt in 1994. The machine to my knowledge was never commercially released. A lucky few have the rare developer versions of the C65 still, some working and some not.</p><p>These original C65 systems now sell for crazy money on Ebay, with a recent Commodore 65 system on Ebay in 2022 sold for over AUD$70,000!!</p><p>A group of enthusiasts formed a company called MEGA in 2015 to work on recreating the Commodore 65 system in FPGA based system, but using the same functionality, disk drive, cartridge port and connections to legacy peripherals, with the planned new case and keyboard. The machine is called the Mega 65, likely to avoid copyright issues with the trademarked Commodore name.</p><p>To say building this computer was a huge task is an understatement. I followed the development work blogs for many years, <a href="https://c65gs.blogspot.com/2019/06/getting-keyword-working-with-mega65r2.html" target="_blank">with a lot of the work being done by a fellow Adelaidean</a>. I was excited by the possibility of finally being able to get one of these systems to try out!</p><p>The system is not cheap at just under EUR800 excluding shipping, but considering the huge development effort, cost of making the case, custom keyboard and the board and system itself, I think the price is reasonable. Compared to the cost of the original C65 hardware today, it is a bargain!</p><p>Covid-19 has impacted component availability and the production of the custom box, and this pushed out the delivery dates. Finally in May 2022, the first batch of 400 pre-orders was sent out, and I was one of those first batch of orders!</p><p>You can view more about the Mega 65 and pre order on their website when the next batch is available <a href="https://mega65.org" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p>The box is amazing and a wonderful tribute to the C64 box:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYjVueu0thQme3JUKRkZYGDkJvBrsdoK0un5StPa4tosMAfFfn5JpLq0T5_DO9JbqcpCk7TTV2L8GU-fpKtiK-QFTePBAwLuubnC22X_7TdkKOq5fuUEHwIplOXVQfJ4VDKEDRM8xT40fszduSAyFHb7gOmjpu6-juyFjeFh5i64fCsryWbTazCmA/s4032/IMG_5361.jpeg"><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYjVueu0thQme3JUKRkZYGDkJvBrsdoK0un5StPa4tosMAfFfn5JpLq0T5_DO9JbqcpCk7TTV2L8GU-fpKtiK-QFTePBAwLuubnC22X_7TdkKOq5fuUEHwIplOXVQfJ4VDKEDRM8xT40fszduSAyFHb7gOmjpu6-juyFjeFh5i64fCsryWbTazCmA/w640-h480/IMG_5361.jpeg" width="640"/></a></p><p>I think the box is probably similar to how the Commodore 65 box might have looked like if it had been released.</p><p>Another view of the beautiful custom keyboard. The feel of the mechanical keyboard is great.</p><p>I&#39;ll look at the mouse more a little later.</p><p>For now though, I fired up some music from the intro disk to enjoy Dual SID audio output from the Mega 65.</p><p>I had to get to work on programming the obligatory &#34;Hello world&#34; program everyone typed into the C64 back in the day..still works.</p><p>I tried out Tetris for the Mega 65 on the Intro disk, which is fun of course:</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpwe73fO82Umr3gjeSdgipCj4esUUbCJBXf5CYi5MJiviWz74C3nXFCfqbTXUSVw-s9oQB3BaZwPNnXk2X7lxiFt8gnfoRLGKqA4IQJXzdfIgK9TnF82_Po4dzBf5oq18pTYmvsA1f4jHlJn7IKXNJYfkGFNHFUhIZDNINOHfXDk3uobp-FMzv4hY/s4032/IMG_5411.jpeg"><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpwe73fO82Umr3gjeSdgipCj4esUUbCJBXf5CYi5MJiviWz74C3nXFCfqbTXUSVw-s9oQB3BaZwPNnXk2X7lxiFt8gnfoRLGKqA4IQJXzdfIgK9TnF82_Po4dzBf5oq18pTYmvsA1f4jHlJn7IKXNJYfkGFNHFUhIZDNINOHfXDk3uobp-FMzv4hY/w640-h480/IMG_5411.jpeg" width="640"/></a></p><p>The resolution and fonts are much nicer looking on the Mega 65 compared to games on the C64.</p></div><p>If you hold down the ALT key when powering on the Mega 65 you get this early start menu, which allows you to prepare an SD Card for use with the Mega65. Yes, you do need to do this step - a standard MicroSD/SD Card needs a special partition format to work with the Mega 65, and this provides the remaining space as a partition available to read/write from your PC/Mac.</p><p>It then shows the two SD cards installed (the original internal one and the new one), and asks me which one I want to prepare. Make sure you choose the right one!</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif1yFiPTGwyWxzni99w9e-kgtx3amGGjsS-VLHTsEycBN-jSmUKKuFm_IiaB45N2DdY7scm1aG-XGLZ42t9GvgpnXUxPX5WOA5IVTFRADRtVkr7TG2iOcKxu4e2LwcYogxD0_CeqnSBHxSjqmuG0Aap55VnNpiuEMgofquesZus87obwhNiZ6Fdpo/s4032/IMG_5429.jpeg"><img data-original-height="4032" data-original-width="3024" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif1yFiPTGwyWxzni99w9e-kgtx3amGGjsS-VLHTsEycBN-jSmUKKuFm_IiaB45N2DdY7scm1aG-XGLZ42t9GvgpnXUxPX5WOA5IVTFRADRtVkr7TG2iOcKxu4e2LwcYogxD0_CeqnSBHxSjqmuG0Aap55VnNpiuEMgofquesZus87obwhNiZ6Fdpo/w480-h640/IMG_5429.jpeg" width="480"/></a></p><p>I realised that the Mega 65 only sees the 256GB MicroSD as a 128GB MicroSD, but unfortunately I don&#39;t have a spare 128GB MicroSD to use, so I am basically wasting the rest of the capacity. But, oh well, whatever. </p></div><p>I proceed with the fdisk and format prep for the MicroSD card - it makes you type out DELETE EVERYTHING in caps before it proceeds:</p><p>The process completed successfully and the new MicroSD is ready for use.</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdKn07K7n34u4EL1eoOu0V8Nj6rAvMo-UzAL0-dkUx_KE4D3DY2BIR-ysdMDReO-v1Yhj86-TtqoR8qmBV3OeP_-2eLlcHde0u4CSjsDgRq0K500rzSzKjr3FjXSYkZxdsk2MskrM4odZad2jZB1_GFYhxcfGSW5w1T3aBINJS5DOeHLYrRDB6oWg/s4032/IMG_5434.jpeg"><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdKn07K7n34u4EL1eoOu0V8Nj6rAvMo-UzAL0-dkUx_KE4D3DY2BIR-ysdMDReO-v1Yhj86-TtqoR8qmBV3OeP_-2eLlcHde0u4CSjsDgRq0K500rzSzKjr3FjXSYkZxdsk2MskrM4odZad2jZB1_GFYhxcfGSW5w1T3aBINJS5DOeHLYrRDB6oWg/w640-h480/IMG_5434.jpeg" width="640"/></a></p><p>With this step done, the Mega 65 will then use the external MicroSD to boot from on power on, and not the internal SD card. If the external slot is empty, it will boot from the internal SD Card.</p><p>The other missing files I mentioned earlier you can copy from the internal SD Card to your PC/Mac, and then transfer to the MicroSD card afterwards if you want them, as I did later as below.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgS1bn5PNXCBdkT3fGJSKrP7wTvRWq32hfv23QuA5EZkOlHOWyDs6TZm7bif3o2xUVqKxVP2QG7G5ee8W_7kVflGkquurV1TmN2noseGkkWccqrIDxQ97X2vkmAq0Ne56Etghh4LIdUk3BjRFQJj5oOo6J89ctsGLMFT1FDFXs5ir9e7cXyqeZr2vY/s3760/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-26%20at%203.00.25%20pm.png"><img data-original-height="1182" data-original-width="3760" height="202" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgS1bn5PNXCBdkT3fGJSKrP7wTvRWq32hfv23QuA5EZkOlHOWyDs6TZm7bif3o2xUVqKxVP2QG7G5ee8W_7kVflGkquurV1TmN2noseGkkWccqrIDxQ97X2vkmAq0Ne56Etghh4LIdUk3BjRFQJj5oOo6J89ctsGLMFT1FDFXs5ir9e7cXyqeZr2vY/w640-h202/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-26%20at%203.00.25%20pm.png" width="640"/></a></p><p>On the early start menu (pressing ALT on power on), the Mega 65 also allows you to change the Mega 65 computer settings:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4mTzUIjSjlwZVKdvoKkRxIs5K0wqYmlnKwueUwPK4c4pssurRI2cMUt1HDbQseqaT2y5BdSw9TdvPwI9jBtIYlbq5YBQ3zNgPhA0Vs4ikqJODUeMuiya8qvlTCFkip7IYa5DwtCTC8O21pZz3bnKn6CT6Y77fPPOs7z6qI4MyJX2K_X5LMoEDq8w/s4032/IMG_5435.jpeg"><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4mTzUIjSjlwZVKdvoKkRxIs5K0wqYmlnKwueUwPK4c4pssurRI2cMUt1HDbQseqaT2y5BdSw9TdvPwI9jBtIYlbq5YBQ3zNgPhA0Vs4ikqJODUeMuiya8qvlTCFkip7IYa5DwtCTC8O21pZz3bnKn6CT6Y77fPPOs7z6qI4MyJX2K_X5LMoEDq8w/w640-h480/IMG_5435.jpeg" width="640"/></a></p><p>You may remember we were asked about the video modes and CRT emulation on first power on, but you can change those settings at any time via this menu. You can use the F1/F3 keys to select the different menu options at the top, with arrow keys and enter to change settings on that screen. </p></div><p>If the 1351 mouse (or Amiga mouse) is connected you can use a mouse also, which is handy! Speaking of which, let&#39;s set the joystick ports to accept Amiga mouse, and to allow Amiga to 1351 functionality.</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUVE081AY_736qxL81CSLe3_iWwPsJcuESdranezlAtwiyIG4gVT5aSFAdlC94BDsEs94lhd4-B9XUQ6kc6R6y8phzOELZGfoDSkatn4JUZrDNILKfKx01GquTn1VqpWKvjbh2fRdAhjblq_AZ_uxOIMjOWNBWzk8mGgHAqoGeoBuOYYIn_m8NlEo/s4032/IMG_5436.jpeg"><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUVE081AY_736qxL81CSLe3_iWwPsJcuESdranezlAtwiyIG4gVT5aSFAdlC94BDsEs94lhd4-B9XUQ6kc6R6y8phzOELZGfoDSkatn4JUZrDNILKfKx01GquTn1VqpWKvjbh2fRdAhjblq_AZ_uxOIMjOWNBWzk8mGgHAqoGeoBuOYYIn_m8NlEo/w640-h480/IMG_5436.jpeg" width="640"/></a></p><p>I set it on both ports, and after saving this, I could use the Amiga mouse I previously had connected.</p></div><p>Under Audio settings you can choose the output, which SID chip generation to use (older bread bin SID chip or newer C64C SID chip), and whether to amplify the audio if you find it too quiet (I didn&#39;t).</p><p>I could then see the Turrican demo for the Mega 65, which (although incomplete and very much just a demo) is very impressive, and reminds me a lot of the Amiga version in terms of the graphics quality. </p><p>The Mega 65 case is held together with three philips head screws on the bottom of the case. Once removed, the internals of the Mega 65 are revealed!</p><p>Below is a close up of the board, showing the internal SD card. I took the opportunity to remove the SD Card (which is 16GB) and backed it up on my PC for safe keeping.</p><p>I installed the CR1220 battery into the Real time clock compartment on the main board:</p><p>I note that is some text etched into the casing for the people who donated to get the custom case made, and the Mega 65 team. Thanks to all for helping to create this wonderful computer!</p><p><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFoFYnQpdQpp0wgUDYwrmYsDqr3aaTlqeodsZWgrQZc-SpyKERKL-kVwpr72CO2E74SRk5KInzuGw6hezqIeJf9rtZAommYEIYJr8XHO4IOuhj6xMx-exbH5VmUJR14hsNE4qARpzddlQb8T34kxpKwhdRL7ClSi7Vefp8q6M5rF1A7HYhAytfDmc/w640-h480/IMG_5468.jpeg" width="640"/></p><p>I remember trying to read the blurry text on the C64 version back in the day, and using a joystick to navigate...so painful.</p><p>You can apparently run .d64 files using the separate C64 core on the Mega 65, but I have not tried this yet.</p><p><a href="https://dansanderson.com/mega65/welcome/using-disks.html" target="_blank">There are ways</a> to transfer C64 floppy disk data from .D64 files to .D81 files on your PC/Mac that can then be read on the Mega 65 virtual drives. Hopefully this is addressed in the future.</p><p>I then looked through a very helpful online tutorial guide to get started with the Mega 65, and a special shout out to Dan Sanderson for a very helpful <a href="https://dansanderson.com/mega65/welcome/index.html" target="_blank">Mega 65 getting started website.</a> I have been using it a lot as I learn about the Mega 65.</p><p>Speaking of floppy disks, let&#39;s look at using real floppy disks and drives rather than just the virtual ones (as convenient as they are).</p><p>I grabbed a 880k 3.5&#34; Amiga floppy disk and 1.44MB PC formatted floppy disk to try out. Both work, but remember that the HD floppy disks need the hole on the left side covered by a non-transparent tape so that the drive doesn&#39;t detect it as HD, as they are not supported as the Mega 65 is delivered (yes I know there is beta support that can be enabled).</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgwwPdcZquF25ZaW1LpPHjekzljWm4gm2Cp2cmYnlYbUzNWNulygzsEjojN7EjgVKpoGE-ZLG5tgNKR0NQD3tdRqAZW0PoPDdV5bS6JuKl2-P2BnYkrWaET90Ybdp9nenrwP6sIc_Tl8Tpzl5svuzIlnfKaItlwKGXlEvlL0ns-0_NwnIez6kuNYJU/s4032/IMG_5485.jpeg"><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgwwPdcZquF25ZaW1LpPHjekzljWm4gm2Cp2cmYnlYbUzNWNulygzsEjojN7EjgVKpoGE-ZLG5tgNKR0NQD3tdRqAZW0PoPDdV5bS6JuKl2-P2BnYkrWaET90Ybdp9nenrwP6sIc_Tl8Tpzl5svuzIlnfKaItlwKGXlEvlL0ns-0_NwnIez6kuNYJU/w640-h480/IMG_5485.jpeg" width="640"/></a></p><p>In order to use the real internal 3.5 floppy disk drive, we need to tell the Mega 65 to use it instead of the virtual floppy drive for the internal drive. Using the Freeze menu (Restore key), we can associate the Internal 3.5&#34; to the Internal drive:</p></div><p><b><span face="&#34;Helvetica Neue&#34;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">OPEN 1,8,15, “N:NAME,1A”:CLOSE 1</span> </b></p><p>On the Mega 65 though, the command is much simpler for formatting disks: </p><p><b>HEADER &#34;DISKNAME&#34;,I01</b></p><p>I then entered a short basic program, and saved it to the new 3.5&#34; disk I just formatted, as below.</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMLiFuA2CcgwV6zn7qAR0AAAyM-XIcOvBzjt7bV6WpZcMsiSkIwp0RQgTKWwGQ6AdlfvDPw_1tihBcroC5Ls_e5qzGl8DCbbu6eUea5fuoS2Aqrddvf2ud6oMWQChVJOySh8SIDvfidZOwMrcRSIG6_rAOAkZKUnf8ly7P4w74goXYkXHEQO43D-4/s4032/IMG_5495.jpeg"><img data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMLiFuA2CcgwV6zn7qAR0AAAyM-XIcOvBzjt7bV6WpZcMsiSkIwp0RQgTKWwGQ6AdlfvDPw_1tihBcroC5Ls_e5qzGl8DCbbu6eUea5fuoS2Aqrddvf2ud6oMWQChVJOySh8SIDvfidZOwMrcRSIG6_rAOAkZKUnf8ly7P4w74goXYkXHEQO43D-4/w640-h480/IMG_5495.jpeg" width="640"/></a></p><p>As you can see above, when I list the contents of the real floppy disk, it now shows the saved program.
