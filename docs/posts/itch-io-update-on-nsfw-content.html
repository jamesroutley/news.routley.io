    <h1>Itch.io: Update on NSFW Content</h1>

We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change.</p>
<p>Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io. Due to a game titled <em>No Mercy</em>, which was temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow noopener" referrerpolicy="origin">Collective Shout</a> launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms.</p>
<p>Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform. To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.</p>
<p>This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change.</p>
<p>We are currently conducting a comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors. Pages will remain deindexed as we complete our review. Once this review is complete, we will introduce new compliance measures. For NSFW pages, this will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account.</p>
<p>Part of this review will see some pages being permanently removed from itch.io. Affected accounts will be notified via their account’s email address from our support address. You can reply to that email if you have any follow up questions.</p>
<p>We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period. I’m sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves. We will post a follow up on our blog if the situation changes.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
