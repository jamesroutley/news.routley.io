    <p><strong>Monday, December 19, 2022</strong></p>

    <p>There&#39;s a tradition at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> of writing a Return Statement after your batch.
I&#39;m not sure of the origin of the terminology, but it seems like it&#39;s a pun on the <code>return</code> statement in programming languages.
It&#39;s a great tradition, and it gives me a good motivator to reflect on my batch and share those reflections.</p>
<p>This is going to be a ride, so buckle up.
First I&#39;ll go through what was life-changing and formative about this period for me.
This is going to be <strong>very personal</strong> and not so much about programming at first.
Then I&#39;ll go through what I worked on during RC and what the batch was like.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned in a few of my previous posts about RC that it&#39;s been a formative, life-changing experience for me.
There&#39;s a lot to unpack there.
And sorry if you came here expecting mostly programming things: a lot of this section is wholly unrelated to programming!</p>
<p>I came into RC expecting it to be an excellent, fun time where I would be restored and learn to love programming again, and to improve as a programmer.
These things did happen!
But there were also some unexpected things that happened.</p>
<p>The main theme of the unexpected things is <strong>self-discovery</strong>.
I guess in retrospect it&#39;s not surprising that in a warm, welcoming community where you&#39;re self-directed, a lot of self-discovery can and will happen.
But I didn&#39;t anticipate it, and I&#39;m so glad I got to experience it!</p>
<p>The most major self-discovery was that <strong>I want to use they/them pronouns</strong> (but he/him pronouns are fine)<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
I haven&#39;t been in many spaces before where the cultural norm is to give your pronouns.
I&#39;ve been in spaces before where you <em>can</em><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, but in a space where it was a norm, suddenly I had a box staring me in the face and I felt <em>very</em> uncomfortable writing &#34;he/him&#34; because that felt wrong in some way I can&#39;t capture in words.</p>
<p>I started out the batch with he/they pronouns, since people used he pronouns for me mostly so it felt like the default safe choice?
My identity was very much rooted in what <em>other people</em> saw, and I knew things felt a little off, but I went with it.
As people used they/them and he/him for me, I got to see what felt right.
Partway through my batch, I flipped it to they/he to signal my preference, and now I&#39;m mostly using they/them pronouns when there&#39;s a box I can put them in.</p>
<p>This has been an interesting experience of accepting my identity and my lack of affinity for the masculine gender.
In particular, it has made it a lot easier to accept some of my preferences and <em>be myself</em>.
I think at work, I&#39;d like to set a norm of providing pronouns, because it&#39;s important to make sure everyone has space to express who they are.</p>
<p>Another major self discovery was that <strong>I am a writer</strong><sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.
I&#39;ve always enjoyed writing, and I think I&#39;m halfway decent at it, but I would think &#34;pssshhh I&#39;m not really a <em>writer</em>.&#34;
No, that self-doubt and lack of confidence has stopped.</p>
<p>You know why I know I&#39;m a writer?
Because I <em>love writing</em> and do it just to do it.
And I&#39;ve been doing it quite a lot.
I&#39;m up to over 33,000 words written on my blog this year, and I&#39;m going to keep up the momentum and keep writing.
Writing has been an incredibly important part of my life for a while (it&#39;s how I think, it&#39;s how I communicate best, and it&#39;s a big part of my success as a staff engineer), and I&#39;m recognizing that it&#39;s part of my identity.</p>
<p>Another unexpected self-discovery was that <strong>in the right environment, I <em>gain</em> energy from social interactions</strong>.
I&#39;ve long identified as an introvert and been generally drained by social things and interpersonal reactions.
In a work context, conversations with people and pair programming were <em>very</em> draining.
It turns out that in the right environment and with the right mindset, these things are incredibly energizing to me.
Nearly every interaction I had with a Recurser left me more excited and more energized.
I quipped in the first week that <strong>I was an introvert getting extrovert energy</strong>, and I think that captures it well.</p>
<p>The big thing that contributed to this shift was the environment and the culture.
The environment was one where we all had a shared purpose and we all <em>chose</em> to be here, we were all excited to be here.
Every single person was nice (not a surprise given the criteria for admission) and the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules">social rules</a> at RC set a nice baseline for behavior.
It certainly changed the way I think about my interactions and changed my assumption that interactions with people necessarily drain my energy.</p>
<p>Okay, that&#39;s probably it for the <em>really</em> squishy personal stuff.
Now onto some of the <strong>more programming-related stuff</strong>.
I mean, it&#39;s still squishy personal stuff.</p>
<p>One of the things I did during RC was <strong>learn in the open</strong>.
I wrote a lot on my blog, and I posted check-ins every day where I detailed what I had done, what I was working on and thinking about, and the challenges I was running into.
This was very new for me.
In the past, I&#39;ve always waited to talk about details of things until I&#39;m sure that they&#39;re &#34;ready.&#34;
This was an element of being <strong>afraid to fail or be wrong</strong>, and some amount of judgment that may come along with that.
In contrast, during RC, I learned to put myself out there and I got to experience how helpful it wasâ€”both to me and to other people.
I&#39;m going to <strong>keep doing this</strong> as much as I can.</p>
<p>Related, I <strong>learned how to pair program more effectively</strong>.
More fundamentally, I learned what my hangups with it were.
In my first week, we did some pairing exercises, and I noticed that I would freeze up during pairing.
After getting off the pairing call, I&#39;d often have this experience of immediately realizing what was blocking us, or look up one thing and figure it out.
But during a pairing call?
No chance.</p>
<p>With a lot of introspection and advice from batchmates and the facilitators (shoutout to James Porter in particular!), I was able to figure out what was blocking me from making the most of pairing:
It felt <em>performative</em> to me.
I think this comes from many years of being an honors student or star employee and being <em>expected</em> to be right and have the answers, and I internalized that.
But that&#39;s not helpful, and none of us know all the answers.
I learned how to be vulnerable and how to take a beat to think, to read the docs, to take a break.
That shifted my relationship with pairing.
It&#39;s still a <em>somewhat</em> draining activity, but it&#39;s going to be a regular part of my work going forward.
I love it.</p>
<p>I also <strong>learned what I want to do with my time and my life</strong>.
I mentioned above that I&#39;m a writer.
I used to say I want to start a startup or other business.
It felt like the thing I should do in order to &#34;control my destiny&#34; and be able to choose what I work on, to an extent<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>.
No, I want to keep doing what I did at RC: <strong>learning, experimenting with technology, and writing about it</strong>.
I&#39;m fortunate to have a job where I have a <em>lot</em> of flexibility (our leadership is pretty forward-thinking) so I have reasonable hours and four-day workweeks.
I&#39;m going to make the most of my time and lean into this as much as I can on my Fridays, mornings, and evenings.</p>
<p>Related, I learned how to <strong>engage with projects consistently</strong> and <strong>let go of them when I&#39;m done with them</strong>.
I don&#39;t mean when they&#39;re done.
I used to feel this need to ship projects, to completely finish them (as if a thing is ever finished!).
Not anymore!
Now when I&#39;ve gotten out of a project what I wanted to learn, and maybe written about it, then it&#39;s done and I can let go and move on.
I love you, projects, and I have to move on to another one now!
It&#39;s very liberating, and it lets me learn about so many different things.</p>
<p>Similarly, RC put into focus <em>how</em> I spend my time, so I learned to focus on the things I <em>really want to do</em> and engage with those projects consistently, not with the ones that aren&#39;t how I want to spend my time.
I&#39;ve cut out any exploration of devops things in my personal time because while it&#39;s useful, it&#39;s not what I want to spend my time on!
And I&#39;ve leaned into learning about programming language interpreters right now, since they&#39;re so interesting and fun.</p>
<p>Another one which I&#39;ve <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/my-evolution-open-source-licenses/">written about before</a>, but is worth mentioning again, is my <strong>evolution of thinking on open-source</strong>.
Letting go of shipping things as potentially-commercial projects meant I could really lean into copyleft licenses.
It&#39;s really freeing to think about starting projects and realize that I can make them, license them under a copyleft license, and rest easy knowing that if the code is useful and someone wants to use it, they can.
It&#39;s a big mindset shift to also chain myself to the mast of open-source and not <em>allow</em> myself to make a proprietary version of my code (once there are any other contributors).</p>
<p>I think that&#39;s the major formative and life-changing things from my batch.
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting something, though.
So <em>much</em> happened in the batch.</p>
<p>Which naturally leads into...</p>

<p>My time was generally split into four buckets: working on my projects, talking to individuals, working with groups, and going to events.</p>
<p>A typical day would generally start at 8am with my check-in call.
Then I&#39;d probably have a coffee chat, or take our toddler to preschool.
By 9:30am, I&#39;d be at my desk and in the swing of things, so I&#39;d spend the morning making pretty good progress on my project or pairing with someone on it or theirs.
Then I&#39;d take lunch, sometimes over a meaty subject like <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/index.html">proving theorems in Coq</a>.
In the afternoon, there were often more groups, and I&#39;d have some coffee chats or pairing sessions and work on my projects.
I wrapped up my days at 5pm.
I&#39;d usually come back and write my check-ins around 7:30pm, after our kids were in bed.</p>
<p>But days were variable!
I bounced to so many different things, and took opportunities to pair or attend events as they arose, so I didn&#39;t really stick to a firm schedule.
I was also kind to myself and listened to my brain.
If I wasn&#39;t into something that day, I&#39;d work on something else.</p>
<p>So, here&#39;s the laundry list of things I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ntietz/anode-kv">key-value store</a> which can beat Redis&#39;s performance multi-core and comes close on single-core.</li>
<li>Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ntietz/patzer">chess engine</a> that can beat me if I&#39;m playing fast but not if I try hard.</li>
<li>Explored <a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui">immediate-mode GUIs</a> for my chess engine and learned that oh, no, I really <em>do</em> love the web, thank you very much.</li>
<li>Wrote a check-in post every day of batch that wasn&#39;t a holiday, and some that were. This was about 60 daily check-ins.</li>
<li>Attended UTC-friendly check-ins every day at 8am Eastern. These were a <em>cornerstone</em> of my RC experience, because I got to have a call with the same folks (spread out all over the world!) every day, and it was such a good crew. I love you folks!</li>
<li>Had about one coffee chat per day (sometimes they&#39;d bunch up), so about 60 coffee chats across the batch! This was a wonderful way to get to know folks, share common interests, and hear about different life experiences.</li>
<li>Read through most of <a href="http://www.redbook.io/">the Red Book</a> and read a bunch of the papers from it, presenting them in the group.</li>
<li>Wrote 25 blog posts, totalling over 32,000 words, during my batch. I got in the rhythm of writing and it feels profoundly good and correct.</li>
<li>Pair programmed a lot, probably three times per week on average. I started out around once every day, but then tapered off near the end, so I think it rounded out to about this. I really loved the pairing experiences at RC, and I can&#39;t wait to keep doing it going forward!</li>
<li>Worked through five chapters of <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/index.html">Logical Foundations</a> with a few other brave souls. They&#39;ve outlasted me. I threw in the towel, but had a <em>ton</em> of fun in the chapters we did work through. (We also tried learning <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean</a> first. There&#39;s a reason we switched to Coq.)</li>
<li>Wrote a (portion of) a <a href="https://sr.ht/%7Entietz/isabella-db/">chess database</a>, which I&#39;m still working on and is slow going! This project has been <em>very</em> fruitful and I&#39;ve learned so much about systems programming, Rust, and databases.</li>
<li>Worked through the first project in <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>. The second one is still in progress.</li>
<li>Learned a little bit of category theory, then let go of that pursuit because I was stretching myself too thin.</li>
<li>Went to a few full-stack web development meetings, but let go of that mostly during batch since I wanted to focus on new-to-me things instead.</li>
<li>Learned about homelab things with my fellow homelab enthusiasts!</li>
<li>Bought and set up a very overkill homelab server, which then turned out to be <em>not at all</em> overkill for the chess database project.</li>
<li>Did a few leetcode problems with people as a fun way to program together.</li>
<li>Did the first few Advent of Code problems, and abandoned it when my batch ended as I was going to be short of time since I was going back to work.</li>
<li>Attended the weekly Rust meeting! It was super fun to have a group of fellow Rustaceans to discuss things with, and it was a good way to measure my progress on getting comfortable with Rust. At the beginning, a lot of the discussion went over my head. By the end, I was pretty comfortable keeping up.</li>
<li>Did the weekly reflections meeting every week and helped keep it running after the facilitator for the first half had his Never Graduation.</li>
<li>Attended weekly presentations, and presented a few times on my projects!</li>
<li>Switched my primary git forge to <a href="https://sr.ht/%7Entietz/">SourceHut</a> instead of GitHub.</li>
<li>Learned some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_(programming_language)">Idris</a> and decided it&#39;s not for me right now.</li>
<li>Rediscovered the joy that is computers and writing code.</li>
</ul>
<p>RC was pretty intense for me, in a delightful kind of way.
Now it&#39;s time to find a sustainable balance.</p>

<p>Well, what&#39;s next for me is that I&#39;ve gone back to my day job, and I&#39;m loving it.
We&#39;ve got a great team and a great culture.
And I&#39;m continuing on with Recurse Center.
After your batch, you Never Graduate, and you stay a part of the community.
I wrote most of this post while hanging out in a writing focus group with people from Recurse Center, and I&#39;m so thankful for the community and being able to remain a part of it.</p>
<p>As for you:
I&#39;m not sure, but if you think Recurse Center sounds appealing, you should <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=c9a1a9e2e7a2ffefd4af20020b4af1e6">apply</a>.
It&#39;s an amazing community of wonderful people, and it has been life-changing for me.
It isn&#39;t <em>life-changing</em> for everyone (that would be quite a high bar!), but the experience is pretty excellent all around, and it&#39;s a great place to become a better programmer regardless of how much or how little experience you have.</p>
<p>If you join Recurse Center, welcome.
I&#39;ll see you on Zulip.</p>
<p>And if not, no worries!
Always feel free to <a href="mailto:me@ntietz.com">reach out</a> to me if you want to chat, whether that&#39;s Recurse Center or Rust or espresso or anything else!</p>
