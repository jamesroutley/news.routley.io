          Notion&#39;s, Slack&#39;s, and Jira&#39;s WYSIWYG text editors behave differently
          when the cursor is at the end of an inline code block. A situation
          like:
        </p>
        <pre><code>THIS IS A CODE BLOCK and this is not
                   ^
                   (cursor is after this character)
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Notion&#39;s behaviour here is the most confusing. Sometimes, typed text
          will appear inside the code block. Sometimes, it&#39;ll appear outside.
          It&#39;s unclear to me what triggers the switch between these two
          behaviours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slack is consistent, but consistently hard to use. A cursor at the end
          of an inline code block is always considered to be inside the code
          block. If you want to type after the code block, you must move your
          cursor after the character just after the end of the block. This
          means, for example, that you can&#39;t easily take the text &#34;<code>foo</code>
          bar&#34; and edit it to &#34;<code>foo</code>&#39;s bar&#34;. To do so, you&#39;d need to
          move your cursor after the space that comes before &#34;bar&#34;, type &#34;&#39;s &#34;,
          then remove the space before the apostrophe.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, Jira defines two possible cursor positions, one inside
          and one outside the inline code block. You can move back and forth
          between the two positions using the left and right arrow keys. And you
          can distinguish between the two cursor positions visually. I like this
          behaviour best because it&#39;s always clear where typed text will appear,
          but you still have flexibility to type inside our outside the code
          block.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a programmer, I spend a small but meaningful amount of time editing
          inline code blocks in WYSIWYG editors. Doing this in Notion and Slack
          frustrates me. But whenever I do it in Jira, I&#39;m glad someone at
          Atlassian thought through this experience.
