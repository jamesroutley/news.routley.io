    <h1>Study: Consumers Actively Turned Off by AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>&#34;When AI is mentioned, it tends to lower emotional trust, which in turn decreases purchase intentions.&#34;</h2><h2>Trough Luck</h2><p>Researchers have found that including the words &#34;artificial intelligence&#34; in product marketing is a major turn-off for consumers, suggesting a growing backlash and disillusionment with the tech — and that startups trying to cram &#34;AI&#34; into their product are actually making a grave error.</p><p>As detailed in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Hospitality Marketing &amp; Management</em>, researchers presented 1,000 respondents with questions and descriptions of products. Surprisingly — or <a href="https://futurism.com/google-ai-ad-sad">perhaps not</a>, depending on <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-adding-work-study">your perspective</a> — they found that products described as using AI were consistently less popular.</p><p>&#34;When AI is mentioned, it tends to lower emotional trust, which in turn decreases purchase intentions,&#34; said lead author and Washington State University clinical assistant profess of marketing Mesut Cicek in a <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2024/07/30/using-the-term-artificial-intelligence-in-product-descriptions-reduces-purchase-intentions/">statement</a>. &#34;We found emotional trust plays a critical role in how consumers perceive AI-powered products.&#34;</p><h2>Strong Pass</h2><p>In an experiment, the researchers found that a group of participants were far less likely to purchase a smart television when its description included the words &#34;artificial intelligence.&#34; A separate group was far <em>more</em> likely to buy it when the words were omitted from an otherwise identical description.</p><p>For &#34;high-risk&#34; purchases such as expensive electronics or medical devices, the effect was even more pronounced, with Cicek suggesting that consumers are more wary of monetary loss or danger to physical safety.</p><p>&#34;We tested the effect across eight different product and service categories, and the results were all the same: it’s a disadvantage to include those kinds of terms in the product descriptions,&#34; Cicek said.</p><p>That kind of growing mistrust is symptomatic of a much larger trend. Earlier this year, technology research and consulting firm Gartner found that the hype surrounding generative AI had passed the &#34;peak of inflated expectations,&#34; which is marked by &#34;overenthusiasm and unrealistic projections.&#34;</p><p>Companies are feverishly trying to stuff what they claim to be AI into every product, from <a href="https://futurism.com/bumble-founder-future-ai-dating-other-ais">dating apps</a> to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-bot-disabled-dpd">automated car salesmen</a> — despite <a href="https://futurism.com/meta-ai-trump-wasnt-shot">glaring shortcomings</a> that have yet to be solved and <a href="https://futurism.com/investors-concerned-ai-making-money">mounting, astronomical costs</a>.</p><p>And consumers are getting tired of their desperate attempts to capitalize on all the hype.</p><p>&#34;Marketers should carefully consider how they present AI in their product descriptions or develop strategies to increase emotional trust,&#34; said Cicek. &#34;Emphasizing AI may not always be beneficial, particularly for high-risk products. Focus on describing the features or benefits and avoid the AI buzzwords.&#34;</p><p><strong>More on AI:</strong> <em><a href="https://futurism.com/meta-ai-trump-wasnt-shot">Meta&#39;s AI Says Trump Wasn&#39;t Shot</a></em></p></div></div>
