    <h1>Why write?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As a reaction to the <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2023/writing/">previous article</a>
on <em>how</em> to write a scientific paper, I got some reactions from friends
and colleagues, the underlying message being that they would rather like
to understand <em>why</em> writing can be important. There is indeed a tendency
to see academic writing as a tedious task that one should try to get
done as quickly as possible lest it causes unbearable pain,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> or,
even worse, that writing in general is a <em>talent</em> that you have to be
born with.</p>
<p>That is of course rubbish. Writing is a cultural technique and a skill,
and like any skill, it becomes better by <em>practising</em> it. To accomplish
that, I want to provide three different<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> answers as to why writing
can be useful. Pick yours and have fun!</p>
<p>(Notice that I will be focusing mostly on academic writing, but the with
some minor changes, I think the same answers can also apply to other
types of writing; more about that at the end of the article.)</p>

<p>The first answer to ‘Why Write?’ is that writing is a wonderful way to
sort out your thoughts in a <em>concise</em> manner. Virtually all researchers
enjoy <em>talking</em> about their research, and I understand why: having an
interlocutor that prompts you about specific details is a marvellous way
to outline your own research!</p>
<p><em>Writing</em>, by contrast, forces you to assume a much more concise
perspective: most venues have a limit on the number of words or pages
you are allowed to use, and I argue that <strong>these restrictions are
fundamentally a good thing because they force you to be more creative
with your explanations and miserly with the number of words that you use</strong>.</p>
<p>But even if you have no such restrictions, putting things into writing
is a marvellous way to sort out your thoughts about the work and ‘clear
your internal cache,’ as it were. I posit that while writing down your
ideas, you will experience at least one of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will get ideas about how to improve your research.</li>
<li>You will improve your understanding of the context of your research,
i.e. the ‘bigger picture.’</li>
<li>You will find it hard to express certain aspects of your method,
forcing you to question your understanding of certain parts of the
materials.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last part is of particular relevance: I find it easy to trick myself
into believing that I understand certain techniques or methods, but only
by actually writing them up do I have a way to see if I internalised the
knowledge well enough to actually <em>generate</em> something with it.</p>

<p>Most academic research will not be widely read, unfortunately. At the
larger machine learning conferences, your paper, when accepted, will be
one of thousands (!) of other papers. Unless you are extremely lucky,
chances are that few people will interact with your research. Thus, my
second answer to ‘Why Write?’ is that <em>any</em> investments into
a well-written abstract and a well-written paper can pay off by enticing
readers from other disciplines, which often leads to unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, my work on <a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/research/EuroVis2015.pdf">dimensionality reduction algorithms and their
evaluation</a>
languished in my previous research community, but it was picked up by
different communities—and I even received some offers for
collaborations because people liked the way I tried to motivate certain
aspect (I am a strong believer in building <strong>the intuition</strong> for
methods).</p>
<p>If you polish your writing and keep on doing it, you will increase the
probability of other people interacting with your work. This is all the
more true for ‘outreach’ writing, i.e. writing that targets a more
general audience. My blog posts on <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/manifold/">manifolds</a>
was read by more people than most of my papers—and can actually
inspire others to engage more with your research field. What’s not to
love?</p>

<p>The last answer to ‘Why Write?’ can be seen as somewhat utilitarian, so
bear with me. I believe that writing an academic paper should always
involve an underlying narrative. Just like a play has its character and
a story, so should any good research paper. By that I do not mean that
you invent things or be imprecise in your speech, on the contrary!
A paper’s underlying narrative needs to be based on the facts of your
discoveries.</p>
<p>If you study outstanding academic papers, such as Shannon’s <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf">A Mathematical Theory of Communication</a>,
you will find that they all have a narrative writing style. Your writing
will benefit if you start adding your own narratives into a paper: you
start by explaining the problem—introducing your characters—and why
it is important. Then you show how your method works—how your
characters overcome obstacles—and what properties (and
limitations) it has. I used to react with immediate disdain for people
that said that ‘The paper needs to tell a story,’ because I always
understood this as an exercise in creative make-believe. I have since
changed my mind and accepted the meaning behind the idea of a story:
a story is <em>compelling</em> and makes it easier for others to understand
your research. Even great ideas can flounder if no one recognises them
as such.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>On top of that: new research is being published every day at
ever-increasing rates. Try to captivate your readers if you want to
stand out!</p>

<p>You now have some seen some answers to ‘Why Write?’ but you may be
wondering how to actually get better at it.  The answer is simple: read
and write more. Read the best papers you can find, either from your own
field, or from others,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and study their writing style. Be bold in
emulating whatever you like—it is a matter of personal taste
anyway—and be prepared to rewrite your own papers multiple times. One
day, you will be deep in the zone, making it look easy. Trust me on
that.</p>
<p>(By the way, all <strong>improvements should be measured relative to where you
started from</strong>. When I read my first papers and compare them to my
recent ones, I see definite improvements. That is all that matters in
the end.)</p>

<p>Writing is a marvellous cultural tool; writing <em>well</em> feels like
a superpower because clear communicators will always be relevant, in
particular as we are moving towards new hybrid teams, both inside and
outside of academia.</p>
<p>Learn to use that superpower wisely and responsibly, until next time!</p>
