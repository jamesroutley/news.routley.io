<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>Deployed <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/slow-art-online">Slow Art Online</a></li>



<li>Watched <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/7/">CS50P Week 7 shorts</a></li>



<li>Worked on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/7/">CS50P Problem Set 7</a></li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Slow Art Online is now <a href="https://slowartonline.com/">live</a>! This was the first time I deployed a Flask app to production. I decided to go with DigitalOcean’s App Platform and used <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-flask-app-using-gunicorn-to-app-platform">this tutorial</a>. The deployment failed in my first attempts, but it worked after I installed Gunicorn and updated the port in my app code. I’m still kind of hazy on these things, and I’d like to understand deployment and DevOps better.</li>



<li>There are still some improvements I want to make to the site, but deploying it was a fun milestone and will also simplify cross-browser and cross-device testing.</li>
</ul>
