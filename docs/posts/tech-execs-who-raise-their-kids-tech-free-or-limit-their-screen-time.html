Pioneers<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/screen-time-limits-bill-gates-steve-jobs-red-flag-2017-10" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel=""> like Steve Jobs</a> have said they had strict boundaries on technology when raising their kids, and they&#39;ve cautioned parents about letting children spend too much time in front of a screen. </p><p>Other CEOs, like Google&#39;s Sundar Pichai, impose strict limits on their children&#39;s use of technology at home.</p>

The kids did not seem addicted at all to devices.&#34;</p><p>In addition to having tech-free family dinners, apparently the Jobs children hadn&#39;t even tried out the iPad after it hit shelves in 2010.</p><p>&#34;They haven&#39;t used it,&#34; Bilton recalled Jobs saying. &#34;We limit how much technology our kids use at home.&#34;</p>

                                      <p>Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and star of &#34;Shark Tank,&#34; initially set up a rewards system for his kids to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-cuban-limits-kids-screen-time-2017-5" rel="" data-analytics-module="body_link">earn screen time</a>. For every hour of reading, the Cuban kids would get two hours of Netflix. His son would often also exchange math problems for Minecraft time.  </p><p>But once his kids figured out ways to get around the rules — like borrowing a friend&#39;s Netflix password — Cuban wised up. He installed special routers that can detect what apps his kids are using in addition to giving him the option to turn off activity. </p><p>&#34;That&#39;s the downside of having a geeky dad, you know. I can figure all this stuff out,&#34; Cuban said on the <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/mark-cuban-on-his-stormy-relationship-with-donald-trump-and-if-hell-ever-run-for-president-b6aadff31af5" rel=" nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">Thrive Global Podcast in 2017</a>. </p>
