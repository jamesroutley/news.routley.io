    <h1>Starting, or Finishing?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>2025 has been my best year yet for journaling. I made a &#34;one word rule&#34; for myself: every day I would write at least one word in my journal.</p>
<p>This rule works for several reasons, but the most important for me is that it is so easy to succeed at. All I need to do is write that one word. Of course, I usually end up with more, but that isn&#39;t the point. Writing a good entry is easy once I&#39;m going. So I focus on the place where I&#39;m likely to fail: starting.</p>
<hr/>
<p>For a while, I thought starting was also my challenge with blogging. I have plenty of ideas, many of which I can write in one sitting. Shouldn&#39;t I focus on directly tackling those posts?</p>
<p>The difference is that it&#39;s harder to finish a blog post than to start one. While I&#39;m happy with anything I write in my journal, I have higher bar for published essays. It&#39;s good to make it easy to start writing a post, but that won&#39;t remove the friction of feeling stuck partway through. </p>
<p>If I want to blog consistently, I need to find ways to finish.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<hr/>
<p>The two problems &#34;starting&#34; and &#34;finishing&#34; aren&#39;t completely opposed, of course. You can have both problems at once. (I&#39;ve rarely composed music this year, and even more rarely finished it).</p>
<p>To me, the problems even feel similar: I have some goal I want to accomplish, but I systematically don&#39;t work on achieving it. I get frustrated with myself, and I try to stress myself into making progress. </p>
<p>Yet as challenges, they ask for different approaches. Starting well means removing barriers at the beginning, lowering standards but not results. Finishing reliably requires asking what I really want, and accepting that there will be hard parts in the process.</p>
<p>Both require identifying where the difficulties are.</p>
