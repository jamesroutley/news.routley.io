<div id="post-64076">
	<p>Today, <a href="#"></a><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqv8veb5i6.fsf@gitster.g/">the Git project released new versions</a> which address a pair of security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>GitHub is unaffected by these vulnerabilities<sup id="fnref-64076-1"><a href="#fn-64076-1" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup>. However, you should be aware of them and upgrade your local installation of Git, especially if you are using Git for Windows, or you use Git on a multi-user machine.</p>
<h2>CVE-2022-24765</h2>
<p>This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines where a malicious actor could create a <code>.git</code> directory in a shared location above a victim’s current working directory. On Windows, for example, an attacker could create <code>C:\.git\config</code>, which would cause all <code>git</code> invocations that occur outside of a repository to read its configured values.</p>
<p>Since some configuration variables (such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config/2.35.2#Documentation/git-config.txt-corefsmonitor"><code>core.fsmonitor</code></a>) cause Git to execute arbitrary commands, this can lead to arbitrary command</p>
<p>The most effective way to protect against this vulnerability is to upgrade to <a href="#">Git v2.35.2</a>. This version changes Git’s behavior when looking for a top-level <code>.git</code> directory to stop when its directory traversal changes ownership from the current user. (If you wish to make an exception to this behavior, you can use the new multi-valued <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config/2.35.2#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory"><code>safe.directory</code></a> configuration).</p>
<p>If you can’t upgrade immediately, the most effective ways to reduce your risk are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git/2.35.2#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode"><code>GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES</code> environment variable</a> to contain the parent directory of your user profile (i.e., <code>/Users</code> on macOS,</li>
<li>Avoid running Git on multi-user machines when your current working directory is not within a trusted repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that many tools (such as the Git for Windows installation of Git Bash, posh-git, and Visual Studio) run Git commands under the hood. If you are on a multi-user machine, avoid using these tools until you have upgraded to the latest release.</p>

<h2>CVE-2022-24767</h2>
<p>This vulnerability affects the Git for Windows uninstaller, which runs in the user’s temporary directory. Because the <code>SYSTEM</code> user account inherits the</p>
<p>The most effective way to protect against this vulnerability is to upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.35.2.windows.1">Git for Windows v2.35.2</a>. If you can’t upgrade</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid running the uninstaller until after upgrading</li>
<li>Override the <code>SYSTEM</code> user’s <code>TMP</code> environment variable to a directory which can only be written to by the <code>SYSTEM</code> user</li>
<li>Remove unknown <code>.dll</code> files from <code>C:\Windows\Temp</code> before running the</li>
<li>Run the uninstaller under an administrator account rather than as the</li>
