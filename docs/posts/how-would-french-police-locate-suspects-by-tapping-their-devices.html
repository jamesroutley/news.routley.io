    <h1>Ask HN: How would French police locate suspects by tapping their devices?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I just found a news article regarding a law that passed in France allowing police to remotely activate GPS, camera, microphone on a user&#39;s device [0]. This was posted before on HN [1], but without traction, but I am not all that much interested in the civil aspects of it, I am more interested in the technical aspects of it. I&#39;m curious if there is someone with know how about how such a thing would be achieved.</p><p>Would they base it on exploits? Would they have to require manufacturers to add police APIs on the devices? Would a remotely activated camera / microphone / location get the active camera / microphone / location indicator?</p><p>55 minute edit: 
It seems like for simple stuff, like coarse location they can get it through the carrier; I assumed as much and it&#39;s relatively easy to get it done. For other stuff, rootkits and exploits are developed by some intelligence agencies which require manufacturing consent or physical interception. Then there&#39;s also groups that sell OS levels exploits such as the NSO group.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing in the case of software exploits, the indicators would appear for camera / mic / gps. But maybe for hardware exploits they could bypass the circuitry? Seems like a lot of work for non-high-profile targets.</p><p>Later edit:
Keyword &#34;baseband&#34; seems to be the most likely attack vector</p><p>[0] <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-surveillance-digital-devices-suspects-6018bdb2aee36ef373209555f5ec0019" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://apnews.com/article/france-surveillance-digital-devic...</a></p><p>[1] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36779568">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36779568</a></p></div></div></div>
