            <p>Developers love GitHub&#39;s markdown editor and there&#39;s a reason for that. It effortlessly enables us to write simple text and have it transform to rich media.</p>

<p>This is the editor I wanted to have since forever üôå</p>

<p>Today, we are proud to present to you <a href="https://github.com/avo-hq/marksmith" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marksmith</a>. The GitHub-style markdown editor for Ruby on Rails. It supports ActiveStorage and has a few powerhouse features like preview-panel and helper, toolbar, and list-continuation.</p>

<h2>Seamless markdown editing</h2>

<p>I feel that the best way to write markdown is in plain-text. I&#39;ve used those &#34;markdown wysiwyg&#34; editors like EasyMDE but they just don&#39;t feel natural. I think in text, so I want to write text. Let me just write it like that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why Marksmith&#39;s interface is a plain <code>textarea</code> where you write plain text. No distractions or any fancy post processing. </p>

<p>It also features GitHub&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/github/markdown-toolbar-element" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">markdown-toolbar-element</a> which will help those who need to quickly change the styling.</p>

<h2>Quick Preview</h2>

<p>Once I finish writing the markdown I usually click the preview button to see what it would look like and if the body is valid. Marksmith has a built-in preview pane which will render the markdown as HTML.</p>

<p>Marksmith comes with a <code>marksmithed</code> helper which will render that content on your show page or other places with the same HTML that you see in your Preview pane.</p>

<p>This renderer is easily customizable and extendable in your own app.</p>

<h2>ActiveStorage integration</h2>

<p>One of the things I do in editors is to embed media and more often images. Marksmith comes integrated with Rails&#39; amazing ActiveStorage framework for storing files.</p>

<p>Drag-and-drop files or click the dedicated button to attach files. Images will automatically be formatted as a markdown image and other files will be attached as a link.</p>

<h2>List continuation</h2>

<p>One nice thing I love about GitHub&#39;s editor is the list continuation feature. When writing lists, after I click return, I expect that the editor will go on the next line and add a new list item. üôå Marksmith does that!</p>

<h2>Media Library</h2>

<p>One request we get very often is the ability to inject images that have previously been uploaded by users, thus not duplicating that content.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>I&#39;d like to thank <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeremysmith.co" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jeremy Smith</a> for pointing me toward GitHub&#39;s toolbar element and other packages and for providing the <a href="https://hybrd.co/posts/stimulus-autocomplete-with-combobox-navigation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">code</a> for the ActiveStorage integration ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>Also, thank you <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jose.omg.lol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jose Farias</a>. I used the release script and some of the patterns he used to package <a href="https://github.com/josefarias/hotwire_combobox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hotwire_combobox</a>.</p>

<h2>Try it today</h2>

<p>Marksmith is available on GitHub as an MIT gem. It&#39;s an engine that hooks up in any Rails app quickly and integrates beautifully with Avo.</p>
