<p>There is only drama in the open source community when the day has a &#34;y&#34; in it, and sure enough a trio of members <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/01/31/changes-in-the-core-team.html">have decided to step back</a> from the Rust Core Team, including a nine-year veteran of the language.</p>
<p>It has been a busy few months for the Rust project. The entire moderation team <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/23/rust_moderation_team_quits/">quit in November 2021</a>. The resignation was, according to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/671">post in GitHub on the matter</a>, &#34;in protest of the Core Team placing themselves unaccountable to anyone but themselves.&#34;</p>
<p>This week has kicked off with three of Core Team taking their leave. Florian Gilcher, a Core Team observer and project director on the Rust foundation board, is departing to focus on his company.</p>

    

<p>Pietro Albini, meanwhile, reckoned he had too much to do, and is off to &#34;focus on other parts of the project.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>Finally, and perhaps most significantly, Steve Klabnik (author of the Rust Programming Language Book, along with Carol Nichols) is departing &#34;to focus on using Rust instead of making Rust.&#34;</p>
<p>Klabnik was also responsible for the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rustlang?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@rustlang</a> Twitter account.</p>

        

<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/today-is-my-first-day-at-oxide-computer-company">Klabnik recently joined Oxide</a>, a server-maker due to ship its first hardware &#34;with the software baked in&#34; in the coming months. Gilcher has been <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://asquera.de/about/#florian">CEO of Asquera</a> for the last 10 years as well as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ferrous-systems.com/rust-experts/">managing director</a> for just over three years of the amusingly named Ferrous Systems (an agency focused on solutions based on Rust).</p>

</ul>
<p>A spokesperson told <i>The Register</i> that the decision of the trio to step back was not related to the resignation of the Moderation Team last year. The latter watered down its comments a little during December, retracting its suggestion that any future moderation team &#34;exercise extreme skepticism of any statements by the Core Team&#34; while leaving its original complaint regarding accountability in place.</p>
<p>The Rust language has been rising in popularity over the years. It continues to top the charts in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">&#34;Most Loved&#34; technology</a> (even if the likes of JavaScript far outstrip it in terms of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies">commonly used</a>) and has fans among the tech giants.</p>
<p>Founding members of the Rust Foundation (kicked off in 2021) include Microsoft, Google and AWS. ®</p>

<p>Although the majority of Microsoft&#39;s desktop trumpeting is about Windows 11, the company&#39;s PowerToys project has quietly become a very handy addition to the user&#39;s toolbox.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.55.0">Now at version 0.55</a>, the suite of utilities has swelled since its early days. After kicking off with the FancyZones windows manager and Shortcut Guide, PowerToys now comprises a dozen components, including the near-essential &#34;Awake&#34; utility to keep a PC running without faffing about with power and sleep settings, and Video Conference Mute to kill microphone and/or camera during a conference call regardless of where the focus is.</p><p>Tech pros can do all these things themselves, either by finding the appropriate bit of freeware or by simply maintaining situational awareness during the fifth Zoom call of the day, but the suite undeniably makes life a bit easier. And, of course, there is the simple retro-delight of the PowerToys brand. Just without the same potential for disaster as a careless play with TweakUI under Windows 95.</p>                    </div>

<p>The UK government is being warned that taxpayers will have to make up a multibillion-pound shortfall to decommission nuclear power stations unless a history of overspending is reversed.</p><p>French firm EDF Energy runs seven Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) stations in the UK, part of eight second-generation reactors set to be decommissioned which provide 16 per cent of the nation&#39;s electricity. The AGR stations are scheduled to stop producing electricity by 2028.</p><p>Last year the government injected £5.1bn into the Nuclear Liabilities Fund – now valued a £14.8bn – which it set up in 1996 to meet the costs of decommissioning AGR and Pressurised Water Reactor stations.</p>                    </div>
