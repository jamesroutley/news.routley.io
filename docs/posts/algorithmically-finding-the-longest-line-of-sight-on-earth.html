    <h1>Show HN: Algorithmically finding the longest line of sight on Earth</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>With the help of a custom-developed algorithm, <a href="https://github.com/AllTheLines/CacheTVS">CacheTVS</a>, we have exhaustively
checked <em>every single</em> view on Earth in search of the coveted <strong>longest line of sight on the planet</strong>.
Based on the method we detail <a href="https://alltheviews.world/faq/">here</a>, we present the greatest view of all:</p>
<h2 id="1-hindu-kush-to-pik-dankova-530km-">
  <a href="https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/78.76539611816406_36.31400680541992">1. Hindu Kush to Pik Dankova (530km) ↗</a>

  Runners Up
</h2>
<p>Longest lines of sight tend to group together around peaks and ridges. So the following are more of our own curated list rather than the technically correct runners up. We chose them based on being in notably different regions of the world.</p>
<h2 id="2-antioquia-to-pico-cristobal-504km-">
  <a href="https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/-75.72223663330078_6.75514030456543">2. Antioquia to Pico Cristobal (504km) ↗</a>
</h2>
<figure><a href="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_2.webp">
  <img src="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_2.webp" alt="Second Longest Line Of Site" title="The second longest line of sight, at 504km, from Antioquia to Pico Crostobal in Colombia" loading="lazy"/>

<p>Now we go right to the other side of the world to Colombia in South America. We’ve found a line of sight from the department of Antioquia to Pico Cristobal, Colombia’s highest mountain.</p>
<h2 id="3-mount-elbrus-to-the-pontic-mountains-483km-">
  <a href="https://map.alltheviews.world/longest/42.43996810913086_43.34897232055664">3. Mount Elbrus to the Pontic Mountains (483km) ↗</a>
</h2>
<figure><a href="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_3.webp">
  <img src="https://alltheviews.world/longest_line_3.webp" alt="Third Longest Line Of Site" title="The third longest line of sight, at 483km, from Mount Elbrus in Russia to the Pontic Mountains in Turkey" loading="lazy"/>

<p>Our pick for the third greatest view is from Mount Elbrus in Russia to the Pontic Moutains in Turkey. Notably Russia does not share a land border with Turkey, so it’s interesting that you can still see one from the other.</p>
