<div><p>Three speculative tales of suspense and escape. <a href="http://www.glittership.com/2017/07/11/episode-42-the-passing-bell-by-amy-griswold/">“The Passing Bell” by Amy Griswold</a> (also available in audio): <i>“It’s kind of you to put me up,” I said, jingling pennies in my pocket to encourage such generosity.  In a town so small it had neither pub nor inn, I considered myself fortunate to be offered the chance to sleep in the blacksmith’s loft.</i> <a href="https://sockdolager.net/authenticity-soup/">&#34;Authenticity Soup&#34; by by Alison Wilgus</a> (<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/145781/Future-so-bright">previously</a>): <i>She had not put the tent together outside the pressurized dome of the city. And she had not been wearing a surface suit. Or gloves.</i> <a href="https://translunartravelerslounge.com/2021/08/15/i-am-tasting-the-stars-by-jennifer-r-donohue/">&#34;I Am Tasting the Stars&#34; by Jennifer R. Donohue</a> (published this year) features a list, champagne, a boat, and a mutiny: <i>&#34;We’re good at finding what we need, having enough. It’s why they still humor me, and my list; I’ve brought them years of plenty, no matter how ridiculous the ask.&#34;</i></p></div>
