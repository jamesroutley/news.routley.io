But a helium leak and issues with the Starliner’s thrusters have left the two NASA astronauts who flew the capsule into space stuck in orbit for more than two months. The journey had been meant to last just eight days.</p><p>Meanwhile, Boeing&#39;s aviation arm continues to deal with fallout after a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/ntsb-grills-boeing-execs-safety-culture-retaliation-allegations-rcna165653" target="_blank">door panel blew out on </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/ntsb-grills-boeing-execs-safety-culture-retaliation-allegations-rcna165653" target="_blank">one of </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/ntsb-grills-boeing-execs-safety-culture-retaliation-allegations-rcna165653" target="_blank">its 737 Max airplane</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/ntsb-grills-boeing-execs-safety-culture-retaliation-allegations-rcna165653" target="_blank">s</a> in January.</p><p>Now, the report from NASA&#39;s inspector general has found that the second stage of the Space Launch System — the part Boeing is responsible for — is significantly over budget. It blew through an original estimate of $962 million in 2017, and the projected price tag for the work through 2025 is now $2.8 billion. </p><p>The project is also years behind schedule: Boeing pushed back delivery of the rocket stage from February 2021 to April 2027.</p><p>As for Boeing&#39;s quality control practices, the NASA inspector general said that from 2021 to 2023, federal oversight officers issued 71 “Corrective Action Requests” to address “deficiencies in quality.”</p><p>Many of the requests took aim at Boeing’s work at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana.</p><p>“Quality control issues at Michoud are largely due to the lack of a sufficient number of trained and experienced aerospace workers at Boeing,” the report said.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><figure><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-860w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-08/240808-nasa-artemis-moon-rocket-mn-1635-8f76ab.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-860w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-nasa-artemis-moon-rocket-mn-1635-8f76ab.jpg 1x"/><source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1000w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-08/240808-nasa-artemis-moon-rocket-mn-1635-8f76ab.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1000w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-nasa-artemis-moon-rocket-mn-1635-8f76ab.jpg 1x"/><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-08/240808-nasa-artemis-moon-rocket-mn-1635-8f76ab.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-nasa-artemis-moon-rocket-mn-1635-8f76ab.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-nasa-artemis-moon-rocket-mn-1635-8f76ab.jpg" alt="NASA&#39;s Space Launch System rocket carrying the Orion spacecraft launches on the Artemis I flight test on Nov. 16, 2022." height="1667" width="2500"/></picture><figcaption data-testid="caption"><span data-testid="caption__container">NASA&#39;s Space Launch System rocket carrying the Orion spacecraft launches on the Artemis I flight test on Nov. 16, 2022.</span><span data-testid="caption__source">John Raoux / AP</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Many of the identified deficiencies ultimately did not get fixed, the report added.</p><p>“Boeing’s process to address deficiencies to date has been ineffective, and the company has generally been nonresponsive in taking corrective actions when the same quality control issues reoccur,” it said.</p><p>In response to a request for comment, a Boeing representative directed NBC News back to NASA. </p><p>Catherine Koerner, the associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters, said in a written response attached to the report that the agency holds its programs to the “highest technical and programmatic standard.”</p><p>“NASA is dedicated to ensuring that its workforce and associated contractors are qualified and properly trained to ensure the safety of its missions,” Koerner wrote. </p><p>The report included several recommendations, including levying “financial penalties for Boeing’s noncompliance with quality control standards.” The inspector general said, however, that NASA decided not to introduce any kind of financial discipline.</p><p>The 322-foot-tall Space Launch System and its accompanying Orion spacecraft are designed to launch astronauts to the moon.

Boeing is the prime contractor for the upper stage of that upgraded version, known as the Space Launch System Block 1B. It began the work in 2014. </p><p>The initial plan called for the upgraded rocket system to be used to send the Artemis II astronauts around the moon, but the timeline has been pushed back — changes that led to delays in the development schedule and increased costs, according to the inspector general.</p><p>The new report said the SLS Block 1B version is likely to cost $5.7 billion by the time it launches.</p><p>The assessment is the latest setback for NASA&#39;s return-to-the-moon program, which has been beset by holdups and budget overruns. NASA has spent more than $42 billion over more than a decade on its Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft.</p><p>Last year, NASA’s inspector general estimated that each Artemis launch would cost $4.2 billion.</p></div><div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/denise-chow-ncpn814621"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2022_46/3581047/denise-chow-byline-jm.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581047/denise-chow-byline-jm.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581047/denise-chow-byline-jm.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"/></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/denise-chow-ncpn814621">Denise Chow</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/denisechow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:denise.chow@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Denise Chow is a science and space reporter for NBC News.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
