    <h1>Ask HN: Have you had any real benefits from apps like Headspace, Fabulous, etc?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>There are so many apps which promise scientific benefits like relief from stress, better habits, etc.<p>Unfortunately most of them are free for only 7 days or 10 days and followed with a steep cost. I&#39;m okay paying if there are any real benefits but the reviews are really mixed on the play store.</p><p>So just wondering what you guys think? Has any such app has had real life benefits? What do you think?</p></td></div></div>
