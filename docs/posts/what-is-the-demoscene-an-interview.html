Unless you’re a computer programmer or engineer, you probably haven’t even heard of it. </span></p><p><span>In this interview, we talk to Filipe Cruz, who uses the handle </span><em>ps</em><span> (@psenough on Twitter, etc. – as </span><em>ps </em><span>is too short of a username). Cruz is a long-time demoscener who runs a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@psenough" rel="">YouTube channel about demoscene</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>On the Arts: What is the demoscene, anyway? And what is a demo? </strong></p><p><span>Filipe Cruz: The demoscene is a sub-culture of digital art, a community of people who focus on showcasing what their machine can do with audiovisual presentations, the so called </span><em>demos</em><span>. It has its roots in the game piracy scene that boomed in the late 80s with the proliferation of the early personal computers (Apple II, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari, Amiga, etc.), where people, mostly teenagers, would trade floppy disks with software and games and sometimes add small intros that would play in the beginning, communicating who had been responsible for breaking the copy protection or fixed/enhanced the game in some way, or how to get in touch for more trading.</span></p><div id="youtube2-pmw87w7i6rQ" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;pmw87w7i6rQ&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pmw87w7i6rQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>Rupture by ASD / Andromeda Software Development (2009)</em></p><p><span>These folks would gather regularly at physical events to trade disks and learn from each other how to use the machine to draw pixelart, produce music, code your own graphical routines, etc. When game trading became more dangerous, the groups became more focused on the artistic side of things and by extension, those LAN copy parties became known as demoparties, holding competitions for best new demos, music, and graphics.</span></p><p><span>But it&#39;s worth mentioning the demoscene is also active outside Europe, in places like the United States, Argentina, Australia, Japan, etc. Some countries with a bit more tradition than others. For example here in Portugal, where I&#39;m from, we only have a single demoscene event per year, the </span><a href="https://inercia.pt/" rel="">Inércia Demoparty</a><span> that I help organize with some friends. It&#39;s quite small compared to other parties, but we are always looking for new blood to come learn about the culture and  participate in the community.</span></p><div id="youtube2-_QZd967F65g" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;_QZd967F65g&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_QZd967F65g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>Incyber by Satori (SK) &amp; Aural Planet (PL) (2000)</em></p><p><strong>OTA: Any favorites or recommendations for cool demos?</strong></p><p><span>FC: Oh yes, I have a lot of favorites for a lot of different reasons. From the late 90s, releases from the Orange demogroup </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOioWD-lTqc" rel="">&#34;Deesbab&#34;</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVRY2aUAdSI" rel="">&#34;Megablast&#34;</a><span> have a special place in my heart. Then from early 2000s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QZd967F65g" rel="">&#34;Incyber&#34; from Satori,</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv-MqEPLYZs" rel="">&#34;Gerbera&#34; by Moppi</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB4V2fBkwv4" rel="">&#34;Barn&#34; from TDA</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also some of my own productions that I collaborated with in the past and am particularly proud of like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5KCpU1r-0" rel="">&#34;Your Song is Quiet pt 2&#34;</a><span> with Russian friends from CPU, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gBTL5QPaBo" rel="">&#34;Anoxia Redux&#34;</a><span> with Greece-based ASD, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQgpknC-SQQ" rel="">&#34;fr-045: life after</a><span> with Finnish section of Farbrausch, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62u_-VE1pQk" rel="">&#34;The Lost Religion of Light&#34;</a><span> with my Serbian friends of Kosmoplovci.</span></p><p><span>In more recent years, I’ve actually started recording a series of demoscene highlights videos, which covers the best demoscene releases by year. You can see them </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxyPjW-DeNVFfzPUIXUJrxIYRURsdRel" rel="">on my YouTube channel.</a></p><p><strong>OTA: Why do demosceners create demos? Is it purely for artistic reasons, or more about pushing the limitations of computer hardware?</strong></p><p><span>FC: A little bit of both. In the late 80s and early 90s the technical aspect was definitely a driving force behind the culture. It was easier to compare things when everyone had the same machine, so it was down to the programming skills and artistic talent to get the most out of the platform. When the IBM PC clones became highly adopted by the masses, some of the active demoscene lost a bit of its charm in that regard, but people kept making demos and gathering at demoparties.</span></p><div id="youtube2-62u_-VE1pQk" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;62u_-VE1pQk&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/62u_-VE1pQk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>kosmoplovci &amp; minimalartifact - the lost religion of light (2007)</em></p><p><span>There are still plenty of demos being regularly released though, both for vintage machines and more recent platforms. </span><a href="https://meteoriks.org/" rel="">The Meteoriks awards</a><span> tries to highlight some of the best releases of the year and their website is a good place to start if you&#39;re looking for recent demos. The more impressive demos tend to have a mix of interesting technology with a focus on style / direction / message / artistic expression.</span></p><p><strong>OTA: Demos are usually created by teams, but are there individual artists too?</strong></p><p><span>FC: There are individual artists too, they are more rare because you typically need a broader range of skillsets to fulfill your vision when you&#39;re doing things alone but they do exist in the demoscene.</span></p><p><strong>OTA: Demoscene seems very much driven by the “scene” (hence the name) of events, called demoparties. How does that work? Do teams typically work on a demo together and only share it at events? And is it a competition, with winners, or just a place to show work? Do creators have portfolios of their work, or is it mostly an event-based art form?</strong></p><p><span>FC: Yes, most social aspect happens at the demoparties. There are typically competitions for many different categories where you submit your latest work. The competition format is a bit of a cultural thing. A lot of the participants don&#39;t really care about the position their entry gets and they just enter it to the competition to have it shared on the big screen / livestream for others to see.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg" width="800" height="600" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:600,&#34;width&#34;:800,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:481556,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3654f1df-fad8-411b-aed4-fe9343f62e7d_800x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Assembly 2004 – a combination of a demoparty and a LAN party</em></p><p><span>There are other demoscene websites doing similar work like </span><a href="http://pouet.net" rel="">pouet.net</a><span>, </span><a href="http://csdb.dk" rel="">csdb.dk</a><span>, or </span><a href="http://janeway.exotica.org.uk" rel="">janeway.exotica.org.uk</a><span>. Some of them focus on specific platforms or just certain aspects of the demoscene. Demozoo tries to cover it all but is still an ongoing process, the database is not complete.</span></p><p><strong>OTA: What do demo creators use to make demos? Are these graphics entirely made with code, or do people use programs like After Effects or Blender too?</strong></p><p><span>FC: Depends on the person and the project. Some people develop their own tools and frameworks to work with or to help their group members collaborate making a production. Particularly if you&#39;re targetting size limited categories like 4kb or 64kb you need specialized tools which don&#39;t exist commercially. But there is a bit of a culture of sharing your tool and framework for others to reuse / learn from after you have released your production. For example, </span><a href="https://in4k.github.io/" rel="">in4k</a><span> gathers resources for creating productions of 4kb.</span></p><p><strong>OTA: In general, are there any real “rules” to demoscene, other than making a cool demo?</strong></p><p><span>FC: Each demoparty has its own set of competitions. And for each of these competitions there are usually rules lined down, to ensure the competition is fair for everyone participating. Those are the main constraints when releasing something on the demoscene. That being said, most demoparties typically have a wild competition category where anything goes: video, weird platforms, live performances, whatever you can think of.</span></p><p><strong>OTA: Demoscene has recently been labeled as intangible culture by UNESCO in some countries. What effect do you think this will have, good or bad?</strong></p><div id="youtube2-eluO-jorxHk" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;eluO-jorxHk&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eluO-jorxHk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>Altair - Mara (2019)</em></p><p><strong>OTA: How long have you been involved in the demoscene? And how does your YouTube channel relate to it?</strong></p><p>FC: I been active in the demoscene since 1997 after a neighbor / classmate of mine showed me some demos and challenged me to learn graphics programming. I did many different types of releases since then, mostly for the MS-DOS and Windows platforms. I also dabbled in audio production, am known as an experimental  / noise artist of sorts in the demoscene for focusing on glitch audio aesthetics in many of my releases. But I also try other aesthetics now and again, depending on the project idea.</p><p><span>The demoscene was never that big in Portugal, so most of my early contact with it was by reading about it through </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_magazine" rel="">diskmag articles.</a><span> Diskmags are the equivalent of an independent news zine of sorts, but in an executable file format and fitting inside a single floppy disk, hence the name, a mag inside a disk. I became a bit obsessed with the medium, was even an amateur editor and co-editor of different number  of demoscene publications throughout the years. So it was common for me  to keep track of the active demoscene, what groups are active, the new  parties coming up, the best latest releases that just came out. Getting  to know all the different groups and platforms of activity and how they  correlated with each other, did a whole bunch of interviews with all  types of demosceners, etc.</span></p><div id="youtube2-3FFPCuDqi_g" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;3FFPCuDqi_g&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3FFPCuDqi_g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><em>BACK TO THE PET – shiru8bit (2022)</em></p><p><strong><span>OTA: If someone wants to get involved with demoscene, where should they start?

Any other recommendations? And where can they find demoscene events to attend?</span></strong></p><p>FC: Definitely “Teach Yourself Demoscene in 14 Days”, it was prepared especially with that goal in mind and peer reviewed by other demosceners.

I would also recommend to join some demoscene Discord servers and getting to know the active community depending on what you&#39;re most interested in. </span></p><p>Through that interaction it&#39;ll become clear what upcoming events people are looking forward to or preparing their releases for, and then just try to participate. If you can&#39;t attend physically, most events also welcome remote participation and usually have a livestream of the event available.</p></div></div></div></div>
