      <p>
        The ActivityPub protocol is a decentralized social networking protocol
        based upon the [<cite><a href="#bib-ActivityStreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite>] 2.0 data format.
        It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting
        content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering
        notifications and content.

    <section id="Overview">
      <!--OddPage--><h2 id="x1-overview"><span>1. </span>Overview</h2>

      <p>ActivityPub provides two layers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>A server to server federation protocol</b>
          (so decentralized websites can share information)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A client to server protocol</b>
          (so users, including real-world users, bots, and other automated processes,
          can communicate with ActivityPub using their accounts on servers,
          from a phone or desktop or web application or whatever)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        ActivityPub implementations can implement just one of these things or
        both of them.
        However, once you&#39;ve implemented one, it isn&#39;t too many steps to
        implement the other, and there are a lot of benefits to both (making
        your website part of the decentralized social web, and being able to
        use clients and client libraries that work across a wide variety of
        social websites).
      </p>

      <p>
        In ActivityPub, a user is represented by &#34;<a href="#actors">actors</a>&#34;
        via the user&#39;s accounts on servers.
        User&#39;s accounts on different servers correspond to different actors.
        Every Actor has:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>An <code>inbox</code>:</b>  How they get messages from the world</li>
        <li><b>An <code>outbox</code>:</b> How they send messages to others</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/illustration/tutorial-1.png" alt="Actor with inbox and outbox"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        These are endpoints, or really, just URLs which are listed in the
        ActivityPub actor&#39;s ActivityStreams description.
        (More on ActivityStreams later).
      </p>

      <p>
        Here&#39;s an example of the record of our friend Alyssa P. Hacker:
      </p>

      <div><p><span>Example 1</span></p><pre aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">{<span>&#34;@context&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</span>,

 <span>&#34;liked&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://social.example/alyssa/liked/&#34;</span>}</pre></div>

      <p>
        ActivityPub uses [<cite><a href="#bib-ActivityStreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite>] for its vocabulary.
        This is pretty great because ActivityStreams includes all the common
        terms you need to represent all the activities and content flowing
        around a social network.
        It&#39;s likely that ActivityStreams already includes all the vocabulary
        you need, but even if it doesn&#39;t, ActivityStreams can be extended
        via [<cite><a href="#bib-JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a></cite>].
        If you know what JSON-LD is, you can take advantage of the cool linked
        data approaches provided by JSON-LD.
        If you don&#39;t, don&#39;t worry, JSON-LD documents and ActivityStreams can be
        understood as plain old simple JSON.
        (If you&#39;re going to add extensions, that&#39;s the point at which JSON-LD
        really helps you out).
      </p>

      <p>
        So, okay.
        Alyssa wants to talk to her friends, and her friends want to talk to
        her!
        Luckily these &#34;inbox&#34; and &#34;outbox&#34; things can help us out.
        They both behave differently for GET and POST.
        Let&#39;s see how that works:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/illustration/tutorial-2.png" alt="Actor with messages flowing from rest of world to inbox and from outbox to rest of world"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Hey nice, so just as a recap:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You can POST to someone&#39;s inbox to send them a message
          (server-to-server / federation only... this <em>is</em> federation!)
        </li>
        <li>
          You can GET from your inbox to read your latest messages
          (client-to-server; this is like reading your social
          network stream)
        </li>
        <li>
          You can POST to your outbox to send messages to the world
          (client-to-server)
        </li>
        <li>
          You can GET from someone&#39;s outbox to see what messages they&#39;ve
          posted (or at least the ones you&#39;re authorized to see).
          (client-to-server and/or server-to-server)
        </li>
      </ul>
 
      <p>
        Of course, if that last one (GET&#39;ing from someone&#39;s outbox) was the
        only way to see what people have sent, this wouldn&#39;t be a very
        efficient federation protocol!
        Indeed, federation happens usually by servers posting messages sent by
        actors to actors on other servers&#39; inboxes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let&#39;s see an example!
        Let&#39;s say Alyssa wants to catch up with her friend, Ben Bitdiddle.
        She lent him a book recently and she wants to make sure he returns it
        to her.
        Here&#39;s the message she composes, as an ActivityStreams object:
      </p>

      <div><p><span>Example 2</span></p><pre aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">{<span>&#34;@context&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</span>,
 <span>&#34;type&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Note&#34;</span>,
 <span>&#34;to&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;https://chatty.example/ben/&#34;</span>],
 <span>&#34;attributedTo&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://social.example/alyssa/&#34;</span>,
 <span>&#34;content&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Say, did you finish reading that book I lent you?&#34;</span>}</pre></div>

      <p>
        This is a note addressed to Ben.
        She POSTs it to her outbox.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/illustration/tutorial-3.png" alt="Actor posting message to outbox"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Since this is a non-activity object, the server recognizes that this is
        an object being newly created, and does the courtesy of wrapping it in
        a Create activity.
        (Activities sent around in ActivityPub generally follow the pattern of
        some activity by some actor being taken on some object.
        In this case the activity is a Create of a Note object, posted by a
        Person).
      </p>


      <div><p><span>Example 3</span></p><pre aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">{<span>&#34;@context&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</span>,
 <span>&#34;type&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Create&#34;</span>,
 <span>&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://social.example/alyssa/posts/a29a6843-9feb-4c74-a7f7-081b9c9201d3&#34;</span>,
 <span>&#34;to&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;https://chatty.example/ben/&#34;</span>],
 <span>&#34;actor&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://social.example/alyssa/&#34;</span>,
 <span>&#34;object&#34;</span>: {<span>&#34;type&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Note&#34;</span>,
            <span>&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://social.example/alyssa/posts/49e2d03d-b53a-4c4c-a95c-94a6abf45a19&#34;</span>,
            <span>&#34;attributedTo&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://social.example/alyssa/&#34;</span>,
            <span>&#34;to&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;https://chatty.example/ben/&#34;</span>],
            <span>&#34;content&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Say, did you finish reading that book I lent you?&#34;</span>}}</pre></div>

      <p>
        Alyssa&#39;s server looks up Ben&#39;s ActivityStreams actor object, finds his
        inbox endpoint, and POSTs her object to his inbox.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/illustration/tutorial-4.png" alt="Server posting to remote actor&#39;s inbox"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Technically these are two separate steps... one is client to server
        communication, and one is server to server communication (federation).
        But, since we&#39;re using them both in this example, we can abstractly
        think of this as being a streamlined submission from outbox to inbox:
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/illustration/tutorial-5.png" alt="Note flowing from one actor&#39;s outbox to other actor&#39;s inbox"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Cool!
        A while later, Alyssa checks what new messages she&#39;s gotten.
        Her phone polls her inbox via GET, and amongst a bunch of cat videos
        posted by friends and photos of her nephew posted by her sister, she
        sees the following:
      </p>

<p>
  As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples,
  and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is
  normative.
</p>
<p id="respecRFC2119">The key words  <em>MAY</em>, <em>MUST</em>, <em>MUST NOT</em>, <em>SHOULD</em>, and <em>SHOULD NOT</em> are

        <h3 id="x2-1-specification-profiles"><span>2.1 </span>Specification Profiles</h3>
        <p>
          This specification defines two closely related and interacting
          protocols:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>A client to server protocol, or &#34;Social API&#34;</dt>
          <dd>
            This protocol permits a client to act <i>on behalf</i> of a user.
            For example, this protocol is used by a mobile phone application to
            interact with a social stream of the user&#39;s actor.
          </dd>
          <dt>A server to server protocol, or &#34;Federation Protocol&#34;</dt>
          <dd>
            This protocol is used to distribute activities between actors on
            different servers, tying them into the same social graph.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          The ActivityPub specification is designed so that once either of
          these protocols are implemented, supporting the other is of very
          little additional effort.
          However, servers may still implement one without the other.
          This gives three conformance classes:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Client</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
            client portion of the client to server protocol.
          </dd>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Server</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
            server portion of the client to server protocol.
          </dd>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Federated Server</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of
            the federation protocols.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          It is called out whenever a portion of the specification only applies
          to implementation of the federation protocol.
          In addition, whenever requirements are specified, it is called out
          whether they apply to the client or server (for the client-to-server
          protocol) or whether referring to a sending or receiving server in
          the server-to-server protocol.

      <!--OddPage--><h2 id="x3-objects"><span>3. </span>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Objects are the core concept around which both [<cite><a href="#bib-ActivityStreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite>] and
        ActivityPub are built.
        Objects are often wrapped in Activities and are contained in streams of
        Collections, which are themselves subclasses of Objects.
        See the [<cite><a href="#bib-Activity-Vocabulary">Activity-Vocabulary</a></cite>] document, particularly the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#types">Core Classes</a>;
        ActivityPub follows the mapping of this vocabulary very closely.
      </p>
      <p>
        ActivityPub defines some terms in addition to those provided by
        ActivityStreams.
        These terms are provided in the ActivityPub
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>
        at
        <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams</code>.
        Implementers <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> include the ActivityPub context in their
        object definitions.
        Implementers <em title="MAY">MAY</em> include additional context as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        ActivityPub shares the same
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#urls">
          URI / IRI conventions as in ActivityStreams</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Servers <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> validate the content they receive to avoid content
        spoofing attacks.
        (A server should do something at least as robust as checking that
        the object appears as received at its origin, but mechanisms
        such as checking signatures would be better if available).
        No particular mechanism for verification is authoritatively specified by
        this document, but please see <a href="#security-considerations">Security 
        Considerations</a> for some suggestions and good practices.

        <h3 id="x3-1-object-identifiers"><span>3.1 </span>Object Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
          All Objects in [<cite><a href="#bib-ActivityStreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite>] should have unique global
          identifiers.
          ActivityPub extends this requirement; all objects distributed by the
          ActivityPub protocol <em title="MUST">MUST</em> have unique global identifiers, unless they
          are intentionally transient (short lived activities that are not
          intended to be able to be looked up, such as some kinds of chat
          messages or game notifications).
          These identifiers must fall into one of the following groups:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Publicly dereferencable URIs, such as HTTPS URIs, with their
            authority belonging to that of their originating server.
            (Publicly facing content <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> use HTTPS URIs).
          </li>
          <li>
            An ID explicitly specified as the JSON <code>null</code> object,
            which implies an anonymous object (a part of its parent context)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Identifiers <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be provided for activities posted in server to
          server communication, unless the activity is intentionally transient.
          However, for client to server communication, a server receiving an
          object posted to the outbox with no specified <code>id</code> <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>
          allocate an object ID in the actor&#39;s namespace and attach it to the

        </p>
        <p>All objects have the following properties:</p>
        <dl>

        <p>
          The HTTP GET method may be dereferenced against an object&#39;s
          <code>id</code> property to retrieve the activity.
          Servers <em title="MAY">MAY</em> use HTTP content negotiation as defined in [<cite><a href="#bib-RFC7231">RFC7231</a></cite>] to
          select the type of data to return in response to a request,
          but <em title="MUST">MUST</em> present the ActivityStreams object representation
          in response to
          <code>application/ld+json; profile=&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</code>,
          and <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> also present the ActivityStreams representation in
          response to <code>application/activity+json</code> as well.
          The client <em title="MUST">MUST</em> specify an <code>Accept</code> header with the

        <p>
          Servers <em title="MAY">MAY</em> implement other behavior for requests which do not comply
          with the above requirement.
          (For example, servers may implement additional legacy protocols, or
          may use the same URI for both HTML and ActivityStreams
          representations of a resource).
        </p>

          Servers <em title="MAY">MAY</em> require authorization as specified in

          Servers <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> fail requests which do not pass their authorization
          checks with the appropriate HTTP error code, or the 403 Forbidden
          error code where the existence of the object is considered private.
          An origin server which does not wish to disclose the existence of
          a private target <em title="MAY">MAY</em> instead respond with a status code of

      <section id="source-property">
        <h3 id="x3-3-the-source-property"><span>3.3 </span>The source property</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to all the properties defined by the
	  [<cite><a href="#bib-Activity-Vocabulary">Activity-Vocabulary</a></cite>], ActivityPub extends the <code>Object</code> by
	  supplying the <code>source</code> property.
          The <code>source</code> property is intended to convey some
          sort of source from which the <code>content</code> markup
          was derived, as a form of provenance, or to support future
          editing by clients.
          In general, clients do the conversion from <code>source</code>
          to <code>content</code>, not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of <code>source</code> is itself an object
          which uses its own <code>content</code> and <code>mediaType</code>
          fields to supply source information.
        </p>
        <div><p><span>Example 8</span></p><pre aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">{
  <span>&#34;@context&#34;</span>: [<span>&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</span>,

    <span>&#34;mediaType&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;text/markdown&#34;</span>}
}</pre></div>
        <div><p><span>Note</span><span>: What to do when clients can&#39;t meaningfully handle a mediaType?</span></p><div>
          <p>
            In general, it&#39;s best to let a user edit their original post
            in the same source format they originally composed it in.
            But not all clients can reliably provide a nice interface for
            all source types, and since clients are expected to do the
            conversion from <code>source</code> to <code>content</code>,
            some clients may work with a media type that another client
            does not know how to work with.
            While a client could feasibly provide the <code>content</code>
            markup to be edited and ignore the source, this means that the
            user will lose the more desirable form of the original
            <code>source</code> in any future revisions.
            A client doing so should thus provide a minimally obtrusive warning
            cautioning that the original source format is not understood and is
            thus being ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, Alyssa P. Hacker likes to post to her ActivityPub
            powered blog via an Emacs client she has written, leveraging
            <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>.
            Later she switches to editing on her phone&#39;s client, which
            has no idea what <code>text/x-org</code> is or how to render
            it to HTML, so it provides a text box to edit the original
            <code>content</code> instead.
            A helpful warning displays above the edit area saying,
            &#34;This was originally written in another markup language we don&#39;t
            know how to handle.  If you edit, you&#39;ll lose your original
            source!&#34;
            Alyssa decides the small typo fix isn&#39;t worth losing her nice
            org-mode markup and decides to make the update when she gets
            home.

      <p>
        ActivityPub actors are generally one of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#actor-types">
          ActivityStreams Actor Types</a>,
        but they don&#39;t have to be. For example, a 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-profile">
          Profile</a> object
        might be used as an actor, or a type from an ActivityStreams extension.
        Actors are <a href="#retrieving-objects">retrieved</a> like any other
        Object in ActivityPub.
        Like other ActivityStreams objects, actors have an <code>id</code>,
        which is a URI.
        When entered directly into a user interface (for example on a login
        form), it is desirable to support simplified naming.
        For this purpose, ID normalization <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> be performed as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it appears that the user neglected to add a scheme for a URI that
          would otherwise be considered valid, such as
          <code>example.org/alice/</code>, clients <em title="MAY">MAY</em> attempt to provide
          a default scheme, preferably <code>https</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, the entered value should be considered invalid.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Once the actor&#39;s URI has been identified, it should be dereferenced.
      </p>

      <div><p><span>Note</span></p><p>
        ActivityPub does not dictate a specific relationship between
        &#34;users&#34; and Actors; many configurations are possible.
        There may be multiple human users or organizations controlling an
        Actor, or likewise one human or organization may control multiple
        Actors. Similarly, an Actor may represent a piece of software,
        like a bot, or an automated process.
        More detailed &#34;user&#34; modelling, for example linking together of Actors which
        are controlled by the same entity, or allowing one Actor to be presented
        through multiple alternate profiles or aspects, are at the discretion
        of the implementation.

      <p>
        [<cite><a href="#bib-ActivityStreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite>] defines the collection concept; ActivityPub
        defines several collections with special behavior.
        Note that ActivityPub makes use of
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#paging">
          ActivityStreams paging</a>
        to traverse large sets of objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that some of these collections are specified to be of type
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-orderedcollection">
          <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>
        specifically, while others are permitted to be either a
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-collection">
          <code>Collection</code></a>
        or an
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-orderedcollection">
          <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>.

          <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>
        <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be presented consistently in reverse chronological order.
      </p>

      <div><p><span>Note</span></p><p>
        What property is used to determine the reverse chronological order
        is intentionally left as an implementation detail.
        For example, many SQL-style databases use an incrementing integer
        as an identifier, which can be reasonably used for handling
        insertion order in most cases.
        In other databases, an insertion time timestamp may be preferred.
        What is used isn&#39;t important, but the ordering of elements must
        remain intact, with newer items first.
        A property which changes regularly, such a &#34;last updated&#34; timestamp,
        should not be used.
      </p></div>

      <section id="outbox">
        <h3 id="x5-1-outbox"><span>5.1 </span>Outbox</h3>
        <p>
          The outbox is discovered through the <code>outbox</code>
          property of an <a href="#actors">actor&#39;s</a> profile.
          The <code>outbox</code> <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be an
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-orderedcollection">
            <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outbox stream contains activities the user has
          published, subject to the ability of the requestor to retrieve the
          activity (that is, the contents of the outbox are filtered by the
          permissions of the person reading it).
          If a user submits a request without
          <a href="#authorization">Authorization</a> the server should
          respond with all of the <a href="#public-addressing">Public</a>
          posts.
          This could potentially be all relevant objects published by the
          user, though the number of available items is left to the
          discretion of those implementing and deploying the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outbox accepts HTTP POST requests, with behaviour described in

        <p>
          The inbox is discovered through the <code>inbox</code>
          property of an <a href="#actors">actor&#39;s</a> profile.
          The <code>inbox</code> <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be an
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-orderedcollection">
            <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The inbox stream contains all activities received by the
          actor.
          The server <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> filter content according to the requester&#39;s
          permission.
          In general, the owner of an inbox is likely to be able to access
          all of their inbox contents. Depending on access control, some
          other content may be public, whereas other content may require
          authentication for non-owner users, if they can access the inbox
          at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          The server <em title="MUST">MUST</em> perform de-duplication of activities returned by
          the inbox. Duplication can occur if an activity is addressed both
          to an actor&#39;s followers, and a specific
          actor who also follows the recipient actor, and the server has failed
          to de-duplicate the recipients list.
          Such deduplication <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be performed by comparing the
          <code>id</code> of the activities and dropping any activities
          already seen.
        </p>

        <p>
          The inboxes of actors on federated servers accepts HTTP POST requests,
          with behaviour described in <a href="#delivery">Delivery</a>.

            JSON rather than converting an incoming activity over to a
            local context using JSON-LD tooling should be aware of this
            and should be prepared to accept all three representations.

      <p>
        Activities as defined by [<cite><a href="#bib-ActivityStreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite>] are the core mechanism
        for creating, modifying and sharing content within the social graph.
      </p>

      <p>
        Client to server interaction takes place through clients posting
        Activities to an actor&#39;s <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>.
        To do this, clients <em title="MUST">MUST</em> discover the URL of the actor&#39;s outbox from
	their <a href="#actor-objects">profile</a> and then <em title="MUST">MUST</em> make an HTTP
        <code>POST</code> request to this URL with the Content-Type of
        <code>application/ld+json; profile=&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</code>.
        Servers <em title="MAY">MAY</em> interpret a Content-Type or Accept header of
        <code>application/activity+json</code> as equivalent
        to <code>application/ld+json; profile=&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</code>
        for client-to-server interactions.
        The request <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be authenticated with the credentials of the user to
        whom the outbox belongs.
        The body of the <code>POST</code> request <em title="MUST">MUST</em> contain a single
        Activity (which <em title="MAY">MAY</em> contain embedded objects), or a single non-Activity
        object which

        <h3 id="x6-1-client-addressing"><span>6.1 </span>Client Addressing</h3>
          <p>
          <strong>Clients</strong> are responsible for addressing new Activities
          appropriately.
          To some extent, this is dependent upon the particular client
          implementation, but clients must be aware that the server will only
          forward new Activities to addressees in the <code>to</code>,
          <code>bto</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>bcc</code>, and
          <code>audience</code> fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="#followers">Followers Collection</a> and/or the
          <a href="#public-addressing">Public Collection</a> are good
          choices for the default addressing of new Activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> look at any objects attached to the new Activity via the
          <code>object</code>, <code>target</code>, <code>inReplyTo</code> and/or
          <code>tag</code> fields, retrieve <em>their</em> <code>actor</code> or
          <code>attributedTo</code> properties, and <em title="MAY">MAY</em> also retrieve their addressing
          properties, and add these to the <code>to</code> or <code>cc</code>
          fields of the new Activity being created.
          Clients <em title="MAY">MAY</em> recurse through attached objects, but if doing so, <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>
          set a limit for this recursion.
          (Note that this does not suggest that the client should &#34;unpack&#34;
          collections of actors being addressed as individual recipients).
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients <em title="MAY">MAY</em> give the user the chance to amend this addressing in the

          Clients submitting the following activities to an <code>outbox</code>
          <em title="MUST">MUST</em> provide the <code>object</code> property in the activity:

      <section id="create-activity-outbox">
        <h3 id="x6-2-create-activity"><span>6.2 </span>Create Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Create</code> activity is used when posting a new object.
          This has the side effect that the object embedded within the Activity
          (in the <code>object</code> property) is created.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a <code>Create</code> activity is posted, the <code>actor</code>
          of the activity <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> be copied onto the <code>object</code>&#39;s
          <code>attributedTo</code> field.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mismatch between addressing of the Create activity and its
          <code>object</code> is likely to lead to confusion.
          As such, a server <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> copy any recipients of the Create activity
          to its <code>object</code> upon initial distribution, and likewise
          with copying recipients from the <code>object</code> to the wrapping
          Create activity.
          Note that it is acceptable for the <code>object</code>&#39;s addressing
          to be changed later without changing the <code>Create</code>&#39;s
          addressing (for example via an <code>Update</code> activity).

          The server then <em title="MUST">MUST</em> attach this object as the <code>object</code>
          of a <a href="#create-activity-outbox">Create Activity</a>.
          For non-transient objects, the server <em title="MUST">MUST</em> attach an

        <h3 id="x6-3-update-activity"><span>6.3 </span>Update Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Update</code> activity is used when updating an already
          existing object.
          The side effect of this is that the <code>object</code> <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be
          modified to reflect the new structure as defined in the update
          activity, assuming the actor has permission to update this
          object.
        </p>

        <section id="partial-updates">
          <h4 id="x6-3-1-partial-updates"><span>6.3.1 </span>Partial Updates</h4>
          <p>
            For client to server interactions, updates are partial;
            rather than updating the document all at once, any key value
            pair supplied is used to replace the existing value with
            the new value.
            This only applies to the top-level fields of the updated
            object.
            A special exception is for when the value is the json
            <code>null</code> type; this means that this field should be
            removed from the server&#39;s representation of the object.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that this behavior is for client to server interaction where
            the client is posting to the server only.
            Server to server interaction and updates from the server to the client
            should contain the entire new representation of the object, after

          The <code>Delete</code> activity is used to delete an already
          existing object.
          The side effect of this is that the server <em title="MAY">MAY</em> replace the

          that will be displayed in activities which reference the deleted
          object.

      <p>
        Servers communicate with other servers and propagate information across
        the social graph by posting activities to actors&#39;
        <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> endpoints.
        An Activity sent over the network <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> have an <code>id</code>,
        unless it is intended to be transient (in which case it <em title="MAY">MAY</em> omit the
        <code>id</code>).
      </p><p>
        <code>POST</code> requests (eg. to the inbox) <em title="MUST">MUST</em> be made with a Content-Type of
        <code>application/ld+json; profile=&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</code>
        and <code>GET</code> requests (see also <a href="#retrieving-objects"><span>3.2</span> <span>Retrieving objects</span></a>) 
        with an Accept header of 
        <code>application/ld+json; profile=&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</code>.
        Servers <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> interpret a Content-Type or Accept
        header of <code>application/activity+json</code> as equivalent
        to <code>application/ld+json; profile=&#34;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&#34;</code>
        for server-to-server interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to propagate updates throughout the social graph, Activities
        are sent to the appropriate recipients.
        First, these recipients are determined through following the
        appropriate links between objects until you reach an actor, and then
        the Activity is inserted into the actor&#39;s <em>inbox</em>
        (<a href="#delivery">delivery</a>).
        This allows recipient servers to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          conduct any side effects related to the Activity (for example,
          notification that an actor has liked an object is used to update the
          object&#39;s like count);
        </li>
        <li>
          deliver the Activity to recipients of the original object, to ensure
          updates are propagated to the whole social graph (see <a href="#inbox-forwarding">
          inbox delivery</a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Delivery is usually triggered by, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          an Activity being created in an actor&#39;s <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>
          with their <a href="#followers">Followers Collection</a> as the
          recipient.
        </li>
        <li>
          an Activity being created in an actor&#39;s <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>
          with directly addressed recipients.
        </li>
        <li>
          an Activity being created in an actors&#39;s <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>
          with user-curated collections as recipients.
        </li>
        <li>
          an Activity being created in an actor&#39;s <a href="#outbox">outbox</a> or
          <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> which references another object.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Servers performing delivery to the <code>inbox</code> or
        <code>sharedInbox</code> properties of actors on other servers <em title="MUST">MUST</em>
        provide the <code>object</code> property in the activity:
        <code>Create</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>Delete</code>,
        <code>Follow</code>, <code>Add</code>, <code>Remove</code>,

        property: <code>Add</code>, <code>Remove</code>.

        <p>
          An activity is delivered to its targets (which are
          <a href="#actors">actors</a>) by first looking up the targets&#39;
          inboxes and then posting the activity to those inboxes.
          Targets for delivery are determined by checking the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#audienceTargeting">
            ActivityStreams audience targeting</a>;
          namely, the <code>to</code>, <code>bto</code>, <code>cc</code>,
          <code>bcc</code>, and <code>audience</code> fields of the activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> is determined by first
          <a href="#retrieving-objects">
            retrieving the target actor&#39;s JSON-LD representation</a>
          and then looking up the <code>inbox</code> property.
          If a recipient is a <code>Collection</code> or <code>OrderedCollection</code>,
          then the server <em title="MUST">MUST</em> dereference the collection (with the user&#39;s
          credentials) and discover inboxes for each item in the collection.
          Servers <em title="MUST">MUST</em> limit the number of layers of indirections through
          collections which will be performed, which <em title="MAY">MAY</em> be one.
        </p>

        <p>
          Servers <em title="MUST">MUST</em> de-duplicate the final recipient list. Servers <em title="MUST">MUST</em> also
          exclude actors from the list which are the same as the <code>actor</code>
          of the Activity being notified about. That is, actors shouldn&#39;t have their
          own activities delivered to themselves.
        </p>

        <div><p><span>Note</span><span>: Silent and private activities</span></p><p>
          What to do when there are no recipients specified is not defined,
          however it&#39;s recommended that if no recipients are specified the
          object remains completely private and access controls restrict the
          access to object.
          If the object is just sent to the &#34;public&#34; collection the object is
          not delivered to any actors but is publicly viewable in the actor&#39;s
          outbox.
        </p></div>

        <p>
          An HTTP POST request (with authorization of the submitting user) is
          then made to the <a href="#inbox">inbox</a>, with the Activity as
          the body of the request.
          This Activity is added by the receiver as an <code>item</code> in the
          <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> OrderedCollection.
          Attempts to deliver to an inbox on a non-federated server <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>
          result in a <code>405 Method Not Allowed</code> response.

        <p>
          For federated servers performing delivery to a third party server,
          delivery <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> be performed asynchronously, and <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> additionally
          retry delivery to recipients if it fails due to network error.

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Activities being distributed between actors on
          the same origin may use any internal mechanism, and are not required
          to use HTTP.

          While it is not required reading to understand this specification,
          it is worth noting that ActivityPub&#39;s targeting and delivery
          mechanism overlaps with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a>
          specification, and the two specifications may interoperably
          combined.
          In particular, the <code>inbox</code> property is the same between
          ActivityPub and Linked Data Notifications, and the targeting
          and delivery systems described in this document are supported
          by Linked Data Notifications.
          In addition to JSON-LD compacted ActivityStreams documents, Linked
          Data Notifications also supports a number of RDF serializations
          which are not required for ActivityPub implementations.
          However, ActivityPub implementations which wish to be more broadly
          compatible with Linked Data Notifications implementations may wish to
          support other RDF representations.

              The following section is to mitigate the &#34;ghost replies&#34; problem
              which occasionally causes problems on federated networks.
              This problem is best demonstrated with an example.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alyssa makes a post about her having successfully presented a
              paper at a conference and sends it to her followers collection,
              which includes her friend Ben.
              Ben replies to Alyssa&#39;s message congratulating her and includes
              her followers collection on the recipients.
              However, Ben has no access to see the members of Alyssa&#39;s
              followers collection, so his server does not forward his messages
              to their inbox.
              Without the following mechanism, if Alyssa were then to reply to
              Ben, her followers would see Alyssa replying to Ben without having
              ever seen Ben interacting.
              This would be very confusing!

          <p>
            For servers hosting many actors, delivery to all followers can
            result in an overwhelming number of messages sent.
            Some servers would also like to display a list of all messages
            posted publicly to the &#34;known network&#34;.
            Thus ActivityPub provides an optional mechanism for serving these
            two use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an object is being delivered to the originating actor&#39;s
            followers, a server <em title="MAY">MAY</em> reduce the number of receiving actors
            delivered to by identifying all followers which share the same
            <a href="#sharedInbox">sharedInbox</a>
            who would otherwise be individual recipients and instead deliver
            objects to said <code>sharedInbox</code>.
            Thus in this scenario, the remote/receiving server participates
            in determining targeting and performing delivery to specific
            inboxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, if an object is addressed to the
            <a href="#public-addressing">Public</a> special collection, a
            server <em title="MAY">MAY</em> deliver that object to all known
            <code>sharedInbox</code> endpoints on the network.

          <p>
            Origin servers sending publicly addressed activities to
            <code>sharedInbox</code> endpoints <em title="MUST">MUST</em> still deliver to actors
            and collections otherwise addressed (through <code>to</code>,
            <code>bto</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>bcc</code>, and
            <code>audience</code>) which do not have a <code>sharedInbox</code>
            and would not otherwise receive the activity through the

        <p>
          Receiving a <code>Create</code> activity in an <code>inbox</code> has
          surprisingly few side effects; the activity should appear in the
          actor&#39;s <code>inbox</code> and it is likely that the server will want
          to locally store a representation of this activity and its accompanying
          object.
          However, this mostly happens in general with processing activities
          delivered to an <code>inbox</code> anyway.

      <section id="update-activity-inbox">
        <h3 id="x7-3-update-activity"><span>7.3 </span>Update Activity</h3>
        <p>
          For server to server interactions, an <code>Update</code> activity
          means that the receiving server <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> update its copy of the
          <code>object</code> of the same <code>id</code> to the copy
          supplied in the <code>Update</code> activity.
          Unlike the
          <a href="#update-activity-outbox">
            client to server handling of the Update activity</a>,
          this is not a partial update but a complete replacement of the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The receiving server <em title="MUST">MUST</em> take care to be sure that the
          <code>Update</code> is authorized to modify its <code>object</code>.
          At minimum, this may be done by ensuring that the <code>Update</code>
          and its <code>object</code> are of same origin.

      <section id="delete-activity-inbox">
        <h3 id="x7-4-delete-activity"><span>7.4 </span>Delete Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The side effect of receiving this is that (assuming the
          <code>object</code> is owned by the sending actor / server) the
          server receiving the delete activity <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> remove its representation
          of the <code>object</code> with the same <code>id</code>, and <em title="MAY">MAY</em>
          replace that representation with a <code>Tombstone</code> object.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Note that after an activity has been transmitted from an origin
          server to a remote server, there is nothing in the ActivityPub
          protocol that can <em>enforce</em> remote deletion of an object&#39;s
          representation).

        <p>
          The side effect of receiving this in an <strong>inbox</strong> is
          that the server <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> generate either an <code>Accept</code> or
          <code>Reject</code> activity with the Follow as the
          <code>object</code> and deliver it to the <code>actor</code> of the
          Follow.
          The <code>Accept</code> or <code>Reject</code> <em title="MAY">MAY</em> be generated
          automatically, or <em title="MAY">MAY</em> be the result of user input (possibly after
          some delay in which the user reviews).
          Servers <em title="MAY">MAY</em> choose to not explicitly send a <code>Reject</code>
          in response to a <code>Follow</code>, though implementors ought to
          be aware that the server sending the request could be left in an
          intermediate state.
          For example, a server might not send a <code>Reject</code> to protect
          a user&#39;s privacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of receiving an <code>Accept</code> referencing this
          <code>Follow</code> as the object, the server <em title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> add the
          <code>actor</code> to the object actor&#39;s
          <a href="#followers">Followers Collection</a>.
          In the case of a <code>Reject</code>, the server <em title="MUST NOT">MUST NOT</em> add the
          actor to the object actor&#39;s
          <a href="#followers">Followers Collection</a>.
        </p>

        <div><p><span>Note</span></p><p>
            Sometimes a successful <code>Follow</code> subscription may
            occur but at some future point delivery to the follower fails
            for an extended period of time.
            Implementations should be aware that there is no guarantee
            that actors on the network will remain reachable and should
            implement accordingly.
            For instance, if attempting to deliver to an actor for perhaps
            six months while the follower remains unreachable, it is
            reasonable that the delivering server remove the subscriber
            from the <code>followers</code> list.
            Timeframes and behavior for dealing with unreachable actors are
            left to the discretion of the delivering server.

          ActivityPub uses authentication for two purposes; first, to

          implementations to authenticate servers to each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately at the time of standardization, there are no strongly
          agreed upon mechanisms for authentication.

        </p>
        <p>
          Servers should be careful to verify that new content is really posted

        <p>
          It is often convenient while developing to test against a process
          running on localhost.
          However, permitting requests to localhost in a production client or
          server instance can be dangerous.
          Making requests to URIs on localhost which do not require
          authorization may unintentionally access or modify resources assumed
          to be protected to be usable by localhost-only.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your ActivityPub server or client does permit making requests to
          localhost URIs for development purposes, consider making it a
          configuration option which defaults to off.

          Some libraries which handle fetching requests at various URI schemes
          may try to be smart and reference schemes which may be undesirable,
          such as <code>file</code>.
          Client and server authors should carefully check how their libraries
          handle requests, and potentially whitelist only certain safe URI

          Collections, servers should take care to limit the size of Collection 
          pages they return to clients.
          Clients should still be prepared to limit the size of
          responses they are willing to handle in case they connect to malicious or
          compromised servers, for example by timing out and generating
          an error.

          Any activity field being rendered for browsers (or other rich
          text enabled applications) should take care to sanitize fields
          containing markup to prevent cross site scripting attacks.

          in their own storage systems.
          However, since <code>bto</code> and <code>bcc</code> are only intended
          to be known/seen by the original author of the object/activity,
          servers should omit these properties during display as well.

        This specification comes from years of hard work and experience by a
        number of communities exploring the space of federation on the web.
        In particular, much of this specification is informed by
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/wiki/Main_Page">OStatus</a>
        and the
        <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/API.md">Pump API</a>,
        as pioneered by StatusNet (now GNU Social) and Pump.io.
        Both of those initiatives were the product of many developers&#39; hard work,
        but more than anyone, Evan Prodromou has been a constant leader in this
        space, and it is unlikely that ActivityPub would exist in something
        resembling its current state without his hard work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Erin Shepherd built the initial version of this specification, borrowed
        from the ideas in the
        <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/API.md">Pump API</a>
        document, mostly as a complete rewrite of text, but sharing most of
        the primary ideas while switching from ActivityStreams 1 to
        ActivityStreams 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jessica Tallon and Christine Lemmer-Webber took over as editors when
        the standard moved to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Social Working Group and did the majority
        of transition from Erin Shepherd&#39;s document to its current state as
        ActivityPub.
        Much of the document was rewritten and reorganized under the long feedback
        process of the Social Working Group.
      </p>

      <p>
        ActivityPub has been shaped by the careful input of many members in the
        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Social Working Group.
        ActivityPub especially owes a great debt to Amy Guy, who has done more
        than anyone to map the ideas across the different Social Working Group
        documents through her work on [<cite><a href="#bib-Social-Web-Protocols">Social-Web-Protocols</a></cite>].
        Amy also laid out the foundations for a significant refactoring of the
        ActivityPub spec while sprinting for four days with Christopher Allan
        Webber.
        These revisions lead to cleaner separation between the client to server
        and server components, along with clarity about ActivityPub&#39;s relationship
        to [<cite><a href="#bib-LDN">LDN</a></cite>], among many other improvements.
        Special thanks also goes to Benjamin Goering for putting together the
        implementation report template.
        We also thank mray for producing the spectacular tutorial illustrations
        (which are licensed under the same license as the rest of this
        document).
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people also helped ActivityPub along through careful review.
