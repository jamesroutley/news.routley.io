    <h1>The web I want vs. the one we have</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember when I first arrived in Silicon Valley with a couple of products and after meeting Steve Jobs at Apple, and signing with the company that bought Visicalc, I felt like I had arrived, and quickly found my tribe. These people understand what I do, after trying to get folks at my university, in Madison, to understand. It was great.</p>
<p>But I didn’t understand how thin the competence was. That didn’t come until I had lunch with one of two leading analysts who were the influencers of the day, the ones who acted as gatekeepers for the venture capitalists. This was a couple of years later, I was on my own after the Visicalc company decided my outliner was too weird to stake their rep on. </p>
<p>So I was going to explain to this reputed visionary how my outliner worked and why it was so different from the writing tools other people were marketing. Very quickly I understood that this person had no more understanding of software than my roommates in Madison did. They were smart and educated, but they were English majors or studied agriculture or business. They didn’t understand the first thing about computers, and neither did this gatekeeper. I can’t tell you how disheartening this was. This was a famous person who I’m not going to name. </p>
<p>Later I learned that when Symantec, the company that bought my startup, was thinking about making a product, they’d invite this person to hear the pitch and if they didn’t like or understand it, they wouldn’t make it. </p>
<p>I later learned that the execs at most of the tech companies were similarly clueless on what made software possible, and basic stuff like trading off time for space and vice versa. Yet these people were deciding what software got made. </p>
<p>And then years later when the PC industry was slowing down, and the cursor had moved into the newly invented world wide web, when we were booting up blogging and I was writing for Wired, again — almost no one knew how these things worked and thus had no idea what was possible. It was so weird, I could figure things out, because I had a degree in computer science, and had written at least prototypes of most of the different kinds of software, that were incomprehensible to anyone else I met in the industry. I was always looking for something new these machines could do, but if I wanted to actually make the products, I’d be on my own. </p>
<p>But what was wonderful about the web, was that here was a machine for finding people with similar interests and experience, anywhere in the world. That’s the web I want back. </p>
<p>PS: This is my second day of kitchen-table blogging using wordLand, WordPress and Mastodon, and I like it even more today than I did yesterday. I have a lot of ideas how to make this work better and even how to build a business on this product. It feels right, and that’s always a good sign.</p>
<p>PPS: Here’s a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113294648507571898">link</a> to a location on Mastodon where you can read this piece. That is still evolving, and it will look better soon. And you can of course follow me there, so we don’t have to rely on other social media sites for you to find my latest writing.</p>
