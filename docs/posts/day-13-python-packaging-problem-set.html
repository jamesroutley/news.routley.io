<p>Some tips for those who can&#39;t beat 100%:
 </p>
<p>1) You should only heal when you have 0 HP
 </p>
<p>2) If you have to choose between scroll and level up (for healing) — choose level up. Because it also increases your max hp and makes the scroll more valuable later in the game
 </p>
<p>3) My strategy was to explore the map quickly, try to save healing scrolls for later and not fight too often. You should find a wizard with level 11 and also mark as many bombs as possible. Then, when you reach lvl 11 (11hp) — kill the wizard and you will have lots of free gold spots marked. You can collect them to level up, heal yourself (and save scrolls for later)
 </p>
<p>4) Actually, when you have 11hp, you can explore any area (if there&#39;s no bomb for sure) because it&#39;s the maximum damage in the game. Don&#39;t forget this
