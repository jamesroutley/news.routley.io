    <h1>Moody&#39;s downgrades US banking: ‘rapidly deteriorating operating environment’</h1>

But it said other institutions with unrealized losses or uninsured depositors still could be at risk.</p><p>The Federal Reserve established a facility to ensure that institutions hit with liquidity problems would have access to cash. The Treasury Department backstopped the program with $25 billion in funds and vowed that depositors with more than $250,000 at SVB and Signature would have full access to their funds.</p><p>But Moody&#39;s said that concerns remain.</p><p>&#34;Banks with substantial unrealized securities losses and with non-retail and uninsured US depositors may still be more sensitive to depositor competition or ultimate flight, with adverse effects on funding, liquidity, earnings and capital,&#34; the report said.</p><p>Bank stocks rallied strongly despite the downgrade. The <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KBE/">SPDR Bank</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> exchange-traded fund rose nearly 6.5% in morning trade. Major indexes also were higher, with the <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-2"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> up nearly 450 points, or 1.4%.</p><p>Moody&#39;s on Monday downgraded Signature Bank and said it would remove all ratings. It placed the following institutions under review for potential downgrades: <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-3"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FRC/">First Republic</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, Intrust Financial, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UMBF/">UMB</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ZION/">Zions Bancorp</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-6"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WAL/">Western Alliance</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> and <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMA/">Comerica</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>.</p><p>The firm noted that an extended period of low rates combined with Covid pandemic-related fiscal and monetary stimulus have complicated bank operations.</p><p>SVB, for instance, found itself with some $16 billion in unrealized losses from long-dated Treasurys it held. As yields rose, it eroded the principle value of those bonds and created liquidity issues for the bank, long a favorite of high-flying tech investors that couldn&#39;t get financing at traditional institutions. SVB had to sell those bonds at a loss to meet obligations.</p><p>Rates rose as the Federal Reserve battled an inflation surge that took prices to their highest levels in more than 40 years. Moody&#39;s said it expects the Fed to continue hiking.</p><p>&#34;We expect pressures to persist and be exacerbated by ongoing monetary policy tightening, with interest rates likely to remain higher for longer until inflation returns to within the Fed&#39;s target range,&#34; Moody&#39;s said. &#34;US banks also now are facing sharply rising deposit costs after years of low funding costs, which will reduce earnings at banks, particularly those with a greater proportion of fixed-rate assets.&#34;</p><p>The firm said it expects the U.S. economy to fall into recession later this year, further pressuring the industry.</p></div></div></div>
