    <h1>Raytheon completes engine run of hybrid-electric flight demonstrator</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><span><span><span>The propulsion system&#39;s initial run took place at Pratt &amp; Whitney&#39;s innovation facility in Longueuil, Quebec and performed as expected. The system fully integrates a 1 MW electric motor developed by Collins Aerospace with a highly efficient Pratt &amp; Whitney fuel-burning engine, specially adapted for hybrid-electric operation. This powerplant technology will enable more efficient engine performance during the different phases of flight, such as take-off, climb and cruise, reducing fuel burn and CO2 emissions by up to 30% compared to today&#39;s most advanced regional turboprop aircraft.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&#34;Hybrid-electric propulsion technology offers significant potential to optimise efficiency across a range of different aircraft applications, helping our industry meet its ambitious goal for achieving net zero CO2 emissions,&#34; said Jean Thomassin, executive director new products and services, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. &#34;With our ground test program now well underway, planned flight testing will enable us to accelerate the demonstration of this next generation sustainable propulsion technology as we continue to expand our collaboration within Canada&#39;s aerospace ecosystem and beyond.&#34;</span></span></span></p>
