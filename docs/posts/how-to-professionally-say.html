          <div><p>Butterflies are flying invertebrates from the order Lepidoptera meaning &#34;scaly wings&#34; in greek. They are often characterised by their large, vibrant wings, as well as clubbed antennae which they use to detect plants that are producing pollen. Only 57 native species and 2 long-distance migrants are in the UK - this is only a small fraction of the 17500 species in the world! Despite the lack of diversity, you can still expect to see a decent number of butterflies with interesting patterns and colours. Phenotypic variations evolved as a means to attract potential mates or as camouflage to reduce predation risk. Butterflies are also amazing pollinators! As they travel from flower to flower, they also pollinate them, allowing them to produce seed or fruit. Butterflies are therefore excellent indicators of healthy ecosystems. Their sensitivity to environmental conditions makes them vulnerable to climate change, and as such, their populations have declined in the past few decades.Â </p></div>
