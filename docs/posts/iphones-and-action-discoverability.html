<p>I spend a lot of my time thinking about UX and design, and I try to consciously
think about it in the wild when I can. One of the things that always catches my
eyes is the idea of discoverability, or how a user is able to discover that
action X does some thing Y.</p>
<p>A basic way to do so is to rely on patterns that we’re all familiar with. For example,
<a href="#it-doesn&#39;t-do-anything-but-still">this link is blue, and if you hover over it with your mouse, you can see the cursor change</a>.
That is a helpful context clue, since you’ve probably seen and interacted with
many links before, and because it has the same pattern, you can expect it to do the same
thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are things that are new to you but are still intuitive when you
first explore them, like using a touch screen for the first time. We touch
things all the time, and when you first used a good touch screen, you were
probably able to quickly understand how it worked. You moved your finger, the
page scrolled, and that feedback helped you to quickly solidify the connection
between your gestures and the screen’s actions. This is like discoverability
through action, where you’re able to figure it out as you try it.</p>
<p>I also think about the category of things that aren’t intuitive and require some
guidance, like Googling steps to show a cursor in an iOS screencast or putting
together IKEA furniture. Woe is the fool who tries to discover a complicated
IKEA piece through action! (Side note: there should be competitive IKEA furniture
speed runs). This discoverability is aided by a guide, and although the quality
of these guides can vary, sometimes it <em>is</em> helpful to first RTFM.</p>

<p>This brings us to a weird area: what about things that are unintuitive and
unguided? Or, as I like to say, how the hell was I supposed to know it would do
that?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’d like to present the following features for your consideration, with an
exaggerated pointer to show the interactive actions:</p>

<p>To delete the last digit from a number you entered in the iOS calculator, you
can <strong>swipe the numbers to delete</strong>.</p>
