            <h2>How iMessage Contact Key Verification works</h2>
            <div><p>When you use iMessage, your messages are end-to-end encrypted so that nobody other than you and the person you’re messaging – not even Apple – can read them while they’re in transit between devices. iMessage Contact Key Verification further protects your iMessage conversations and helps verify that you’re only messaging the people you intend to.<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>iMessage Contact Key Verification verifies that you’re messaging the person you intend to automatically. In iMessage conversations with people who have also turned on iMessage Contact Key Verification, you’ll receive an alert if there’s an error in this verification process. These alerts help ensure even a very sophisticated attacker can’t impersonate anyone in the conversation.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can verify contacts manually by comparing verification codes. When you verify a contact manually, iMessage Contact Key Verification will verify that the code you have saved matches the one provided by the iMessage servers for that contact, and will notify you if the verification code changes.</li>
</ul>

            <div><p>For additional assurance that you’re messaging the person you intend to, you can verify contacts manually. To verify manually, you’ll need to have that person saved in your Contacts.<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-device comparison – </strong>From Conversation Details, you can choose to verify a contact. Both you and that contact will generate a code at the same time to share and compare.</li>
<li><strong>Public Verification Code</strong> – You can share your Public Verification Code, so the people you’re messaging can verify you. Your Public Verification Code doesn’t contain any private information, so you can post it to social media or another account where the people you’re messaging can find and use it. You can also use other people’s Public Verification Codes to verify them.</li>

            <div><p>Both you and the person you’re messaging need to be connected to mobile data or Wi-Fi. You both need to follow the process to have the “Verify Contact” screen open on your devices at the same time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Messages, then tap the message thread.</li>
<li>Tap the contact’s name to view Conversation Details.</li>
<li>Scroll down and tap Verify Contact...</li>
<li>When the other person also taps Verify Contact, a code will appear.</li>
<li>Verify the code in person, via FaceTime or through another secure call.<ul>
<li>If the codes match, tap Mark as Verified to add the verification code to that person’s Contact Card.</li>
<li>If the codes don’t match, you may not be messaging the person you intend to. You may want to stop messaging until you can make sure you’re messaging the correct person.</li>
