One internal study cited 13.5 per cent of teen girls saying Instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse and 17 per cent of teen girls saying it makes eating disorders worse.</p><p>Following the first reports, a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press, published their own findings based on leaked documents from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/facebook-whistleblower-testifies-profit-safety-1.6199886">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, who has testified before U.S. Congress and a British parliamentary committee about what she found.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | Facebook whistleblower says governments need to rein in Big Tech:</strong></em> <span><span><div><div title="Former Facebook data scientist asks Congress to intervene in social media company’s actions" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div title="Former Facebook data scientist asks Congress to intervene in social media company’s actions"><div><p><img srcset="

Speaking before a Senate panel, Haugen outlined how Facebook knew its products and algorithms were steering users toward dangerous and toxic content, yet did nothing about it.</span></span></span></p><p>The use of social media among teens is nearly universal in the United States and many other parts of the world. Up to 95 per cent of youth from the ages of 13 to 17 in the U.S. report using a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use social media &#34;almost constantly,&#34; according to the Pew Research Center.</p><p>To comply with federal regulation, social media companies ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms — but children have been shown to easily get around the bans, both with and without their parents&#39; consent, and many younger kids have social media accounts.</p><h2>Loose enforcement</h2><p>Other measures that social platforms have taken to address concerns about children&#39;s mental health are also easily circumvented. For instance, TikTok recently introduced a default 60-minute time limit for users under 18. But once the limit is reached, minors can simply enter a passcode to keep watching.</p><p>In May, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy called on tech companies, parents and caregivers to take &#34;immediate action to protect kids now&#34; from the harms of social media.</p><p>The lawsuit seeks a variety of remedies, including substantial civil penalties.</p><p>Meta said that it had sought to make young people safe online.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,&#34; the company said in a statement.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
