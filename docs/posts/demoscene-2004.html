    <h1>Demoscene (2004)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>Welcome to demoscene.info, a webportal providing information on the demoscene.</p>
    <p>The demoscene is a worldwide non-commercial network of creative minds involved in the making of so called &#39;demos&#39;. Demos are computer generated music clips that show what kind of graphic and sound effects can really be done by using high-end computer hardware to its full potential.</p>
    <p>Demo-making is teamwork. As demos are rather complex any helping hand is welcome. Each scener provides the team with different skills. Graphicians and musicians create suitable pieces of art, the programmers fit all the parts together in an extensive amount of detail work to finally make it an executable program: the demo.</p>
    <p>The sceners don&#39;t necessarily have to physically meet each other at all during the whole process. Usually they meet in chatrooms and share their latest work over the internet. Most sceners live in Europe but you can find them almost everywhere in the world.</p>

    <p>This is the place to go to if you just want to find demos fast and easily. Without much hassle, you&#39;ll find recommendations for demos from experienced sceners behind these links.</p>

        <h3>Scene.org Awards</h3>
        <p>The scene.org awards are something like the Oscar to the demoscene: with this award the best releases from the previous year are honoured. On their site you can find the best of the best since 2002.

        <h3>Demoo</h3>
        <p>Their motto is &#39;a demo a day keeps the doctor away&#39;, that&#39;s why they list good demos and describe why they&#39;re recommended. Looking for a good demo to watch? The Calodox guys are there to invite you for a good one.
