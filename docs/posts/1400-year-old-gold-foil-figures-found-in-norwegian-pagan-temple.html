are tiny, about the size of a fingernail. They are flat and thin as paper,
often square, and stamped with a motif. Usually, they depict a man and a woman in
various types of clothing, jewellery, and hairstyles.</p><p>They are
from what we call the Merovingian period in Norway, which starts around 550 and
goes into the Viking Age. A time of turbulent climate and turbulent power
relations.</p><p>In previous
excavations, archaeologists have found 30 such gold foil figures here at Hov, connected
to what the archaeologists believe was once a temple where people worshiped and
made sacrifices to the gods.</p><p> The archaeologists had talked about how they should not be disappointed if they did not find more gold foil figures this time.</p><p>But then
something sparkled in the ground.</p>

</article><h2>A
religious offering?</h2><p>Archaeologists
have found five gold foil figures in the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Three of
them were found where the wall of the temple once
stood. Two of them were found in separate post holes.</p><p>Finding a gold
foil figure is spectacular and rare in itself. But the five gold foil figures that
were found at Hov this time offer something extra: They were found and
excavated where they were most likely originally placed. Knowing where something
was once placed helps archaeologists understand more.</p><p>“It’s extra
special that we can link the gold foil figures to the various parts of the
building&#39;s construction,” Stene says.</p><p>The many gold
foil figures found here earlier were discovered in and around another post hole
in the old temple, on the opposite side of the two that recently appeared.</p><p> It&#39;s possible that some of the gold foil figures they found here earlier were also placed in the wall, but there&#39;s uncertainty about exactly where they were once found. Now, with these three that we found under the actual structure of the wall, it&#39;s clear that they were intentionally placed there before the wall&#39;s construction,&#34; Stene says.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">One of the
theories about what the gold foil figures were used for is that they may have
served as a form of <span data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">admission ticket</span> to a temple like the one that once stood here at Hov. </p>
<p>But an admission ticket doesn’t lie under a wall.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Modern
excavation has provided more knowledge about this,” Stene says. “The gold foil
figures in the post hole were not visible to people. Those we found in the wall
would also not have been visible to others. So this doesn&#39;t appear to be an admission ticket, but rather an offering or a religious act to protect the building.&#34;</p><figure data-element-guid="58a219f5-cf93-409e-8b56-de3378926276">

<h2>A small,
but prominent pagan temple</h2><p>The temple at
Hov was discovered by pure chance in 1993. County conservator Harald Jacobsen drove
along the E6 and noticed the soil. He thought it looked like what
archaeologists call cultural layers, meaning soil where traces of humans are
found. A small investigation proved that he was right, and the finding of two gold
foil figures indicated that this was no ordinary place.</p>



<!-- placeholder(#1) -->


<p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">Smaller
excavations during the 2000s led to the discovery of 28 gold foil figures, and
what is referred to as a temple, a house for pagan religious practices.</p><p>One of the
reasons archaeologists believe this was a temple, besides the gold foil figures,
is the absence of other finds that would be natural if people lived there, like
cooking pots and whetstones. </p><p>A proper
excavation of the area had to wait until this year, in connection with the E6
Roterud-Storhove road project. Throughout the autumn and winter, C14 dating
will finally determine if it is true that the temple has stood here since
around the year 600 – and right up to the 11th century.</p><p>“Based on what we have interpreted as post holes, it&#39;s not unreasonable to think that a building has stood here that has looked the same for several hundred years. That&#39;s not a problem, as long as you maintain the building by
replacing the load-bearing posts as they rot,” Stene says. </p><p>With its
15–16 metres in length, the house is small. Residential homes of the time could
easily be 20-30 metres long.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Because it’s
relatively small, we believe the structure served a solely ritualistic function,” says
Stene. “It probably wasn&#39;t where they had their feasts. Those were likely held in a larger hall, but maybe they had drinking ceremonies here. Maybe it was just the select circle in society, the elite, who were allowed to enter.&#34;</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">The archaeologists also believe the building was fairly tall. </p><p>“It
probably stood out in the landscape. If you came to Mjøsa by boat, it was
probably clearly visible,” Stene says. </p><figure data-element-guid="de9f3460-1756-4414-a618-5c61db98a1ed">

</article><h2>Gold foil
figures in buildings</h2><p>Ingunn
Marit Røstad, archaeologist at the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, is an expert on the
Merovingian period in Norway and gold foil figures. She also believes there are
more gold foil figures out there.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“Bornholm
is very special, even in Denmark. There aren&#39;t that many other find sites
there,” Røstad points out.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">There are
also other regional differences: In Denmark, there are more individual
figures, whereas in Norway and Sweden, it is mostly couples that are
depicted. </p><p>“But more of these small pieces of gold keep appearing. Either through excavation or with metal detectors. So, more
could pop up in various places in Norway as well,” she says.</p><p>Due to the continuous new finds, the number of gold foil figures must be regularly updated. The latest numbers Røstad has from 2019 indicate that a total of 3,243 gold foil figures
have been found in Scandinavia – 2,708 of them on Bornholm.</p><p>Røstad also
points out that what’s especially unique about the new gold foil figures from
Hov is that they were found in the ground, where they lay. Archaeologists call
it context – the place where something is found is part of the story.</p><p>“Of all the
thousands of gold foil figures we have, only a few have been found on-site and
excavated,” Røstad says. “So, it’s extremely valuable that we get good context
for the finds from Hov.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">What stands
out when gold foil figures are actually excavated – as opposed to just being randomly
found in a field – is that archaeologists find them in association with
buildings.</p><figure data-element-guid="584a4b0f-0a19-41ae-b357-e844b875ddc5">

<h2>Pictures
of the elite</h2><p>Røstad does
not place much stock in the theory that the gold foil figures were admission tickets to the temple.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">They do not
have holes suggesting that they were sewn onto clothing, and apart from a few
exceptions from Bornholm, they do not have fastenings suggesting
they are jewellery.</p><p>They are
dated to the Merovingian period due to the style of clothing and jewellery depicted
on the men and women. </p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“People assume
that they’re showing the elite’s clothing during this period,” Røstad says. “A
sort of idealised depiction of elite clothing, featuring the elaborate hairstyle
that the women have with a distinctive knot. You also see beads, special types of brooches, drinking cups, and drinking horns, which date them to the Merovingian
period.”</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">A common
interpretation of the gold foil figures is that they have some sort of ritual
significance. Many believe that the couple depicted is the god Frøy and the goddess Gerd. Perhaps the gold foil figures were part of a symbolic act
when people celebrated weddings?</p><figure data-element-guid="53d29dd6-915a-47cf-b8db-a61d421a19e3">

<h2>Of divine
lineage?</h2><p>Another
interpretation deals with the idea that the most powerful families of this time
claimed they could trace their lineage back to the gods, and that the gold foil
figures in some way signaled that they were of divine lineage.</p><p data-lab-font_weight="font-weight-normal">“This was
used to legitimise ruling; you were a leading family because you were descended
from the gods,” Røstad says. “Even though they’re tiny, the gold foil figures could
have been very significant. Not as jewellery worn visibly to show status, but
perhaps they were part of some kind of ritual placement at the high seat
where the king or jarl sat.” </p><p>The first gold
foil figures were found in 1725. In a text from 1791, they were referred to as ‘gullgubber’
(golden old men), and the name just stuck. Even though the vast majority of them actually depict both a man and a woman.</p><p>———</p><p>Translated by Alette Bjordal Gjellesvik.</p><p><a href="https://forskning.no/arkeologi/gullskatt-funnet-utenfor-lillehammer-blir-ikke-stort-mer-spektakulaert-enn-dette/2252591">Read
