<p>Intel has updated the code it says allows the implementation of “software-defined silicon” (SDSi).</p>
<p>Chipzilla dropped some code for SDSi into the Linux Kernel in September 2021, describing it as tech that allows users to activate dormant features in silicon. The code outlined a process for enabling new features by verifying cryptographically signed licences.</p>
<p>A new <a target="_blank" href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2112.0/07851.html">post</a> to the Linux Kernel Mailing List from David E. Box, a Linux dev who works at Intel, explains version two of Intel’s SDSi code.</p>

    

<p>Box explained the update offers “changes to the current intel_pmt driver to give it broader support for Intel defined PCIe VSEC and DVSEC features. It moves the implementation from MFD to the auxiliary bus and creates a generic framework for enumerating the extended capabilities. It also adds support for a new VSEC, Software Defined Silicon (SDSi).”</p>

        


        <div>
            
        </div>

<p>VSEC stands for “Vendor-Specific Extended Capability,” in case you are wondering. And this <a target="_blank" href="https://composter.com.ua/documents/ECN_DVSEC-2015-08-04.pdf">PCI-SIGN Engineering Change Notice</a> (PDF) from 2015 states it “allows PCI Express component vendors to use the Extended Capability mechanism to expose vendor-specific registers.”</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> asked Intel about SDSi in the wake of Box’s first posts on the matter. Intel declined to offer details of its plans, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/19/intel_sdsi/">told</a> <i>The Register</i> SDSi might not have anything to do with an actual product and/or might never be used.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/16/intels_chip_flaw/">Intel&#39;s recent Atom, Celeron, Pentium chips can be lulled into a debug mode, potentially revealing system secrets</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/25/intel_controlflag/">Intel hopes to burn newly open-sourced AI debug tech into chips</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We were sceptical of that assertion because making the effort to add code to the Linux kernel without planning for it to be used is thoroughly counter-intuitive. It’s also the sort of thing that annoys key Linux maintainers: Greg Kroah-Hartman <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/21/minnesota_linux_kernel_flaws_update/">fumed</a> when researchers conducted an experiment by trying to add insecure code to the kernel and then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/21/linux_5_13_patches/">testily pointed out</a> that 80 developers worked to clean up the resulting mess.</p>
<p>Intel knows better than to provoke that sort of ire. And now that it’s bothered to refine its SDSi efforts, the non-explanation for its kernel contributions is even flimsier than before.</p>

        

<p>We’ve therefore asked Intel to again explain its SDSi ambitions. If we receive a meaningful response, we’ll let you know. ®</p>

<p><span data-label="register debate">Register Debate</span> <i>Welcome to the latest Register Debate in which writers discuss technology topics, and you the reader choose the winning argument. The format is simple: we propose a motion, the arguments for the motion will run this Monday and Wednesday, and the arguments against on Tuesday and Thursday. During the week you can cast your vote on which side you support using the poll embedded below, choosing whether you&#39;re in favour or against the motion. The final score will be announced on Friday, revealing whether the for or against argument was most popular.</i></p><p>
  <i>This week&#39;s motion is: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/Debates/2021/12/06/software_environment/"><b>A unified, agnostic software environment can be achieved</b></a>. We debate the question: can the industry ever have a truly open, unified, agnostic software environment in HPC and AI that can span multiple kinds of compute engines?</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Arguing today <b>FOR</b> the motion is Rob Farber, a global technology consultant and author with an extensive background in HPC and in developing machine-learning technology that he applies at national laboratories and commercial organizations. Rob can be reached at <a href="mailto:info@techenablement.com">info@techenablement.com</a>.</i>

<p>Maybe someday – maybe – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/27/security_architecture/">Zero Trust</a> will solve many of our network security problems. But for now, if you want to make sure you don&#39;t have an eavesdropper on your network, you need a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p><p>There&#39;s only one little problem with commercial VPNs: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/17/ufo_vpn_database/">many of them are untrustworthy</a>. So, what can you do? Well, run your own of course is the open-source answer. And, today, your VPN of choice is Linux&#39;s built-in VPN: WireGuard.</p><p>Why WireGuard rather than OpenVPN or IKEv2? Because it&#39;s simpler to implement while maintaining security and delivering faster speeds. And, when it comes to VPNs, it&#39;s all about balancing speed and security.</p>                    </div>
