<p><span data-label="update">Update</span> Intel has updated the code it says allows the implementation of “software-defined silicon” (SDSi).</p>
<p>Chipzilla dropped some code for SDSi into the Linux Kernel in September 2021, describing it as tech that allows users to activate dormant features in silicon. The code outlined a process for enabling new features by verifying cryptographically signed licences.</p>
<p>A new <a target="_blank" href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2112.0/07851.html">post</a> to the Linux Kernel Mailing List from David E. Box, a Linux dev who works at Intel, explains version two of Intel’s SDSi code.</p>

    

<p>Box explained the update offers “changes to the current intel_pmt driver to give it broader support for Intel defined PCIe VSEC and DVSEC features. It moves the implementation from MFD to the auxiliary bus and creates a generic framework for enumerating the extended capabilities. It also adds support for a new VSEC, Software Defined Silicon (SDSi).”</p>

        


        

<p>VSEC stands for “Vendor-Specific Extended Capability,” in case you are wondering. And this <a target="_blank" href="https://composter.com.ua/documents/ECN_DVSEC-2015-08-04.pdf">PCI-SIG Engineering Change Notice</a> (PDF) from 2015 states it “allows PCI Express component vendors to use the Extended Capability mechanism to expose vendor-specific registers.”</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> asked Intel about SDSi in the wake of Box’s first posts on the matter. Intel declined to offer details of its plans, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/19/intel_sdsi/">told</a> <i>The Register</i> SDSi might not have anything to do with an actual product and/or might never be used.</p>

</ul>
<p>We were sceptical of that assertion because making the effort to add code to the Linux kernel without planning for it to be used is thoroughly counter-intuitive. It’s also the sort of thing that annoys key Linux maintainers: Greg Kroah-Hartman <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/21/minnesota_linux_kernel_flaws_update/">fumed</a> when researchers conducted an experiment by trying to add insecure code to the kernel and then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/21/linux_5_13_patches/">testily pointed out</a> that 80 developers worked to clean up the resulting mess.</p>
<p>Intel knows better than to provoke that sort of ire. And now that it’s bothered to refine its SDSi efforts, the non-explanation for its kernel contributions is even flimsier than before.</p>

        

<p>We’ve therefore asked Intel to again explain its SDSi ambitions. If we receive a meaningful response, we’ll let you know. ®</p>

<p>Apple will not be required to implement third-party in-app payments systems for its App Store by 9 December, after a federal appeals court temporarily suspended the initial ruling on Wednesday.</p><p>As part of its ongoing legal spat with Epic, a judge from the Northern District Court of California said Apple wasn’t a monopoly, but agreed it’s ability to swipe up to a 30 per cent fee in sales processed in iOS apps was uncompetitive. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered an injunction, giving the iGiant 90 days to let developers add links or buttons in their apps to direct users to third-party purchasing systems.</p><p>Those 90 days were set to end on 9 December. If developers were allowed to process financial transactions using external systems they wouldn’t have to hand over their profits to Apple, they argued. When Apple tried to file for a motion to stay, which would pause the injunction until it filed an appeal, Rogers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/11/apple_epic_payments/">denied</a> its request.</p>                    </div>

<p>The new 5G C-band wireless broadband service expected to rollout on 5 January 2022 in the US will disrupt local radio signals and make it difficult for airplanes to land safely in harsh weather conditions, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p><p>Pilots rely on radio altimeter readings to figure out when and where an aircraft should carry out a series of operations to prepare for touchdown. But the upcoming 5G C-band service beaming from cell towers threatens to interfere with these signals, the FAA warned in two reports.</p><p>Flights may have to be delayed or restricted at certain airports as the new broadband service comes into effect next year. The change could affect some 6,834 airplanes and 1,828 helicopters. The cost to operators is expected to be $580,890.</p>                    </div>
