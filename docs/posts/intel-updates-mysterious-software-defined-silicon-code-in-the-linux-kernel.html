    <h1>Intel updates mysterious ‘software-defined silicon’ code in the Linux kernel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span data-label="update">Update</span> Intel has updated the code it says allows the implementation of “software-defined silicon” (SDSi).</p>
<p>Chipzilla dropped some code for SDSi into the Linux Kernel in September 2021, describing it as tech that allows users to activate dormant features in silicon. The code outlined a process for enabling new features by verifying cryptographically signed licences.</p>
<p>A new <a target="_blank" href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2112.0/07851.html">post</a> to the Linux Kernel Mailing List from David E. Box, a Linux dev who works at Intel, explains version two of Intel’s SDSi code.</p>

    

<p>Box explained the update offers “changes to the current intel_pmt driver to give it broader support for Intel defined PCIe VSEC and DVSEC features. It moves the implementation from MFD to the auxiliary bus and creates a generic framework for enumerating the extended capabilities. It also adds support for a new VSEC, Software Defined Silicon (SDSi).”</p>

        


        

<p>VSEC stands for “Vendor-Specific Extended Capability,” in case you are wondering. And this <a target="_blank" href="https://composter.com.ua/documents/ECN_DVSEC-2015-08-04.pdf">PCI-SIG Engineering Change Notice</a> (PDF) from 2015 states it “allows PCI Express component vendors to use the Extended Capability mechanism to expose vendor-specific registers.”</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> asked Intel about SDSi in the wake of Box’s first posts on the matter. Intel declined to offer details of its plans, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/19/intel_sdsi/">told</a> <i>The Register</i> SDSi might not have anything to do with an actual product and/or might never be used.</p>

</ul>
<p>We were sceptical of that assertion because making the effort to add code to the Linux kernel without planning for it to be used is thoroughly counter-intuitive. It’s also the sort of thing that annoys key Linux maintainers: Greg Kroah-Hartman <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/21/minnesota_linux_kernel_flaws_update/">fumed</a> when researchers conducted an experiment by trying to add insecure code to the kernel and then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/21/linux_5_13_patches/">testily pointed out</a> that 80 developers worked to clean up the resulting mess.</p>
<p>Intel knows better than to provoke that sort of ire. And now that it’s bothered to refine its SDSi efforts, the non-explanation for its kernel contributions is even flimsier than before.</p>

        

<p>We’ve therefore asked Intel to again explain its SDSi ambitions. If we receive a meaningful response, we’ll let you know. ®</p>
<h3>UPDATE, 23:15 UTC, December 8th</h3>
<p>&#34;Intel has advised they have nothing further to add at this point&#34;, reads a statement Intel has sent to <i>The Register</i>.</p>
