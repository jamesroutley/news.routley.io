    <h1>Intel updates mysterious ‘software-defined silicon’ code in the Linux kernel</h1>

                <div id="body">
<p>Intel has updated the code it says allows the implementation of “software-defined silicon” (SDSi).</p>
<p>Chipzilla dropped some code for SDSi into the Linux Kernel in September 2021, describing it as tech that allows users to activate dormant features in silicon. The code outlined a process for enabling new features by verifying cryptographically signed licences.</p>
<p>A new <a target="_blank" href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2112.0/07851.html">post</a> to the Linux Kernel Mailing List from David E. Box, a Linux dev who works at Intel, explains version two of Intel’s SDSi code.</p>

    

<p>Box explained the update offers “changes to the current intel_pmt driver to give it broader support for Intel defined PCIe VSEC and DVSEC features. It moves the implementation from MFD to the auxiliary bus and creates a generic framework for enumerating the extended capabilities. It also adds support for a new VSEC, Software Defined Silicon (SDSi).”</p>

        


        

<p>VSEC stands for “Vendor-Specific Extended Capability,” in case you are wondering. And this <a target="_blank" href="https://composter.com.ua/documents/ECN_DVSEC-2015-08-04.pdf">PCI-SIGN Engineering Change Notice</a> (PDF) from 2015 states it “allows PCI Express component vendors to use the Extended Capability mechanism to expose vendor-specific registers.”</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> asked Intel about SDSi in the wake of Box’s first posts on the matter. Intel declined to offer details of its plans, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/19/intel_sdsi/">told</a> <i>The Register</i> SDSi might not have anything to do with an actual product and/or might never be used.</p>

</ul>
<p>We were sceptical of that assertion because making the effort to add code to the Linux kernel without planning for it to be used is thoroughly counter-intuitive. It’s also the sort of thing that annoys key Linux maintainers: Greg Kroah-Hartman <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/21/minnesota_linux_kernel_flaws_update/">fumed</a> when researchers conducted an experiment by trying to add insecure code to the kernel and then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/21/linux_5_13_patches/">testily pointed out</a> that 80 developers worked to clean up the resulting mess.</p>
<p>Intel knows better than to provoke that sort of ire. And now that it’s bothered to refine its SDSi efforts, the non-explanation for its kernel contributions is even flimsier than before.</p>

        

<p>We’ve therefore asked Intel to again explain its SDSi ambitions. If we receive a meaningful response, we’ll let you know. ®</p>

Wants Google, Meta, Netflix and locals to work harder on uptime, warn locals of outages in Korean                            </p>

<p>South Korea&#39;s Ministry of Science and ICT has offered Big Tech some advice on how to make their services suitably resilient, and added an obligation to notify users – in Korean - when they fail.</p><p>The guidelines apply to Google, Meta (parent company of Facebook), Netflix, Naver, Kakao and Wavve. All have been told to improve their response to faults by beefing up preemptive error detection and verification systems, and create back up storage systems that enable quick content recovery.</p><p>The guidelines offer methods Big Tech can use to measure user loads, then plan accordingly to ensure their services remain available. Uptime requirements are not spelled out.</p>                    </div>

                            <p>
Certifies hardware with malware-crimping spec, already common in PCs, for Azure Stack and Windows Server                            </p>

<p>Microsoft has extended the Secured-core concept it applied to PCs in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/10/22/microsoft_securecore_pcs/">2019</a> to servers, and to Windows Server and Azure Stack HCI.</p><p>Secured-core sees Microsoft work with hardware manufacturers to ensure that their products include TPM 2.0 modules, ship with Secure Boot enabled by default in BIOS, and use the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement tech that allows use of Intel&#39;s Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and AMD&#39;s Secure Virtual Machine (SVM).</p><p>Once those elements are in place, Microsoft is confident hardware is harder to compromise with firmware-based attacks, and is less susceptible to running unverified code.</p>                    </div>
