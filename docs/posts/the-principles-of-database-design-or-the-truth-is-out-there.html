  </h2><p>Every software project needs to represent the reality of the business he
is embedded in. The way we can represent reality as limited rational
beings is through propositions, i.e, declarative statements that affirm
or deny something about reality. When a collection of such propositions
is stored in a computer system, we call it a database.</p>
<p>Such database needs to be designed to properly reflect reality. This
can’t be automated, since the semantics of the situation need to be
encoded in a way that can be processed by a computer. Such then is the
goal of database design: to encode propositions in such a way that can
properly be processed by a database management system (DBMS).</p>
<p>At this point, a regular software developer comes to a stall. Since
there is scarcely any formal training in database design (or formal
logic) in his education, he tends to fall back haphazardly on ad-hoc
methods, with severe consequences (update anomalies and data
inconsitencies with huge potential downsides).</p>
<p>If you are such developer, you <strong>need</strong> to understand the underlying
principles of database design. Think about it, if you don’t have
principles of design, you are not doing engineering, are you?</p>
<p>Here is a list of design principles to follow for formal database
design(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">McGoveran 2012</a>, <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">2015</a>)(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Pascal 2016</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Principle of Orthogonal Design (POOD): Base relations are independent;</li>
<li>Principle of Representational Parsimony (PORP): There are no
superfluous base relations;</li>
<li>Principle of Expressive Completeness (POEC): All meaningful relations
are derivable from the base relations.</li>
<li>Principle of Full Normalization (POFN) : Every base relation should be
in its highest normal form (3, 5 or 6th normal form).​ Thus eliminating
redundancy and preventing anomalies by ensuring that each relation is
free from undesirable characteristics like partial, transitive, or
join dependencies.</li>
<li>The Information Principle (TIP) : All information in the database is
represented explicitly and in exactly one way — by attribute values
drawn from domains in relations.</li>
<li>Principle of Logical Independence (PLI) : Application programs and
terminal activities remain logically unimpaired when information
preserving changes of any kind that theoretically permit unimpairment
are made to the base relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>To these I’d like to introduce a new principle, an innovation I hope to
develop in future work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principle of Essential Denotation (PED): A relation should be
identified by a natural key that reflects the entity’s essential,
domain-defined identity — not by arbitrary or surrogate values.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following pseudo-SQL shows the contrast between improper and proper denotation:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>  </span><span>-- usage of surrogate keys
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>  </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>citizen</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>id</span><span> </span><span>uuid</span><span> </span><span>primary</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>full_name</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><span>Code Snippet 1:</span>
  Illustration of not using PED with SQL
</p>
<p>This usage has some problems, the worst of it is the disconnection
between database structure and domain semantics. Here is a rework that
preserves such connection:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>  </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>domain</span><span> </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>(...);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>  </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>citizen</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>primary</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>full_name</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><span>Code Snippet 2:</span>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Databases are representations of reality, and as such, they are
foundational to any serious information system. Poor design leads to
semantic confusion and technical instability—with consequences that can
be costly and far-reaching. Good design demands rigor, discipline, and a
firm grasp of foundational principles.</p>
<p>To put it simply: if you’re in the business of information, you need to
know how to build structures that tell the truth that is out there.</p>
