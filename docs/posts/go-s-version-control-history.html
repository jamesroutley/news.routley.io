Obviously something silly is going on, and people usually stop there.
But Go’s actual version control history is richer and more interesting.
For example, there are a few more fake commits and then the fifth
commit is the first real one:
</p><pre>commit 18c5b488a3b2e218c0e0cf2a7d4820d9da93a554

<p>
Why does that commit have a different trailer than the three fake commits?
<a href="#subversion"></a></p><h2 id="subversion"><a href="#subversion">Subversion</a></h2>


<p>
Go started out using Subversion, as part of a small experiment to evaluate
Subversion for wider use inside Google. The experiment did not result
in wider Subversion use, but the <code>SVN=111041</code> tag in the
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/18c5b488a3b2e218c0e0cf2a7d4820d9da93a554">first real commit above</a>
records that on the original Subversion server, that Go commit
was revision 111,041. (Subversion assigns revision numbers in increasing order,
and the server was a small monorepo being used for a few other projects besides Go.
There were not 111,040 other Go commits that didn’t make it out.)

<p>
This was the first commit after Go moved from a lightly-used
Subversion server to a lightly-used Perforce server.
Google was a <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/39983.pdf">very heavy Perforce user</a>
due to its use of a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2854146">single giant monorepo for most code</a>.
Go was not part of that monorepo world, and at the time,
projects that didn’t have to be on the heavily-loaded main server
were hosted instead on secondary ones.

</p><p>
At the transition to Perforce, you can see the introduction of telltale
<code>DELTA=</code>, <code>OCL=</code>, and <code>CL=</code> tags.
Perforce imposes a linear ordering on change lists, like Subversion revisions,
but each change list ends up with two sequence numbers: it is assigned
one when it is created and uses that number while it is a local, pending change list,
including in our code review systems.
Then, when it is submitted and becomes part of the official history,
it is assigned a new number, to keep submitted changes in order.
The <code>OCL=</code> is the original change list number, while the <code>CL=</code> is the final one.
The <code>R=</code> line means that <code>gri</code> (Robert Griesemer) reviewed the change before
it was submitted,
using our internal code review system, then called Mondrian.
Because the server was so lightly used (and presumably the review so quick),
no new change lists had been
created or submitted while this one was pending, and its final submission
reused its original number instead of needing to create a new one.

</p><p>
Many other changes have the same <code>OCL=</code> and <code>CL=</code> because they were
created and submitted in a single Perforce command, without review,
like <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/c1f5eda7a2465dae196d1fa10baf6bfa9253808a">the next one</a>:

<p>
You can also see from this that the <code>DELTA=</code> line is added
by the code review system, not Perforce:
this unreviewed change doesn’t have it.
(The last two lines are being provided by the <code>git log --stat</code>
command as we explore the Git version of these changes.)

</p><p>
The bulk of the pre-open-source development of Go was done
on that Perforce server.

<p>
That commit introduces yet another kind of trailer line,
which says <code>http://go/go-review/1013012</code>.
At one point that link pointed, inside Google,
to an internal version of the Rietveld App Engine app,
which we used for code review on the way to submission
to a private Mercurial repo on Google Code Project Hosting.
We were doing that conversion, in October 2009, as part
of the preparation to open-source Go in November.

</p><p>
It was at this point, during the conversion to Mercurial,
that I introduced the “hello, world” commits.
The Subversion and Perforce repos had been Google-internal servers,
and we had stored essentially all the Go code in the world
alongside the Go implementation.
We each had “user directories” like <code>/usr/rsc</code> in the repo.
Those directories contained various code that wasn’t going
out in the release, whether because it was targeting Google-internal
technologies or because it was simply not worth publishing.
(You can still see references to <code>/usr</code> in a few commit messages
that did make it out.)

</p><p>
For the conversion, I ended up with a directory full of patches,
one per commit, and a script to run the patches to create a new
Mercurial repository.
Then I edited the patches (with automated help) to remove the files that weren’t
being released, including the entire <code>/usr</code> tree,
and to add the new open-source copyright notices to every file.

</p><p>
This took me about a week, and it was annoyingly difficult.
If I removed a file from some patches but then it got renamed
in others, Mercurial would complain about the rename using
a file that hadn’t been created in the first place.
And if I added a copyright notice when the file was created,
I had to be careful to update later patches to not have
merge conflicts when changing the top of the file.
And so on. I remember thinking that it was like being
a con man who constructs an elaborate false identity
and struggles to keep it all straight.
<a href="#hello_world"></a></p><h2 id="hello_world"><a href="#hello_world">Hello, world</a></h2>


<p>
A month earlier, I had created object file parsing packages
like <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/debug/macho">debug/macho</a>,
and as test data for each of those packages I <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/bf69025825fd2b8e7aac01f27d5c974bd30af542">checked in an object
file</a> compiled from a trivial “hello, world” program, along with the
source code for them:

<p>
This was the original commit that introduced <code>src/pkg/debug/macho/testdata/hello.c</code>, of course.
As I added copyright notices to files, it seemed wrong to
add a copyright notice to that <code>hello.c</code> file.
Instead, since I had the repo split into this patch-file-per-commit form,
it was easy to create a few fake commits that showed at least part of
the real history of that program, as an Easter egg for people who looked that closely:

<p>
The <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/7d7c6a97f815e9279d08cfaea7d5efb5e90695a8">July 1972 commit</a> shows the very first “hello, world” program,
copied from Brian Kernighan’s
“<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/btut.html">A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B</a>”:
</p><pre>main( ) {
 extrn a, b, c;
 putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar(’!*n’);
}

a ’hell’;
b ’o, w’;
c ’orld’;
</pre>


<p>
Various online sources refer to this as a “book”, but it definitely was not.
It was a printed, 17-page document that was later included as half of January 1973’s
“<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bintro.html">Bell Laboratories Computing Science Technical Report #8: The Programming Language B</a>”
(still not even close to a book!).
The “hello, world” program appears in section 7,
preceded by the less catchy “hi!” program in section 6.
As I write this blog post in 2022, I cannot find any online
reference for the B tutorial being originally dated July 1972,
but I believe I must have had a good reason.

</p><p>
The <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/0bb0b61d6a85b2a1a33dcbc418089656f2754d32">January 1974 commit</a>
converts the program to C, as found in Kernighan’s “<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/ctut.pdf">Programming in C — A Tutorial</a>”.
The linked PDF is a retyped copy from Dennis Ritchie, without a date,
but Ritchie’s “<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cman74.pdf">C Reference Manual</a>” technical memo
dated January 15, 1974 cites Kernighan’s tutorial as “Unpublished internal memorandum, Bell Laboratories, 1974”,
implying that the tutorial must have been written in January as well. That C program was shorter than
what we are used to today, but much nicer than the B program:
</p><pre>main( ) {
	printf(&#34;hello, world&#34;);
}
</pre>


<p>
I skipped over the presentation in the first edition of <i>The C Programming Language</i>, which looks like:
</p><pre>main() {
	printf(&#34;hello, world\n&#34;);
}
</pre>


<p>
The <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/0744ac969119db8a0ad3253951d375eb77cfce9e">April 1988 commit</a>
shows the program from the “Draft-Proposed ANSI C” version of the second edition of <i>The C Programming Language</i>:
</p><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main()
{
	printf(&#34;hello, world\n&#34;);
}
</pre>


<p>
The <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/d82b11e4a46307f1f1415024f33263e819c222b8">second April 1988 commit</a>
shows the final full ANSI C version we know today:
</p><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main(void)
{
	printf(&#34;hello, world\n&#34;);
	return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>
Wikipedia says the second edition was published in April 1988.
I didn’t have a day, but April 1 seemed appropriate.
I didn’t have a time for either one of these, so I used 02:03:04 for
the second commit and therefore 02:02:04 for the first.

</p><p>
The email addresses in the commits are also period-appropriate,
although Mondrian’s <code>R=</code> and <code>DELTA=</code> tags clearly are not:
there was no code review happening back then!

</p><p>
For what it’s worth, I’ve since heard from many people about
how the 1972 dates have broken various presentations and
analyses they’ve done on the Go repository as compared to
other projects. Oops! My apologies.
(I also heard from someone who was analyzing Mercurial
repos for “branchiness” and decided to use the Go
repo as a large test case.
Their program said it had branchiness 0 and they
spent a while debugging their program before
realizing that the repo really was completely linear,
thanks to our “rebase and merge” policy.)
<a href="#public_mercurial"></a></p><h2 id="public_mercurial"><a href="#public_mercurial">Public Mercurial</a></h2>


<p>
We published the Google Code Mercurial repo on November 10, 2009,
and to mark the occasion we added one more Easter egg.
A footnote in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike’s 1984 book <i>The Unix Programming Environment</i>
says:</p><blockquote>

<p>
Ken Thompson was once asked what he would do differently
if he were redesigning the <small>UNIX</small> system.
His reply: “I’d spell <code>creat</code> with an <code>e</code>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>
This refers to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">creat(2) system call</a>
and the <code>O_CREAT</code> file open flag.

</p><p>
Immediately once the release was public,
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/c90d392ce3d3203e0c32b3f98d1e68c4c2b4c49b">Ken mailed me a change</a> fixing this mistake:

<p>
Sadly, we didn’t execute the joke perfectly, in that the code review went to
our internal Rietveld server instead of the public one.
So the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/44fb865a484b8e12adfa0a1413eacc807cec085b">very next commit</a>
updated the code review server in our configuration.

</p><p>
But here, for posterity, is the review, preserved in my email:

</p><p>
<img name="creat" width="776" height="1008" src="https://research.swtch.com/creat.png" srcset="creat.png 1x, creat@2x.png 2x"/>
<a href="#git"></a></p><h2 id="git"><a href="#git">Git</a></h2>


<p>
So things stood from November 2009 until late 2014,
when we knew that Google Code Project Hosting was
going to shut down and we needed a new home.
After investigating a few options, we ended up using
<a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit Code Review</a>, which has been a fantastic choice.
Many people think of Go as being hosted on GitHub,
but GitHub is only primary for our issue tracker:
the official primary copy of the sources is on <code>go.googlesource.com</code>.

</p><p>
You can see the transition from Mercurial to Git
in the logs when the <code>R=</code> lines end, followed by
a few completely unreviewed commits, and then
<code>Reviewed-by:</code> lines begin:

<p>
As part of the conversion from Mercurial to Git, we did
not add visible lines to the commit bodies showing the
old Mercurial hashes, but we did record them in the
underlying Git commit objects. For example:
</p><pre>% git cat-file -p 7d7c6a97f815e9279d08cfaea7d5efb5e90695a8
tree e06bd601885e16ad3d72c2a8c9b411889b2e478e

<p>
The <code>golang-hg</code> line records the original Mercurial commit hash.

</p><p>
And that’s the end of the story, until we move to a fifth
version control system at some point in the future.
