        <p>One of the vital tasks when operating any aircraft, large or small, is ensuring that the aircraft is loaded to no more than its permissible weight and that the centre of gravity (CG) position is within the permissible limits. Failure to ensure that these two parameters are observed can have serious detrimental consequences for the aircraft&#39;s performance, handling and even structural safety. Indeed, many aircraft have come to grief over the years through mis-loading.</p>
        <p>Performing the necessary calculations is fairly simple with smaller aircraft, but the larger the aircraft the more complex the possible loading permutations become, and the more complex become the weight and balance calculations. This can be both time consuming and error prone. This was the problem confronting the operators of the new generation of large, all-metal airliners entering service in the late 1930s.</p>
        <p>One solution was provided by Librascope Inc. of Burbank, California, USA in the form of a mechanical weight and balance computer. The example on this page, from the CAHS collection, was originally used by Guinea Airways for their Lockheed 14s. The pilot dials in the weight of fuel, oil, passengers and ballast at each loading station and the two upper windows show the total loaded weight and the CG position. This can easily be checked with the retractable landing gear in both retracted and extended position (since the gear retracts rearward, it changes the CG position as it does so). </p>
        <p> Being the size of a small briefcase, the Librascope is very portable. It is also quite robust and reliable.</p>
