    <h1>the frog</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>i went to kauai with my parents last summer. we walked across some trail that left me covered in mud, and near the entrance to the trail we saw a frog lying on its back, feebly twitching. i figured it would die. i left it there.</p>

<p>i walk a lot faster than my parents and ended up the first back about 2 hours later.</p>

<p>the frog twitched.</p>

<p>i don’t know what seized me, but suddenly i was running towards it. i grabbed it, took off at a full sprint, and dropped it into the nearby river.</p>

<p>i’m not vegetarian, but in that moment i just wanted it to live.</p>

<p>“thank you for saving it”. an old woman called to me across the bridge. she bowed and put her palms together.</p>

<p>“i don’t know why i did it. i feel like a hypocrite, i’ve killed so many others.”</p>

<p>she just smiled.</p>

<p>“i think you will save many more. may you be free of suffering.”</p>

<p>something about the way she said it. she saw me and <em>forgave</em> my past cruelties.
i burst into tears, and for once didn’t try to hide it or control it. i just let
it wash over me. i let the past fall away like a hot rock i’d been holding.</p>

<p>i didn’t become vegetarian after that, but my meat consumption went down a great
deal, and continues to.</p>
