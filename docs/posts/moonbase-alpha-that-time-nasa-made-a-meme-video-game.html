            <p>NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, has tried <em>many</em> different ways to encourage public interest in science education and space exploration. That included a brief pivot to video game publishing, of all things.</p><p>In 2009, NASA teamed up with multiple video game studios to create a space-themed MMO. The result was a moon base simulator game that became a meme: Moonbase Alpha.</p><h2 id="to-the-moon">To the Moon</h2><p><a href="https://virtualheroes.com/">Virtual Heroes</a> was founded in 2004 as a game studio focused on training simulators and other non-entertainment &#34;serious games.&#34; Its first major client was the United States Army, which tasked the company with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410195930/https://www.virtualheroes.com/portfolio/military/america-s-army/">working on updates</a> for &#34;America&#39;s Army,&#34; the 2002 first-person shooter. That game was the first major use of video games as a recruitment tool for the United States military, which somehow <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/americas-army-shut-down">remained online until 2022</a>.</p><p>Virtual Heroes was <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2009/04/13/daily61.html">acquired by Applied Research Associates</a> in 2009, a research and development firm working on everything from <a href="https://www.ara.com/e-sim/">building evacuation simulators</a> to <a href="https://www.ara.com/non-kinetic-directed-energy-weapons/">advanced directed energy weapons</a>. The company&#39;s presence in the military-industrial complex, combined with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205135614/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-10-30-serious-skills_x.htm">2006 concept for a multiplayer virtual astronaut game</a>, helped gain the attention of a certain federal space agency.</p><p>In 2009, NASA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nasa-secures-partners-for-mmo-project">announced</a> plans for a massively multiplayer online game, called &#34;Astronaut: Moon, Mars, and Beyond.&#34; The game was pitched as a learning tool that would recreate spacecraft, technology, and robotics based on NASA prototypes, built on top of Unreal Engine 3. Three studios were tasked with development: Virtual Heroes, Canada-based <a href="https://go.projectwhitecard.com/">Project Whitecard</a>, and Information in Place (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WisdomTools_Enterprises">WisdomTools</a>).</p><p>Daniel Laughlin, project manager at NASA Learning Technologies, told <em>Yahoo Games</em>, &#34;We want to create a fun, compelling gaming experience that will give players the chance to learn about science and engineering careers while they play the game.&#34; It was set for a 2010 release, with a demo to arrive before the end of 2009. That demo eventually became Moonbase Alpha.</p><h2 id="moonbase-alpha">Moonbase Alpha</h2><p>Moonbase Alpha was finally released in July 2010 as &#34;a realistic multiplayer game that will allow players to experience a hypothetical day in the life of a lunar astronaut.&#34; It was developed entirely by Army Game Studio, the primary creator of America&#39;s Army, and Virtual Heroes. NASA said it was &#34;meant as a precursor&#34; to the in-development MMO.</p><p>The game is set in a fictional lunar outpost in the year 2032, where players are tasked with repairing critical systems after a meteor strike. You have 25 minutes to repair the life support systems with various tools and robots at your disposal. It was partially based on designs for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program">Constellation program</a>, NASA&#39;s crewed spaceflight plans for future Moon and Mars missions. Constellation was fully cancelled later that year with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Authorization_Act_of_2010">NASA Authorization Act of 2010</a>, but some parts of Constellation eventually became the Space Launch System that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System">completed its first launch in 2022</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/05/ss_a3f8427dd5afb1a7dc22dbee50a44e613f1b0ac0.1920x1080.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an astronaut standing near a lunar habitat module, with landers in the background on the gray, cratered moon surface." loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/ss_a3f8427dd5afb1a7dc22dbee50a44e613f1b0ac0.1920x1080.jpg 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/ss_a3f8427dd5afb1a7dc22dbee50a44e613f1b0ac0.1920x1080.jpg 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/05/ss_a3f8427dd5afb1a7dc22dbee50a44e613f1b0ac0.1920x1080.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/39000/Moonbase_Alpha/" rel="noreferrer"><span>NASA/Steam</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Moonbase Alpha didn&#39;t receive much attention from the mainstream gaming media, at least at first, and initial reviews were mixed. <em>GamePlanet</em> said in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181116000755/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/games/162879.Moonbase-Alpha/reviews/135241.Moonbase-Alpha/">its review</a>, &#34;it&#39;s a pretty tech demo with a couple of hours of enjoyment attached. We&#39;re not complaining though, it&#39;s free after all.&#34; In the context of the Constellation program&#39;s imminent collapse, <em>Popular Mechanics</em> <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/gaming/a6398/why-nasas-new-video-game-completely-misses-the-point/">said</a> &#34;the astronaut simulation game is a lost cause,&#34; and Moonbase Alpha was &#34;excruciatingly boring.&#34;</p><p>Moonbase Alpha achieved over 100K downloads in the first two weeks, <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/42478/nasa_army_collaboration_takes_gamers_to_moon">according to Army Game Studio</a>, and it passed 300K downloads <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2011/cg_4.html">after eight months</a>. SteamDB tracked an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/39000/charts/#max">all-time peak of 1,443 simultaneous players</a> in July 2010, which is in fact <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">better than Concord</a>.</p><h2 id="moon-maestro">Moon maestro</h2><p>In the multiplayer mode, Moonbase Alpha required coordinating with other players to repair the lunar base, either with voice or text chat. The latter functionality was powered by a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECtalk">DECtalk</a>, the speech synthesis software originally released in 1984. DECtalk is probably most recognizable as Stephen Hawking&#39;s voice—he used a CallText 5010 unit with the <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/82887">Perfect Paul</a> voice for nearly 30 years, which was replaced by a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/The-Silicon-Valley-quest-to-preserve-Stephen-12759775.php">reverse-engineered and emulated</a> version near the end of his life.</p><p>The speech synthesis was <em>usually</em> more entertaining than the actual game, just like playing with Microsoft Sam on Windows and MacinTalk (later PlainTalk) on Mac. The viral video &#39;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo">Moonbase Alpha provides a realistic simulation of life on a natural satellite</a>&#39; showed off some of the most popular spam phrases, like &#34;aeiou&#34; pronounced as &#34;ayy-you,&#34; and &#34;John Madden.&#34;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hv6RbEOlqRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Moonbase Alpha provides a realistic simulation of life on a natural satellite"></iframe></figure><p>Importantly, the developers of Moonbase Alpha didn&#39;t turn off DECtalk&#39;s pitch and duration controls. This allowed players to send <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482628855">specially-crafted commands</a> to sing songs by pasting commands into the game chat. As an example, this is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRic84u4aPs">1966 Batman TV show theme</a> as a Moonbase Alpha song, with the &#34;na-na&#34; parts spelled out as &#34;nae nae&#34; and the final &#34;Batman&#34; as &#34;bae-ttmae-nn&#34;:</p><p><strong>[nae&lt;99,20&gt;nae&lt;99,20&gt;nae&lt;99,19&gt;nae&lt;99,18&gt;nae&lt;99,18&gt;nae&lt;99,19&gt;nae&lt;99,19&gt;bae&lt;140,25&gt;ttmae&lt;600,40&gt;nn]</strong></p><p>Online games turned into speech synthesis singing competitions, with a community of people creating and sharing DECtalk equivalents of sheet music. The video &#39;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNPKXfb3rws">Moonbase Alpha: The Musical</a>&#39; highlights many of these songs, including &#34;Make a Man Out of You&#34; from Disney&#39;s Mulan, theme songs for Spider-Man and the A-Team, and &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34; by Carly Rae Jepsen.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CNPKXfb3rws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Moonbase Alpha: The Musical"></iframe></figure><p>There&#39;s no better gameplay than oxygen alert sounds playing alongside a speech synthesis cover of &#34;Party Rock Anthem.&#34; There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS4pF9Zz5FBR7HiH_1NUtSZ2v8XA3cHxG">many other great Moonbase Alpha songs</a>, some of which were created outside of the game but with similar DECtalk technology. </p><h2 id="the-legacy">The legacy</h2><p>The promised space MMO eventually arrived as a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/star-rangers-hq/astronaut-moon-mars-and-beyond-the-nasa-mmo-online-0/description">Kickstarter project</a> in August 2011, initially called &#34;Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond&#34; and later renamed to &#34;Starlite: Astronaut Academy.&#34; The fundraising campaign was organized by Project Whitecard, the Canadian game studio that was helping with development.</p><p>Starlite was planned as a PC, mobile, and console game based around the fictional Arthur C. Clarke Astronaut Academy Station, described as &#34;a sort of Hogwarts in space.&#34; The missions would be set around the Space Academy, Mars, the asteroid belt, and other locations in our solar system.</p><figure><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/05/645fbd9e6ec4156d528320914006e24a_original.jpeg" alt="Futuristic space station orbiting Earth, featuring glowing blue lights and a small robotic spacecraft nearby." loading="lazy" width="1552" height="873" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/645fbd9e6ec4156d528320914006e24a_original.jpeg 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/645fbd9e6ec4156d528320914006e24a_original.jpeg 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/05/645fbd9e6ec4156d528320914006e24a_original.jpeg 1552w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/star-rangers-hq/astronaut-moon-mars-and-beyond-the-nasa-mmo-online-0/description" rel="noreferrer"><span>Kickstarter</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>The game blew past the $25,000 goal with a total of $45,719 in Kickstarter funding. It also received an <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/star-rangers-hq/astronaut-moon-mars-and-beyond-the-nasa-mmo-online-0/posts/357856">additional $750,000</a> from the Canadian government, MacArthur Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and other sources. However, the game never materialized. A short demo called &#34;Starlite: Astronaut Rescue&#34; was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/266090/Starlite_Astronaut_Rescue__Developed_in_Collaboration_with_NASA/">released on Steam</a> in 2014, and another &#34;Star Rangers&#34; game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333340/Star_Rangers_XE/">released as Early Access</a> in 2016, with both games receiving negative user reviews.</p><p>In a 2023 campaign update, developers cited &#34;internal disagreements&#34; and &#34;constraints in funding&#34; as reasons for Starlite never arriving. Less than a million dollars for a multi-platform MMO probably wasn&#39;t realistic. Virtual Heroes also tried a Kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/virtualheroes/moonbase-alpha-2-use-gaming-to-teach-science-and-t">a direct sequel to Moonbase Alpha</a>, which only raised $4,510 of its $480,000 goal.</p><p>Moonbase Alpha&#39;s viral moment has long since passed, but it still maintains a cult following and a connection to the larger <a href="https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki">vocaloid music production</a> community. There are even new songs every once in a while, like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIxowl5YuaQ">fantastic cover of &#34;Industry Baby&#34; by Lil Nas X</a> from 2022, with the vocals of Hatsune Miku alongside Moonbase Alpha&#39;s DECtalk.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIxowl5YuaQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="MOONBASE BABY (ft.
