<p>“…rhinological adenoids was a disappearing condition and that the</p>



<p>-Somerville and Hastings, Royal Proceedings in Medicine, 1932</p>



<p>Much is discussed by experts on the topic about the ideal treatment of the (inferior) turbinates – cautery, radiofrequency, ultrasound sharp removal, direct steroid injections and even cryotherapy.  Treating the turbinates with nasal steroids and subsequently surgery is a big business for small innocent structures inside the nose.  Most are convinced that because turbinates are there, they must be the CAUSE of nasal blockage. As they debate which way to “shrink” the turbinates is best, of course they completely miss the point of why they are there in the first place.  This is a symptom of both two-dimensional thinking and fixed business models.  Of course, as with anything that for 100 years that needs to be repeatedly re-branded as the next big thing, almost the entire concept is questionable…</p>



<p>In reality, the turbinate is not a mystery organ that undergoes inflammation, and then needs to be shrunken by well-meaning experts.  Instead, it a critical part of the nasal airflow system that maintains air-pressure in the throat to prevent collapse during sleep, by PREVENTING turbulent airflow within the nose and maintaining smooth jets of inspired air from the nostrils.  I know…you were told the exact opposite was true, and that shrinking the turbinates would help your sleep symptoms.   The turbinate is not the cause of nasal obstruction in most cases (except in its most extreme form when the turbiate has become so swollen to become polypoid or extremely stretched out (see video below).   Unfortunately, most doctors and patients confuse two entirely distinct conditions as one, and this creates a massive inefficiency in our healthcare.  The two distinct conditions are:  1). True nasal obstruction, which manifests as a deformity of narrow nostrils, or a very deviated septum – (this is less common) and 2).  Nasal Disuse (or underuse) – (which is extremely common and coined by Stanford’s late Christian Guilleminault), and simply means that the nose FEELS obstructed but is simply not used or is underused.  Obviously, #1 (True obstruction) can be fixed if the obstruction is relieved, and that is another topic for another day.   But, #2 (Nasal Disuse) can be confusing to all because it consists of invisible forces!  Particularly as we age, or have diminishing tone from poor diet and sedantarism, during sleep, our mouths reflexively open due to relaxation, just as our arms and legs go limp, so do our mouths.  This causes us to breathe through our mouths instead of our nose!  So, the air flowing through the mouth now means that during the night, the nose has less air flowing through it.  Like an unused railroad track that develops weeds and damage to the rails, this under-used passage that is inadvertently neglected becomes filled with vacuum (negative pressure) forces that are generated by our chest expansion.  This build-up of vacuum forces in the nose can stretch the tissue itself inwardly, and cause “growth” of the lining of the turbinates, the shock structure that protects us from the vacuum forces.  The turbinate’s job is to temporarily stretch its skin and grow to diminish the vacuum forces from acting on other anatomic structures like the sinuses, nostril and throat.  But, when the forces become too great from too much severe nasal underuse and mouth-breathing, the turbinates become damaged, and inflammatory cells rush to the rescue.  Of course, because clinicians do not directly see the night time pressure-mediated trauma but instead do their examination in the office during waking hours, they only see the resultant inflammation, the only therapeutic target remains anti-inflammatories, (nasal steroids), or mechanical (usually heat) shrinkage.  Only the rarest of physicians mentions night-time barotrauma, (vacuum related damage) to the tissues as the cause of the problem.  Most, instead will call the disease allergic rhinitis in mild cases, and when more severe, and the vacuum damage extends to the chambers known as sinuses, will call it “sinusitis”.  Then, the patient, suffering from never-ending night-time barotraumas, can after steroid treatment, have sinuses or turbinates “cleaned out” which means removing the damaged tissue, but of course in all cases, the problem shortly returns, because the root cause is almost never addressed.  It is worsened in the cold winter up north where dry humid air further worsen the damage from the vacuum, and it is worsened in parts of the south where too much moisture and humidity in the summer cause buildup of fungus in the vacuum damaged tissues.  But, of course the majority only focus treatment on the downstream problems of inflammation, stretched tissues or colonizing organisms like bacteria or fungus that are not the root cause, but gives the illusion of improvement because symptoms temporarily improve, and the medical industrial complex (described by Elisabeth Rosenthal in American Sickness) is satisfied, because a condition that is always treated but never cured is a boon to industry.  The practical but not easy solution is the restoration of nasal breathing at night, NOT by treating the nose, but by keeping the jaws SHUT!  This can be achieved with improved body tone, or even using a jaw-closure garment or intra-oral device.  Not lying on the back is helpful, as in the supine position, the jaw feels the exertion of more gravity encouraging opening versue prone (stomach down- *best), or side-sleeping.  I spend a lot of energy explaining this, because people who have nasal disuse like I just described have very poor results from surgery, so if we can not distinguish obstruction from disuse, we will have many poor results, as presented in most of the medical literature that has failed to distinguish between the two conditions, so uses survey type outcome measures that only focus on temporary symptoms rather than more concrete variables to justify the continued limited techniques that were known to be marginal in 1932 (see quote).  Of course, you can have both obstruction and underuse, and in these challenging cases, the physician still must distinguish which treatments treat which of the two problems, and combined therapy is required for resolution:  like a functional rhinoplasty combined with a post-op use of a nighttime jaw closure device.  In children, mouth-breathing commonly occurs before the jaws and tone mature during adolescence, and this mouth-breathing causes growth of the tonsils and adenoids the same way that the turbinates grow, from negative pressure and usually dryness, and again, these structures are seen as the cause of the difficulty, but are actually the result.  Almost a parallel pediatric version of the turbinates!   If you have more questions, let us know, whether you want to help yourself or improve efficient delivery of healthcare.</p>
