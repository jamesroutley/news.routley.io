    <h1>Introducing Arc: Outliers Wanted</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div>
<p>Today we are excited to introduce Arc, a seed-stage catalyst for outlier founders.  It is an open-call to anyone actively working on an idea or product and with the ambition of building a category-defining company that will endure. </p>



<p>Over the course of 8 weeks, seed-stage founders in the program will learn Company Design, the Sequoia way to start, build and scale <em>enduring</em> companies. You will get access to a best-in-class community of Sequoia founders and operators. And, your company will receive a $1M up-front investment to jump start your business.  </p>



<p>A commitment to company building has always been Sequoia’s hallmark.  It is reflected in our mission to help the daring build legendary companies and is rooted in the belief that it takes more than capital to create enduring impact.  Many times and over decades, we’ve seen what works. Just as important, we’ve seen what doesn’t.  Mindsets, foundations, networks and community are what make the difference between companies that stand the test of time and those that don’t. These are the principles of Company Design, which will be central to the Arc experience.  Establishing these fundamentals early is critical.  We think of it as a compass: adjust your direction at the start of a journey and the impact to the arc you travel will compound over time.  With Arc, you will learn what it takes to build for the next decade, not just the next quarter.</p>



<p>The first cohort of Arc will cater to European companies, with curriculum and experiences tailored to the unique demands of company building in Europe, including regionally specific perspectives on market expansion, remote hiring and more. A US cohort will launch later this year.</p>



<p>If you are a seed-stage founder building a company headquartered in Europe, we want to hear from you. Applications will be accepted until April 8th.  The program will kick-off on May 23rd and run through July 15, 2022.  <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/">Learn more and apply here.</a></p>
