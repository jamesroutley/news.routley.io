      <p>In September 2021, I randomly split all email subscribers to guzey.com in 3 groups and sent my updates via <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a>, and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>.</p>
<p>Although Buttondown is not perfect, Iâ€™m going with it for now because:</p>
<ol>
<li>its open rates and click rates are great and this is ultimately what I care about the most</li>
<li>it looks very good and allows to have quotes and tweet embeds</li>
<li>itâ€™s pleasant to use, in contrast to Mailchimp, and costs almost exactly as much</li>
</ol>
<p>Key stats and my thoughts on each platform below:</p>
<p><strong>Substack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>39% open rate</li>
<li>54% of openers clicked a link</li>
<li>looks very nice and tweet embeds look great</li>
<li>user interface is great</li>
<li>canâ€™t remove branding</li>
<li>free (because it has lots of VC money and because they try very hard to convert your newsletter into a paid one, from which they would earn a 10% commission)</li>
<li>If Substackâ€™s open rate wasnâ€™t terrible, I would go with it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buttondown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>46% open rate</li>
<li>53% of openers clicked a link</li>
<li>looks very nice, a tiny bit worse than Substack (twitter embeds though behave somewhat worse, so my <a href="https://bestoftwitter.substack.com/">Best of Twitter newsletter</a> stays with Substack)</li>
<li>user interface is great</li>
<li>$5/month/1k subscribers (with Buttondown branding and without custom domain)</li>
<li>add $29/month for removing Buttondown branding and custom domain that does not work</li>
<li>price at 4k subscribers when not removing Buttondown branding and not sending from custom domain: $20/month</li>
<li>price at 4k subscribers when removing Buttondown branding: $49/month</li>
<li>kinda buggy. For example, it very annoyingly fails to send emails from my domain despite my accountâ€™s settings claiming that everything is set up correctly and Buttondown simply ignored several of my support emails about this ðŸ™„</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mailchimp:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>48% open rate</li>
<li>37% of openers clicked a link (I think this is because Mailchimpâ€™s links are black rather than blue and itâ€™s easy to miss them)</li>
<li>looks ok</li>
<li>user interface is trying to kill you and editor is a giant pain in the ass (e.g. it literally does not have ability to insert quotes or embed tweets). Using Mailchimp is very unpleasant.</li>
<li>unclear pricing but starts free for &lt;2000 subscribers with Mailchimp branding</li>
<li>minimum price at 4k subscribers (allows to remove Mailchimip branding): $53/month</li>
</ul>
