<p><b>Notes</b>: Parent-subsidiary linkages are based on relationships current as of the latest revision listed in the <a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/pages/update-log">Update Log</a>, which may vary from what was the case when a violation occurred. The penalty totals are adjusted to account for the fact that the individual entries below may include both agency records and settlement announcements for the same case; or else a penalty covering multiple locations may be listed in the individual records for each of the facilities. The totals are also adjusted to reflect cases in which federal and state or local agencies cooperated and issued separate announcements of the outcome. Duplicate or overlapping penalty amounts are marked with an asterisk in the list below.</p></div><p><b>(*): Penalty amounts marked by an asterisk are ones announced by more than one agency. Parent penalty totals are adjusted to avoid double-counting.</b>
