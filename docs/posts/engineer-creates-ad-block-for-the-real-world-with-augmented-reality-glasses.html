<p>Say what you will about going outside, but there isn&#39;t an AdBlock program for real-life billboards and ads. At least, there didn&#39;t use to be.

The captured video also shows the glasses blocking out the brand names on food packaging.</p><p>Spanhove says the project is still very early in its production, but &#34;it‚Äôs exciting to imagine a future where you control the physical content you see.&#34; Spanhove continues to brainstorm the future of the app in his replies, hinting at future features allowing users to replace the glaring red prohibited square with custom photos or lists from a notes app.</p><p>The app is built from libraries and APIs shared by Snap on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Snapchat/Spectacles-Sample/tree/main/Depth%20Cache" data-url="https://github.com/Snapchat/Spectacles-Sample/tree/main/Depth%20Cache" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">its Github</a> on its Depth Cache development, making the app, for now, a Snap Spectacles exclusive experience. Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest enjoyers will need to wait a bit longer for similar experiences to arrive on their screens.</p><p>Snap, best known for its flagship social media app Snapchat, has been developing its AR Spectacles since 2016, though the camera goggles were originally designed to help people capture life events, rather than AR devices. While companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and Meta have abandoned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-prioritizing-puffin-for-2026-pushing-out-quest-4-to-2027/" data-url="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-prioritizing-puffin-for-2026-pushing-out-quest-4-to-2027/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">or paused</a> their augmented reality projects in recent months and years, Snap has seemingly been carrying the banner forward, with its fifth-gen Spectacles available for $99 per month for developers.</p><p>While mere mortals without development interest will need to wait a bit longer to experience a true <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>They Live</em></a> anti-propaganda glasses experience, the questions the app raises are perhaps the most interesting part of it. What will a world look like where we can control what, or perhaps who, we see? At least for now, it will look just like the normal world, just with a few extra red rectangles.</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wvat8jdVtBBsPbrFsHdjPL"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get Tom&#39;s Hardware&#39;s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div></div></div>
