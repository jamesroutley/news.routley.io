    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>I used to be fascinated with what the Open Startup movement promoted and the amazing feeling it gave to the startup and indie maker ecosystems.</p><p>To those that may be unfamiliar, being an open startup means being an open book when it comes to how you run your business.</p><p>In recent years, “builders” have shared their business stats, goals, metrics, and more with the internet.</p><p>The transparency shown using Twitter and dedicated “open pages” fostered an environment of support, learning, and inspiration.</p><p>Some of the pioneers that I’d like to mention are Buffer, Ghost, and NomadList.</p><h4 data-id="94d3e65f676540f3b851ac6b4df48227" id="buffer"><span><a href="#buffer" title="Buffer"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://buffer.com/transparency">Buffer</a></span></span></h4><p>I recognize Buffer as one of the first companies to preach and practice the Open Startups philosophy.</p><p>Buffer is a company known for its commitment to transparency and open communication. The company, which provides social media management tools, has been an advocate for the &#34;open startup&#34; philosophy since its founding in 2010.

The open startup philosophy is based on the idea that companies should be transparent and open in their operations, both with their customers and the public. This includes sharing financial information, product roadmap, and other internal details, even their salaries. </p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://cdn.feather.blog?src=https%3A%2F%2Fusenotioncms.com%2Fproxy%2Fblock%2Fd32b96bb-f1e7-44bc-9c72-030c78ca1988%252F8a3b7fe5-1bc1-49bd-a656-d057f265e076%252FScreen_Shot_2023-01-20_at_8.44.17_AM.png&amp;optimizer=image" height="100%"/></p></figure><p>They share everything on their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://buffer.com/transparent-metrics">transparency page</a>.
