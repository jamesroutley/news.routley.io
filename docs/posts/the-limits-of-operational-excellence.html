    <h1>The Limits of Operational Excellence</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/04/limits_of_operational_excellence.jpg" alt="The Limits of Operational Excellence"><p>In <a href="https://commoncog.com/making-sense-of-deming/#some-synthesis">Making Sense of Deming</a> I wrote: </p><blockquote>Why is it that some Deming-influenced manufacturing companies can survive long enough to acquire process power, whilst others go down the Deming path and die? I wish I have an answer for you, but the honest truth is that I don&#x2019;t know. This requires a lot more investigation than I&#x2019;ve had time for in the writing of this essay. But it&#x2019;s a question that&#x2019;s been occupying my mind for a few months now &#x2014; and I&#x2019;m likely going to think about it for years afterwards. Perhaps, one day, I will find satisfactory answers.</blockquote><p>The simple form of this question is: &#x201C;what are the limits of Lean?&#x201D; or perhaps &#x201C;what are the limits of Deming&#x2019;s ideas?&#x201D; The more <em>interesting</em> question is &#x201C;when is operational excellence important for business success ... and when is it irrelevant?&#x201D;</p><p>I&#x2019;m pleased to report that I have found an answer to all three questions &#x2014; and earlier than expected. Though I&#x2019;m a little abashed to say this: the answer should <em>not</em> be surprising. This is well-explored territory, and the clues have been available to me all along.</p><p>In order to make this answer more memorable, I want to tell you a story. This is a case that I&#x2019;d read years ago, long before my current Deming deep-dive; it is the story of a remarkable American manufacturer, a component member of the S&amp;P 100 (with a <a href="https://investors.danaher.com/">stock return of 4,500%</a> over the past 25 years), and one of the best manufacturing companies in the world.</p>
