    <h1>CodeMirror 6.0 Stable Release</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="full">
  
  <p><a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a> is a new code editor library
for the web, a from-scratch implementation based on the experience of
building and maintaining versions 1 to 5 for the past 13 years. It
aims to be more extensible and accessible than previous versions.</p>
<p>As of today, version 6.0 is stable. Going forward, probably at least
several years, all new releases will be under the 6 major version, and
be backwards compatible.</p>
<p>The library has been usable and largely stable for over a year, with
only minor breaking changes. I generally prefer to release late, to
avoid having too many regrettable mistakes slip into the stable
release, which would then have to be kept there indefinitely. Without
a doubt there will be things that, a year from now, I wish I had
released differently, but by having users work with the code in
production for a significant amount of time, a lot of small issues and
sources of friction have been found and resolved before being set down
in stone.</p>
<p>Work on this system started four years ago, with <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/">Prototype
Fund</a> funding the initial work. It was
announced publicly and crowd-funded a year after that, built out into
a useable system in the two years after that, and refined and
stabilized in the past year. During the first two years, I
collaborated with Adrian Heine on the design and implementation of the
initial system.</p>
<p>For some more background on the new library, see the blog posts on
<a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/lezer.html">Lezer</a> (the parser system), <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/facets.html">facets</a> (the
extension system), and <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">collaborative
editing</a>. For an overview of the entire
system, take a look at the <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/docs/guide/">system
guide</a>. For a rough summary of
what changed in the interface since 5.x, see the <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/docs/migration/">migration
guide</a>.</p>
