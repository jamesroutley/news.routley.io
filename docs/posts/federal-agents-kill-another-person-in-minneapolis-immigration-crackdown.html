The agent continues to fire while the man lies motionless on the floor.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7357523/minnesota-ice-protest-business-immigration-minneapolis/?utm_source=beehiiv&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-the-brief&amp;_bhlid=1db67f05e77f6e7525804099249fb1d6a0b02d00"><em>Minnesotans Shutter Businesses and Call Off Work in Economic Blackout Day to Protest ICE</em></a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at a press conference on Saturday afternoon that the victim is a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident and an American citizen. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">&#34;The only interaction that we are aware of with law enforcement has been for traffic tickets and we believe he is a lawfully gun owner with a permit to carry,&#34; O’Hara said. He added that the police were not yet sharing his identity with the public. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2015115351797780500">statement</a> that it was carrying out a &#34;targeted operation&#34; when an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. It said officers attempted to disarm the man, but he &#34;violently resisted.&#34; </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">&#34;Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene,&#34; the statement continued. It added: &#34;[T]his looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.&#34; </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">But a <a href="https://x.com/TheJFreakinC/status/2015116316122746929">video</a> showing the lead-up to the fatal shooting contradicted that account. It shows the man standing still, filming a group of federal officers with his phone in his right hand, with his left hand empty, resting by his side. An agent then approaches and pushes him backwards. The video then cuts before the shooting takes place.  </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7345319/ice-shootings-renee-good/"><em>Fatal ICE Shooting Sparks Scrutiny of Killings in Trump’s Immigration Crackdown </em></a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The incident is the latest in a series of shootings in which the DHS claims the victim was threatening the life of an agent, only for video evidence to later <a href="https://time.com/7345319/ice-shootings-renee-good/">contradict the claim</a>. In the shooting of Renee Good, the DHS claimed the mother-of-three had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.” Video later showed that the agent was positioned to the side of Good’s vehicle when he fired the shots that killed her, and her wheels turned away from him.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">O&#39;Hara, in his press conference, called for greater discipline from the estimated 3,000 federal immigration agents in the city.  </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">&#34;Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,&#34; he said. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Saturday&#39;s shooting prompted a wave of anger from local politicians, many of whom have been calling for the Trump Administration to bring an end to its immigration surge following weeks of <a href="https://time.com/7347110/ice-minneapolis-judge-arrests/">violent encounters</a> with Minnesotans, including the use of pepper spray and the arrest of peaceful protesters. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting &#34;sickening&#34; and called on President Donald Trump to end his immigration crackdown in the state.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” Walz said in a <a href="https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/2015093164999119352">post</a> on X.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“The President must end this operation.

We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,&#34; it added. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A few hundreds 300 protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis by noon, where they scuffled with federal agents who had blocked off the intersection. Protesters screamed &#34;I smell Nazis&#34; at the federal agents and shouted at them to &#34;go home.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The agents deployed tear gas and used pepper-spray as they fought running battles with protesters.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The shooting comes a day after thousands took to the streets across Minnesota on Friday, closing down businesses and calling out of work in a mass protest against the Trump Administration’s immigration crackdown in the state.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The “Ice Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom” demonstration, organized by community leaders, members of the clergy, and labor unions, called for a “no work, no school, no shopping” economic blackout.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><em>This is a developing story.</em></p></article></div></div></div></div>
