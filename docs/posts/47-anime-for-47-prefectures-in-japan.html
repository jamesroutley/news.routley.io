    <h1>47 Anime for 47 Prefectures in Japan</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Japanese animation can be a vehicle to take you all around Japan, from legendary temples and nature spots, to small-town streets and convenience stores. Very often the locations are drawn in so much detail, that they seem like copies of real-life places. Here’s a list of all 47 prefectures in Japan and anime that take place in each prefecture.</p>
<h2 id="651f78b1ef141">Hokkaido</h2>
<p><iframe title="Golden Kamuy (Anime-Trailer)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrHcN08d7dQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h3>Golden Kamuy</h3>
<p>This is the most representative story from Hokkaido, with both the anime and manga showcasing various locations across the island.  The story takes place after the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) and gives a spotlight to Hokkaido’s indigenous Ainu people, even featuring the Ainu language.</p>
<h2 id="651f78b1ef169">Tohoku</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Flying Witch Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tlS3BXTq7wQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Aomori</h3>
<p>Aomori is the scene for an anime featuring a young witch and her black cat. It’s not Kiki, but Makoto Kowata and she makes the opposite move — from the big city to the countryside, more specifically from Yokohama to rural Aomori. <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31376/Flying_Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Flying Witch</em></a> is a 2017 anime, showing the budding trend of escaping to nature.</p>
<h3>Akita</h3>
<p>Fans of the Akita breed of dog and the famous Hachiko should watch <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/589/Ginga_Nagareboshi_Gin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silverfang: The Shooting Star Gin</a>. </em>The main character is an Akita puppy who leaves his master to join a pack of wild dogs and takes us across the Akita wilderness.</p>
<h3>Iwate</h3>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4062/Musashi_no_Ken" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Musashi no Ken (Musashi’s Sword)</em></a> is both a way to see Iwate Prefecture in anime and to look into the world of the martial art, kendo. It shows the peaceful environments of small towns in Iwate and the characters often speak in the local dialect. The anime even manages to weave in the poetry of literary great Kenji Miyazawa, an Iwate native.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Haikyu!! - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOGp2c7-cKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Miyagi</h3>
<p>The widely popular volleyball anime <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu?q=haikyu&amp;cat=anime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Haikyu!!</em></a> takes place in Miyagi Prefecture, mostly in its capital Sendai. Since it’s a sports-themed anime, you can see depictions of real-life gymnasiums and sports centers in the prefecture, as well as in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Yamagata</h3>
<p>Excluding theories that the bathhouse in <em>Spirited Away</em> is based on Ginzan Onsen in Yamagata, this prefecture is best viewed through the lens of another, albeit less known, Ghibli film. The main character in <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1029/Omoide_Poroporo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Only Yesterday</em></a> travels from Tokyo to Yamagata where she falls in love with the place and with a Yamagata local.</p>
<h3>Fukushima</h3>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/32248/Masamune_Datenicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Masamune Datenicle</em></a> (a play on “Date” and “chronicle”) is a 2016 anime produced by a studio in Fukushima and aims to promote the prefecture’s history and culture. Date Masamune was a famous Tohoku samurai who still has a lot of fans to this day.</p>

<h3>Niigata</h3>
<p>The anime <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/33003/Mahou_Shoujo_Ikusei_Keikaku" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Magical Girl Raising Project</em></a>, based on the light novels by Asari Endo, takes place in the cryptic N-city. However, with exact depictions of Takada Station, Takada Castle and Takada Park’s Gokurakubashi Bridge (to name a few), we can see it’s based on Joetsu city, the author’s hometown.</p>

<h3>Tottori</h3>
<p>Tottori is a special case as it’s the hometown of Gosho Aoyama, the author of <em>Case Closed</em> (Detective Conan). The long-running anime takes place all over Japan, but you can experience it in real life the most in Tottori. With Conan appearances starting at Tottori Airport, the whole prefecture is a treasure trove for Detective Conan fans.</p>

This anime brings us to several prefectures in Shikoku, but with a strong focus on Tokushima. The story also began as a column in a Tokushima newspaper.</p>
<h3>Kagawa</h3>
<p>The prefecture with the best udon is naturally the setting for the <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/32673/Udon_no_Kuni_no_Kiniro_Kemari" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Poco’s Udon World</em></a> anime, particularly in Takamatsu and Shodo Island.

<h3>Fukuoka</h3>
<p>The city known for <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/travel/ichiran-tonkotsu-ramen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tonkotsu ramen</a> and riverside stalls is best enjoyed in the <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35889/Hakata_Tonkotsu_Ramens"><em>Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens</em></a> anime that shows us Fukuoka nightlife and a fictional criminal underbelly.</p>
<h3>Saga</h3>
<p>The characters in <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/32995/Yuri_on_Ice" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Yuri!! On Ice</em></a> figure skate their way to Barcelona, but the main plot takes place in Saga Prefecture, particularly the castle town of Karatsu. Karatsu has embraced this connection and displays the characters around town.</p>
<h3>Nagasaki</h3>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Barakamon</em></a> follows a Tokyo calligrapher sent to the <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/travel/people-churches-goto-islands-hidden-christians-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goto Islands</a> in Nagasaki Prefecture.

<p>Bonus: the over-the-top comical <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/3702/Detroit_Metal_City" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Detroit Metal City</em></a> takes place in Tokyo, but the protagonist is from Inukai, Oita Prefecture.</p>
<h3>Kumamoto</h3>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Natsume’s Book of Friends</em></a> acquaints us with the supernatural folklore of yokai spirits and takes place in the Hitoyoshi Kuma region of Kumamoto Prefecture. Due to its theme, it shows many old revered temples and shrines, in addition to natural landscapes.</p>
<h3>Miyazaki</h3>
<p>Also known for traditional spirituality, Miyazaki Prefecture is the setting for <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/29854/Ushio_to_Tora_TV" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ushio and</em> Tora,</a> an anime that takes place in a temple and deals with the supernatural.</p>
<h3>Kagoshima</h3>
<p>Tanegashima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture is the setting of the <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/13599/Robotics_Notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Robotics;Notes</em></a> anime. Tanegashima Space Center, the main rocket launch facility for JAXA, features heavily because the main plot centers around the creation of a giant mecha robot.</p>
<h2 id="651f78b1ef184">Okinawa</h2>
<p>It seems that every other anime has a filler episode including a trip to Okinawa. There are, however, anime set entirely in Okinawa, including <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/15043/Haitai_Nanafa">Haitai Nanafa</a>, </em>which features a local soba shop and two sisters helping their grandmother run it. As well as Okinawan food, you can also see beautiful architecture and landscapes.</p>
