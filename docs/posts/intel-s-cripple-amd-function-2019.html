			<p>In the long run, this will hurt Intel, since it will drive customers away from their compilers.  Given AMD&#39;s new Zen CPUs, anyone investigating their use will switch to gcc or clang for compilation, rather than Intel.  I know Google switched their C++ compilation to clang more than two years ago. (There were of course many other reasons for that switch, but by crippling compiled-code performance on AMD, Intel has essentially disqualified their compiler from consideration.)</p>
