    <h1>DJI Drone Rescue Map</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> To be included in this map, a drone must have been used to rescue a person from peril. (It doesn&#39;t matter which company made the drone.) The drone must have been an active part of the search or rescue operation, and the drone must have made a difference in accomplishing the rescue faster, safer, more easily or more effectively than would have been possible without the drone.</p></div><div><p> We would like to keep this map as up-to-date as possible, and we need your help to do it. If you know of a drone rescue not included on this map, please report the rescue information on <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1sToYV_q0Seuxj0OkpHa1mQ3bdaf" target="_blank">this form</a> and we will work with you to validate the submission.</p></div></div>
