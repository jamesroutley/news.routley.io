    <h1>Autophage rocket engine consumes plastic fuselage for fuel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p itemprop="abstract">
                        An autophage rocket engine that consumes its plastic fuselage for fuel has been built and fired by engineers at Glasgow University.
                    </p><div itemprop="articleBody">
                            <p>The autophage engine uses waste heat from combustion to sequentially melt its own plastic fuselage as it fires. It then feeds the molten plastic into the engine’s combustion chamber as additional fuel to burn alongside its regular liquid propellants.</p>
<p>The concept of a self-eating rocket engine was first proposed and patented in 1938. However, no autophage engine designs were fired in a controlled manner until a research partnership between Glasgow University and Dnipro National University, Ukraine achieved this milestone in 2018.</p>

<p>The team’s design developments are being showcased <a rel="noopener" href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-1604#:~:text=This%20paper%20discusses%20the%20design,fraction%20of%20the%20launch%20vehicle." target="_blank" data-anchor="#:~:text=This%20paper%20discusses%20the%20design,fraction%20of%20the%20launch%20vehicle.">as a paper</a> presented at the international <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.aiaa.org/SciTech" target="_blank">AIAA SciTech Forum</a> in Orlando, Florida this week.</p>
<p>In the paper, the team describe how they test-fired their Ouroborous-3 autophage engine, producing 100 newtons of thrust in a series of controlled experiments. </p>



<p>The tests also showed that the rocket’s burn could be controlled, with the team demonstrating its ability to be throttled, restarted and pulsed in an on/off pattern.</p>
<p>In a statement, project lead Professor Patrick Harkness from Glasgow University’s James Watt School of Engineering said: “These results are a foundational step on the way to developing a fully-functional autophage rocket engine. Those future rockets could have a wide range of applications which would help advance the UK’s ambitions to develop as a key player in the space industry.</p>
<p>Development of the team’s autophage engine will continue with the support of new funding from the UK Space Agency and the Sciences and Technology Facilities Council.</p>
