<h2>Console</h2>



<p>The Vectrex Mini captures the full spirit of the original Vectrex in a case half the size. <strong>Its plastic shell is made using injection molding</strong>, just like the console of the time, and each unit will come in <strong>packaging inspired by the original box</strong>.</p>



<p>On the technical side, the console features a <strong>built-in 5-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 800Ã—600</strong>, delivering sharp and bright vector graphics. <strong>Power is supplied via USB-C</strong>, so it can run on a wall outlet as well as an external battery. The Vectrex Mini is powered by an <strong>ESP32</strong>, a modern and reliable microprocessor, powerful enough to run the entire Vectrex game library with performance beyond many arcade machines of the era.</p>

<p>The console will include<strong> 12 built-in classic games</strong>, mostly from the General Consumer Electronics catalog (the final selection is still being completed, with the official list to be announced later). Each game will come with its own <strong>physical overlay </strong>to recreate the visual experience of the 1980s. </p>



<p><strong>Sticker sheets</strong> will also be included, featuring different official logos (current, European, American, and Japanese), so players can customize their machine.</p>

<p>An alarm can also be set, allowing the Vectrex Mini to double as a stylish bedside clock or desk companion. </p>

<h2>Kickstarter Campaign</h2>



<p>After three years dedicated to prototyping and preparing for production, the project is now ready. We have set a clear timeline with defined milestones for testing, final adjustments, and assembly. Manufacturing will be carried out in partnership with teams based in Taiwan.</p>



<p>The Kickstarter campaign aims to finance this production phase.<strong> We waited until we had a fully functional prototype, strong partners, and a realistic schedule before launching.</strong> See you on <strong>November 3 on Kickstarter</strong> to discover all the details and join the adventure.</p>
