    <h1>QX82: Tiny JavaScript game/experience engine inspired by retro 80s computing</h1>

  <p>QX82 is a tiny Javascript engine that lets you create games and
  experiences inspired by the look and feel of a retro 80s computer.
  It&#39;s not an emulator or a fantasy console: it&#39;s just a Javascript library.</p>

  <p>It&#39;s open source. You can download it from the
    <a href="https://github.com/btco/qx82">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

  </p>

  <p>Although this engine tries to recreate the feel of retro computers, you
  are not limited to the functionality of old computers: this is just
  Javascript and you can do whatever you want with no artificial
  restrictions.</p>

  <p>It&#39;s open-source and MIT-licensed, so you can freely see how it
  works and make modifications to it as you need.</p>

  to move): </p>
  

  <p>This engine was developed by <b>Bruno Oliveira</b>. I&#39;m <b>@btco_code</b> on
  <a href="https://twitter.com/btco_code">Twitter</a> and on
  <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@btco_code">Mastodon</a>.

  by &#34;tc&#34; at gmail.com.</p>

  <p><b>Note about mobile support:</b> This engine was mostly designed for
  desktop, but on mobile devices it shows a virtual joystick with a DPAD and 2
  buttons. However, mobile support is currently <b>very experimental</b> and
  quite buggy, I&#39;ll try to fix it soon!</p>

  
  <p>It&#39;s a straightforward immediate mode API inspired by BASIC:</p>

  <pre><em>// Clear screen (7 = white, 1 = blue).</em>
<b>qx.color</b>(7, 1);
<b>qx.cls</b>();
<em>// Print hello at pos (1,1).</em>
<b>qx.locate</b>(1, 1);
<b>qx.print</b>(<u>&#34;Hello world!\n\n&#34;</u>);
<em>// Ask the user&#39;s name.</em>
<b>qx.print</b>(<u>&#34;What is your name? &#34;</u>);
<em>// Wait for user to type:</em>
<u>const</u> name = <u>await</u> <b>qxa.readline</b>();
<em>// Print back the name in yellow (14).</em>
<b>qx.color</b>(14);
<b>qx.print</b>(<u>`\n\nHi, {name}.`</u>);</pre>

  <p>There&#39;s also a more traditional frame-based API where you
  get a callback to draw every frame, which works best for action games
  that run continuously without blocking for user input.</p>

  
  <p>Like in the old times, a lot of graphics is accomplished via
  characters. You can define the graphics for each character code,
  so you can use this for the player, enemies, projectiles, fancy
  borders, or anything else you want.</p>

  </p>

  <p>You can of course change this font file to draw anything you
  want. Then you can use the character code (these are numbered from 0x00
  to 0xFF) to draw:</p>

  <pre><em>// Set color (yellow over blue).</em>
<b>qx.color</b>(14, 1);
<em>// Draw hero (char code 0xc0).</em>
<b>qx.locate</b>(5, 5);
<b>qx.print</b>(<u>&#34;\uc0&#34;</u>)</pre>
  
  <p>And if you don&#39;t want to be constrained by text-mode rows and
  columns, you can draw directly using pixel coordinates too:</p>

  <pre><em>// Draw hero at pixel pos (50, 50).</em>
<b>qx.spr</b>(0xc0, 50, 50);</pre>
