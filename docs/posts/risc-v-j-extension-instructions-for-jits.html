<p dir="auto">The RISC-V J extension aims to make RISC-V an attractive target for languages that are traditionally interpreted or JIT compiled, or which require large runtime libraries or language- level virtual machines. Examples include (but are not limited to) C#, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, OCaml, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk or WebAssembly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Typical features of these languages include garbage collection, dynamic typing and dynamic dispatch, transparent boxing of primitive values, and reflection. This provides a very wide scope for possible approaches and, as such, the working group will follow a two-pronged strategy investigating both immediate gains and longer-term more experimental ideas concurrently. Existing attempts to implement JIT-compiled languages on RISC-V have highlighted some places where better instruction density is possible, and these should fall into an early version of the specification.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instructions intended to accelerate common JIT’d instruction sequences may be optional within the J extension, with the expectation that software will test for their presence before determining which code sequence to generate. This also provides scope for additions that are only appropriate for a subset of microarchitectures. For example, there is increasing interest in running JavaScript on IoT devices, but acceleration for simple low-power in-order pipelines with constrained memory may be wholly inappropriate for large application cores.</p>
