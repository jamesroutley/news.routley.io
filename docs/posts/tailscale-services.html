    <h1>Tailscale Services</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today we’re excited to announce Tailscale Services, a new way to define available resources on your network and expand the granularity of your access controls.</p><p>Tailscale’s mesh-networking approach, combined with a flexible and powerful policy engine, has empowered our customers to provide precision access controls wherever Tailscale is installed.</p><p>But what if you’re unable to install Tailscale on a resource directly? What if that resource is on a dynamic IP address, or in ephemeral container orchestration environments? What if a single machine hosts multiple resources, or if a single logical resource exists in multiple places? What if you’ve got thousands of services you need to quickly stand up in a tailnet?</p><h2 id="your-services-on-tailscale"><a href="#your-services-on-tailscale">Your services, on Tailscale<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>That’s where Tailscale Services come in. Tailscale Services allows you to assign virtual Tailscale IPv4 and IPv6 address pairs (TailVIPs) to any logical resource in your network, as long as that resource is reachable by a Tailscale client. Services get a unique human-readable <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=fall-update-2025">MagicDNS name</a> for ease of reference. Services are a unit of policy on which you can grant access. And maintaining a service can be entirely automated via API.</p><p>Tailscale Services functions a lot like traditional Tailscale nodes, but the services are not tied to any particular hardware. A service can map to one or many Tailscale nodes. Because of that, Tailscale Services can replace traditional or cloud load balancing setups with simple intelligent routing and availability mechanisms.</p><figure id=""><img _type="asset" video="[object Object]" alt="Services defined on a tailnet are displayed in the Services tab of the admin console." loading="lazy" width="2188" height="1492" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/8e0bdf55b81eff79fce18297764fa4ac52e2daf6-2188x1492.png?w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;auto=format 1x" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/8e0bdf55b81eff79fce18297764fa4ac52e2daf6-2188x1492.png?w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;auto=format"/></figure><h2 id="a-new-approach-to-connectivity"><a href="#a-new-approach-to-connectivity"><strong>A new approach to connectivity</strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>We’ve been piloting Tailscale Services with select customers, and they’ve used it for all sorts of connectivity scenarios, from workload connectivity to critical developer tooling to internal application access. Our early design partners have built capability and identity-aware database proxies, highly available internal secret stores, simple and scalable MCP servers, globally distributed telemetry and logging gateways, and more—all without any complex networking and security infrastructure to set up.</p><p>One design partner used Tailscale Services alongside their CI pipelines to connect in-development workloads to testing suites, quality assurance teams, and their internal secret storage, migrating away from a legacy firewall, load balancer, and mutual TLS setup. The repeatable API-driven interface allowed them to easily scale their CI model across the organization with minimal infrastructure setup, internal approvals, and allowed for their development teams to focus on shipping code instead of debugging networking issues or fighting security constraints.</p><p>Another design partner leveraged Tailscale Services to expose a fleet of containerized applications in their homelab with MagicDNS names instead of having to remember their various port numbers. Their previous setup required complex local networking and didn’t allow for high availability during software updates or migrations.</p><p>Tailscale Services can help anywhere you need a simple and predictable connectivity path, precision access control policies, or can’t install Tailscale on the target workload.</p><h2 id="architecture"><a href="#architecture">Architecture<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>Every service consists of a stable TailVIP, unique MagicDNS name, a definition of the service’s endpoints, and a set of hosts that advertise the service.

During our open beta period, we won’t be charging customers or capping usage on the services they define and deploy, and we’ll provide a legacy exception for your usage.</p><p>We’re continuing to improve Tailscale Services with the features you’d expect from Tailscale, like Configuration Audit Logs, Network Flow Logs, and more. Currently, service hosts can only point to resources that are on the local host; in the coming 1.92 stable release they’ll be able to point at local network destinations. We’re also doing the standard bug squashing and usability testing, and readily listening to feedback from our customers.</p><p>This is just a foundation for what’s next. We have a long way to go, and we’d love to hear your thoughts on what’s most important and valuable. We’ve got ideas around:</p><ul><li>Bringing more state validation to Tailscale Services, with availability based on custom context</li><li>Creating an API to register service hosts with <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1244/tsnet">tsnet</a></li><li>Building identity in Tailscale Services, extending the boundary of trust from connection termination to where the workload is running</li><li>Integrating natively with third-party proxies, so you can plug Tailscale into existing infrastructure</li><li>Letting services hook up to Funnels for easy, public-facing HA access</li><li>Discovering local services on the network and building easy workflows to expose them</li><li>Building a service gateway to leverage Tailscale’s native MagicDNS across entire private subnets, and much more.</li></ul><p>To get started today, head over to the admin console &gt; Services tab and define your first service.
