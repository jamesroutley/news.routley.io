            <div><p><strong>The Norwegian shipping company Havila Kystruten will no longer allow electric cars on board its ships, according to Norwegian Television <a href="https://www.nrk.no/nordland/havila-kystruten-stanser-frakt-av-elbiler-i-frykt-for-brann-1.16256402">NRK</a>. The consequences of an electric car fire are considered too severe, states the company.</strong></p>
<p>The scenic <strong>Hurtigruten coastal route</strong> between<strong> Bergen</strong> and <strong>Kirkenes</strong> runs along the coast of Norway. From 2021, the two shipping companies <strong>Hurtigruten</strong> and <strong>Havila</strong> share a mutual agreement on the traffic between the two destinations.</p>

<p><strong>&#34;Toxic gases are released&#34;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Risk analysis found lithium batteries too risky onboard</strong></p>
<p>The decision was made after <strong>an external risk analysis was mad</strong>e on behalf of the company. What the risk analysis found was that fires in electric cars are considered<strong> more difficult to extinguish than fires in cars powered by petrol and diesel.</strong></p>
<p>&#34;An electric car fire gets very hot, and there may be a risk of explosion where toxic gases will be released. This can mean that you have to evacuate the ship immediately and in the worst case you can have a total breakdown of the ship, says <strong>Lasse A. Vangstein</strong> who is in charge of communications at <strong>Havila Kystruten</strong> to NRK.</p>


<p><strong>Competing ferry company continues to allow all types of cars</strong></p>
<p>
The competitor Hurtigruten makes a different assessment and will continue to allow all types of cars.</p>
<p>&#34;We have transported cars between all ports for 40 years, and.. we have no plans to stop it, says press spokesperson <strong>Martin Henriksen.</strong></p>
<p>The issue of electric car fires on board ships is becoming more controversial in <strong>Scandinavia</strong> as more and more car owners switch to electric cars. When Finnish Television company <strong>YLE</strong> reported on the matter recently, the shipping companies <strong>Viking line</strong> and <strong>Ålandstrafiken</strong> stated that all types of cars are permitted board their ships as long as there is no reason to believe the battery has been damaged.</p>


<p><strong>Many EVs in Norway due to government subsidies</strong></p>
<p>Referencing the <strong>Norwegian Directorate for Safety and Preparedness (DSB)</strong>, the NRK news company says that fires in fossil fuel cars are<strong> 4-5 times as common as fires in electric cars. </strong></p>
<p>However, as fire inspector<strong> Sigurd Folgerø Dalen</strong> at the Oslo Fire Department said to Faktisk.no,<strong> large amounts of water will be needed if an EV catches fire. </strong></p>
<p>According to NRK, already in 2019 there was speculation regarding if the shipping company <strong>Havila Kystruten</strong>  would allow EVs on their new route. However, then CEO <strong>Arild Myrvoll</strong> decided to allow them based on the need on the population.</p>
<p><strong>Norway has had government incentives towards purchasing electric cars</strong> for many years and therefor a large fleet of EVs are on the road in the country. </p>
