    On the face of things, we seem to be merely talking about text-based files, 
    containing only the letters of the English Alphabet (and the occasional
    punctuation mark).

    On deeper inspection, of course, this isn&#39;t quite the case. What this site
    offers is a glimpse into the history of writers and artists bound by the
    128 characters that the American Standard Code for Information Interchange
    (ASCII) allowed them. The focus is on mid-1980&#39;s textfiles and the world
    as it was then, but even these files are sometime retooled 1960s and 1970s
    works, and offshoots of this culture exist to this day.
