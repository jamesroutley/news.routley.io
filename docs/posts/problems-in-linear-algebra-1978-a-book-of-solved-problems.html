    <h1>Problems in Linear Algebra (1978), a book of solved problems</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="descript" itemprop="description"><blockquote><p>In preparing this book of problems the author attempted 
firstly, to give a sufficient number of exercises for developing skills 
in the solution of typical problems (for example, the computing of 
determinants with numerical elements, the solution of systems of linear 
equations with numerical coefficients, and the like), secondly, to 
provide problems that will help to clarify basic concepts and their 
interrelations (for example, the connection between the properties of 
matrices and those of quadratic forms, on the one hand and those of 
linear transformations, on the other), thirdly to provide for a set of 
problems that might supplement the course of lectures and help to expand
 the mathematical horizon of the student (instances are the properties 
of the Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric determinant, the properties of 
associated matrices, and so on).</p>
<p>Compared with other problem book, this one has few new basic 
features. They include problems dealing with polynomial matrices (Sec. 
13), linear transformations of affine and metric spaces (Secs. 18 and 
19), and a supplement devoted to group rings, and fields. The problems 
of the supplement deal with the most elementary portions of the theory. 
Still and all, I think it can be used in pre-seminar discussions in the 
first and second years of study.</p>
<p>Starred numbers indicated problems that have been worked out or 
provided with hints. Solutions are given for a small number of problems.</p><p>The book was translated from the Russian by <em>George Yankovsky</em> and was first published by Mir Publishers in 1978.</p><p>Contents</p>
