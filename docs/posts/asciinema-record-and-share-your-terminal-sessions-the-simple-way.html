  <p>Been going through Mosteller’s <em>50 challenging problems in probability</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There are 100 coins in a box. In each box there’s 1 fake. 100 boxes are tested. What is the chance of going undetected? What if it’s <code>n</code> instead of 100?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Same as above but now each box has <code>m</code> fakes. Same sampling procedure. What is the chance of getting exactly <code>r</code>  ripoffs from <code>n</code> boxes and <code>m</code> fakes?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spores produce mold colonies on gelatin plates in a lab. Each plate has an average of 3 colonies. What fraction of plates has exactly 3? What if the average is a large integer <code>m</code>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A salesman sells an average of 20 cakes on a round. What is the probability of selling an even number of cakes? (We assume sales follow poisson)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="answers">Answers</h2>

<p>27 and 28 are solved sort of at the same time.</p>

<p>I will handle the general case of <code>n</code> boxes, <code>r</code> ripoffs, and <code>m</code> fakes per box. The chance of getting a fake is <code>m/n</code>. The chance of not getting a fake is <code>1-m/n</code>. The chance of getting exactly <code>r</code> ripoffs in <code>n</code> boxes is <code>binom(n, r) * (1-m/n)^(n-r) * (m/n)^r</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>n</code> is unlimited and <code>m</code> is limited, then the chance of success is infinitesimal. This is a binomial with unlimited trials and infinitesimal success probability: a Poisson distribution by similar reasoning as in <a href="http://alok.github.io/2022/09/12/y539043">this derivation of the exponential Taylor series</a>. Then the chance of getting exactly <code>r</code> ripoffs is <code>e^(-m) * m^r / r!</code> .</p>

<p>If <code>m</code> is large (say also unlimited), then the chance of success is <code>e^(-m) * m^m/m!</code>. This is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi  m}}\).</p>

<p>For 29, the chance of getting exactly 3 colonies is <code>e^-3 * 3^3 / 3!</code>. This is Poisson because the probability of a specific patch being infected is small, thus idealized as infinitesimal. The rate is just the average, 3.</p>

<p>For 30, just assuming Poisson seems sus to me, but 1 rationalization is that the salesman has a lot of customers and never sells to 2 at once. Chance of sale is low per person. Chance of selling an even amount is sum of  <code>Poisson(n,rate=20)</code> for all even <code>n</code>. This turns out to be <code>cosh(rate)*e^(-rate) = 1/2</code>. Satisfying and intuitive. I’m guessing to get the odd numbers instead, use sinh over cosh. If his rate was 1, then he’d have a 56\% chance of selling an even amount.</p>
