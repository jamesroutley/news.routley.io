</div><p>A recent study by behavioral biologists from Wageningen University &amp; Research and the German Primate Research Center has uncovered a remarkable phenomenon among wild chimpanzees in West Africa: the use of stones to produce sound, presumably as a form of communication.</p>


										    
																					<p>Over the course of a five-year field study, the research team collected <a href="https://phys.org/tags/video+footage/" rel="tag">video footage</a> at five distinct locations within a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/nature+reserve/" rel="tag">nature reserve</a> in Guinea-Bissau. This was made possible through the use of camera traps and with essential support from local field guides. In specific areas, a striking behavioral pattern was observed: adult male chimpanzees repeatedly struck stones against <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tree+trunks/" rel="tag">tree trunks</a>, resulting in characteristic piles of stones at the base of these trees.</p>
<p>The study is <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2025.0053" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Biology Letters</i>.</p>

</figure><p>Lead author Sem van Loon refers to this behavior as &#34;stone-assisted drumming.&#34; &#34;It appears to be related to the classic drumming with hands or feet on hollow buttress roots, which chimpanzees use to convey information over long distances or to display dominance,&#34; she explains.</p>
<p>Yet there are clear differences: prior to throwing stones, the animals are more likely to emit loud pant-hoots, followed by silenceâ€”an opposite pattern to traditional drumming, where silence typically precedes the noise.</p>
<p>Van Loon suspects a different motivation behind this behavior. &#34;It may be that these loud, low-frequency sounds are meant to carry further than typical within-group communication,&#34; she suggests. &#34;The acoustic properties of a stone striking a tree make that feasible in densely forested areas.&#34;</p>

</figure><p>The observations point to cultural transmission. Young chimpanzees adopt the behavior from older group members, indicating that it is learned socially rather than genetically inherited.</p>
<p>Marc Naguib, Professor of Behavioral Ecology, underscores the broader significance of the discovery: &#34;It illustrates that culture is not unique to humans and that such behaviors need to be considered also in nature conservation.&#34;</p>
