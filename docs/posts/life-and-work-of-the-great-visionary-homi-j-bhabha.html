    <h1>Life and work of the great Visionary, Homi J. Bhabha</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="JYFd0b"><p>Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born in Bombay on October 30, 1909 to Jehangir and Meherbai Bhabha. Jehangir Bhabha had grown up in Bangalore and was educated at Oxford. After receiving his training as a lawyer in England, Jehangir started working in Mysore where he joined the judicial service of the state. He married Meherbai, daughter of Bhikaji Framji Pandey and granddaughter of the renowned philanthropist, Dinshaw Petit of Bombay. After marriage, the couple moved to Bombay, the first commercial city of British India where young Bhabha spent his childhood.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/young-homi-with-his-parents-tifr-archives/MQG8M8b4YTh3Pg" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Young Homi with his parents" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Homi with his parents, Meherbai Bhabha and Jehangir Bhabha</p></div><p>Homi was named after his paternal grandfather, Hormusji Bhabha, Inspector General of Education in Mysore.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/bhabha-with-parents-grandfather-and-aunt-meherbai-tata-tifr-archives/bAG9_iRJ32oDrA" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Bhabha with parents, grandfather and aunt Meherbai Tata" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Homi with his parents, grandfather and Aunt Meherbai Tata</p></div><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/hormusji-bhabha-grandfather-tifr-archives/-wFJgmJ5-c76Gg" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Hormusji Bhabha, grandfather" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Hormusji Bhabha, grandfather of Homi Bhabha</p></div><p>Homi’s paternal aunt, also Meherbai, was married to Dorab Tata, the elder son of the pioneer of Indian industry, Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata.

Heitler, then at Cambridge, Bhabha explained the cosmic-ray shower formation in a paper published in 1937.</p><p>It had been discovered by 1918 that there is a strong level of radiation in the upper atmosphere. Robert Millikan, who was the first to identify that the origin of the radiation was from outside the Earth, called it cosmic radiation.</p><p>A high-energy particle from the Sun, or from some remote source like a star, a galaxy, or a quasar, hits the atoms of the upper atmosphere. This hard hit causes the nuclei of these atoms to disintegrate, creating a number of high-energy fragments and new particles. These fragments fly off with enough energy to hit neighboring atoms and cause their nuclei in turn to disintegrate and fly off.</p><p>To explain the penetrating component, Bhabha made the far-reaching hypothesis that there must exist a new particle with the same characteristics as the electron but approximately 100 times heavier.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/cosmic-shower-tifr-archives/3AHC5PqPM3BXag" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Cosmic Shower" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>The Bhabha-Heitler picture of a shower produced by a cascadde of electromagnetic processes</p></div><p>Bhabha was also the first to point out that cosmic rays, moving at speeds close to that of light, are the best place to verify the conclusions of Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity. For example, mesons, which normally decay within a distance of half a kilometer, can travel more than 10 km down to the Earth’s surface because relativistic time dilation increases their decay lifetime.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/cosmic-shower-with-secondary-cosmic-ray-particles-tifr-archives/igFIi5ftFuAuKA" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Cosmic shower with secondary cosmic ray particles" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Production of secondary cosmic ray particles in terrestial atmosphere</p></div><p>Bhabha held the Rouse Ball Travelling studentship from 1932-34 during which he visited Enrico Fermi at the Institute of Physics in Rome.</p><p>Bhabha came to India for a holiday in 1939, but the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 made him change his plans.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/bhabha-s-sketch-of-c-v-raman-tifr-archives/UwHbHA_aEfzbEw" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Bhabha&#39;s sketch of C.V.

In a letter to Sir Sorab Saklatvala he wrote:</p><p>“ ....There is at the moment in India no big school of research in the fundamental problems of physics, both theoretical and experimental.... It is absolutely in the interest of India to have a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics, for such a school forms the spearhead of research not only in less advanced branches of physics but also in problems of immediate practical application in industry.”</p><p>In the same letter he writes : “ When nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production in, say, a couple of decades from now , India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand.”</p><p>&#34; The scheme I am now submitting to you is but an embryo from  which I hope to build up in the course of time a school of physics comparable with the best anywhere.&#34;</p><p>The Trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust accepted Bhabha’s proposal.</p><p>Dr H.J. Bhabha was appointed as Director of the Institute from June 1, 1945.  Prof. D.D. Kosambi was appointed as the Professor of Mathematics from June 16, 1945.</p><p>The Institute may be considered to have commenced its work on June 1, 1945 at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/indian-institute-of-science-bangalore/aQEUN_BmK6ZrNw" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</p></div><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/kenilworth-tifr-archives/ngG3PX3DCISQVQ" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Kenilworth" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Kenilworth- the bungalow from where TIFR functioned during 1945-1949</p></div><p>The Institute was shifted to Bombay and formally inaugurated by Sir John Colville, Governor of Bombay, on December 19, 1945.</p><p>In a memorable inaugural lecture about the state of research in the world, Bhabha also discussed the philosophical aspects of science:</p><div><p>Bhabha with John Colville and Sorab Saklatvala at the inauguration of TIFR in 1945 Bhabha at the inauguration of TIFR at Kenilworth. John Colville and Sorab Saklatvala are seen sitting.</p></div><p>The new institute grew rapidly. As brilliant individuals joined TIFR to set up and lead research groups, the institute’s departments grew steadily around them. The first research areas to be taken up were theoretical physics, experimental work in cosmic rays and high-energy physics, and mathematics. For Bhabha, research in modern experimental areas was of critical importance, not only for its own sake and to  provide the right balance for the theoretical studies, but  also for the consequent confidence that it generated  in the design, fabrication and use of equipment. For similar reasons, Bhabha understood the importance of developing mathematics at TIFR.</p><div><p>R.R Daniel B. V Sreekantan</p></div><p>The mathematician K. Chandrasekharan, joined the Institute on 1st July,1949</p><p>Later in September 1949, the Institute moved from its 6000 square feet old premises on Pedder Road to 35,000 square feet at the Old Yacht Club near the Gateway of India.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/old-yacht-club-tifr-archives/IgGizAM-HG8eoA" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Old Yacht Club" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Old Yacht Club, which continues to be the location of the Department of Atomic Energy</p></div><p>Bernard Peters joined TIFR in 1951 as a Professor in Experimental Physics and stayed on till 1958, directing research work on cosmic rays and nuclear emulsions.</p><p>From the outset, Bhabha was aware of the need to plan for the growing energy requirements of a developing nation. In his proposal for the new institute in 1944, he emphasized the need for research into nuclear physics:</p><p>The Atomic Research Committee, appointed by the CSIR recommended that TIFR should be the centre of all large-scale research activity in nuclear physics in India. The Committee recommended that a high-energy accelerator capable of producing particles of energy above 200 MeV and sufficient to create mesons, should be set up in TIFR . A Committee was set up to appoint a team of ten scientists and train them in techniques of Nuclear Physics. </p><p>This was soon followed by a plan for the country’s nuclear power policy which Bhabha set out in a note entitled “Oraganisation of Atomic Research in India” addressed to Prime Minister Nehru on April 26, 1948. In his note Bhabha proposed the creation of an Atomic Energy Commission.</p><p>Research in nuclear physics began at TIFR in the early 1950s. The one million-volt Cockroft -Walton accelerator (Cascade Generator) was installed in the Institute in 1953. It was used extensively by scientist of TIFR as well as from various other scientific institutes.</p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/bhabha-in-front-of-the-cascade-generator-tifr-archives/_gET_u4Hkwm85w" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Bhabha in front of the Cascade Generator" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Bhabha in front of the Cascade Generator in TIFR</p></div><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/international-conference-on-elementary-particles-hosted-by-tifr-tifr-archives/mwFqxGFuSqTl2Q" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="International conference on Elementary Particles hosted by TIFR" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>International Conference on Elementary Particles hosted by TIFR in 1950</p></div><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/bhabha-at-atomic-energy-establishment-trombay-tifr-archives/3wE3745Xne_7bA" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Bhabha at Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Bhabha at Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay</p></div><p>In the 1950s, with TIFR growing rapidly, it was again time to change to a permanent location. </p><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/proposed-site-of-tata-institute-of-fundamental-research-at-colaba-tifr-archives/nwGDZjV40lKYHw" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Proposed site of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research at Colaba" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Proposed site of TIFR at Colaba</p></div><div><a href="https://chanind.github.io/asset/architect-s-drawing-tifr-archives/lgHWj1gdcPtk2w" jsmodel="nDkrdf" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md; mousedown:jScpfc; touchstart:jScpfc; touchmove:NI7Syc; mouseup:nHXBQb; touchend:nHXBQb; mouseleave:FfcXAd; blur:ll011b;" jscontroller="eFtfHd" title="Architect&#39;s Drawing" jsshadow=""><span jsslot=""></span></a><p>Architect&#39;s drawing of the Institute Building</p></div><p>“The Institute appointed for its architect a well-known American firm, Holabird, Root &amp; Burgee because till today they have designed several laboratories, including one for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission....

Half of the cost of the reactor was borne by India and the other half was met by Canada under the Colombo plan. Mr. N. B.
