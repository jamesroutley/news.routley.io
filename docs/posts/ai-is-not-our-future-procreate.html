Built on a foundation of theft, the technology is steering us toward a barren future.  We think machine learning is a compelling technology with a lot of merit, but the path generative AI is on is wrong for us.</p><p>We&#39;re here for the humans. We&#39;re not chasing a technology that is a moral threat to our greatest jewel: human creativity. In this technological rush, this might make us an exception or seem at risk of being left behind. But we see this road less travelled as the more exciting and fruitful one for our community.</p></div></div></section></div><!----><!--]--><!--]--></main></div></div>
