        <p><em><span><strong>Work described in this story was made possible in part by federal funding supported by taxpayers. At Harvard Medical School, the future of efforts like this — done in service to humanity — now hangs in the balance due to the government’s decision to terminate large numbers of federally funded grants and contracts across Harvard University.</strong></span></em></p><p><span lang="EN">All day long, our brains carry out complicated and energy-intensive tasks such as remembering, solving problems, and making decisions. </span></p><p><span lang="EN">To supply the energy these tasks require while conserving this precious fuel, the brain has evolved a system that allows it to quickly and efficiently send blood only to the areas that need it most in any given moment. This system is essential to brain function and overall health, yet how it works has remained somewhat of a mystery.</span></p><p><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/sign-email-communications"><span lang="EN">Get more HMS news</span></a></p><p><span lang="EN">Now, a team led by researchers at Harvard Medical School has uncovered new details of how the brain moves blood to active areas in real time. Their </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00732-9"><span lang="EN">findings are published July 16 in </span><em><span lang="EN">Cell</span></em></a><em><span lang="EN">.</span></em><span lang="EN"></span></p><p><span lang="EN">In experiments in mice, the team discovered that the brain uses specialized channels in the lining of its blood vessels to communicate where blood is needed.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">“This work helps us understand how you can get that super-important blood supply to the correct areas of the brain on a time scale that is useful,” said co-lead author </span><a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/169438"><span lang="EN">Luke Kaplan</span></a><span lang="EN">, a research fellow in neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS. </span></p><p><span lang="EN">If confirmed in additional studies in animals and humans, the findings could be used to better understand findings on brain imaging tests such as functional MRI (fMRI). The insights may also advance understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, in which this communication system often breaks down, leading to cognitive problems. </span></p><h3><span lang="EN">A long-standing mechanistic puzzle </span></h3><p><span lang="EN">In the late 1800s, Italian physician Angelo Mosso observed something intriguing in a patient with a skull defect that left an area of his brain exposed: When the patient got angry, parts of the exposed area instantly swelled with blood — hinting at a connection between brain activity and blood flow. </span></p><p><span lang="EN">A century later, this connection became the basis of fMRI, a type of brain scan that measures blood flow to different regions as a proxy for neural activity while individuals perform various tasks. </span></p><p><span lang="EN">The brain is one of the body’s most energy-demanding organs, accounting for 2 percent of the body’s weight but consuming 20 percent of its total energy. To stay within budget, the brain must be highly efficient: It rapidly directs blood flow to the regions that need it the most, explained senior author </span><a href="https://gu.hms.harvard.edu/"><span lang="EN">Chenghua Gu</span></a><span lang="EN">, professor of neurobiology at HMS. </span></p>
