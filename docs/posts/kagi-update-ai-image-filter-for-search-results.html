    <h1>Kagi Update: AI Image Filter for Search Results</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-6b87e69f=""><div data-v-6b87e69f=""><div><p>As AI-generated images become increasingly prevalent across the web, many users find their image search results cluttered with artificial content. This can be particularly frustrating when searching for authentic, human-created images or specific real-world references.</p><p>At Kagi, we understand the importance of delivering high-quality, relevant search results. Our AI Image Filter feature is designed to address this challenge, giving users more control over the content they see and prioritizing authentic imagery in search results.</p><h2 id="downranking-ai-generated-images" tabindex="-1">Downranking AI-generated images <a href="#downranking-ai-generated-images" aria-label="Permalink to &#34;Downranking AI-generated images&#34;">​</a></h2><p>By default, <a href="https://kagi.com/images" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kagi Image Search</a> downranks images from websites with a high proportion of AI-generated content. Try the example search <a href="https://kagi.com/images?q=baby+cat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p><img src="https://help.kagi.com/assets/kagi_vs_google_image_search.697001c9.png" alt="Kagi vs Google AI-generated images" width="720px" data-zoomable=""/></p><h2 id="labeling-ai-generated-images" tabindex="-1">Labeling AI-generated images <a href="#labeling-ai-generated-images" aria-label="Permalink to &#34;Labeling AI-generated images&#34;">​</a></h2><p>In addition to downranking, we have implemented an AI image labeling system. This feature adds a small badge or icon to thumbnails that are likely to be AI-generated content. The label helps users quickly identify potential AI images without completely removing them from search results.</p><p><img src="https://help.kagi.com/assets/image_search_ai_label.f8dce12e.png" alt="Kagi AI Image Label" width="720px" data-zoomable=""/></p><h2 id="filtering-ai-generated-images" tabindex="-1">Filtering AI-generated images <a href="#filtering-ai-generated-images" aria-label="Permalink to &#34;Filtering AI-generated images&#34;">​</a></h2><p>You can use the AI images filter to completely exclude websites with AI-generated images from your search results.</p><video src="/assets/exclude_ai_images_filter.5e996806.mp4" width="720" type="video/mp4" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" disablepictureinpicture="" alt="Kagi Image Search - Exclude AI Images Filter"></video><h2 id="you-are-in-control-block-websites-in-image-search-results" tabindex="-1">You are in control: Block websites in image search results <a href="#you-are-in-control-block-websites-in-image-search-results" aria-label="Permalink to &#34;You are in control: Block websites in image search results&#34;">​</a></h2><p>Note that, since there is currently no reliable way to automatically identify AI-generated images with good enough precision, this feature relies on the website&#39;s reputation rather than analyzing individual images. As a result, some AI-generated content may still appear in the results.</p><p>If you detect a website with AI or low quality imagery that slipped through our filter, you can lower or completely block it off in your search results, using our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/website-info-personalized-results.html">search personalization feature</a>.</p><p>Click on shield icon in your image search results, the same as you already can do in web search results.</p><p><img src="https://help.kagi.com/assets/block_domain.4dab6216.gif" alt="Kagi Image search personalization"/></p><h2 id="our-approach-to-ai-generated-images" tabindex="-1">Our approach to AI-generated images <a href="#our-approach-to-ai-generated-images" aria-label="Permalink to &#34;Our approach to AI-generated images&#34;">​</a></h2><p>The decision to implement this feature and have it turned on by default is based on our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html">AI integration philosophy</a> and direct <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/4972-ability-to-filter-out-obvious-ai-image-websites-from-image-search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">user feedback</a>.</p><p>This is farily new territory so do not expect the detection to be 100% reliable. We will be working more to improve this in the future.
