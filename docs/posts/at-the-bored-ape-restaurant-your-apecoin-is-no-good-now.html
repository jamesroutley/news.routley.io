    <h1>At the Bored Ape restaurant, your ApeCoin is no good now</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><div data-subscriber-content=""><p>When Bored &amp; Hungry <u><a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2022-04-19/bored-ape-nft-restaurant-la-long-beach">first opened in Long Beach</a></u> in April, the burger joint didn’t just embrace the aesthetics of crypto culture. It was all-in on the digital money part too.</p><p>Sure, meme-y references to <u><a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/moon" target="_blank">rockets</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp#toc-what-is-a-bull" target="_blank">bulls</a></u> dotted the walls, and Bored Apes — those cartoon monkeys that celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Post Malone have <a href="https://decrypt.co/86135/biggest-celebrity-nft-owners-bored-ape-yacht-club" target="_blank">touted</a> as six-figure investments — covered the cups and trays. But customers were also offered the option to pay for their meals in cryptocurrency. The restaurant was putting its bitcoin where its mouth was, so to speak.</p><p>Not even three months later, in the midst of a crypto crash that has some investors looking for the door, that is no longer the case.</p><p>During a lull in the lunch rush one recent afternoon, as a cashier stamped paper bags with the fast-food spot’s logo, twin menus hanging over his head — listing Bored &amp; Hungry’s meat-based and vegan options, respectively — showed prices only in old-fashioned U.S. dollars.</p><p>A smashburger: $9.25. Pepper-seasoned fries: $3.50. An ape-themed cup of soda: $3.50. </p><p>Missing: any mention of ethereum or apecoin, the two currencies the popup boasted it would make history by accepting as payment.</p><p>Also missing: owner Andy Nguyen, who didn’t respond to repeated emails asking about the change. </p><p>But an employee who declined to give their name said that the store wasn’t accepting crypto payments. “Not today — I don’t know,” they said, declining to clarify how long ago the store stopped accepting crypto or whether that option will eventually return.</p><p>With both coins down more than 60% since early April and undergoing double-digit intra-day swings, it would be understandable for any business to be reluctant to accept them in lieu of dollars. But utility may also be a factor. At the restaurant’s grand opening, a staffer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2022-04-19/bored-ape-nft-restaurant-la-long-beach">told The Times</a> that the crypto payments were unwieldy and going largely ignored by customers.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" data-lazy-load="true" data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c9b0618/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/320x240!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b651821/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/568x426!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dec9270/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/768x576!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/093e223/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/840x630!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 840w" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-sizes="100vw"/>     <img alt="The crypto-themed interior of the Bored &amp; Hungry restaurant." data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7341f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/320x240!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9734abf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/568x426!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/477b965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/768x576!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d1ddbe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/840x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG 840w" data-sizes="100vw" width="840" height="630" data-src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d1ddbe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/840x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcb%2F6d%2F4802bce6484bb025bda55814e65d%2Ffi-bored-and-hungry-003.JPG" data-lazy-load="true" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/>  </picture>   <div> <p>Restaurateur Andy Nguyen says he paid more than $330,000 for the different ape-themed NFTs that form the basis of his restaurant’s brand.</p><p>(Brian Contreras / Los Angeles Times)</p> </div>  </figure></div><p>Nearly three months later, it was hard to find a patron who cared much one way or the other about the restaurant’s fidelity to the crypto cause.</p><p>“Yes, ethereum is a currency in a way where you can exchange [non-fungible tokens, or] NFTs and stuff … but as far as buying food and all that, maybe not,” one crypto-enthusiast diner, Marc Coloma, said as he munched on fries outside the restaurant. “People want to hold onto their ethereum. They’re not gonna want to use it.”</p><p>Michael Powers, 46, of Long Beach was less in the loop. He comes to Bored &amp; Hungry a lot — as often as two or three times a week, he estimated — but although the ape-themed signage was what first drew him in, he didn’t know the spot was NFT-themed until his sons explained it to him.</p><p>Powers’ one foray into crypto, an investment in the Elon Musk-promoted currency dogecoin, didn’t end well, and he doesn’t plan on trying again. “I’ve had my fill” of crypto, he said — though not of the burgers, which offer an upscale riff on In-N-Out’s “animal style” sandwiches. (The chopped onions and creamy sauce are a nice touch that, incidentally, isn’t subject to wild swings in value or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ethereum-gas-fees-skyrocket-bored-ape-yacht-club-otherside-nft-launch" target="_blank">exorbitant</a> transaction fees.)</p><p>Another Long Beach local, 30-year-old Richard Rubalcaba, said he bought into ethereum after meeting other crypto investors during the four-hour wait for Bored &amp; Hungry’s grand opening. But on this visit he too paid in U.S. dollars. </p><p>“I don’t know how [crypto purchases] would work, with the crash,” he said.</p><p>The crypto ecosystem is <u><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-06-20/crypto-investors-hot-streak-ends-as-harsh-winter-descends">currently in free-fall</a></u>, with high-profile companies either taking drastic steps to stave off catastrophe or simply collapsing altogether, while cryptocurrencies themselves <u><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-05-13/why-is-crypto-bitcoin-luna-crashing-explainer">plunge in value</a></u>.</p><p>The two e-currencies that Bored &amp; Hungry initially accepted, <u><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" target="_blank">ethereum</a></u> and <u><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/apecoin-ape/" target="_blank">apecoin</a></u>, are down to about 23% and 17% of their highs over the last year, respectively. Estimates put the entire sector at worth less than a third of what it was in early 2022.</p><p>Nor have the non-fungible tokens that form the backbone of Bored &amp; Hungry’s brand been immune. A sort of digital trading card series built around drawings of anthropomorphic monkeys, Bored Apes count the likes of Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg among their <u><a href="https://decrypt.co/86135/biggest-celebrity-nft-owners-bored-ape-yacht-club" target="_blank">owners</a></u>; some have sold for <u><a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/most-expensive-bored-ape-nft-sells-for-2-7-million/articleshow/87162740.cms" target="_blank">millions</a></u> of dollars.
