    <h1>Why pipes sometimes get &#34;stuck&#34;: buffering</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     <p>Here’s a niche terminal problem that has bothered me for years but that I never
really understood until a few weeks ago. Let’s say you’re running this command
to watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I’d see
is… nothing! It doesn’t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,
there just wouldn’t be any output.</p>
<p>I internalized this as “uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don’t
show me the output, that’s weird”, and I’d handle it by just
running <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>
<p>So as I’ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was
really excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-happens-buffering">why this happens: buffering</h3>
<p>The reason why “pipes get stuck” sometimes is that it’s VERY common for
programs to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the
pipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data
to the pipe!</p>
<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you
can uses more system calls, so it’s more efficient to save up data until you
have 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it
to the pipe.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has
8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>
<h3 id="programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal">programs don’t buffer when writing to a terminal</h3>
<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>
will work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops
working!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends
on whether it’s writing to a terminal or not.</p>
<p>Here’s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function
<ul>
<li>If it’s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>
<li>Otherwise, use “block buffering” – only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you’ll see the line as
soon as it’s printed, but if it’s writing to a pipe, you won’t.</p>
<p>Of course the buffer size isn’t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc’s buffer size is
defined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100">Here’s where that’s defined in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>(as an aside: “programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a
terminal” isn’t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB
buffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be
extremely weird if it did that, I can’t think of any program that behaves that
way)</p>
<h3 id="commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t">commands that buffer &amp; commands that don’t</h3>
<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to
remember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>
<p>Some commands that <strong>don’t</strong> buffer their output:</p>
<ul>
<li>tail</li>
<li>cat</li>
<li>tee</li>
</ul>
<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it’s a command
where you’re likely to be using it for batch processing. Here’s a list of some
common commands that buffer their output when writing to a pipe, along with the
flag that disables block buffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>grep (<code>--line-buffered</code>)</li>
<li>sed (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>awk (there’s a <code>fflush()</code> function)</li>
<li>tcpdump (<code>-l</code>)</li>
<li>jq (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>tr (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>cut (can’t disable buffering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ones I can think of, lots of unix commands (like <code>sort</code>) may
or may not buffer their output but it doesn’t matter because <code>sort</code> can’t do
anything until it finishes receiving input anyway.</p>
<p>Also I did my best to test both the Mac OS and GNU versions of these but there
are a lot of variations and I might have made some mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="programming-languages-where-the-default-print-statement-buffers">programming languages where the default “print” statement buffers</h3>
<p>Also, here are a few programming language where the default print statement
will buffer output when writing to a pipe, and some ways to disable buffering
if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>C (disable with <code>setvbuf</code>)</li>
<li>Python (disable with <code>python -u</code>, or <code>PYTHON_UNBUFFERED=1</code>, or <code>sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=False)</code>, or <code>print(x, flush=True)</code>)</li>
<li>Ruby (disable with <code>STDOUT.sync = true</code>)</li>
<li>Perl (disable with <code>$| = 1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that these languages are designed this way so that the default print
function will be fast when you’re doing batch processing.</p>
<p>Also whether output is buffered or not might depend on what print function you
use, for example in Rust <code>print!</code> buffers when writing to a pipe but <code>println!</code>
will flush its output.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-press-ctrl-c-on-a-pipe-the-contents-of-the-buffer-are-lost">when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code> on a pipe, the contents of the buffer are lost</h3>
<p>Let’s say you’re running this command as a hacky way to watch for DNS requests
to <code>example.com</code>, and you forgot to pass <code>-l</code> to tcpdump:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 | grep example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>, what happens? In a magical perfect world, what I would
<em>want</em> to happen is for <code>tcpdump</code> to flush its buffer, <code>grep</code> would search for
<code>example.com</code>, and I would see all the output I missed.</p>
<p>But in the real world, what happens is that all the programs get killed and the
output in <code>tcpdump</code>’s buffer is lost.</p>
<p>I think this problem is probably unavoidable – I spent a little time with
<code>strace</code> to see how this works and <code>grep</code> receives the <code>SIGINT</code> before
<code>tcpdump</code> anyway so even if <code>tcpdump</code> tried to flush its buffer <code>grep</code> would
already be dead.</p>
<small>
<p>After a little more investigation, there is a workaround: if you find
<code>tcpdump</code>’s PID and <code>kill -TERM $PID</code>, then tcpdump will flush the buffer so
you can see the output. That’s kind of a pain but I tested it and it seems to
work.</p>
</small>
<h3 id="redirecting-to-a-file-also-buffers">redirecting to a file also buffers</h3>
<p>It’s not just pipes, this will also buffer:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Redirecting to a file doesn’t have the same “<code>Ctrl-C</code> will totally destroy the
contents of the buffer” problem though – in my experience it usually behaves
more like you’d want, where the contents of the buffer get written to the file
before the program exits. I’m not 100% sure whether this is something you can
always rely on or not.</p>
<h3 id="a-bunch-of-potential-ways-to-avoid-buffering">a bunch of potential ways to avoid buffering</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s talk solutions. Let’s say you’ve run this command or s</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>I asked people on Mastodon how they would solve this in practice and there were
5 basic approaches. Here they are:</p>
<h4 id="solution-1-run-a-program-that-finishes-quickly">solution 1: run a program that finishes quickly</h4>
<p>Historically my solution to this has been to just avoid the “command writing to
pipe slowly” situation completely and instead run a program that will finish quickly
like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2 | tail
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t do the same thing as the original command but it does mean that
you get to avoid thinking about these weird buffering issues.</p>
<p>(you could also do <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file</code> but I often prefer to use an
“unnecessary” <code>cat</code>)</p>
<h4 id="solution-2-remember-the-line-buffer-flag-to-grep">solution 2: remember the “line buffer” flag to grep</h4>
<p>You could remember that grep has a flag to avoid buffering and pass it like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep --line-buffered thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="solution-3-use-awk">solution 3: use awk</h4>
<p>Some people said that if they’re specifically dealing with a multiple greps
situation, they’ll rewrite it to use a single <code>awk</code> instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  awk &#39;/thing1/ &amp;&amp; /thing2/&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Or you would write a more complicated <code>grep</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  grep -E &#39;thing1.*thing2&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>awk</code> also buffers, so for this to work you’ll want <code>awk</code> to be the last command in the pipeline)</p>
<h4 id="solution-4-use-stdbuf">solution 4: use <code>stdbuf</code></h4>
<p><code>stdbuf</code> uses LD_PRELOAD to turn off libc’s buffering, and you can use it to turn off output buffering like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | stdbuf -o0 grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Like any <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> solution it’s a bit unreliable – it doesn’t work on
static binaries, I think won’t work if the program isn’t using libc’s
buffering, and doesn’t always work on Mac OS. Harry Marr has a really nice <a href="https://hmarr.com/blog/how-stdbuf-works/">How stdbuf works</a> post.</p>
<h4 id="solution-5-use-unbuffer">solution 5: use <code>unbuffer</code></h4>
<p><code>unbuffer program</code> will force the program’s output to be a TTY, which means
that it’ll behave the way it normally would on a TTY (less buffering, colour
output, etc). You could use it in this example like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | unbuffer grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>stdbuf</code> it will always work, though it might have unwanted side
effects, for example <code>grep thing1</code>’s will also colour matches.</p>
<p>If you want to install unbuffer, it’s in the <code>expect</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-the-solutions-i-know-about">that’s all the solutions I know about!</h3>
<p>It’s a bit hard for me to say which one is “best”, I think personally I’m
mostly likely to use <code>unbuffer</code> because I know it’s always going to work.</p>
<p>If I learn about more solutions I’ll try to add them to this post.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-not-really-sure-how-often-this-comes-up">I’m not really sure how often this comes up</h3>
<p>I think it’s not very common for me to have a program that slowly trickles data
into a pipe like this, normally if I’m using a pipe a bunch of data gets
written very quickly, processed by everything in the pipeline, and then
everything exits. The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li><code>tail -f</code></li>
<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>
<li>the output of a slow computation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering">what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?</h3>
<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn
off buffering, like <code>PYTHON_UNBUFFERED</code> in Python. I got this idea from a
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering-2.html">blog posts</a> by Mark Dominus
in 2018. Maybe <code>NO_BUFFER</code> like <a href="https://no-color.org/">NO_COLOR</a>?</p>
<p>The design seems tricky to get right; Mark points out that NETBSD has <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/setbuf.3">environment variables called <code>STDBUF</code>, <code>STDBUF1</code>, etc</a> which gives you a
ton of control over buffering but I imagine most developers don’t want to
implement many different environment variables to handle a relatively minor
edge case.</p>
<p>I’m also curious about whether there are any programs that just automatically
flush their output buffers after some period of time (like 1 second). It feels
like it would be nice in theory but I can’t think of any program that does that
so I imagine there are some downsides.</p>
<h3 id="stuff-i-left-out">stuff I left out</h3>
<p>Some things I didn’t talk about in this post since these posts have been
getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000
words about buffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between line buffering and having totally unbuffered output</li>
<li>how buffering to stderr is different from buffering to stdout</li>
<li>this post is only about buffering that happens <strong>inside the program</strong>, your
operating system’s TTY driver also does a little bit of buffering sometimes</li>
<li>other reasons you might need to flush your output other than “you’re writing
to a pipe”</li>
</ul>
