    <h1>Why pipes sometimes get &#34;stuck&#34;: buffering</h1>
    
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a niche terminal problem that has bothered me for years but that I never
really understood until a few weeks ago. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command
to watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I&rsquo;d see
is&hellip; nothing! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,
there just wouldn&rsquo;t be any output.</p>
<p>I internalized this as &ldquo;uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don&rsquo;t
show me the output, that&rsquo;s weird&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d handle it by just
running <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was
really excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-happens-buffering">why this happens: buffering</h3>
<p>The reason why &ldquo;pipes get stuck&rdquo; sometimes is that it&rsquo;s VERY common for
programs to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the
pipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data
to the pipe!</p>
<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you
can uses more system calls, so it&rsquo;s more efficient to save up data until you
have 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it
to the pipe.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has
8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>
<h3 id="programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal">programs don&rsquo;t buffer when writing to a terminal</h3>
<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>
will work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops
working!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends
on whether it&rsquo;s writing to a terminal or not.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function
<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>
<li>Otherwise, use &ldquo;block buffering&rdquo; &ndash; only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you&rsquo;ll see the line as
soon as it&rsquo;s printed, but if it&rsquo;s writing to a pipe, you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of course the buffer size isn&rsquo;t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc&rsquo;s buffer size is
defined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100">Here&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s defined in glibc</a>.</p>
<p>(as an aside: &ldquo;programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a
terminal&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB
buffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be
extremely weird if it did that, I can&rsquo;t think of any program that behaves that
way)</p>
<h3 id="commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t">commands that buffer &amp; commands that don&rsquo;t</h3>
<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to
remember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>
<p>Some commands that <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> buffer their output:</p>
<ul>
<li>tail</li>
<li>cat</li>
<li>tee</li>
</ul>
<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it&rsquo;s a command
where you&rsquo;re likely to be using it for batch processing. Here&rsquo;s a list of some
common commands that buffer their output when writing to a pipe, along with the
flag that disables block buffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>grep (<code>--line-buffered</code>)</li>
<li>sed (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>awk (there&rsquo;s a <code>fflush()</code> function)</li>
<li>tcpdump (<code>-l</code>)</li>
<li>jq (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>tr (<code>-u</code>)</li>
<li>cut (can&rsquo;t disable buffering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are all the ones I can think of, lots of unix commands (like <code>sort</code>) may
or may not buffer their output but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because <code>sort</code> can&rsquo;t do
anything until it finishes receiving input anyway.</p>
<h3 id="programming-languages-where-the-default-print-statement-buffers">programming languages where the default &ldquo;print&rdquo; statement buffers</h3>
<p>Also, here are a few programming language where the default print statement
will buffer output when writing to a pipe, and some ways to disable buffering
if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>C (disable with <code>setvbuf</code>)</li>
<li>Python (disable with <code>python -u</code>, or <code>PYTHON_UNBUFFERED=1</code>, or <code>sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=False)</code>, or <code>print(x, flush=True)</code>)</li>
<li>Ruby (disable with <code>STDOUT.sync = true</code>)</li>
<li>Perl (disable with <code>$| = 1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that these languages are designed this way so that the default print
function will be fast when you&rsquo;re doing batch processing.</p>
<p>Also whether output is buffered or not might depend on what print function you
use, for example in Rust <code>print!</code> buffers when writing to a pipe but <code>println!</code>
will flush its output.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-press-ctrl-c-on-a-pipe-the-contents-of-the-buffer-are-lost">when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code> on a pipe, the contents of the buffer are lost</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command as a hacky way to watch for DNS requests
to <code>example.com</code>, and you forgot to pass <code>-l</code> to tcpdump:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 | grep example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>, what happens? In a magical perfect world, what I would
<em>want</em> to happen is for <code>tcpdump</code> to flush its buffer, <code>grep</code> would search for
<code>example.com</code>, and I would see all the output I missed.</p>
<p>But in the real world, what happens is that all the programs get killed and the
output in <code>tcpdump</code>&rsquo;s buffer is lost.</p>
<p>I think this problem is probably unavoidable &ndash; I spent a little time with
<code>strace</code> to see how this works and <code>grep</code> receives the <code>SIGINT</code> before
<code>tcpdump</code> anyway so even if <code>tcpdump</code> tried to flush its buffer <code>grep</code> would
already be dead.</p>
<h3 id="redirecting-to-a-file-also-buffers">redirecting to a file also buffers</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just pipes, this will also buffer:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tcpdump -ni any port 53 &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Redirecting to a file doesn&rsquo;t have the same &ldquo;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will totally destroy the
contents of the buffer&rdquo; problem though &ndash; in my experience it usually behaves
more like you&rsquo;d want, where the contents of the buffer get written to the file
before the program exits. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure whether this is something you can
always rely on or not.</p>
<h3 id="a-bunch-of-potential-ways-to-avoid-buffering">a bunch of potential ways to avoid buffering</h3>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk solutions. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve run this command or s</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>I asked people on Mastodon how they would solve this in practice and there were
5 basic approaches. Here they are:</p>
<h4 id="solution-1-run-a-program-that-finishes-quickly">solution 1: run a program that finishes quickly</h4>
<p>Historically my solution to this has been to just avoid the &ldquo;command writing to
pipe slowly&rdquo; situation completely and instead run a program that will finish quickly
like this:</p>
<pre><code>cat /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2 | tail
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t do the same thing as the original command but it does mean that
you get to avoid thinking about these weird buffering issues.</p>
<p>(you could also do <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file</code> but I often prefer to use an
&ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; <code>cat</code>)</p>
<h4 id="solution-2-remember-the-line-buffer-flag-to-grep">solution 2: remember the &ldquo;line buffer&rdquo; flag to grep</h4>
<p>You could remember that grep has a flag to avoid buffering and pass it like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep --line-buffered thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="solution-3-use-awk">solution 3: use awk</h4>
<p>Some people said that if they&rsquo;re specifically dealing with a multiple greps
situation, they&rsquo;ll rewrite it to use a single <code>awk</code> instead, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  awk '/thing1/ &amp;&amp; /thing2/'
</code></pre>
<p>Or you would write a more complicated <code>grep</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file |  grep -E 'thing1.*thing2'
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>awk</code> also buffers, so for this to work you&rsquo;ll want <code>awk</code> to be the last command in the pipeline)</p>
<h4 id="solution-4-use-stdbuf">solution 4: use <code>stdbuf</code></h4>
<p><code>stdbuf</code> uses LD_PRELOAD to turn off libc&rsquo;s buffering, and you can use it to turn off output buffering like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | stdbuf -o0 grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Like any <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> solution it&rsquo;s a bit unreliable &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t work on
static binaries, I think won&rsquo;t work if the program isn&rsquo;t using libc&rsquo;s
buffering, and doesn&rsquo;t always work on Mac OS. Harry Marr has a really nice <a href="https://hmarr.com/blog/how-stdbuf-works/">How stdbuf works</a> post.</p>
<h4 id="solution-5-use-unbuffer">solution 5: use <code>unbuffer</code></h4>
<p><code>unbuffer program</code> will force the program&rsquo;s output to be a TTY, which means
that it&rsquo;ll behave the way it normally would on a TTY (less buffering, colour
output, etc). You could use it in this example like this:</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | unbuffer grep thing1 | grep thing2
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike <code>stdbuf</code> it will always work, though it might have unwanted side
effects, for example <code>grep thing1</code>&rsquo;s will also colour matches.</p>
<p>If you want to install unbuffer, it&rsquo;s in the <code>expect</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-the-solutions-i-know-about">that&rsquo;s all the solutions I know about!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit hard for me to say which one is &ldquo;best&rdquo;, I think personally I&rsquo;m
mostly likely to use <code>unbuffer</code> because I know it&rsquo;s always going to work.</p>
<p>If I learn about more solutions I&rsquo;ll try to add them to this post.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-not-really-sure-how-often-this-comes-up">I&rsquo;m not really sure how often this comes up</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not very common for me to have a program that slowly trickles data
into a pipe like this, normally if I&rsquo;m using a pipe a bunch of data gets
written very quickly, processed by everything in the pipeline, and then
everything exits. The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li><code>tail -f</code></li>
<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>
<li>the output of a slow computation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering">what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?</h3>
<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn
off buffering, like <code>PYTHON_UNBUFFERED</code> in Python. I got this idea from a
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://blog.plover.com/Unix/stdio-buffering-2.html">blog posts</a> by Mark Dominus
in 2018. Maybe <code>NO_BUFFER</code> like <a href="https://no-color.org/">NO_COLOR</a>?</p>
<p>The design seems tricky to get right; Mark points out that NETBSD has <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/setbuf.3">environment variables called <code>STDBUF</code>, <code>STDBUF1</code>, etc</a> which gives you a
ton of control over buffering but I imagine most developers don&rsquo;t want to
implement many different environment variables to handle a relatively minor
edge case.</p>
<h3 id="stuff-i-left-out">stuff I left out</h3>
<p>Some things I didn&rsquo;t talk about in this post since these posts have been
getting pretty long recently and seriously does anyone REALLY want to read 3000
words about buffering?</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between line buffering and having totally unbuffered output</li>
<li>how buffering to stderr is different from buffering to stdout</li>
<li>this post is only about buffering that happens <strong>inside the program</strong>, your
operating system&rsquo;s TTY driver also does a little bit of buffering sometimes</li>
<li>other reasons you might need to flush your output other than &ldquo;you&rsquo;re writing
to a pipe&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
