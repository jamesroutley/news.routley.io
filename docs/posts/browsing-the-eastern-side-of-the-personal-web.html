					  Browsing the Eastern Side of the Personal Web
              </p>
              <p>
					  and exploring its differences with the West
              </p>
			  <p>The Personal Web, to many people, only exists in a select few places. It could be solely sites on <a href="https://www.searchblogspot.com/">Blogspot</a>, or <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>, or some other adjacent platform, and that to them is the &#34;Personal Web&#34;. However, once you&#39;ve exhausted these places and found the sites that you find interesting, it&#39;s extremely difficult to figure out where to go next—to go to some unknown territory that you don&#39;t even know exists.</p>
			  <p>For myself, I&#39;ve browsed Neocities for what seems like four years now as of writing this. I&#39;ve seen many sites come and go—some plenty interesting, and others not at all. And even now, with plenty of sites that I don&#39;t recognize, I&#39;ve become rather jaded. It&#39;s hard for me to find sites that pique my interest anymore—and if they do, it&#39;s hard to find them actually being updated or not be completely barren. All of this is what led me to going on excursions to places that not many people have gone to.</p>
			  <p>This is difficult in and of itself since funnily enough, Neocities users tend to link to <em>only</em> Neocities users and no one else. Despite many of its users being against walled gardens, it ironically became one itself. Tangent aside, I had to go on sites that were independent and far from any platforms before I somehow started stumbling onto underground Japanese sites, which in turn led to me stumbling into what is essentially the underground city that is the <em>Japanese Personal Web</em>, or as they call it: creative/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doujin">doujin</a> sites.</p>
              <p><img id="imgDisp" src="https://www.bikobatanari.art/posts/post-photo/east-west-top-img.jpg" loading="lazy"/></p>
			  <p>This space, from what I&#39;ve seen, is structured by various search engines whose sole purpose is to index personal Japanese sites and nothing else; by &#34;index&#34;, what is really meant is people register their own personal websites onto the engine—sort of like a glorified link directory. Its scope is even narrower than that of Neocities and other hosting platforms because sites with more formal contexts (such as business sites) are not even allowed in these spaces.</p>
			  <p>This got me curious then: how differently do people over in the East Asian sphere (primarily Japan) handle personal websites compared to the West? Since the Personal Web and its culture in the West at this current time is heavily influenced by social media culture and the people coming from those spaces (for better or worse), I wondered how the differences in culture would impact the mindset between webmasters in the East versus webmasters in the West. So I set out to do some research, and I returned with a few of my findings.</p>
			  <p>If you want to take a look at these sites yourself, the banners below link to a small selection search engines that index these sites (there&#39;s many more that cater to specific niches but you can find them for yourself). Google Translate or the <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/translator">DeepL Translator</a> will be essential traveling gear if you can&#39;t read Japanese (because I certainly can&#39;t, and I wasn&#39;t going to start trying).</p>

			  </p>
			  <p>Now this should go without saying, but when browsing through these search engines and the sites within them, <strong><u>please respect the people running these sites</u></strong>.  You&#39;re stepping on their part of the world, not yours, and as such, you <em>will</em> find stuff that you won&#39;t necessarily jibe with—or you&#39;ll encounter fringe content that, to put it lightly, has a <em>very</em> niche audience; but despite this, respect these people&#39;s personal spaces and browse at a distance. I&#39;m pretty sure Westerners already have an abysmal reputation over there due to moral policing (à la Twitter/Tumblr) those who are literally minding their own business—in a completely different <em>continent</em> no less. So don&#39;t make things worse for those who are already making an effort in disconnecting from those places where people who would harass them are rampant.</p>
			  
				<p>One major thing that I realized while browsing these places is that the Personal Web, while it was something that got swept under the rug in the West, is something that&#39;s still alive in the East. Many of the sites indexed by these search engines have been around for <em>years</em>—years longer than even Neocities&#39; existence. Many sites from the mid-2000s are still being updated to this day, or at the very least have been updated in the past 3–4 years, which is significant considering that they&#39;ve been up for more than a decade or two by that point.</p>
				<p>This shouldn&#39;t really be surprising, considering that the social media networks that have become widely adopted in the West were also <em>founded</em> in the West, meaning that the citizens here were going to be the first adopters, and thus will have the &#34;older&#34; technology (i.e. personal websites) phased out way faster than those outside of North America. GeoCities here in NA was shut down in <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2468045/yahoo-geocities-closes-on-oct--26.html">October 2009</a>, whereas GeoCities Japan wasn&#39;t shut down until <a href="https://qz.com/1408120/yahoo-japan-is-shutting-down-its-website-hosting-service-geocities">March 2019</a>, practically a decade later.</p>
				<p>There was an observation (and it&#39;s also somewhat of a running joke) that Japan was quite slow in <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/mckinsey-japan">adopting new technology</a>, but it does come at a benefit: you can see the impact it can have on people before fully adopting said technology. Though people from Japan nowadays have widely adopted social media (primarily Twitter), there are likely more people who stuck with personal sites longer than those in the West have purely because they didn&#39;t adopt the newer tech that was supposed to phase them out.</p>
				<p>Though I wouldn&#39;t say that the Personal Web in the West ever died either. It was simply unknown to a large majority of people after social media took over. There was an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/08/indie-web/">article written as early as 2013</a> about the IndieWeb (which, coincidentally, is the same year that Neocities was founded), so it&#39;s less about the Personal Web not existing and more so it being so underground that no one knew (or completely forgot) of its existence to begin with.</p>
				<p>I still find it interesting that there are still that many people overseas updating their sites for years despite social media existing. Many people over here see it as like this new revolutionary thing, with the likes of the <a href="https://yesterweb.org/">Yesterweb</a> movement and whatnot, but really it was something that was always hovering in the background—it&#39;s just that no one had noticed.</p>
			  
			  <p>Something that I&#39;ve noticed in general is that the personal sites over there tend to be very creations/product focused. That is, their sole purpose is to show off things that they&#39;ve made, rather than embody some sort of persona.</p>
			  <p>Even the site topic distribution makes this evident. The front page of a search engine that specializes in doujin sites called <a href="http://kn1.x0.to/">よろずりんく</a> (Yorozulink when romanized) has sectioned off registered sites into categories, and the visual arts trumps practically every other category. An overwhelming majority of these sites&#39; admins post illustrations, lots of them post their own mangas (original or derived from an existing series), write novels and stories, and indulge in a lot of other creative hobbies. Personal diaries and blogs do exist, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as ubiquitous there as it is compared to the West. And even for those that have personal blogs: more often than not they&#39;re also those same people that do illustration work, and are not purely blogs.</p>
              <p><img id="imgDisp" src="https://www.bikobatanari.art/posts/post-photo/creations-focused.png" loading="lazy"/></p><p>the categorical split between these personal sites</p>
			  <p>This emphasis on creations is also made clear by how many of these sites&#39; administrators handle their About pages. It&#39;s not hard to find an About page on Neocities or some other site in the Western Personal Web space which has a lot of personal information—almost written like a biography—detailing who they are, where they&#39;re from, their beliefs, favourite media, food, etc.; also displaying stamps, blinkies, and that sort of stuff that came from DeviantArt and Tumblr in regards to Neocities sites.</p>
			  <p>However, in a large majority of these Japanese sites, you will have an extremely difficult time finding something like that. You&#39;re more likely to find an About page with a sentence or two at most—and it&#39;s most likely talking about their site, not themselves as a person. They may share their name and sometimes what prefecture that they were born/raised in, but that&#39;s about it.</p>
			  <p>I think this is largely due to the difference in culture in general as opposed to specifically their personal website conventions. Asian cultures tend to express individuality less and emphasize sticking to behaving in ways that are to be &#34;expected&#34; in the group—especially in cases where honour and shame are a big part of how the culture governs itself. As a result, personality doesn&#39;t take much of a spotlight (if at all), and there tends to be a large disconnect between them as a person and what they make.</p>
			  <p>This is the case for many instances where these people post online, even on social media. A lot of Japanese artists (or East Asian artists in general) don&#39;t post information about themselves at all—they solely post their artwork and that&#39;s really the extent of their social media &#34;persona&#34;, or lack thereof.</p>
			  <p>As a person who grew up in such a culture myself, it&#39;s a hard thing to reconcile. This site had plenty of instances where I had some personal information, then tore it down because I thought it was a bit too much, only for me to post a tiny bit again—and so on and so forth. I&#39;m at the point where everything in my <a href="https://www.bikobatanari.art/about.html">About page</a> is basically only about the site rather than me as a person, simply because I don&#39;t think talking about myself is going to contribute anything to the work that I make. I also had a blog around three years ago since writing this, but I tore that down too because it felt pointlessly personal, and my life didn&#39;t seem all too interesting to warrant a blog in the first place, so I completely understand why there&#39;s such a cultural difference regarding what amount of personal information is &#34;acceptable&#34; and expected between those from the East and those from the West.</p>
			  
			  <p>The personal web over here definitely has an emphasis in making a &#34;handcrafted&#34; site. Usually the design is all coded by hand, and templates are, in a way, frowned upon. But relating to the creations-focused philosophy that a lot of these sites adhere to, the design of many of these sites are actually rather... <em>tame</em>. Minimalistic, even. Portfolio-like. Designs that showcases their work rather than ones that potentially take away attention from it. This is despite the fact that they&#39;re actually <em>not</em> portfolio sites. The informalities are evident through the work that they make, rather than shoddy web design.</p>
			  <p>And from what I can tell, a lot of people in these spaces actually don&#39;t care if their site is handcrafted, uses a template, or <em>whatever</em>—or at the very least there&#39;s very little emphasis on it; it&#39;s only having a personal space that matters. Now whether that&#39;s because none of them are on a centralized platform that forces users to use static HTML and nothing else, I don&#39;t know (since there&#39;s plenty of personal sites here in the West that also use templates and CMS outside of places like Neocities or <a href="https://ichi.city/">ichi.city</a>)—but there is a lot of variety in terms of what foundations these sites are built on and where their sites are hosted.</p>
			  <p>Some sites have WordPress as their backend; others have their blogs hosted in <a href="https://fc2id.com/">FC2</a>; there were some sites hosted on <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/">Jimdo</a> which I never heard of before but apparently it&#39;s quite a popular choice there; and heck, some of them are made using bloody <em><a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a></em> out of all things, which I didn&#39;t even know crossed over into Japan but I guess it did because there were plenty of sites built from it.</p>
			  <p>Things such as &#34;shrine&#34; pages that are quite popular in the personal webspace here don&#39;t really exist in the same form in these Japanese sites. Like I mentioned in the last section, if they wanted to commemorate a piece of media that they love, they&#39;d often make fan art of it or create some other type of fanwork pertaining to it, instead of making a handcrafted webpage dedicated to it. Web design as a tool for self-expression doesn&#39;t seem to be the norm in these spaces, and again, they focus more on the things that they make instead. Their sites are solely vessels to hold their work, not the work in and of itself. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule; but from the majority of the sites that I&#39;ve seen, this is how a lot of them operate.</p>
			  
			  <p>Webrings are a lot more common over here, but over in Japan they have these things called &#34;同盟&#34;, translated as either &#34;union&#34; or &#34;alliance&#34;. Or at least that&#39;s what was translated when using a translator. You&#39;re going to find a lot of butchered translations here, sorry.</p>
			  <p>Webrings or cliques over here usually have an admission system: you apply to be part of the ring, and if your site satisfies all of the requirements, then you&#39;re allowed in. You add the widget to your site, and the site of the webring/directory will link to all sites that are a part of it.</p>
			  <p>But interestingly they do things differently with these web alliances/unions: it&#39;s merely a site that you link to that may have a certain message or stance that your own site aligns with. They provide buttons or banners that you can display on your own site to show that you&#39;re a part of this group. In fact, I&#39;m currently linking to <a href="https://unionmatome.web.fc2.com/jikoman/index.html">one right now</a> in my About page, whose message I really resonated with and as a result I wanted to link to it myself.</p>
			  <p>There are a few more examples, such as one that simply states that <a href="https://flanet.web.fc2.com/union/site_enjoy/">you enjoy (and have) a personal website</a> (which is a very common one that&#39;s floating around), one that enjoys a certain piece of media like <a href="http://kanan218.fc2web.com/ouji/">Le Petit Prince</a>, and even some very niche ones like for those that are really attracted to <a href="http://cvs.client.jp/">the aesthetic of convenience stores during the nighttime</a>.</p>
              
			  <p>And that&#39;s essentially how these web alliances/unions work: just link to their webpage and you&#39;re done. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a place where people participating in such groups are linked, which I find rather strange.</p>
			  <p>Though from what I&#39;ve gathered, there seems to be some remains of the antiquated practice where the groups <em>did</em> link to those who were a part of it (like how webrings and link directories work over here nowadays), but that seems to be phased out, and they&#39;ve simply resorted to taking the banner home instead.</p>
