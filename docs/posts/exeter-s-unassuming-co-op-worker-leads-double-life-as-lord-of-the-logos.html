You&#39;ll be more likely to find him sitting in the outdoors as that&#39;s where he feels most at ease and creative.</p> <p>My first encounter with Christophe - nickname Lord of the Logos i is at Heavitree Pleasure Ground in Exeter. The <a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/weather">weather</a> is unusually warm for a March day, so Christophe has found himself a sunny spot outside the front of the Parklife Cafe.</p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10044178" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</figure> <p>As I approach, he is busy working on a new logo called Exe&#39;uber&#39;ances which is the title of an exhibition he is participating in Exeter this summer.</p> <p>Knowing that his speciality is heavy metal, I expect to see him dressed in a black t-shirt brandishing a fearsome gothic inspired design. To my surprise, he is wearing a bright blue t-shirt emblazoned with yellow lettering. On closer inspection, it becomes apparent that Christophe is turning his talents to political protest t-shirts as the front reads &#39;make Russia small again&#39;, with an anti-Trump and vice-president JD Vance.</p> <p>He explains it was created in a &#39;moment of anger&#39; and that he has Ukrainian heritage in his family. For his own personal satisfaction creates controversial drawings of American president Donald Trump that can only ever be kept under wraps to limit any damage to his career that has earned him the nickname &#39;Lord of the Logos&#39;.</p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10044199" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</figure> <p>Christophe&#39;s life-long passion for art started when he was a schoolboy drawing wildlife. His art then turned in a new direction when he discovered English rock band Mot√∂rhead, much to the disapproval of his mum whose favourite artist was Barbara Streisand and his dad&#39;s being Elvis.</p> <p>It led to a love of heavy metal, particularly the black and death metal sub-genres. His two passions have since taken him all over the world. His work first came to wider international attention in the mid &#39;90s off of the back of logos for the likes of Emperor, Old Man&#39;s Child and Enthroned. </p> <p>Since then he has continued to make a significant contribution to the extreme metal scene having drawn logos for hundreds of bands including Melechesh, Falkenbach, Aborted, Abigail Williams and Bloodshot Dawn. For &#39;fun&#39;, he has designed unofficial logos for the likes of Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars.</p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10044203" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</figure> <p>Christophe created his first logo at the tender age of 17 for a Polish band called Totustus back in 1987. Unfortunately, the band never achieved fame. </p> <p>The first &#39;important&#39; logo he says he designed was in 1989 for Finland band Disgrace, but what he credits for getting his name out there was creating logos for Germany band Endseeker, a well-known death metal band, and Enthroned from Belgium.</p> <p>But his biggest claim to fame remains the global recognition he gained after designing a show-stopping logo for pop star Rihanna in 2016. One of his visually striking designs was projected onto a 100ft backdrop at the MTV VMA awards during a live performance of her single B*tch Better Have My Money.</p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="410479" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

The opportunity came following a chance encounter with a member of Rihanna&#39;s management team on the tube between Canada Water and London Paddington.</p> <p>But it isn&#39;t the logo he is the most proud of. Instead he says it is the one he designed for Norwegian black metal band Emperor, simply because it is &#39;readable and iconic&#39;.</p> <p>&#34;If I could create a logo for anyone it would be Muse. I would also like to do ones for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and also Elbow who are one of my favourite bands.</p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10044201" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</figure> <p>Explaining how to make the perfect logo, Christophe, who lives in the Stoke Hill area of Exeter, said: &#34;They have to be fluid to the eye. You need harmony, flow, symmetry and for it to be pleasant to the eye and very stylish.</p> <p>&#34;If something is off centre it looks distracting; I&#39;m a bit of a perfectionist! I love the aesthetics of an arched logo.</p> <p>&#34;I prefer my logos to be simple, but have a kick. They also need to have a certain readability. Using a calligraphy style means the letters blend together rather than letters in existing fonts.&#34;</p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="portrait" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10044202" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</figure> <p>Christophe&#39;s reputation for designing logos means he receives commissions from all over the world. His finalised sketches are then digitised by graphic designer Faye Burn to speed up the process for clients. </p> <p>However, the industry is fiercely competitive which is a constant struggle for Christophe to battle against.</p> <p>He said: &#34;Within the past 10 years, the industry has been ruined by cheap designers using a computer and changing existing logos into a different name. Stealing intellectual property is something I have experienced extremely frequently.</p> <p>&#34;You can tell when all the detail has been done by hand rather than by a computer, and those &#39;designers&#39; charge a much cheaper price which makes people more inclined to use them.&#34;</p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="portrait" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10044200" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</figure> <p>It means that Christophe relies on the steady income of his job at the Co-op serving customers. He is contracted to do 12 to 20 hours a week, currently at its store in Queen Street, but also can occasionally be seen doing shifts in Heavitree.</p> <p>He said: &#34;The reason I will never be able to fulfil my dream to be living exclusively off my art is because of the competition there now is so I have to have two sources of income.</p> <p>&#34;Working at the Co-op also helps me maintain contact with the outside world as otherwise you can be immersed in your own art world. As long as my tummy is full and I have a roof over my head, that is the most important thing.&#34;</p> <p>Being part-time at the Co-op enables Christophe to spend as much time as he can abroad exhibiting his work and also attending events and award ceremonies. In January, he was awarded the prestigious Artist of the Year 2025 International Prize at the Palazzo Pucci in Italy. </p> <figure data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10044179" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
