    <h1>The Fundamentals of Control Theory</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0aa4bd24b21ad15bc7f1"><div><h3>Fundamentals of Control Theory</h3><p>I&#39;m writing an eBook. I started my YouTube channel because I was frustrated by the lack of straightforward and easy to understand videos on the topic and felt that what some students needed was a more practical and intuitive approach to understanding the material. This book is an extension of that idea. I’m releasing it under the Creative Commons License and giving the book out for free. </p><p>Get it here! <a href="http://bit.ly/2XLlAKl"><span>http://bit.ly/2XLlAKl</span></a> </p>
