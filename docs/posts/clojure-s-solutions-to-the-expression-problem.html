                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>Chris Houser presents the expression problem showing two ways to solve it in some languages, followed by a demonstration of solving it using multimethods and protocols in Clojure, mentioning pros and cons of each solving method.</p>

                        <p>Chris Houser is a co-author of &#34;The Joy of Clojure&#34;, and a primary contributor to Clojure itself. He is a senior software developer at Sentry Data Systems, where he&#39;s using Clojure to develop a distributed application platform. His lifelong passion for programming began when he was a child and drives him to continue learning and exploring new languages today.</p>

                        <h2>About the conference</h2>
                        <p>Strange Loop is a developer-run software conference.  Innovation, creativity, and the future happen in the magical nexus &#34;between&#34; established areas.  Strange Loop eagerly promotes a mix of languages and technologies in this nexus, bringing together the worlds of bleeding edge technology, enterprise systems, and academic research.
Of particular interest are new directions in data storage, alternative languages, concurrent and distributed systems, front-end web, semantic web, and mobile apps.</p>
