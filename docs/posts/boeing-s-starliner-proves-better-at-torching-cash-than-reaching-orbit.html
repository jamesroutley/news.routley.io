    <h1>Boeing&#39;s Starliner proves better at torching cash than reaching orbit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Lurking in Boeing&#39;s woeful Q2 financials is an admission that while its Starliner spacecraft might be struggling when it comes to burning fuel, it has no problem whatsoever setting fire to dollar bills.</p>
<p>The Calamity Capsule is currently attached to the International Space Station (ISS) while engineers scrutinize test results and finalize procedures for bringing the Boeing spacecraft – and its two crew members – back to Earth.</p>
<p>The word &#34;calamity&#34; might equally apply to the impact of the project on Boeing&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/31/boeing_q2_2024/">finances</a>. The troubled aerospace titan&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000012927/000001292724000055/ba-20240630.htm">filing</a> with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed it would be increasing its &#34;reach-forward loss on the [Starliner] program&#34; by another $125 million.</p>

    

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/27/starliner_losses_closing_in_on/">losses</a> incurred by Boeing thanks to Starliner have comfortably breezed past $1 billion, and will likely surpass $1.6 billion before long. &#34;Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods,&#34; Boeing observed.</p>

        


        

<p>It is now almost ten years since NASA handed Boeing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/05/29/nasa_hands_boeing_contract_for_first_commercial_crew_mission_to_iss/">contract</a> to develop a vehicle to transport crew to and from the ISS. John Mulholland, then Boeing VP and Program Manager for Commercial Crew and now Boeing&#39;s Program Manager for the ISS, said: &#34;We&#39;re on track to fly in 2017, and this critical milestone moves us another step closer in fully maturing the CST-100 design.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>After a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/20/boeing_starliner_failure/">failed first attempt</a> to reach the ISS, Boeing repeated the non-crewed test flight &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2020-04-06-Boeing-Statement-on-Starliners-Next-Flight">at no cost to the taxpayer</a>.&#34; Despite that second unmanned try at reaching the ISS being successful, the Calamity Capsule was subject to yet more delays before finally getting off the ground in June with two test pilots onboard for a minimum mission duration of eight days. Destination: The space station, and then home.</p>
<p>Almost two months later, the spacecraft and its human duo remain docked to the ISS. Starliner can&#39;t get back to Earth within NASA&#39;s safety parameters, due to thruster issues and gas leaks. It is cleared for an emergency return, an option American officials aren&#39;t willing to take right now.</p>
<p>NASA and Boeing have yet to set a date for the spacecraft&#39;s return. In an update issued on August 1, NASA <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/boeing-crew-flight-test/2024/08/01/nasa-boeing-continue-data-analysis-for-crew-flight-test-evaluation/">noted</a> that the planning for the spacecraft&#39;s return was &#34;expected to continue into next week.&#34; This includes finalizing undocking procedures and &#34;operational mitigations that could be used in flight, if needed.&#34;</p>

        

<p>In its own <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://starlinerupdates.com/starliner-return-to-earth-preps-underway/">update</a>, Boeing reported that return-to-Earth preparations were under way, with teams working through simulations and the ISS crew inspecting the exterior of Starliner using the outpost&#39;s Canadarm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a NASA spokesperson <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/yes-nasa-really-could-bring-starliners-astronauts-back-on-crew-dragon/">told Ars</a> the US agency is &#34;evaluating all options.&#34; It&#39;s thought those possible options include using a SpaceX capsule to do what Starliner right now can&#39;t – bring back its pair of pilots.</p>
<p>The next flight of the Starliner is not expected until August 2025, so it seems likely that Boeing&#39;s balance sheet will continue to bleed red in the &#34;contracts we wish we&#39;d never signed&#34; column for a while longer. ®</p>
