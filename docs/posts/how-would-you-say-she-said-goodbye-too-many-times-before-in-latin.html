    <h1>How would you say “She said goodbye too many times before.” in Latin?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Cicero provides a possibility for &#34;too many times&#34; with <em>nimium saepe</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quare &#34;bene et praeclare&#34; quamvis nobis saepe dicatur; &#34;belle et festive&#34; <strong>nimium saepe</strong> nolo (Cicero, <em>De Oratore</em> 3.101.2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the meaning is even clearer with Seneca&#39;s <em>Medea</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quodsi <strong>nimium saepe</strong> vocari quereris votis, ignosce, precor:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cicero uses <em>nimium</em> joined with <em>saepe</em> often, perhaps too often, since it&#39;s rarely found in other others (once in Seneca, the above passage, and I think twice in Ovid, but I haven&#39;t translated the passages in full to see if they belong together or if <em>nimium</em> goes with another word).</p>
<p>You could also easily just use the comparative or superlative forms of <em>saepe</em>, which would get the point across. In searching the Loeb library, I found several translators who have done that, so it&#39;s not just my intuition.</p>
<p>While Draconis is right that you don&#39;t need to translate &#34;she&#34;, you might consider it if you want to single the subject out. For this, you could use <em>illa</em>, &#34;that woman.&#34; For this particular sense of <em>illa</em>, see Lewis &amp; Short:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C. Opp. to hic, <strong>to indicate that object which is the more remote</strong>, either as regards the position of the word denoting it, or as it is conceived of by the writer; v. hic, I. D.—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So saying <em>illa valedixit</em> would have the same sense as the English &#34;that woman.&#34;</p>
<p>I really only bring this up because the previous line has (and the song is called) &#34;this love,&#34; so it provides a nice contrast: <em>hic amor, illa mulier.</em></p>
