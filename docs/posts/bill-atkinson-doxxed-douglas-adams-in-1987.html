    <h1>Bill Atkinson doxxed Douglas Adams in 1987</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content"><p>Bill Atkinson doxxed Douglas Adams in 1987</p><p>I read somewhere that Douglas Adams (writer of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy) was the first person in Europe to own an Apple II computer.</p><p>Something I haven&#39;t found anywhere is that Bill Atkinson (Apple developer who created HyperCard) may have accidentally shared Douglas Adams his adress and phone numbers on television.</p><p>I was watching an old episode of The Computer Chronicles and saw Bill presenting HyperCard. He showed an address book as an example application, and for a brief moment Douglas Adams his name shows up, with an address and phone number. Maybe it wasn&#39;t a real address / phone number, but I did notice Bill skipped past it pretty quickly, so it may have been an honest mistake:</p><p><img src="https://not.withoutdistractions.com/public-static/img/douglas-adams-hypercard___sha256-0ec0f0bc4117ef26b057f9f3f41d5242412e86c1ca221397a7a77015521deed7.png" alt="Image of the address book showing Douglas Adams his address and phone number."/></p><p>See the video fragment  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FquNpWdf9vg&amp;t=399s" target="_blank">here</a> (I couldn&#39;t get an exact timestamp for the video because it&#39;s shown for less than a second.)</p></div></div>
