    <h1>Google fires another AI researcher who reportedly challenged findings</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-going-on-at-google-ai-150001422.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">firing AI researchers</a> amid criticism of its work. <em>The New York Times</em> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/02/technology/google-fires-ai-researchers.html" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">learned</a> Google fired machine learning scientist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/satrajit-chatterjee-17a0251/" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">Satrajit Chatterjee</a> in March, soon after it refused to publish a paper Chatterjee and others wrote challenging <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w.epdf?sharing_token=kTv18zP-ISjkT-M6j5F329RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PW0K0NmVrRsFPaMa9Y5We97spjdO-aPpvZYXPHhKbfpfPljZaIm3b-kyQ3gKElVBjZIxn_5lBKsnqIIUn2YkCI3IFe5puGE49yIrhVbJrW9eUbKmMo7FS9KDgM4hs9TFGpRVlSt4Nl99J4cCGkkLZ7VMHt49mwCk2dlnBf24jObug9H_15O50hYb9Zhk2bcFQ%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theverge.com" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">earlier findings</a> that computers could design some chip components more effectively than humans. The scientist was reportedly allowed to collaborate on a paper disputing those claims after he and fellow authors expressed reservations, but was dismissed after a resolution committee rejected the paper and the researchers hoped to bring the issue to CEO Sundar Pichai and Alphabet&#39;s board of directors.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#39;t detailed why it fired Chatterjee, but told the<em> Times </em>he&#39;d been &#34;terminated with cause.&#34; It also maintained that the original paper had been &#34;thoroughly vetted&#34; and peer-reviewed, and that the study challenging the claims &#34;did not meet our standards.&#34;</p>
<p>Whether or not the science holds up, the exit underscores the ongoing clash between Google&#39;s management and the AI teams that drive many of its projects. The problems began in earnest when Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-sundar-pichai-timnit-gebru-ai-ethics-204137362.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">fired ethicist Timnit Gebru</a> in 2020 following a dispute over a paper, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alex-hanna-dylan-baker-dair-233014682.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">two others following suit</a>. The matter escalated when the internet giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/margaret-mitchell-google-ai-233309349.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">terminated Margaret Mitchell</a> in early 2021. While Google claimed Mitchell violated data confidentiality policies, she also publicly criticized executives and the decision to fire Gebru. These firings led veteran engineers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-engineers-leave-over-timnit-gebru-exit-093645678.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">leave the firm</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ethical-ai-team-letter-174518115.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">demand reforms</a>, and that&#39;s not including company-wide <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-jwcc-contract-214046745.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">protests over military contracts</a>. Google investigated Gebru&#39;s firing and promised changes, but the Chatterjee firing might not ease tensions.</p>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that Google is proud of its AI research. It&#39;s keen to tout algorithms that can outperform humans in fields like chip design and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-15-google-ai-spots-advanced-breast-cancer.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">cancer detection</a>, and its flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">Pixel 6</a> phones are built around a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-soc-pixel-6-chip-170059466.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">custom AI-focused processor</a>. Any flaws could significantly hinder Google&#39;s business, not to mention tarnish its reputation as a leader in AI development.</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
