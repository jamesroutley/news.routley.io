    <h1>A blogger who doesn&#39;t blog</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently read this book called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art">The War of Art</a>. In the book, the author has introduced me to a new idea, which he calls “Resistance”.</p>
<p>To tell what that is, I must quote a few lines from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance…..</p>
<p>Are you a writer who doesn’t write, a painter who doesn’t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moment I read those lines, I had this realization: “I have become <em>a blogger</em> who doesn’t blog.”</p>
<p>Today, I want to break that and overcome my resistance to writing blog posts. Because blogging is a soulful act for me. I find it personally rewarding every time I do it, and I always want to do more of it.</p>
<p>So, here I am! Opening up my journal in the middle of the night to write this blog post on paper to overcome my resistance. “Having to turn on my computer every time I want to write a blog post” has become a resistance for me. Not just that, I am sure there are <code>n</code> different things resisting me at a given point in time. But that is okay - I just need to do better at overcoming them!</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I am finding it fun to write this on paper. The words are flowing faster, and I am saving myself from a little bit of screen time.</p>
<p>I want to do more of this: Resisting my resistance.</p>
