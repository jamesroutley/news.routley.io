                        <h3>Security and reliability are not optional</h3>
                        
                        <p>Security updates are nearly instant. No unnecessary services run, period. Services are managed by the world-class supervision software, s6, designed to do one thing and to do it well. If an application misbehaves, it&#39;s stopped in its tracks before it can cause harm.</p><p>Adélie does not claim to provide magical security protections. Instead, it provides everything you need to rest assured knowing there are no surprises. Because you deserve to know the truth.</p>
