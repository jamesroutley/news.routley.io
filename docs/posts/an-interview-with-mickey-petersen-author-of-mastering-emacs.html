    <h1>An Interview with Mickey Petersen, Author of Mastering Emacs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>An interview with Mickey Petersen, author of </span><a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Mastering Emacs</a></em></p><p><strong>Who are you, and what do you do?</strong></p><p><span>I&#39;m Mickey Petersen. I live in London, UK.</span></p><p><strong>How did you get interested in that in the first place?</strong></p><p><span>I cut my teeth programming C in Turbo C for DOS and moved on to Delphi for Windows some years later, whilst at the same time trying to get a grip on this fairly new-fangled thing called Linux. Back then you had to go through all manner of hoops to even get it: I think I got mine from a CD that a friend of a family member had. It would&#39;ve been far too large for my meagre 33.6k dialup modem connection to even attempt to download it from the web.</span></p><p><strong>What resources would you recommend for people that are interested in what you do?</strong></p><p><span>For programming? Gosh, there&#39;s too much. Back in the day it was actually really hard to learn programming as you&#39;d need books, the web/internet, or know someone who knows a bit about it. Today, it&#39;s infinitely easier to get started — though I think it&#39;s equally hard </span><em>sticking</em><span> to it, and becoming proficient!</span></p><p><strong><span>I found your work through </span><a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Mastering Emacs</a><span>, a phenomenal site – and </span><a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/book" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">book</a><span> (written in Emacs, of course) – that helped me design my Emacs workflow (more so as a writer than a developer). Emacs can be intimidating for first-time users. Why should they choose it over another text editor?</span></strong></p><p><span>Thank you! I&#39;m glad you like both. That was exactly why I started the site.</span></p><p><strong>What are some areas where Emacs could improve, either for longtime users or for newcomers?</strong></p><p><span>Hm, this is a good question.</span></p><p><strong>What are some of the Emacs specific workflows that help you get your work done (packages, changes from defaults, etc.)?</strong></p><p><span>For me it&#39;s the ability to program Emacs when I need to. I had to write some e-mail filters – sieves, as they&#39;re known – for an e-mail server. That was tedious as I had to test that they worked; what emails they&#39;d affect (lest I screw up badly and ransack my emails); and then against particular e-mails to make sure the filter works properly for that particular e-mail.</span></p><p><strong>Besides Emacs, what tools &amp; gear do you use (hardware, software, or anything else that comes to mind)?</strong></p><p><span>I use a </span><a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">ZSA Moonlander Mark 1</a><span>. It&#39;s one of those fancy &#39;mechanical&#39; keyboards. It&#39;s quite nice. It&#39;s programmable and extensible, and it&#39;s more comfortable than normal keyboards. I used a MS Ergonomic keyboard for about 20 years and I&#39;d literally wear them out in about 2 years.</span></p><p><strong>Besides the tools, what habits &amp; routines help you finish your work?</strong></p><p><span>I rarely finish my work. Unless someone&#39;s paying me, that is!</span></p><p><strong>How do you relax or take a break?</strong></p><p><span>I set my own working hours, as I generally work on my terms. For clients my work is a case of agreeing the scope of what needs doing, and then I get on with it. But it&#39;s unlikely to follow a 9-5 schedule, per se. So when I want a break, I get up and walk around. Living in London affords me the ability to do all manner of cultural stuff, if that is what I feel like.</span></p><p><strong>Whose work inspires or motivates you, or that you admire?</strong></p><p>Hm, you know, it&#39;s a good question. I self-motivate, I think, mostly. I know it&#39;s common for people to look upon the works of others for inspiration, and I think that is probably true of me as well. But it&#39;s more of an ethereal thing for me: it&#39;s a range of things – concepts, ideas – that drive me, and less so any particular person. So when I sit down and half-invent something, it&#39;s because of that.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
