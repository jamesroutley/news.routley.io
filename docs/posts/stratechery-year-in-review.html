		<p>It has been over a decade of Stratechery; this is the 11th Year in Review I have published. You can find previous years here:</p>

<p>I am both proud and grateful to have made it to this milestone. Stratechery has changed my life; I hope it has had some small impact on yours.</p>

<p>At the beginning of last year’s review I said that the biggest story in tech was the emergence of AI; I can say the exact same thing about 2023, but even more so: 12 of Stratechery’s free Weekly Articles were about AI in some way, shape, or form. The second biggest topic was a Stratechery staple: the evolving content landscape; 2023 was particularly notable, though, for the dramatic shifts that are hitting Hollywood, highlighted by both strikes and the Disney-Charter standoff this fall. There were also big stories about the tech industry itself, from a bank failure to board room drama, and a “vision” of what might come next.</p>

<p>This year Stratechery published 27 free <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/articles/">Articles</a>, 105 subsriber <a href="https://stratechery.com/category/daily-email/">Updates</a>, and 37 <a href="https://stratechery.com/topic/events/interview/">Interviews</a>. Today, as per tradition, I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year.</p>
<h3>The Five Most-Viewed Articles</h3>
<p>The five most-viewed articles on Stratechery according to page views:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/">From Bing to Sydney</a> — Microsoft launched a new conversational UI in Bing based on GPT-4; I got early access, and discovered Sydney, and had a series of conversations that blew my mind.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-four-horsemen-of-the-tech-recession/">The Four Horsemen of the Tech Recession</a> — Tech is increasingly divorced from the real economy thanks to the COVID hangover and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/openais-misalignment-and-microsofts-gain/">OpenAI’s Misalignment and Microsoft’s Gain</a> — The end of a dramatic weekend in tech is that OpenAI has split and Microsoft is partnered with one and has hired the other; this is the ultimate failure case of what should have been a for-profit company organized the wrong way.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">Apple Vision</a> — Apple Vision is incredibly compelling, first as a product, and second as far as potential use cases. What it says about society, though, is a bit more pessimistic.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-death-of-silicon-valley-bank/">The End of Silicon Valley (Bank)</a> — Silicon Valley Bank bears responsibility for its demise, but it symbolizes a Silicon Valley reality that is very different from the myth — and the ultimate cause is tech itself.</li>
</ol>
<h3>AI Strategy</h3>
<p>Is AI a sustaining technology that makes existing companies stronger, or a disruptive one that leads to new entrants?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-and-the-big-five/">AI and the Big Five</a> — Given the success of existing companies with new epochs, the most obvious place to start when thinking about the impact of AI is with the big five: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/google-i-o-and-the-coming-ai-battles/">Google I/O and the Coming AI Battles</a> — Google A/I suggests that AI is a sustaining innovation for all of Big Tech; that means the real battle will be between incumbents and Big Tech on one side, and open source on the other.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/windows-and-the-ai-platform-shift/">Windows and the AI Platform Shift</a> — Microsoft argued there is an AI platform shift, and the fact that Windows is interesting again — and that Apple is facing AI-related questions for its newest products — is evidence that is correct.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-openai-keynote/">The OpenAI Keynote</a> — OpenAI’s developer keynote was exciting, both because AI was exciting, and because OpenAI has the potential to be a meaningful consumer tech company.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/googles-true-moonshot/">Google’s True Moonshot</a> — Google could do more than just win the chatbot war: it is the one company that could make a universal assistant. The question is if the company is willing to risk it all.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Questions and Philosophy</h3>
<p>AI doesn’t just raise strategic questions: it raises questions about the nature of computing, the future of society, and what it means to be human.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Gets a Computer</a> — It’s possible that large language models are more like the human brain than we thought, given that it is about prediction; that is why ChatGPT needs its own computer in the form of plug-ins.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-nil-and-zero-trust-authenticity/">AI Philosophy</a> — AI-generated content is not going to harm those with the capability of breaking through: it will make them stronger, aided by Zero Trust Authenticity.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/">Nvidia On the Mountaintop</a> — Nvidia has gone from the valley to the mountain-top in less than a year, thanks to ChatGPT and the frenzy it inspired; whether or not there is a cliff depends on developing new kinds of demand that only GPUs can fulfill.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-hardware-and-virtual-reality/">AI, Hardware, and Virtual Reality</a> — Defining virtual reality as being about hardware is to miss the point: virtual reality is AI, and hardware is an (essential) means to an end.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/regretful-accelerationism/">Regretful Accelerationism</a> — The Internet removed constraints from the analog world, and AI is finishing the job. That this may be the final blow for the Internet as a source for truth may ultimately be for the best.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Streaming and Hollywood</h3>
<p>While the past, present, and future of content has always been a focus of Stratechery, this year felt like a tipping point for Hollywood in particular.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/netflixs-new-chapter/">Netflix’s New Chapter</a> — Netflix waited out Blockbuster with better economics, and it’s seeking to do the same with its competitors today; the key to the company’s differentiation, though, is increasingly creativity, not execution.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-unified-content-business-model/">The Unified Content Business Model</a> — Every content company is or should be moving to a model that incorporates both subscriptions and ads; creator platforms should help their publishers do the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/hollywood-on-strike/">Hollywood on Strike</a> — The Hollywood strike is setting talent against studios, but the problem is that both are jointly threatened by the reality of the Internet and zero distribution costs.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/disneys-taylor-swift-era/">Disney’s Taylor Swift Era</a> — Not even Taylor Swift can fight the devaluation of recorded music, but she makes it up in physical experiences; Disney isn’t much different, but it looks much worse given the company’s old business model.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/the-rise-and-fall-of-espns-leverage/">The Rise and Fall of ESPN’s Leverage</a> — Charting ESPN’s rise, including how it build leverage over the cable TV providers, and its ongoing decline, caused by the Internet <em>(See also: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/charter-disney-winners-and-losers/">Charter-Disney Winners and Losers</a>)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regulation</h3>
<p>It is, for better or worse, impossible to cover technology without discussing regulation, and 2023 was no different.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/amazon-friction-and-the-ftc/">Amazon, Friction, and the FTC</a> — The FTC’s Amazon complaint raises some fair points in isolation, but misses the bigger picture, both in terms of Amazon specifically and the Internet generally.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ftc-sues-amazon-fba-and-prime-pricing-punishment/">FTC Sues Amazon</a> — The FTC is suing Amazon, and some of the complaints are compelling, but ultimately not convincing.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/china-chips-and-moores-law/">China Chips and Moore’s Law</a> — Moore’s Law is not yet dead, nor is Moore’s Precept, even if AI computes differently. Addressing both is the key to succeeding with the China chip ban.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/attenuating-innovation-ai/">Attenuating Innovation (AI)</a> — Innovation required humility about the future and openness to what might be possible; Biden’s executive order proscribing AI development is the opposite, blocking progress and hindering the solutions to our greatest challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/attenuating-innovation-ai/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/attentuatinginnovation-4.png?resize=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1" alt="Photo of a radiant, downscaled city teetering on the brink of an expansive abyss, with a dark, murky quagmire below containing decayed structures reminiscent of historic landmarks. The city is a beacon of the future, with flying cars, green buildings, and residents in futuristic attire. The influence of AI is subtly interwoven, with robots helping citizens and digital screens integrated into the environment. Below, the haunting silhouette of a shoggoth, with its eerie tendrils, endeavors to pull the city into the depths, illustrating the clash between forward-moving evolution and outdated forces." width="640" height="640" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/attentuatinginnovation-4.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/attentuatinginnovation-4.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/attentuatinginnovation-4.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/attentuatinginnovation-4.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/attentuatinginnovation-4.png?resize=630%2C630&amp;ssl=1 630w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
