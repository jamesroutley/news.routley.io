            In a startling disruption of the space-time continuum — and a violation of the basic maxim of publishing that nothing is ever on time — the publication date of the 2nd edition of my book <i>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</i> was bumped up by 12 days. That means that the publication date is <i>today</i> and the book might be available from your favorite book vendor. (Or perhaps not quite yet.)

            Here are a few links, but actually getting the book might take longer than you’d like:
            </p>
            <li>
            <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/Code">Microsoft Press Store</a> has the pithiest URL and you’re ordering direct from the publisher
            </li>
            <li>
            <a href="https://www.informit.com/store/code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software-9780137909100">Inform IT</a> is an alternative to ordering directly from the publisher
            </li>
            <li>
            <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software-9780137909100/9780137909100">Bookshop.org</a> is generally my favorite online source, but they don’t even have the cover image yet and they say that the book is “temporarily out of stock”
            </li>
            <li>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0137909101">Amazon</a>, which you’ve probably heard of, but today they’re saying “3 to 5 weeks”
            </li>
            <li>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0137909101">Amazon UK</a> was supposed to be publishing early but now they’re saying November 24th!
            </li>
            <li>
            <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/code-charles-petzold/1100324884?ean=9780137909100">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> (which I’ve been shopping at for over 50 years starting when they were just one store on 5th Avenue and 17th Street) but they’re saying “temporarily out of stock online”
            </li>
            <p>
            I don’t even have a copy of the book yet but I think that one may be waiting for me at my New York City apartment.
