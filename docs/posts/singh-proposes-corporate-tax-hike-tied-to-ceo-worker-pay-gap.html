They can&#39;t afford their groceries, they can&#39;t afford their bills,&#34; Singh told a news conference Tuesday.</p><p>&#34;At the very same time, the CEOs of the companies they work for are making more salary, making more compensation than they&#39;ve ever made before.&#34;</p><p>The plan would raise the corporate income tax on a sliding scale, depending on the ratio between the pay of a company&#39;s CEO and the median pay of the company&#39;s workers. <a href="https://www.ndp.ca/news/jagmeet-singh-table-plan-rein-outrageous-ceo-pay">According to an NDP news release</a>, the tax increase would be 0.5 per cent if a CEO makes 50 to 100 times the median income of workers, and would rise to a five per cent increase if a CEO makes a salary 500 times or more higher than the median income of workers.</p><p>House of Commons rules forbid private members&#39; bills from making changes to taxation, with an exception for bills that create exemptions from new taxes or new tax increases.</p><p>&#34;A private member&#39;s bill cannot impose, increase or extend the application of a tax,&#34; says the House of Commons <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/procedure/our-procedure/PrivateMembersBusiness/c_g_privatemembersbusiness-e.html">guide on practice and procedure</a>.</p><p>Singh did not say how he would get around the rule, adding he hasn&#39;t drafted the bill yet.</p><p>Singh has attacked grocery companies and executives repeatedly, saying that greed is responsible for a rise in food prices. Grocery chain representatives, including top executives, have told a House of Commons committee that higher supplier costs and other factors are responsible for the rising price of food, and that other products, such as pharmaceuticals and hygiene products, have a higher profit margin.</p><p>Loblaw president Galen Weston Jr. has been the most frequent target of Singh&#39;s criticism; the two <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/grocery-ceo-ottawa-1.6771887">traded barbs at a House of Commons committee meeting</a> last month. Loblaw <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/loblaw-weston-1.6813874">announced Tuesday that Weston will step down as president</a> — a move that comes just weeks after news broke that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/grocery-executive-compensation-1.6802091#:~:text=Weston&#39;s%20compensation%20bump%20was%20first,than%20%249%20million%20in%202020.">he&#39;d received a $3 million raise in 2022</a>.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Galen Weston, in a blue suit and glasses, is shown seated at a table with a name card in front of him as he testifies about food inflation at a committee in Ottawa on March 8." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6775000.1680712526!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/galen-weston.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6775000.1680712526!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/galen-weston.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6775000.1680712526!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/galen-weston.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6775000.1680712526!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/galen-weston.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6775000.1680712526!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/galen-weston.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6775000.1680712526!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/galen-weston.jpg"/></p><figcaption>Galen G.

The overall inflation rate was 4.3 per cent.</p><p>Singh called on other parties to support his proposal.</p><p>&#34;This is to decrease inequality. This is to force companies to stop the inequality that continues to grow,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;This is a concrete way, a measure, that&#39;s going to lift up workers and tell companies a clear message that the inequality that exists in those companies is wrong, and that we&#39;re going to incentivize having less inequality.&#34;</p><p>The NDP&#39;s plan would increase the corporate income tax according to this scale:</p><ul><li>0.5 per cent if CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio is between 50 and 100</li><li>1 per cent if CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio is between 100 and 200</li><li>2 per cent if CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio is between 200 and 300</li><li>3 per cent if CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio is between 300 and 400</li><li>4 per cent if CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio is between 400 and 500</li><li>5 per cent if CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio is 500 or more</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>
