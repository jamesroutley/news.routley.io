<p>Intel has announced these <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/programmable/fpga-leadership.html">new/future FPGA families</a>:</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/FPGA/Intel-Agilex-D-Series-FPGAs-Deliver-Leading-Fabric-Performance/post/1413888?cid=iosm&amp;source=linkedin&amp;campid=intel_psg/fpga_q3_2022&amp;content=100003405734341&amp;icid=dcai-psg-local-campaign&amp;linkId=100000151928211">Intel® Agilex™ D-Series</a></strong></p>



<p>For midrange FPGA applications like studio cameras, 8K video transport, and wireless infrastructure.</p>



<p>This new family incorporates an upgraded hard processor system (HPS), Enhanced DSP with AI Tensor Block, MIPI I/O support, and a hardened time-sensitive network controller (TSN). Intel Agilex D-Series devices also keep features from previous families like the 2nd-generation Intel® Hyperflex™ FPGA Architecture and high-speed SerDes transceivers.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/FPGA/Intel-Agilex-FPGAs-code-named-Sundance-Mesa-Deliver-Industry/post/1413887?cid=iosm&amp;source=linkedin&amp;campid=intel_psg/fpga_q3_2022&amp;content=100003405734341&amp;icid=dcai-psg-local-campaign&amp;linkId=100000151928210">Future Intel® Agilex™ FPGAs </a>(codenamed Sundance Mesa)</strong></p>



<p>Under design, for a variety of applications, including workloads in industrial, broadcast, automotive, communications, consumer, test and measurement, and medical markets. </p>



<p>The new Intel Agilex device family inherits many of the most important architectural features of earlier Intel Agilex devices including the second-generation Intel® Hyperflex™ FPGA Architecture, which places Hyper-Registers throughout the FPGA. </p>



<p>These devices combine the Intel Agilex FPGA fabric with a broad set of intellectual property (IP) and connectivity options including high-speed transceivers that support data rates to 28.1 Gbps and the PCIe 4.0 interface protocol.</p>



<p>The new Intel Agilex device family also supports DDR4, LPDDR4, DDR5, and LPDDR5 SDRAM; general purpose I/O with output voltages ranging from 1.05 V to 3.3 V; in addition a hard processor system (HPS) based on a multi-core Arm Cortex CPU with two Arm Cortex-A76 processor cores that can run as fast as 1.8 GHz and two Arm Cortex-A55 processor cores that can run as fast as 1.5 GHz. </p>



<p><strong>Intel® Agilex™<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/FPGA/Intel-Adds-CXL-IP-to-Intel-Agilex-FPGA-IP-Library-in-the-Intel/post/1417013?cid=iosm&amp;source=linkedin&amp;campid=intel_psg/fpga_q3_2022&amp;content=100003405734341&amp;icid=dcai-psg-local-campaign&amp;linkId=100000151928213"> FPGAs with R-Tile</a></strong></p>



<p>These devices include the Compute Express Link (CXL) intellectual property (IP) to the Intel Quartus Prime Software IP library. This CXL hard + soft IP builds upon the existing PCI Express (PCIe) 5.0 capabilities of the Intel® Agilex™ I-Series and M-Series FPGAs and SoCs that incorporate “R” transceiver tiles. The initial release of this IP supports CXL v1.1. A planned future IP release will provide a software-only upgrade path for these Intel Agilex FPGAs and SoCs by adding support for CXL v2.0.</p>



<p>CXL devices will be used in diverse areas such as high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data analytics, and other specialized tasks.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/FPGA/Intel-Delivers-a-Game-Changing-Analog-Enabled-Direct-RF-FPGA/post/1417363?cid=iosm&amp;source=linkedin&amp;campid=intel_psg/fpga_q3_2022&amp;content=100003405734341&amp;icid=dcai-psg-local-campaign&amp;linkId=100000151928212">Direct RF FPGAs</a></strong> Intel® Direct RF FPGAs can perform direct analog RF signal conversion for multiple analog input and output channels in a variety of topologies supporting up to 16 channels and various configurations with channel rates as fast as 64 Gsps.</p>



<p>The new devices in this portfolio of Intel Direct RF FPGA devices now extend the I/O capabilities of Intel Agilex and Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs to the analog domain using ADC and DAC chiplets that have been co-developed with partners and then composed into packaged devices using Intel’s EMIB and AIB technologies. </p>
