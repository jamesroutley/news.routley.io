    <h1>Nintendo 64 Test Cart ROM</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We were sent a <strong>Nintendo 64 test cartridge</strong> ROM that was dumped anonymously. Zoinkity wrote up a nice readme explaining the details which is included in the <strong>7ZIP</strong> file we’ve uploaded to the Internet Archive for safekeeping. Download it by clicking <strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/n64_testcart">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Below is the text from the included readme file with details.</p>

<p>.: Nintendo 64 Test Cart version 1.? :.</p>
<p>Finally, a public release of both complete ROMs from a Nintendo 64 test cart!</p>
<p>Test carts were designed to be reprogrammed–in full or in part–through the jtag port or via gangwriter. When there’s any kind of electrical delay whatsoever it seems to map the “testcart_reflash” ROM, allowing you to pipe a new “testcart_runtime” to it. (Check the “reflash interface.txt” doc for more info on how that works.)</p>
<p>Please note that the runtime is not supposed to be some perfect multiple of a chip size. If you have ever had the “privilege” of using jtag you’d understand why. The reflasher is aligned to the start of the last unit (each unit being 0x200000 large) and retains its padding (in other words, the unwritten bytes erased to 0xFF at the end). That file has a maximum size in other words, so that feels like an important thing to preserve.</p>
<p>.: Why version 1.? :.</p>
<p>For those in the know, a partial dump of the main runtime was taken by marshallh back on Jun 29, 2016. That was done by sniffing the address lines and was largely complete, lacking only data that wasn’t accessed (as opposed to used). It’s been available to emulator devs since then, awaiting a complete dump before public release. It’s the same build as this one or very, very close.</p>
<p>.: About Zaru :.</p>
<p>.: Does It Emulate? :.</p>
<p>It works fine on flashcarts, but then the test cartridge *is* a flashcart so that’s no surprise. Might be useful if you did a console mod and need to know how bad your solder job really was.</p>
<p>Note it’s *supposed* to display garbage for ~15 seconds, then differently colored garbage about as long before ultimately loading the interface. There’s an initial bootloader in the 80200000 range that first runs some very basic tests–like confirming RDRAM is available &amp; works by running through its setup and some r/w tests–before loading the actual interface code to the 80000000 range, faking a reset (except with zaru where the reset is quite real), then going through the entire initialization routine again and finally setting up some video. Don’t be surprised that it has two sets of basic lib functions. You can sidestep that–and need to if you’re using an iQue–but you’re also avoiding some of the lowest level tests.</p>
<p>The reflasher is relatively pointless to run without a real unit. It was incredibly helpful to learn how to talk to the flash properly and understand the IO limitations; the dumper(s) wouldn’t have been possible without it.</p>
