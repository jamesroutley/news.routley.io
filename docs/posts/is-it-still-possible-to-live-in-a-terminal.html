    <h1>Ask HN: Is it still possible to live in a terminal?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In college I did a month long experiment where I only used my computer&#39;s terminal emulator to do all my work. I wrote my code/notes in Vim, browsed the web with elinks, and wrote my emails using mutt. It was a great learning experience.</p><p>Recently I looked into doing this again and ran into a bunch of issues:</p><p>- My company uses Slack&#39;s enterprise auth, and all the CLI slack clients I could find haven&#39;t been updated in years and no longer work.</p><p>- The web is using more javascript than in the past.</p><p>- Mutt doesn&#39;t handle multiple email accounts natively for work/personal. The solutions are hacks at best. Email servers are starting to use more complete auth mechanisms that don&#39;t work well with mutt.</p><p>It seems like the terminal world is slowly getting abandoned in favor of proprietary GUI apps. Anyone still living inside the terminal? Links to tools for Slack are appreciated.</p></div></div></div>
