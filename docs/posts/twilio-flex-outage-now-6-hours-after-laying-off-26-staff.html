                    <p><strong>Update</strong> - <span>We are observing intermittent recovery of TaskRouter, Flex console login, and other underlying services within Flex. Our engineering teams are continuing to work towards full restoration of services and we will continue to provide updates every 30 minutes or sooner if we have further pertinent information.</span></p></div>

                    <p><strong>Update</strong> - <span>Our engineering teams are continuing to implement the redeployment of the underlying service, but the initial estimated time to partial mitigation is being extended until 9:30 am PST. No additional information is available at this time. We will continue to provide updates every 30 minutes or sooner if we have further pertinent information.</span></p></div>

                  <div>
                    <p><strong>Identified</strong> - <span>Our engineering team has identified that a degraded underlying service is causing failures on upstream services affecting multiple products. We are redeploying the underlying service across all other services. Our initial estimate was that partial mitigation would start at 8:00am PST, but our engineers have now updated that to start at 9:00am PST.  As we redeploy the service, this estimate may change. We will continue to provide updates every 30 minutes or sooner if we have further information.</span></p></div>
                  <div>
                    <p><strong>Update</strong> - <span>We have declared a sev0 incident related to ongoing issues affecting multiple products, including Flex, Programmable Voice, ElasticSearch, Insights, Voice insights, Programmable SMS, Automated SMS routing, Task Router Statistics, Agent Login, and support live chat. All necessary teams have been engaged to remediate the issue and restore services as soon as possible. We will provide an update in 1 hour or as soon as we have further information.</span></p></div>
