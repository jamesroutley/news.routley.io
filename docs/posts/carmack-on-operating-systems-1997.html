    <p>I have gotten a significant amount of response on the
    Quake 2 extension mechanism. I do read everything that comes
    my way (I can&#39;t respond to all of it, though), and I have
    learned a few things from the mail.</p>
    <p>Nothing is set in stone yet, but it is still looking
    like a dll is going to be the primary interface. I have been
    seriously considering a java interface, but the tradeoffs
    (time spent implementing takes away from something else...)
    just don&#39;t quite add up. Other options, like enhancing qc or
    using other languages like perl have very remote chances.</p>
    <p>One of the primary reasons is that you can allways
    build UP -- put more functionality on top of a dll, but you
    can&#39;t allways build DOWN -- accessing the registry from java
    for instance.</p>
    <p>For Id Software to develop a game, a dll will be most
    efficient. We have more cpu power, and we can debug it more
    easily. We are directing significant effort towards making
    Quake 2 a better GAME, as well as just a better mutliplayer
    virtual world. Quake 1 was pretty messed up from a game
    standpoint, and we don&#39;t plan on doing that again.</p>
    <p>What I can offer the qc hacking crowd is a public
    release of the qc interface and interpreter code from Quake 1
    when Quake 2 is released. The user community can then bolt
    things together so that there can be one publicly trusted DLL
    that executes an updated and modified qc language for
    portable, secure add ons.</p>
    <p>I really do care about portability, but it is just one
    factor that needs to be balanced against all the others.
    Things just aren&#39;t clear cut.</p>
    <p>Speaking of portability, to remove the guesswork that
    goes on, here are my current opinions on the various
    platforms:</p>
    <h3>Win32</h3><p>
    Win32 rules the world. You are sticking your head in the sand
    if you think otherwise. The upside is that windows really
    doesn&#39;t suck nowdays. Win 95 / NT 4.0 are pretty decent
    systems for what they are targeted at. I currently develop
    mostly on NT, and Quake 2 will almost certainly be delivered
    on win32 first. Our games should run as well as possible in
    NT, we won&#39;t require any &#39;95 only features.</p>
    <h3>DOS</h3><p>
    We are not going to do another dos game. No amount of flaming
    hate mail is going to change my mind on this (PLEASE don&#39;t!).
    The advantages of good TCP/IP support, dynamic linking,
    powerfull virtual memory, device drivers, etc, are just too
    much to overcome. Yes, all of those can be provided under dos
    in various ways, but it just isn&#39;t worth it.</p>
    <h3>Linux</h3><p>
    I consider linux the second most important platform after
    win32 for id.  From a biz standpoint it would be ludicrous to place it
    even on par with mac or os/2, but for our types of games that
    are designed to be hacked, linux has a big plus: the highest
    hacker to user ratio of any os. I don&#39;t personally develop on
    linux, because I do my unixy things with NEXTSTEP, but I have
    a lot of technical respect for it.</p>
    <h3>MacOS</h3><p>
    From a money making standpoint, the only OS other than
    win32 that matters, and it doesn&#39;t matter all that much. We
    have professional ports done to MacOS instead of unsupported
    hack ports, which is a mixed blessing. They come out a lot
    later (still waiting for quake...), but are more full
    featured. I have zero respect for the MacOS on a technical
    basis. They just stood still and let microsoft run right over
    them from waaay behind. I wouldn&#39;t develop on it.</p>
    <h3>OS/2</h3><p>
    A native OS/2 port of any of our products is unlikely. We
    just don&#39;t care enough, and we are unwilling to take time
    away from anything else.</p>
    <h3>SGI</h3><p>
    I don&#39;t particularly care for IRIX as a development
    environment (compared to NT or NEXTSTEP), but SGI has the
    coolest hardware to run GL apps on. Safe to assume future
    IRIX ports, but its not exactly a top priority.</p>
    <h3>AIX / OSF / HPUX / SOLARIS</h3><p>
    I wouldn&#39;t start a port to any of these, but if a trusted
    party (Zoid) wanted to do them, I probably wouldn&#39;t object.</p>
    <h3>BeOS</h3><p>
    I bought a BeBox because I am a solid believer in SMP, and I
    like clean, from-scratch systems. I was left fairly non
    plussed by it. Yes, it is lean and mean and does a couple
    things better than any other OS I have seen, but I just don&#39;t
    see any dramatic advantages to it over, say, NEXTSTEP. Lion
    (the company doing the mac quake port) has a BeOS port of
    quake sort of working, and have my full support in releasing
    it, but it will be strictly an act of charity on their part,
    so don&#39;t expect too much.</p>
    <h3>Plan9</h3><p>
    I spent a few months running Plan9. It has an achingly
    elegent internal structure, but a user interface that has
    been asleep for the past decade. I had an older version of
    quake dedicated server running on it (don&#39;t ask me for it --
    I lost it somewhere) and I was writing a civilized window
    manager for it in my spare time, but my spare time turned out
    to be only a couple hours a month, and it just got
    prioritized out of existance.</p>
    <h3>NeXTStep</h3><p>
    My favorite environment. NT and linux both have advantages
    in some areas, but if they were on equal footing I would
    choose NEXTSTEP hands down. It has all the power of unix
    (there are lots of things I miss in NT), the best UI (IMHO,
    of cource), and it just makes sense on so many more levels
    than windows. Yes, you can make windows do anything you want
    to if you have enough time to beat on it, but you can come
    out of it feeling like you just walked through a sewer.</p>
    <p>In the real world, things aren&#39;t on equal footing, and
    I do most of my work on NT now. I hold out hope that it may
    not stay that way. If apple Does The Right Thing with
    rhapsody, I will be behind them as much as I can. NEXTSTEP
    needs a couple things to support games properly (video mode
    changing and low level sound access). If apple/next will
    provide them, I will personally port our current win32
    products over.</p>
    <p>If I can convince apple to do a good hardware
    accelerated OpenGL in rhapsody, I would be very likely to
    give my win NT machine the cold shoulder and do future
    development on rhapsody. (I really don&#39;t need Quickdraw3D
    evangelists preaching to me right now, thank you)</p>
