    <h1>The correct amount of ads is zero</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Verge has finally shipped the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss">paywalled version of their site and added a subscription</a>. I personally have nothing against that move and I think freemium is the way forward if we want sites to be sustainable and not be invaded with ads. The personal highlight of the new version is obviously this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subscribers will also get access to full-text RSS feeds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hell yeah, full RSS feeds are back. That said though, one thing is a big no-no:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now pay to get fewer ads</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correct amount of ads for a publication that’s directly supported is zero. That’s the amount we should get. I don’t care about the rationale behind it. I’m giving you money, you decided how much money I should be giving you for your product, you don’t get to double dip and also sell my data to your advertisers and earn more on the side. I’ll say it again: the correct amount of ads, in this case, is zero. Get your shit together verge people.</p></div></div>
