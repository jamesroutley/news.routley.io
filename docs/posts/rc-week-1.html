        <p>I just started the winter 1 batch of 2023 at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> (RC)! I&#39;m very happy, I
        wasn&#39;t sure that I was going to make it as I applied very late and
        worried that I would miss the deadline for this batch. However, the
        process went super smooth and here I am at then end of week 1 (actually
        start of week 3, but I just now got my website up and running).</p>
        <p>I will be keeping notes on RC here, mostly weekly retrospects where
        I will reflect and potentially plan for the coming week together with
        short updates about what I&#39;m doing.</p>

      <div id="text-orgf313315">
        <p>RC operates a truly hybrid retreat where participants come from all
        over the world (and timezones). As of writing this (day 2 of week 3,
        I&#39;m a bit out of sync but aim to catch up to my current day soon!) I am
        in Sweden as I am sorting out my visa. Week 1 was split into two
        sections as the hub wasn&#39;t opened for the Winter 1 2023 (or just W1&#39;23
        batch) until the Wednesday of this week. So Monday and Tuesday were
        remote while the rest of the week I was present in the hub.</p>
        <p>I think this format really works well, since it is designed with
        being hybrid in mind and not tacked onto an already existing model. I
        think the tools really help here as I find Zulip a joy to use once you
        get the hang of it compared to for example Slack and the virtual RC hub
        is fun and interactive. However, being physically in the hub is also
        great, the space is very cool and inspiring (it really has a nice,
        comfy hacker vibe).</p>

      <h2 id="org8a0ac7f"><a href="#org8a0ac7f">Socializing is fun, but how am
      I supposed to remember all of these people?</a></h2>
      <div id="text-org8a0ac7f">
        <p>This week was spent mainly getting to know people of the batch, who
        they are, what they do and what their plans were. According to the
        directory of participants of my batch we are <strong>45 people</strong>
        and additionally there are people from the previous batch who are also
        around, making it <strong>93 people in total</strong>. The directory
        really helps keeping track since I can study who I met and do some
        quick mental notes, but I have several times re-introduced myself to
        others at the hub.</p>
        <p>I think taking an organic approach to this is best</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to meet as many people as you can.
            <ul>
              <li>Go to events and be ready to try new things out</li>
              <li>Introduce yourself even if you may not have the time to chat
              properly as this will set a context for further interaction and
              make it less awkward to talk</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Don&#39;t worry about meeting everyone, just be nice and things will
          sort itself out in time</li>
          <li>Naturally you will gravitate towards some people, either due to
          vibing or just because you share similar interests. However, don&#39;t
          let this make you insular, form inclusive contexts rather than
          insular cliques</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typing out the above it also strikes me that everyone present has a
        responsibility to make this retreat inclusive and enjoyable. This is
        basically some additional aspirations in addition to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">RC social
        rules</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="org38a9460"><a href="#org38a9460">The Manual and online
      resources</a></h2>
      <div id="text-org38a9460">
        <p>RC has an <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">online manual</a>
        which lays out what RC is, the environment and how to make the most out
        of your batch including logistics, planning your stay and the
        philosophy of this <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-welcome">unusual experience</a>.
        The manual contains a lot of material, but I found it really
        comprehensive and great for setting the tone for the retreat. In any
        case, it can be used as a reference as you go through your batch.</p>
        <p>There are also other resources available internally which I&#39;ve found
        really helpful such as the directory of nevergraduated RC alumni. The
        wiki is great and contains a lot of project that previous RC people
        have created.</p>
        <p>Finally, I think it&#39;s so refreshing to have things written down.
        Often we don&#39;t find the time to actually document processes, which
        leads to repetition which can become tiring, or worse, we may be
        uncertain what processes are or they may be implicit.</p>

      <div id="text-orgd25cfde">
        <p>At the end of the first week I felt excited, a bit overwhelmed, and
        slightly anxious about what my project would be. The <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">self-directives</a> were
        mentioned a lot and we also did some exercises about building our
        volitional muscles which I appreciate since I have a tendency to become
        a bit paralyzed when trying to scope out new projects and I should just
        get to it rather than just doing background reading perpetually!</p>
        <p>It was a joy to meet everyone during the first week and looking
        forward to meeting more people in the coming week, working together on
        different projects and pair programme!</p>
