    <h1>FTC sues Amazon over ‘deceptive’ Prime sign-up and cancellation process</h1>

Amazon shares fell 1% in early trading.</p><p>The FTC had been investigating sign-up and cancellation processes for Amazon&#39;s Prime program since March 2021. Tensions flared between Amazon and the FTC when the agency sought to have CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos testify on the company&#39;s Prime practices. Amazon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/amazon-accuses-ftc-of-harassing-bezos-and-jassy-in-prime-investigation.html">argued</a> the request would be unduly and burdensome, which the FTC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/amazon-cant-keep-jassy-bezos-from-testifying-in-ftc-prime-probe.html">rejected</a>.</p><p>Launched in 2005, the Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for Amazon. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content.</p><p>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, accuses Amazon leadership of slowing or rejecting changes that would have made it easier for users to cancel Prime because those changes &#34;adversely affected Amazon&#39;s bottom line.&#34;</p><p>Amazon made it difficult for consumers to buy items on its site without Prime, and a button that instructed users to complete their transaction did not clearly state that they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription, the complaint states.</p><p>The cancellation process is also difficult to navigate and designed to deter consumers from ending their Prime subscription, the FTC alleged. Amazon used an internal term called &#34;Iliad&#34; to describe the process, referencing Homer&#39;s epic poem about the Trojan War, the agency said, citing a report by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-ftc-probe-customer-complaints-sign-ups-internal-documents-2022-3" target="_blank">Insider</a>.</p><p>The complaint marks the third lawsuit the FTC has filed against Amazon in the last month. Amazon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/31/ftc-sues-amazon-over-ring-doorbell-privacy-violations.html">in late May agreed</a> to pay the agency more than $30 million to settle cases alleging privacy lapses in its Alexa and Ring units. Amazon said it disagreed with the FTC&#39;s claims but that it settled in order to move on from the matter.</p></div></div></div>
