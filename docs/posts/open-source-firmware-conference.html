    <h1>Open Source Firmware Conference</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Mission</h2><p>Change the way of firmware development, collaborate with others and share knowledge.</p><p>Closed source firmware development has been the de-facto standard for the electronics industry since its inception. That didn&#39;t change even when open-source took off in other areas. Now, with changing use cases and strict security requirements, it&#39;s more important than ever to take open-source firmware development to the next level. That&#39;s why we&#39;re inviting you to the Open Source Firmware Conference.</p><p><a href="https://tickets.osfc.io/" target="_blank">Get your ticket here!</a></p></div></div>
