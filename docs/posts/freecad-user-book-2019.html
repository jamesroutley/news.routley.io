<h3>About This Book</h3><p>This book is a documentation of my journey, learning Freecad. It is not a linear path from beginning to end, the sequence of topics added may appear somewhat randomly. For instance, I started with <a href="https://github.com/realthunder">Realthunder</a>&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/releases">Assembly 3 Preview</a> branch of Freecad, which offered the <tt>Link</tt> feature, an object that supports re-use of components without duplicating their definition, local or across file boundaries. I found that appealing for organizing standard parts in repositories.</p>
