<p>​The Pwn2Own Automotive 2025 hacking contest has ended with security researchers collecting $886,250 after exploiting 49 zero-days.</p>

<p>Throughout the event, they targeted automotive <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2024/9/23/announcing-pwn2own-automotive-for-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">software and products</a>, including electric vehicle (EV) chargers, car operating systems (i.e., Android Automotive OS, Automotive Grade Linux, and BlackBerry QNX), and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems.</p>

<p>According to the Pwn2Own Tokyo 2025 <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnAuto2025Rules.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">contest rules</a>, all devices targeted ran the latest operating system versions and had all security updates installed.</p>

<p>While Tesla also provided a Model 3/Y (Ryzen-based) equivalent benchtop unit, security researchers who joined the competition have only registered attempts against the company&#39;s Wall Connector charger.</p>

<p>The competitors collected $382,750 in cash awards after demoing 16 unique zero-days on <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-16-zero-days-on-first-day-of-pwn2own-automotive-2025/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the first day</a> and another $335,500 on <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tesla-ev-charger-hacked-twice-on-second-day-of-pwn2own-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the second day</a> after exploiting 23 more zero-day vulnerabilities and hacking Tesla&#39;s EV charger twice. On <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2025/1/23/pwn2own-automotive-2025-day-three-and-final-results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the third day</a> of Pwn2Own, they collected another $168,000 for 10 more zero-days.</p>

<p>After the zero days are demoed and reported during Pwn2Own events, vendors have 90 days to release security patches before TrendMicro&#39;s Zero Day Initiative publicly discloses them.</p>

<p>Two months later, during <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-earn-1-132-500-for-29-zero-days-at-pwn2own-vancouver/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024</a> competition, ZDI awarded another $1,132,500 for 29 zero-day bugs.
