    <h1>Berlin: Record harvest sparks mass giveaway of free potatoes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Germans love their potatoes. They eat on average 63kg a person every year, according to official statistics.</p><p>But the exceptional glut of potatoes produced by farmers during the last harvest has overwhelmed even the hardiest of fans.</p><p>Named the <em>Kartoffel-</em><em>Flut</em> (potato flood), after the highest yield in 25 years, the bumper crop has inspired one farmer to organise a potato dump on Berlin, with appeals going out around the German capital for people to come to various hotspots and pick them up for free.</p><p>Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, kindergartens, schools, churches and non-profit organisations are among those to have taken their fill. Even Berlin zoo has participated in the “rescue mission”, taking tonnes of potatoes that would otherwise have gone to landfill, or to produce biogas, to feed its animals. Two lorry loads have been sent to Ukraine.</p><p>Ordinary city residents, many feeling the squeeze over the rise in the cost of living, have arrived at pre-announced potato dump locations, filling up anything from sacks and buckets to handcarts.</p><p>Astrid Marz queued recently in Kaulsdorf, on the eastern edge of Berlin, one of 174 distribution points spontaneously set up around the city, to stuff an old rucksack with spuds. “I stopped counting at 150. I think I’ve got enough to keep me and my neighbours going until the end of the year,” she said.</p><p>The operation, called 4000 Tonnes after the surplus a single potato farmer near Leipzig offered in December after a sale fell through at the last minute, was organised by a Berlin newspaper with the Berlin-based eco-friendly not-for-profit search engine Ecosia.</p><figure id="493e703d-d74b-412c-8bf4-538e263cca1c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637f8c02f0307354213c8241b3ce9ec4f5fa1c65/0_0_3314_2379/master/3314.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637f8c02f0307354213c8241b3ce9ec4f5fa1c65/0_0_3314_2379/master/3314.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637f8c02f0307354213c8241b3ce9ec4f5fa1c65/0_0_3314_2379/master/3314.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637f8c02f0307354213c8241b3ce9ec4f5fa1c65/0_0_3314_2379/master/3314.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637f8c02f0307354213c8241b3ce9ec4f5fa1c65/0_0_3314_2379/master/3314.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637f8c02f0307354213c8241b3ce9ec4f5fa1c65/0_0_3314_2379/master/3314.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Workers distribute potatoes for their customers at the Berliner Tafel e.V. food bank." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637f8c02f0307354213c8241b3ce9ec4f5fa1c65/0_0_3314_2379/master/3314.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="319.449305974653" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Workers distribute potatoes for their customers at the Berliner Tafel e.V. food bank. </span> Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy Live News.</figcaption></figure><p>“At first I thought it was some AI-generated fake news when I saw it on social media,” Marz, a teacher, said. “There were pictures of huge mountains of ‘earth apples’,” she recalled, using the word <em>Erdäpfel</em>, an affectionate term for the potato sometimes used by Berliners, “with the instruction to come and get them for free!”</p><p>The excitement has lifted spirits at a time when arctic cold has Berlin in its grip, hampering travel, grinding public transport to a halt and leaving pavements hazardously icy.</p><p>“There was a really party-like atmosphere,” said Ronald, describing how people cheerily helped one other with heavy loads and swapped culinary tips when he recently picked up potatoes for his family at the Tempelhofer Feld.</p><p>As a result of the buzz, the potato is receiving something of a new lease of life.</p><p>It has helped resurrect stories about how the humble tuber first became popular in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Germany</a>, after Prussia’s Frederick II issued an order for its cultivation in the 18th century, known as the <em>K</em><em>artoffelbefehl</em><em> </em>(potato decree), establishing it as a staple food despite reported initial scepticism over its strange texture and form.</p><p>Recipes galore are being shared online as those who have scooped up the spuds try to work out what to do with the surfeit.</p><p>Although the potato has sometimes been spurned in recent years as some fitness gurus have recommended avoiding carbohydrates, experts have highlighted its nutritional properties, such as vitamin C and potassium.</p><p>Celebrity Berlin chef Marco Müller of the Rutz restaurant has said now is the ideal moment to give the potato the Michelin-star treatment.
