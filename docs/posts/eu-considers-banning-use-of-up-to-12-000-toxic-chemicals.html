<p><span>April 26 (UPI) --</span> Up to 12,000 potentially toxic or harmful chemicals could soon be banned from use in Europe, the European Commission has announced.</p>
<p>The European Union&#39;s executive branch published a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/49734" target="_blank">&#34;restrictions roadmap&#34;</a> on Monday as a first step in prohibiting certain substances linked to diseases and reproductive issues.
</p>
<p>As part of the European Green Deal, the European Commission published its chemicals strategy last October that outlined a sustainable path toward a toxic-free environment.</p>
<p>The proposal announced this week would be the world&#39;s &#34;largest ever ban of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/eu-unveils-plan-largest-ever-ban-on-dangerous-chemicals" target="_blank">toxic chemicals</a>&#34;, according to the European Environmental Bureau, as reported in The Guardian.
</p>
<p>Over 190 million synthetic chemicals <a href="https://www.cas.org/cas-data/cas-registry" target="_blank">are registered</a> across the globe, according to the Chemical Abstracts Service.</p>
<p>Chemical category groups like PVC plastics, flame retardants and bisphenols are included in the EU&#39;s plan.</p>
<p>To make it harder for chemical firms to avoid having individual chemicals banned, the European Chemicals Agency prefers dealing with chemicals in groups.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, firms can use a tactic called &#34;regrettable substitution -- altering the composition of chemicals to create sister chemicals that could be just as dangerous, The Guardian reported.</p>
<p>The toxins will be part of a regularly reviewed rolling list, according to the European Commission.
</p>
<p>Substances may be removed from or added to the list <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_revision_chemical_strategy_en.htm" target="_blank">prior to the revision</a> of the EU&#39;s Reach regulation for chemicals scheduled for 2027.
</p>
<p>Reach &#34;aims to improve the protection of human health and the environment through the better and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_en.htm" target="_blank">earlier identification</a> of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances,&#34; the European Commission&#39;s website stated.</p>
<p>The planned revision will assess possible impacts of<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_revision_chemical_strategy_en.htm" target="_blank"> changing Reach</a> regulation on the use of animal testing, protecting human health and the environment.</p>
<p>Scientists earlier this year said that chemical pollution had surpassed a &#34;planetary boundary,&#34; according to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/04/26/eu-s-great-detox-could-see-up-to-12-000-potentially-dangerous-chemicals-banned" target="_blank">Euro News</a>, which could threaten humanity&#39;s survival and break down essential ecosystems.</p>
<p>The United Nations released a report in February showing that chemical pollution-related deaths are surpassing the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/" target="_blank" title="COVID-19">COVID-19</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/594375-un-report-pollution-causing-more-deaths-than-first-18-months-of/" target="_blank">death toll</a> in the pandemic&#39;s first 18 months, the Hill reported.</p>
