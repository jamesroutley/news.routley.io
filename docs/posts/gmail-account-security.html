    <h1>Ask HN: Gmail account security</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I have a gmail account that I rarely use, but I know the password.  I enter it correctly and get the following message:<p>You’re trying to sign in on a device Google doesn’t recognize, and we don’t have enough information to verify that it’s you. For your protection, you can’t sign in here right now.
Try again from a device or location where you’ve signed in before.</p><p>Even if I get the code from the recovery email account, it won&#39;t work.  Is this the AI hell Google throws you into if you get a new phone and computer in the same year?  Has anyone else on HN run into this and found a solution?</p></td></div></div>
