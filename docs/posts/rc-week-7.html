<ul>
  <li>Yesterday I redesigned my <a href="https://gracekwak.me/">professional/personal website</a> to look more like the ones that other CS academic folk have while still retaining my personality. Really happy with it!</li>
  <li>Got <a href="https://github.com/grkw/gratie">Gratie</a> to a stopping point that I’m satisfied with. Thank you @<strong>Jordan</strong> for working on it with me :)</li>
  <li>Did today’s <a href="https://leetle.app/">Leetle</a> (“Weedle”) (thanks for sharing it with me @<strong>Russell</strong> !). I was looking for a way to get some easy wins and this seems great!</li>
  <li>Brainstormed more about my search engine UI project. Will take more thinking — planning to pitch it, and maybe some other ideas, at this week’s Presentations to see who else might wanna join me on a bigger-scale project.</li>
  <li>I already miss the W1s… but I met some great W2’s on Zoom today!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tues">Tues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Hub tours for W2’s</li>
  <li>Leetle with @<strong>Mia</strong></li>
  <li>Finished perusing the Zulip topic with all the W2’s introductions (wow y’all are amazing)</li>
  <li>Spent the majority of the day brainstorming different project ideas… perhaps I should’ve just picked any and started coding, but I really wanted to move forward with intention idk. Tonight I was really in my feelings and I thought of this one that I feel really good about! Hoping that others wanna join!
 <strong>pairing&gt;A wholesome web app for “open when…” letters</strong>
– also @<strong>Shenai</strong> I think this project has similar vibes as your <a href="https://notes-from-afar.onrender.com/">notes from afar</a>!</li>

This is one of those things that I’d never be able to do on my own and am truly so grateful to be doing it at RC <a href="http://gracekwak.me/user_uploads/13/mT5tDFVG4V7JDNHKKWsGvcZI/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-01-08-a-las-10.04.47p.m..png">Captura de pantalla 2025-01-08 a la(s) 10.04.47 p.m..png</a></li>
