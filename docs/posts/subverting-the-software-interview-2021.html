<p>Cans. Cans everywhere. Some alcoholic, some diabetic, all of them
eclectic. Remnants of nights long gone, spent hunched over in front of
the pale glow of a text editor. Time you’ll never recover, lost to the
ethereal dance of progress. There’s an old pizza box in the corner, a
faint memory of a lonely meal. You miss being able to go out and eat.
More specifically, you miss having the cash to do so. You think back to
a happier period in your life, one where your wallet was unbare, and the
numbers on your bank statement left no negative space for
interpretation. Those times are gone, and you’re desperate for the
chance to be able to feed yourself again. You’ve conjured software
magick for most of your life; regretfully, your supernatural programming
ability is hindered by mortal desires like eating and not being
homeless.</p>
<p>You came across a posting one night, one that offered the prospect of
potential employment. The words of the HR manager echoed softly in your
ears - among the sea of corporate jargon, unrealistic requirements, and
a slightly boring job description, your eyes lit up when they scanned
the salary range. Across the gossamer threads of the internet, where
datagrams twirl and spin across fibre-optic highways, this one reached
your browser, and by extension - your soul. It’s enough money to shop at
Whole Foods without selling a kidney. You jump back, your posture
restored by the rejuvinating shock of motivation, and fire your resume
across the void.</p>
<p>A response lands in your inbox a day later.</p>
<pre><code>Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out to us - we&#39;d like to invite you for a phone interview sometime this week, to get to know you and your fit with the team. This will include some technical problems, in addition to a short chat about your experience and skills. What time works best for you?

Best,
Dave 
{tech-company}</code></pre>
<p>Any time works, Mr.<code>{tech-company}</code>. Any time works.</p>
<p>You set up an appointment at your (their) earliest convenience, and
the day can’t come quick enough. You tell yourself to remain calm, to
remember the subtle spells behind negotation as you learned them so long
ago, but most of all - to hide your power level.</p>
<p>You’ve been a strong engineer since you started down this path, but
your strength is also your greatest weakness. You make a short note in
your head to remember that line if they ask you. It’s been a problem
since the beginning - you come across an interesting problem, one that’s
arguably trivial, but there’s some notion of challenge behind it that
you can’t resist. Maybe it’s because you didn’t get enough attention
from your broodmother, or maybe it’s extended procrastination that’s
easier to justify to yourself. Either way, you’re well aware of this
fatal flaw, your achilles heel, your glowing-red spot with a hit marker
on it:</p>
<p><span>You have a <em>tendency</em> to
overengineer things.</span></p>
<p>Your mind flashes back to when you wrote a 200-line CLI tool for
interactive and configurable cover-letter templating, instead of
actually sending out cover letters. Or when you translated half of a
<code>Node.js</code> project into <code>Rust</code> addons in order to save a few
milliseconds on a data processing step. Or that other time when you
built an S-expression parser, full templating engine, and macro system
so you could write <code>Lisp</code> instead of
<code>HTML</code> tags.</p>
<p>“I’m not gonna do that”, you tell yourself. “I need this job, so I’m
going to do everything in my power to make that happen”. You meditate on
this for a while, wondering about how you got this way. You were a
pretty laid-back kid, and extraneous attention to detail was never your
defining attribute. Your affinity for pretentious and overpriced coffee
definitely doesn’t help your mental state.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The day finally comes. Cans pushed aside, collared shirt adorned, you
turn on your webcam and lie in wait. Your encounter with your
<del>adversary</del> interviewer will begin soon enough.</p>
<p>The chartreuse <code>D</code> adorning the Zoom
window begins to shift, blinking from existence. Its pixels are
overwritten by the image of a man in his 30’s. He looks enthusiastic to
be there, and you get a feeling that he’s mastered the arcane magic of
office diplomacy. He’s done enough standups to make even the strongest
stander weak in the knees, and his waterfall methodologies rival that of
ancient naiads. Dave <code>{tech-company}</code> knows his stuff.</p>
<p>“Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. As the posting said,
we’re looking for a back-end developer, with at least 10 years of
Kubernetes experience, 20 years of cumulative experience in TypeScript,
PHP, COBOL, and Adobe Reader, in addition to a growth mindset and a
willingness to learn new technologies. We’re at the forefront of the
industry with our tools, and …”</p>
<p>He talks for a while about what it means to be a part of the
<code>{tech-company}</code> team, what the hours are like, and how their
work ethics share the same ability to resist deformation as their play
habits. Whatever that means. He goes over your resume, and expresses a
little bit of concern at the lack of experience. It’s not your fault
that companies want you to work before you can work. Everybody needs to
start somewhere professionally.</p>
<p>“I understand that my experience section is a little empty.” you quip
back calmly. The game of shogi has begun. “However, I have plenty of
exprience from working on personal projects and contributing to
open-source, and I am more than confident in my abilities as an
engineer”. Dave frowns.</p>
<p>“Alright. I’d like to get started on the technical part of this
interview. You look like you’re ready to move onto the fun part anyway.”
He says this with a slight smirk, as if to get across to you that he’s
on your side about this. You honestly just want a job. The encounter has
moved into its most crucial stage - the examination of your mind. You
wonder if it was always like this, whether the ritual of hazing
prospective hires through trivial puzzles has always been a hallowed
tradition of engineers, or if there was some tragedy that echoed through
history, forever changing the course of technical hiring practices. Did
Stallman have to <code>FizzBuzz</code> before he got
to yell at printers? Did Ritchie know how to invert a binary tree before
inventing null pointers? Did Edward Kmett-</p>
<p><em>ahem</em>. Dave coughs. “Sorry, just wanted to grab your
attention. You seemed a little lost in thought over there.”</p>
<p>Can a person really be lost when they ponder the secrets of the
universe?</p>
<p>“If you’re ready, here’s your problem. Are you familiar with <code>FizzBuzz</code>?”</p>
<p>Stallman be damned. You reply yes, but ask for some clarification in
case this company wants to be special and put their own spin on it.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="fizz-buzz"><span>Fizz
Buzz</span></h2>
<p>There’s a kid’s game called <code>FizzBuzz</code>, which works like this:</p>
<p>You go around in a circle, and count upwards from 1. The catch is -
every 3rd turn, instead of saying the number, you say <code>Fizz</code>. Every 5th turn, you say <code>Buzz</code>. If those conditions happen on the same
turn, you say <code>FizzBuzz</code>!.</p>
<p>Given a number <code>n</code>, where <code>n</code> &gt; 0, return a
list of strings representing a game of <code>FizzBuzz</code> with n turns.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Wow, even you’re surprised by how he managed to explain it with fancy
formatting. You’ll have to ask about his spellbooks after the interview.
The first thought that comes to mind is to do a trivial solution through
trial division -</p>

<p>But, something clicks in your head. It’s like a spark that slowly
emanates from your frontal lobe, traveling down your spine. You feel
chills, and the lights flicker for a moment.</p>
<p>Modulus is <em>slow</em>. It’s also completely unnecessary when you
realize that the problem just involves the parallel merging of cyclic
sequences. There’s a pattern to these strings, and a faint vision begins
to appear in your mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Dave stares at you, but you continue anyways.</p>
<p>In a white void, the only inhabitants are abstract objects. They
dance like the kinetic frenzy of atoms within a hot cup of coffee,
bouncing into each other, pairing up, and everything in-between. Only
one law exists in this frenetic land - concatenation. When two of these
objects pair up, they may join together in unity, free to live the rest
of their lives together as one. There are an infinite number of
potential pairings, and endless variations on what types might form the
primordial form of these objects.</p>

<p>Their concatenation function is polymorphic; specialized to their
form, but associative nonetheless. They can join amongst themselves at
any time, any number of times, and their final result depends only on
the order. This law is a constant among the vast landscape of parallel
universes, and they harmonize across the fabric of reality as they
slowly tend towards unity.</p>
<p>Among these objects are special ones, whose existence contributes not
to the affairs of their world. They don’t have identity; rather, they
ARE identity. These nameless objects can be joined together with any
other inhabitant of their realm, but to no effect. Their concatenation
is a null operation, and they leave the world just as they entered it -
empty. They are equal citizens to other inhabitants of their worlds, but
doomed to existences void of action.</p>

<p>From these classes, we can derive new worlds simply by swapping
arrows around. Reversing the direction of a morphism results in its
<code>Dual</code>, a backwards land where these
objects have goatees.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Dual</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Dual</span> {<span>getDual ::</span> a}</span>

<p>We can also define associative mathematical operations as monoids,
allowing us to treat them as first-class objects.</p>

<p>As a bonus - we can define the Church numerals as a <code>Monoid</code>, treating function application

<p>“<em>Ok</em>, I think we’re getting a little sidetracked here.” he
says, trying to restore normalcy to his precious conflict-free
workspace. You’ve only gotten started.</p>
<p>“I think I’m ready to code a solution now”, you whisper softly in his
ear. Technically, everything you’ve said so far is into his ear since
he’s wearing headphones.</p>
<p>We can create 3 infinite lists, consisting of “Fizz” and “Buzz” in
their respective cycles, along with the natural numbers. We zip the
“Fizz”es and “Buzzes” together into a single list containing the strings
in all their correct places, and fill in a number where there’s a
hole.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, regular lists have an unintuitive <code>Alternative</code> instance for what we want to do,
so we’ll just pattern match.</p>

<p>“Awesome”, he says. His expression doesn’t match his words. You make
a mental note to watch out for Dave at work - he seems like the Janus
type. He also <em>really</em> didn’t seem to like your 20-minute monoid
lecture to explain FizzBuzz. You try to salvage the situation by
mentioning the space-efficiency of your solution, since both
<code>fizzes</code> and <code>buzzes</code> are in constant-applicative
form, but he looks like he’s had a long day already.</p>
<p>Dave tells you, “We’ll get back to you when we make a decision.” and
logs off. You don’t feel too great about how the interview went, but
least you didn’t overengineer this time.</p>
