    <h1>Pasta Cooking Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p><span>

I generally find the numbers printed on pasta boxes for cooking time
far too high: I&#39;ll set the timer for a minute below their low-end &#34;al
dente&#34; time, and when I taste one it&#39;s already getting too mushy. I
decided to run a small experiment to get a better sense of how cooked
I like pasta.

</span></p><p>

I decided to use Market Basket <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigatoni">Rigatoni</a>. [1] It&#39;s a
ridged cylinder, and I measured the ridges at 1.74mm:

<p>

And the valleys at 1.32mm:

<p>

The box recommends 13-15 minutes:

<p>

This is a house brand pasta from a chain centered in a part of the
country with a relatively high Italian-American population, so you
might think they&#39;d avoid the issue where Americans often cook pasta
absurdly long:

</p>
<p>

<p>

I boiled some water, put in the pasta, and starting at 9min I removed
a piece every 15s until I got to 14:30:

</p>
<p>

<a highlight="" href="https://esoteric.codes/pasta-every-15s-big.jpg"><img src="https://esoteric.codes/pasta-every-15s.jpg" width="550" height="739" srcset="/pasta-every-15s.jpg 550w,/pasta-every-15s-2x.jpg 1100w"/></a></p>


<p>

Here&#39;s the minute-by-minute, cut open so you can see the center of the
noodles:

</p>
<p>

<a highlight="" href="https://esoteric.codes/pasta-cut-open-by-time-big.jpg"><img src="https://esoteric.codes/pasta-cut-open-by-time.jpg" width="550" height="90" srcset="/pasta-cut-open-by-time.jpg 550w,/pasta-cut-open-by-time-2x.jpg 1100w"/></a></p>


<p>

My family and I tried a range of noodles, trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search">bisect</a> our way
to the ideal cooking time.  I was happiest at 10m15s, but ok between
9m15s and 11m30s.  Julia thought 9m45s was barely underdone, while
11m45s was barely overdone.  Anna liked 10m30s.  Lily didn&#39;t like any
of them, consistently calling them &#34;too crunchy&#34; up through 10m45s and
then &#34;too mushy&#34; for 11m0s and up.  Everyone agreed that by 12m45s it
was mushy.

</p>
<p>

Instead of 13-15min, a guideline of 10-12min would make a lot more
sense in our house.  And, allegedly, the glycemic index is much lower.

</p>
<p>

My mother and her siblings grew up in Rome, and I wrote asking about
what they&#39;d noticed here.  My uncle replied &#34;my bias is that Americans
are wimps for soft pasta&#34; and the others agreed.

</p>
<p>

I tried using a <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/christmas-microscopy">cheap
microscope</a> to investigate, whether there were interesting
structural differences, but even with an iodide stain I couldn&#39;t make
out much.  Here&#39;s 3min:

</p>
<p>

<p>

And 7min:

<p>

And 13min:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://esoteric.codes/rigatoni-iodide-13m00s-big.jpg"><img src="https://esoteric.codes/rigatoni-iodide-13m00s.jpg" width="550" height="367" srcset="/rigatoni-iodide-13m00s.jpg 550w,/rigatoni-iodide-13m00s-2x.jpg 1100w"/></a></p>


<p>

On the other hand, the kids and I did have fun with the microscope.
