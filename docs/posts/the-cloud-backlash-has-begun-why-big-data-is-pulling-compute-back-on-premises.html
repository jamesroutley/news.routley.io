</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span>The great cloud</span> migration has revolutionized IT, but after a decade of cloud transformations, the most sophisticated enterprises are now taking the next generational leap: developing true hybrid strategies to support increasingly business-critical data science initiatives and repatriating workloads from the cloud back to on-premises systems. Enterprises that haven’t begun this process are already behind.</p>
<h2>The great cloud migration</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, the cloud was mostly used by small startups that didn’t have the resources to build and operate a physical infrastructure and for businesses that wanted to move their collaboration services to a managed infrastructure. Public cloud services (and cheap capital in a low interest-rate economy) meant such customers could serve a growing number of users relatively inexpensively. This environment enabled cloud-native startups such as Uber and Airbnb to scale and thrive.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, companies flocked en masse to the cloud because it lowered costs and expedited innovation. This was truly a paradigm shift and company after company announced “cloud-first” strategies and moved infrastructures wholesale to cloud service providers.</p>

<h2>The growing backlash</h2>
<p>However, cloud-first strategies may be hitting the limits of their efficacy, and in many cases, ROIs are diminishing, triggering a major cloud backlash. Ubiquitous cloud adoption has given rise to new challenges, namely out-of-control costs, deepening complexity and restrictive vendor lock-in. We call this cloud sprawl.</p>
<p>The sheer quantity of workloads in the cloud is causing cloud expenses to skyrocket. Enterprises are now running core compute workloads and massive storage volumes in the cloud — not to mention ML, AI and deep learning programs that require dozens or even hundreds of GPUs and terabytes or even petabytes of data.</p>
<p>The costs keep climbing with no end in sight. In fact, some companies are now spending <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to twice as much</a> on cloud services as they were before they migrated their workloads from on-prem systems. Nvidia estimates that moving large, specialized AI and ML workloads back on premises can yield a 30% savings.</p>			</div></div>
