<p><strong>Jules Memory for Repositories:</strong> We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new Memory feature! Jules now has the ability to learn from your interactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works:</strong> During a task, Jules will save your preferences, nudges, and corrections.</li>
<li><strong>The benefit:</strong> The next time you run the same or a similar task in that specific repository, Jules will reference its memory to better anticipate your needs and follow your established patterns, leading to more accurate results with less guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Settings:</strong> You can toggle memory on or off for the repo in the repo settings page under ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù</li>
</ul> </article><article> <h2 id="tell-jules-exactly-what-file-to-work-on-using-file-selector"> Tell Jules exactly what file to work on using file selector </h2> <b id="sun-sep-28-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> September 29, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/fileselector.7WfNoQbn_2m4uUx.webp" alt="File Selector" width="1498" height="754" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>

<p>Jules is now able to read and respond to your comments on pull requests!</p>
<p>When you start a review, Jules will add a üëÄ emoji to each comment to let you know it‚Äôs been read. Based on your feedback, Jules will then push a commit with the requested changes.</p>
<p>For more control, you can switch to <strong>Reactive Mode</strong> in your <a href="https://jules.google.com/settings">global Jules UI settings</a>. In this mode, Jules will only act on comments where you specifically mention <code dir="auto">@Jules</code>.</p> </article><article> <h2 id="all-hands-on-deck"> All Hands on Deck! </h2> <b id="thu-sep-18-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> September 19, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/changelog-019.C2qW8uJn_Z3euJL.webp" alt="image upload" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p>Ahoy, mateys! To celebrate International Talk Like a Pirate Day, we‚Äôve given Jules a temporary map to the treasure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jules Speaks Pirate: You‚Äôll find your AI agent‚Äôs responses are a bit more‚Ä¶ swashbuckling‚Ä¶ for today only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same Great Logic: Fear not! Beneath the eyepatch and Jolly Roger, it‚Äôs the same powerful coding engine ready to help you plunder that backlog and send bugs to Davy Jones‚Äô locker.</p>
</li>
</ul> </article><article> <h2 id="image-upload"> Image upload </h2> <b id="mon-sep-08-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> September 9, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/image-upload.CXDvQ88D_Z1J34qe.webp" alt="image upload" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>

<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diff viewer now stacks file changes vertically by default</li>
<li>You can also toggle back to the previous tabbed diff viewer</li>
</ul> </article><article> <h2 id="improved-jules-critic"> Improved Jules Critic </h2> <b id="tue-sep-02-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> September 3, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/changelog-016.DcExNlSl_ZDHzjl.webp" alt="Improved Critic" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p>We‚Äôve shipped significant improvements to the Jules critic agent, making its feedback more insightful and reliable. To increase transparency and give you more insight into its evaluation process, you can now see the critic‚Äôs real-time analysis as it works.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The critic‚Äôs thought process is now visible in the UI, showing its step-by-step evaluation of the code in real-time.</li>
<li>The critic‚Äôs now incorporates more contextual information when making decisions, leading to more accurate and relevant feedback on potential bugs and logic flaws.</li>
</ul> </article><article> <h2 id="jules-sample-prompts"> Jules Sample Prompts </h2> <b id="mon-sep-01-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> September 2, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/changelog-015.CXL47v6I_ZPLQu4.webp" alt="Sample Prompts" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>

<p>Great developers don‚Äôt just write code, they question it. And now, so does Jules. We‚Äôve built the Jules critic agent to ensure that every line of code isn‚Äôt just functional, but robust, secure, and efficient. It acts as an internal peer reviewer, challenging every proposed change to elevate the quality of the final output.</p>
<p>Some high level notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Critic-augmented generation:</strong> The Jules critic is integrated directly into the generation process. Every proposed change undergoes adversarial review before completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved code quality:</strong> The critic flags subtle bugs, missed edge cases, and inefficient code. Jules then uses this feedback to improve the patch in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A new kind of review:</strong> The critic is not just another linter or test. It understands the intent and context behind code, similar to a human peer reviewer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Built on research:</strong> This feature draws on research into multi-step, tool interactive critiquing and actor-critic reinforcement learning, where an ‚Äúactor‚Äù generates and a ‚Äúcritic‚Äù evaluates.</p>
</li>

<p>Today, we‚Äôre launching <a href="https://jules.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Jules,</strong></a> a new AI coding agent.</p>
<p>Jules helps you move faster by working asynchronously on tasks in your GitHub repo. It can fix bugs, update dependencies, migrate code, and add new features.</p>
<p>Once you give Jules a task, it spins up a fresh dev environment in a VM, installs dependencies, writes tests, makes the changes, runs the tests, and opens a pull request. Jules shows its work as it makes progress, so you never have to guess what code it‚Äôs writing, or what it‚Äôs thinking.</p>
<p><strong>What Jules can do today</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bugs with test verified patches</li>
<li>Handle version bumps and dependency upgrades</li>
<li>Perform scoped code transformations</li>
<li>Migrate code across languages or frameworks</li>
<li>Ship isolated, scoped, features</li>
<li>Open PRs with runnable code and test results</li>
</ul>
