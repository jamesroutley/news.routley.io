    <h1>The human toll of Fallout 76’s launch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="js_movable-ads-post-contents"><p><em>“</em>No one wanted to be on that project because it ate people. It destroyed people,” one former developer on <em>Fallout 76</em> told <em>Kotaku</em>. “The amount of people who would go to that project, and then they would quit [Bethesda] was quite high.” </p><p><em>Kotaku</em> spoke to 10 former employees of Bethesda and its parent company ZeniMax Media who were familiar with <em>Fallout 76’s</em> development, all of whom shared their accounts only under the condition of anonymity. Some sources said that they signed non-disparagement agreements upon leaving the company, and feared that ZeniMax’s influence in the industry would prevent them from being hired elsewhere. </p><p>Testers who worked during the months leading up to the original launch said that they crunched 10-hour days for six days a week as the game trudged toward the beta’s optimistic launch date of November 14, 2018.</p><p>Some testers would only find reprieve when they finally left the <em>Fallout 76</em> team. Two former testers recounted that one of their colleagues said in a QA group chat after leaving the project: “I didn’t cry last night when I was taking a shower.” Another said in the same chat: “I pulled into work today, and I sat in my car for a second, and my chest didn’t feel heavy like it normally does.”</p><p>Within the games industry, QA is seen by many consumers and even some non-tester developers as an easy job that involves “<span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/quality-assured-what-it-s-really-like-to-play-games-fo-1720053842&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quality-assured-what-it-s-really-like-to-play-games-fo-1720053842">playing games for a living.</a></span>” They are often <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-s-qa-department-seems-like-a-hellho-1847473158&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-s-qa-department-seems-like-a-hellho-1847473158">treated poorly</a></span> by their managers, <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/report-fortnite-developers-are-severely-overworked-1834243520&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/report-fortnite-developers-are-severely-overworked-1834243520">work long hours</a></span>, and are <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/former-paradox-testers-say-we-were-severely-underpaid-1844991173&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/former-paradox-testers-say-we-were-severely-underpaid-1844991173">underpaid</a></span>, to the point that QA testers at Raven Software recently <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-union-raven-software-activision-blizzard-s-1848399505&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-union-raven-software-activision-blizzard-s-1848399505">formed the first AAA-studio video game union</a></span> as a measure to help better their working conditions. Accounts of game production at major studios over the last <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/quality-assured-what-it-s-really-like-to-play-games-fo-1720053842&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quality-assured-what-it-s-really-like-to-play-games-fo-1720053842">seven years</a></span> have painted a picture of an industry where testers are granted lower professional status compared to colleagues with skills that are perceived as more technical or creative. As a result of this dynamic, testers told <em>Kotaku </em>that they felt more vulnerable to production issues on the <em>Fallout 76 </em>project, resulting in more brutal crunch. </p><p>These testers shared stories with <em>Kotaku </em>about ZeniMax management, and how it would habitually require overtime from QA, even when that overtime wouldn’t contribute to fixing a bug. A former tester who worked on the game’s DLC recalled being coerced into coming in to crunch on the weekend because the latest version of the game needed a fix. The individual tester would later discover that the development team had not implemented the fix, and that any work they did on the unfixed build would be for nothing. According to the former tester:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I remember seeing one of my coworkers stand up, look at the person who was in charge that day, and scream across the room: “Why are we here? We gave up our day for this. The build isn’t the build we need. This is useless. This is a waste of our time. Like why are we here?”</p></blockquote><p>QA contractors were rewarded with low hourly pay, while permanent employees would work for slightly above that. But no matter how desperate their circumstances, two sources believed that their colleagues felt financially compelled to stay at ZeniMax, the largest games employer in the Rockville, Maryland area. Crunching at ZeniMax was considered by Rockville-based developers to be the only way to work in games without moving their families.</p><p>When QA staff got called in for weekend crunch, the companies tried to motivate them with the possibility of being paid an extra $200 that week and the opportunity to eat “free” pizza. However, they found out that such perks did not make up for their work circumstances. As one explained,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I mean, we got overtime, but like all the money in the world doesn’t matter at that point… When we did weekend work, they would get pizza for us… [It] takes time to, you know, come out of that mindset and realize, yeah, they’re giving us something for free, but it’s not worth it. And it’s kind of the same with the overtime money. It’s like, yeah, it’s more money. But at what cost?</p></blockquote><p>In fact, a couple of former ZeniMax employees tell <em>Kotaku</em> that no amount of financial incentive could erase the physical and mental exhaustion they experienced from the continual onslaught of non-stop, obligatory overtime. Two sources claim that they tried to flag the issue to Rob Gray, the director of QA at ZeniMax. However, they say he continually deflected or denied that crunch was happening in his department. <em>Kotaku</em> was able to obtain a copy of the email that one source claimed that they sent to him about the testers’ working conditions. The existence of the letter is corroborated by two other sources familiar with the situation in QA. </p><p>One QA source recounted how badly they wanted to stop working, despite their financial need. When they almost broke a bone on the stairs, they fantasized about the prospect of being too injured to go to work the next day. They said it was the most comforting feeling they felt while working crushing hours on <em>Fallout 76</em>.</p><p>The testers also coped with the pressures of being surveilled. A couple of sources told <em>Kotaku</em> that QA workers would have their breaks timed or sometimes even be followed into the restrooms by non-management employees described by one source as “chronic snitches.” According to them, these otherwise normal testers, designated as “coordinators,” did not have a real title or pay bump, but felt that micromanaging their peers would help their career standing at ZeniMax. Another did not recall if people were specifically followed, but knew testers whose bathroom breaks had been timed.</p><p>Rather than bringing an end to their hardship, <em>Fallout 76</em>’s launch only brought new problems, as QA testers now had to endure constant vitriol from players who were <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-s-multiplayer-the-promise-vs-the-reality-1830595693&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-s-multiplayer-the-promise-vs-the-reality-1830595693">dissatisfied with the buggy state of the game</a></span>. Some staff received death threats. While it’s common for game companies to ask testers to moderate official forums, <em>Fallout 76</em>’s testers worked shifts around the clock to moderate bug reports written by frustrated players, all for a game that <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-s-multiplayer-the-promise-vs-the-reality-1830595693&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-s-multiplayer-the-promise-vs-the-reality-1830595693">reviewed extremely poorly</a></span>. One of <em>Kotaku</em>’s QA sources vividly recalled a bug report comment that said: “I am going to take a gun and go to the QA department and shoot all of them.” </p><p>The QA department was constantly losing headcount, but it wasn’t the only one. Other departments were also losing talented developers to the awful working conditions. </p><p>Even if developers outside of QA didn’t want to work on the dreaded project, <em>Fallout 76</em>’s management team was not shy about borrowing. They drafted developers from all over the ZeniMax umbrella, to the point that other projects were negatively affected. Arkane Studios’ <em>Redfall </em>and Bethesda’s <em>Starfield </em>both lost team members to the black hole of <em>Fallout 76</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/05/todd-howard-reflects-on-crunch-at-bethesda-and-across-industry-a-ign-unfiltered&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/05/todd-howard-reflects-on-crunch-at-bethesda-and-across-industry-a-ign-unfiltered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard had told <em>IGN</em></a></span> that, “We’ve been through every type of crunch you can imagine. And long ago, some ones that were very, very difficult for a lot of us personally, with your time, and your health and things like that. We have gotten much, much better at it. Now we’re at the point where we can really manage it. … I think it’s why people stay here.” He had framed the personnel shifting as a positive. In truth, the post-launch content for <em>Fallout 76</em> took a demoralizing toll on employees across the ZeniMax network. </p><p>Some sources noted that the project drove an exodus of senior developers who had worked on some of Bethesda’s most prolific titles. Many developers developed physical health issues, such as tinnitus and back pain. One source said it “wasn’t uncommon” for artists to have wrist braces. Senior staff who’d remained loyal to the company for 20 years finally found their reason to quit. Some had been around since <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>. <em>Fallout 76</em> was their final breaking point.</p><p><strong>“</strong>People don’t need to suffer so that patch 42 can come out on time. It is a deliberate decision to foster a workplace and a work cycle where that can happen,” one source said. “It is prioritizing the work over the people.”</p><hr/><p><em>Fallout 76</em>, the high-profile online multiplayer RPG, started off as <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-s-multiplayer-the-promise-vs-the-reality-1830595693&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-s-multiplayer-the-promise-vs-the-reality-1830595693">a grand promise</a></span>. On a dazzling stage at E3 2018, executive producer Todd Howard told thousands of fans that Bethesda’s next major game would give the player freedom.<br/></p><p>“When we think about games, we think about worlds, and the choices you can make, the stories that you create and tell yourself,” <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEUEfM4uFtg&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEUEfM4uFtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard said</a></span>. “We have a game, more than any game that we’ve ever done, where the choices are yours, where you’ll decide what happens.

Already, <em>Fallout 4</em> had seen significant backlash from the fandom as Bethesda stripped what had <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-is-not-the-fallout-fans-fell-in-love-with-1745651992&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-is-not-the-fallout-fans-fell-in-love-with-1745651992">formerly been a description-heavy franchise</a></span> and turned it into a <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637">quippier, action-focused one</a></span>. </p><p>But for better or worse, Bethesda found a balance and <em>Fallout 76</em>&#39;s predecessor went on to <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;Internal link&#34;,&#34;https://kotaku.com/this-week-in-the-business-fallout-4-the-win-1714357822&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-week-in-the-business-fallout-4-the-win-1714357822">break franchise records</a></span>. Releasing a follow-up with zero NPCs, on the other hand, was a more brazen gamble that did not sit comfortably with developers who worked on <em>Fallout 76, </em>according to sources. </p><p>A couple of sources <em>Kotaku</em> spoke with didn’t feel that the teams had a coherent direction for what <em>Fallout 76</em> was supposed to be during its initial three-year development cycle. According to one source, Howard was supposed to be in charge of the game, but he spent most of his time working on <em>Starfield</em>, which reportedly <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.pcgamer.com/starfield-release-date-trailer-2022/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/starfield-release-date-trailer-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started development</a></span> after <em>Fallout 4</em> shipped in 2015. One source told <em>Kotaku</em> that his subordinates would call it “seagulling” when he would “fly by later and shit all over an idea” that had popular traction within the design team. Another source felt that Howard was a decent executive producer, albeit one with a “bigger is better” design philosophy.</p><p>According to <em>Kotaku</em>’s sources, Bethesda leadership did not fully anticipate the challenges of producing a full-fledged live-service game, or the costs that doing so would inflict on their employees. Bethesda seemed to assume that putting “rock star” senior developers with extensive <em>Elder Scrolls</em> and <em>Fallout</em> single-player experience on the <em>Fallout 76</em> team would smooth out any difficulties in making a live-service game, but this would not prove true.</p><p>“As the game increased in size and scope, no additional time was ever really given for [testing],” one source told <em>Kotaku</em>. “A full pass of this huge multiplayer game with multiple expansions? [QA] got three days in a good week. It was one day if production issues resulted in a late build being delivered.”</p><p>It wasn’t just testers who were having problems. Some designers raised questions about griefing, multiplayer stability issues, and quest checkpointing, but said their concerns were dismissed or postponed by management. Even as the designers created major gameplay events, they had no clear idea of how many players would be on a server. Effective multiplayer design requires precise mathematical knowledge of how long it will take for players to clear encounters. <em>Fallout 76</em>’s designers, a source said,<em> </em>weren’t given the resources to derive that information, either. Bethesda did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. </p><p>In June 2019, Howard <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/02/bethesda-knew-fallout-76-would-have-bumps-a-ign-unfiltered&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/02/bethesda-knew-fallout-76-would-have-bumps-a-ign-unfiltered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gave an <em>IGN</em> interview</a></span> about how Fallout 76 was a game that “we wanted to play.” In reality, sources said that morale was also very low among some former <em>Fallout 4</em> developers who were assigned to work on <em>Fallout 76</em>. They joined Bethesda’s Rockville studio because they were fans of the studio’s single-player games, but now they were working in a genre they had little interest in. Two sources told <em>Kotaku</em> that many former <em>Fallout 4</em> developers they knew especially resented being assigned to make a live-service game. These were veterans who’d spent many years at a studio that was famous for prestigious single-player RPGs.</p><p>A source familiar with the situation noted that some developers from the main Rockville office had a chip on their shoulder about the success of live-service games. For example, the free-to-play mobile game <em>Fallout Shelter</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-06-19-fallout-shelter-reaches-usd100m-lifetime-revenue&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-06-19-fallout-shelter-reaches-usd100m-lifetime-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grossed $100 million in four years</a></span>, making it one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://gamerant.com/bethesda-games-best-selling-ranked/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/bethesda-games-best-selling-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most successful Bethesda games ever</a></span>. But even as studio executives eagerly eyed online games’ potential to rake in cash for years after their initial launch, some senior developers at the main Rockville studio were not enthused about <em>Fallout</em> becoming a live-service franchise. </p><p>Bethesda Austin, which was tasked with helping to bring <em>Fallout 76 </em>to life, was well-known as a multiplayer studio, and ZeniMax Online is the sister studio that released the highly successful <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>. However, two sources told <em>Kotaku</em> they did not believe that the two studios’ online multiplayer expertise was utilized to its fullest potential until after <em>Fallout 76</em> launched.

In an industry that regularly lays off large numbers of employees, Bethesda was unusual in how frequently it was able to retain staff for over a decade. It would cost a significant amount of time and money to re-train senior employees in new scripting languages. </p><p>Using the Creation Engine was supposed to be the lesser evil. Instead, it created complex problems that constantly required more people in the QA department. According to one source who worked on the game, <em>Fallout 76</em>’s tools were so poorly optimized that simply updating the build could break it, which could add even more production pressure on the developers. Since the design department would not move deadlines, sources from both design and QA say they were forced to accommodate for such errors with crunch, typically racking up between 10 to 16 hours of work a day. One source said that they clocked over 60 hours a week, and that they weren’t the only ones. </p><p>One source explained why Bethesda ideally would not have used the existing single-player engine to make a multiplayer game. In <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>, every element is an “event” centered around the player. If a player isn’t in an area, then the game thinks that the area doesn’t exist. In online games, areas have to exist at all times because multiple players could be observing the same location at once. <em>Fallout 76</em> struggled with trying to make everything exist at all times since the engine was designed to make games in which objects only <em>sometimes</em> existed.</p><p>Given Bethesda’s reputation for janky games, it’s no wonder that in an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.pcgamer.com/todd-howard-there-was-very-little-we-didnt-screw-up-on-fallout-76-launch/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/todd-howard-there-was-very-little-we-didnt-screw-up-on-fallout-76-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, Howard said that he hoped that the Xbox acquisition will help Bethesda’s games be better tested at launch. However, <em>Kotaku</em>’s sources said that <em>Fallout 76</em> underwent no shortage of testing.</p><p>When <em>Kotaku</em> asked about which features were broken as a result of poor scheduling, a developer replied: “Tongue in cheek: the whole game. In general, every major bug in <em>76</em> [that appeared at launch] was known by QA.” Bethesda did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. </p><p>Though they worked in the same building complex as the main development team, the testers at Rockville say they were expressly forbidden from directly interacting with any of the non-QA developers, including the devs who worked on bug fixes. If QA testers found a major problem, they were usually expected to escalate it to QA department leads rather than to the specific designers who owned the broken quests (and had the authority to fix them). With test leads being among the busiest people in the QA department, one source felt that this division between testers and designers caused significant delays in which a single issue could ping-pong back and forth for days or months. </p><p>Working on a beloved IP was supposed to balance out the stressors of working in game development. However, sources told Kotaku the misalignment between the business goal and the actual team members proved to be devastating for morale. One source felt that there was a feeling that “we were making a game that wasn’t primarily for us.” </p><p>Or even the fans. The source said that the developers who came from the <em>Fallout 4</em> team thought that <em>Fallout 76</em> would disappoint a sizable chunk of their loyal audience. “Even though the studio has a reputation for buggy games, I initially still had faith that they would delay rather than putting out a bad game.”</p><p><em>Fallout 76 </em>was never delayed from the release date announced at E3 2018.</p><hr/><p>“I don’t know how [Bethesda] made [Skyrim]. It doesn’t make sense to me,” a former employee told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Like it had to have been like monkeys with a typewriter creating Shakespeare. I don’t know how things can be so chaotic and people are still able to do their jobs.”<br/></p><p>There’s a story that some Bethesda developers believe: That it is special among big-budget studios. That its scrappiness can overcome any major creative challenge.

Multiple sources also told <em>Kotaku</em> that development staff (with the notable exception of QA) were not under a mandate to crunch or explicitly coerced to do so. </p><p>However, in practice, <em>Kotaku</em> was told by four sources, developers still crunched on every one of these games, and one source said that “I can’t speak to whether it’s scheduled on the production side, but everyone seemed to always know it was coming.”Multiple sources from both design and QA stated that crunch on <em>Fallout 76</em> was mandatory.</p><p>One of <em>Kotaku</em>’s sources said that both testers and leads called it “voluntold overtime” when management said that if nobody volunteered for weekend overtime, then everyone would be called in. A current employee said that peer pressure was the main motivator for crunch, and interns and contract workers could improve their odds of being converted to full-time if they crunched.</p><p>Despite the constant crunch, some testers believed that ZeniMax was one of the better companies, since they converted QA to full time instead of laying everyone off.

The Swedish courts ruled against no-solicitation clauses in employment contracts, and the case set a new precedent for Swedish employment law. <em>Kotaku</em> was able to view the letters that the lawyers sent the defendants, which said that they represented both MachineGames and ZeniMax Media.</p><p>Despite being sued by his former employer, Bad Yolk’s (now known as Ember Trail) Joel Jonsson told Kotaku that he didn’t blame MachineGames for the lawsuit.

I’ve never seen a contract like that in Sweden… It was very long and in many ways describing how much they own whatever you make… Me and [Paixao] said to management: ‘Many of these parts of the contract might not be viable in Sweden.” </p><hr/><p>Bethesda <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/officially-welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/officially-welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially became</a></span> a part of Xbox Game Studios on March 9, 2021, which placed <em>Fallout 76</em> under Microsoft’s stewardship.
