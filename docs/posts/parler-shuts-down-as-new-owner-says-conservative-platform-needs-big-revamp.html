<p>Parler, the self-described &#34;uncancelable free speech platform,&#34; has been sold and shut down while its new owner conducts a &#34;strategic assessment.&#34; The platform will be back eventually, new owner Starboard says.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://parler.com/">Parler website</a> is now a simple page containing only today&#39;s press release announcing the acquisition, which was completed without financial terms being disclosed. &#34;No reasonable person believes that a Twitter clone just for conservatives is a viable business any more,&#34; the acquisition announcement said, promising a revamp.</p>
<p>&#34;While the Parler app as it is currently constituted will be pulled down from operation to undergo a strategic assessment, we at Starboard see tremendous opportunities across multiple sectors to continue to serve marginalized or even outright censored communities—even extending beyond domestic politics,&#34; the press release said. No timing for a return was mentioned.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Starboard founder and CEO Ryan Coyne <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parler-set-to-be-shut-down-temporarily-by-new-owner-a88a51aa">said</a> that Parler is &#34;going to take a breath of fresh air.&#34;</p>
<h2>New buyer emerged after canceled Kanye West deal</h2>
<p><a href="https://starboard.co/">Starboard</a>, formerly called Olympic Media, owns conservative news sites American Wire News and BizPac Review. &#34;The team at Parler has built an exceptional audience, and we look forward to integrating that audience across all of our existing platforms,&#34; Coyne said in the acquisition announcement.</p>
<p>Parlement Technologies, the previous owner, struck a deal to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/kanye-west-to-buy-parler-promises-to-protect-conservative-opinions/">sell Parler to Ye</a> (formerly Kanye West) in mid-October. But Parler <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/parler-and-twitter-both-cut-ties-with-kanye-west-as-he-says-i-like-hitler/">canceled the deal</a> weeks after Ye praised Adolf Hitler and Nazis in an appearance on Alex Jones&#39; Infowars show.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Parlement then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/01/parler-reportedly-axed-most-of-its-staff-after-ending-deal-to-sell-to-kanye-west/">laid off</a> about 75 percent of its staff in November and December, reportedly leaving it with only about 20 employees. Parler also once <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/parlers-ownership-offer-to-trump-and-possible-russian-ties-probed-by-congress/">reportedly offered</a> Donald Trump&#39;s company a 40 percent ownership stake, but negotiations were cut off after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Parlement CEO George Farmer, who is leaving the company, &#34;said Starboard was one of a handful of suitors interested in Parler,&#34; the WSJ wrote today.</p>
<h2>January 6 attack increased scrutiny</h2>
<p>Parler&#39;s extremely lax approach to removing Russian disinformation came under greater <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/chairwoman-maloney-demands-docs-related-to-parler-s-financing-ties-to-foreign">scrutiny in Congress</a> after the attack on the Capitol. Parler was also kicked off <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/amazon-cuts-off-parlers-web-hosting-following-apple-google-bans/">Amazon Web Services</a> right after January 6, taking it offline until it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/parler-says-its-back-without-big-tech-after-being-kicked-off-amazon/">secured alternative hosting</a>. Apple and Google booted Parler from their app stores but eventually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/parler-re-platformed-as-apple-allows-social-network-back-into-app-store/">allowed</a> it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-02/parler-app-returns-to-google-store-after-ban-in-january-2021">back on</a> after Parler agreed to change its content moderation approach.</p>
<p>Parler has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/parler-be-acquired-by-kanye-west-2022-10-17/">said</a> it has about 16.5 million registered users, but its active user base appears to be much smaller. Analytics firm SimilarWeb <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/parler.com/#overview">says</a> Parler&#39;s website had 851,000 visits on desktop and mobile in the past month. In October, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/kanye-west-to-acquire-uncancelable-social-media-platform-parler/">reported</a> that Parler had 250,000 monthly active users on its iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>Despite that, Coyne claimed in the acquisition announcement that &#34;Parler&#39;s large user base and additional strategic assets represent an enormous opportunity for Starboard to continue to build aggressively in our media and publishing business.&#34;</p>
<p>Starboard also claims that artificial intelligence technology can help boost Parler&#39;s reach. &#34;Advancements in AI technology, along with the existing code base and other new features, provide an opportunity for Starboard to begin servicing unsupported online communities—building a home for them away from the ad-hoc regulatory hand of platforms that hate them,&#34; the company said.</p>
