                     Our starting point is the <em>tangent-point energy</em> of Buck &amp; Orloff (1995), which for each pair of points <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> on a curve considers the radius <em>r</em> of the smallest sphere tangent to <em>x</em> and passing through <em>y</em>.  By penalizing the reciprocal of the radius <em>1/r(x,y)</em>, the energy provides an infinite barrier to collisions—while naturally ignoring points that are close in space merely because they are close along the curve itself.

                     Untangling the highly tangled <em>Freedman unknot</em> <span>(top left)</span> to the unit circle. For the same wall clock time, standard L2 gradient descent makes almost no progress, whereas conventional Sobolev descent fails to smooth out low (<em>H</em><sup>1</sup>) or high (<em>H</em><sup>2</sup>) frequencies. By carefully matching the inner product to the energy, our fractional <em>H</em><sup><em>s</em></sup> descent quickly flows to the circle.

                     We can pack curves into a domain by penalizing their proximity to its boundary, and progressively increasing edge length. (Here we render curves with a non-circular cross section, which is not modeled by the energy.)

                     Allowing curve endpoints to slide freely over constraint surfaces <span>(left)</span> enables design tasks like arranging networks of muscles or muscle fibers <span>(right)</span>.

                     Just as repulsive potentials are used to equally-distribute points, we can compute collections of equally-spaced curves (here constrained to a region via a fixed curve potential).

                     Topologically intricate loops can be difficult to draw by hand---the sketches at left (drawn by Nathan Dunfield) illustrate <em>Dehn-Thurston</em> coordinates.  At right we generate an equispaced version of this curve by flowing a rough sketch, subject to an implicit surface constraint.

                     Traditional 2D graph drawing algorithms based on nodal proximity may cause edges to cross <span>(left)</span> or position nodes extremely close together <span>(center)</span>; these layouts were produced by the popular <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> library. By treating edges as repulsive curves, we can obtain graph drawings that are both more compact and more legible <span>(right)</span>.

                     Isometric embedding: by jittering 2D drawings of non-planar graphs (which necessarily have crossings), curve repulsion with length constraints yields nicely spaced embeddings in <em>R</em><sup>3</sup> with prescribed edge lengths.

                     As with Bézier curves, we can also control curve tangents at both interior and endpoints.  Here we flow a polygonal curve <span>(left)</span>, to a smooth interpolant with fixed points <span>(red)</span>, and fixed points and tangents <span>(blue)</span>.

                     Standard curve interpolation methods in 2D drawing programs can cause curves to self-intersect <span>(center)</span>, even when the control polygon <span>(left)</span> does not. By starting from the control polygon and constraining the control points, we obtain a smooth, non-intersecting interpolant <span>(right)</span>.

This same construction can easily be generalized to 3D environments.

                     Encouraging curve tangents to align with a given vector field improve the quality of streamline visualization. Here, a random set of curve segments <span>(top)</span> aligns itself with a rotational vector field; we can also optimize randomly sampled streamlines <span>(bottom)</span> to improve their spacing.

                     Local minimizers of the tangent-point energy <em>E</em><sub>2α</sub>. When α = 2 the tangent-point energy is scale-invariant and can exhibit “tight spots”; for larger values of α local interactions are penalized more than distant ones.

                     To accelerate evaluation of the tangent-point energy, we build a bounding volume hierarchy that partitions both positions <span>(left)</span> and tangent directions <span>(right)</span>, here drawn as a curve on the unit sphere.
