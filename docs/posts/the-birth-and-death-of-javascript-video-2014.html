          This science fiction / comedy / completely serious talk traces the history of JavaScript, and programming in general, from 1995 until 2035. It&#39;s not pro- or anti-JavaScript; the language&#39;s flaws are discussed frankly, but its ultimate impact on the industry is tremendously positive. For Gary&#39;s more serious (and less futuristic) thoughts on programming, try some <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All Software</a> screencasts.
