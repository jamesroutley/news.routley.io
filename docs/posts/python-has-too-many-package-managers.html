    <h1>Python Has Too Many Package Managers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Python is a wonderful programming language. I’ve used it to build webapps, deep learning models, games, and numerical computation. However there is one aspect of Python that has been an inexcusable pain-in-the ass over many years. That would be the fragmented Python package and environment management ecosystem, succinctly represented by the following XKCD comic:</p><p><img src="https://dublog.net/images/python_environment_xkcd.png" alt="Python tooling is complicated"/></p><p>You see, a lot of other programming languages developed standardized ways to setup versioning, dependency resolution, and dev environment setup. C# has <code>NuGet</code>, Javascript has <code>npm</code>, Dart has <code>pub</code>, and most notably Rust has <code>Cargo</code> – quite possibly the most widely loved package manager tool in existence.</p><h2 id="the-sane-way-to-do-things">The sane way to do things</h2><p>In a sane world, package management would work like it does with <code>Cargo</code> - the <code>rust</code> package manager. You have a single master configuration TOML file where you simply list your dependencies and config settings. The TOML file goes into a folder encapsulating your entire development environment. For extra reproducibility, whenever you build your environment and resolve all your package dependencies, a <code>*.lock</code> file records all the packages you used along with their versions and hashes.</p><p>Finally, because dependency resolution is a directed acylic graph (DAG) resolution problem, the dependency retrieval and resolution should both be engineered to be relatively fast. Dependency information should be freely available from a public API metadata server in a way that is simple to parse, and cached locally once downloaded to avoid redundantly hitting this server. Finally, the dependency resolution algorithm itself should be written in a relative fast programming language like C++ or Rust.</p><p>The problem with Python has been that there hasn’t been a single tool that does <em>all of this</em> well although some have come enticingly close. To that end, here is my rundown of more than a dozen Python package managment/virtual environment tools:</p><h2 id="classic-python-package-management">Classic Python Package Management</h2><h3 id="pip-and-venv"><code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code></h3><p>The OG of Python package managers. Dependency resolution? <code>pip</code> up until recently hardly did any dependency resolution at all. Historically it would install packages one by one, conflicts be damned. In version 20.3, introduced in 2020, <code>pip</code>finally added dependency resolution backtracking, which means if an inconsistent state was detected, it would go back and try to fix the problem. Unlike many of the other tools in this list, and unlike tools like Cargo or NuGet in Rust and C# respectively, <code>pip</code> does not manage environments along with dependencies. A separate tool like <code>venv</code> or <code>virtualenv</code> needs to be used to create “virtual environments” which are in turn be completely decoupled from a specific project or project directory.</p><p>One of the key faults of <code>pip</code> is what happens when you decide to remove a dependency. Removing a dependency does not actually remove the sub-dependencies that were brought in by the original dependency, leaving a lot of potential cruft. This actually needs to be done either manually or by using yet another tool like <code>pip-autoremove</code> to remove sub-dependencies that are no longer useful.</p><h3 id="pyenvhttpsgithubcompyenvpyenv"><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><code>pyenv</code></a></h3><p>One thing to note about python’s <code>venv</code> tool is that it isn’t really setup to create virtual environments for <em>different versions</em> of Python. To actually do this, yet another tool called <code>pyenv</code> exists which allows you to switch between different versions of system Python at will, with options to set Python locally for specific projects. Very often, I’ve seen this tool abused to set Python versions globally, which can lead to some severe reproducibility issues, with folks forgetting which version of Python they were using for different projects.</p><h3 id="pipenvhttpspipenvpypaioenlatest"><a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"><code>pipenv</code></a></h3><p>So <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> combined can let you build “virtual environments” and <code>pyenv</code> can let you switch Python versions. The natural thing to do is to have a tool that allows you to specify the python version and dependencies in a single file. <code>pipenv</code> basically sets this up, optionally interoperating with <code>pyenv</code> by letting users specify python version and dependencies in a <code>Pipfile</code> and locked dependencies in a <code>Pipfile.lock</code>.</p><p>The downside to <code>pipenv</code> is that it’s dependency resolution is no better than that of <code>pip</code> which it uses under the hood. Furthermore, in 2020, a new “Python Enhancement Proposal” <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/"><code>PEP 621</code></a> was accepted defining how package metadata should be consolidated in the future for Python projects making <code>Pipfile</code> and <code>Pipfile.lock</code> no longer quite “idiomatic” in the long run…</p><h2 id="consolidating-python-config-with-pyprojecttoml-and-pep-621">Consolidating Python config with pyproject.toml and PEP-621</h2><p>Before <code>PEP-621</code>, there were a large number of config files that could wind up in a given Python project:</p><ul><li><code>requirements.txt</code>: The project’s dependencies, which may or may not include package hashes (for security reasons) depending on how its setup.</li><li><code>setup.py</code> and <code>setup.cfg</code>: A script and a config file which collectively define dependencies and options.</li><li>`Pip</li><li><code>MANIFEST.in</code>: Tells packaging software (like setuptools) what sort of non-code files to include in the package.</li><li><code>tox.ini</code>: Used by the tool <code>tox</code> to configure environment setup, dependencies, and test commands (do you see the redundancy now?)</li><li><code>Pipfile</code> and <code>Pipfile.lock</code>: For folks using <code>pipenv</code>.</li><li><code>.pylintrc</code>: Used to setup config for linting tools like <code>black</code> and <code>isort</code></li><li><code>environment.yml</code>: Used specifically by conda to define dependencies, some of which are not python packages at all. Interestingly you can specify both pip dependencies and conda dependencies separately, even if a pip package has a corresponding (and possibly better curated) version on a conda channel!</li><li><code>.condarc</code>: The config file for Conda.</li></ul><p>Naturally the proliferation of all these tools and standards leads to a massive amount of redundancy. There is effectively no standard way to enumerate the dependencies of a given package nor how to setup tools like linters and tests.</p><p><img src="https://dublog.net/images/xkcd_standards.png" alt="The problem with new standards"/></p><p>In 2020 <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/"><code>PEP 621</code></a> was accepted. This proposal effectively gives a guidance to consolidate <em>everything</em> into a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, almost identical to <code>Cargo.toml</code> in Rust and similar to the <code>package.json</code> used in <code>npm</code>. Naturally this led to a proliferation of new Python package managers which leverage the new standard. Enter <code>poetry</code>, <code>PDM</code>, <code>Flit</code>, and <code>Hatch</code>.</p><h3 id="poetryhttpsgithubcompython-poetrypoetry"><a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a></h3><p><code>Poetry</code> right now is the closest tool in the Python ecosystem with widespread traction that actually comes close to approximating the experience of using tools like <code>Cargo</code> and <code>npm</code>. Unlike <code>pip</code> and similar to <code>conda</code> and <code>mamba</code> (<em>See below</em>), <code>Poetry</code> will attempt to resolve the full dependency graph DAG beforehand, and install dependencies in topological order. It <em>mostly</em> respects <code>pyproject.toml</code> and treats it as a first-class citizen. Like <code>conda</code> and <code>venv</code>, <code>poetry</code> can also manage your virtual environments, which can exist within or outside of your project folder. <code>poetry</code> also generates <code>poetry.lock</code> files which can be an immense boon for reproducibility. Notably, these lockfiles are multi-platform lock files meaning they can be extremely large. Finally, <code>poetry</code> is also a build tool, allowing users to build and publish Python packages rather seamlessly.</p><p><code>Poetry</code> is <em>almost</em> the perfect tool for the job, however it has a number of downsides that can be utter deal breakers for production or even basic research and development. First of all dependency resolution can be incredibly slow. A big part of this is no fault of <code>poetry</code> in of itself, but rather in the disparate ways in which Python packages enumerate their dependencies. Unlike other programming ecosystems, not all Python packages declare their metadata in a way that is necessarily served cleanly by public metadata APIs like PyPI. In these cases, exploring every dependency for every possible package in the DAG can involve a staggering amount operations to directly figure out package dependencies by downloading and parsing python wheels. For some folks doing basic R&amp;D, the cost of simply having a few packages excluded from dependency resolution can be a fairer tradeoff than waiting minutes to hours to find a “failure to resolve dependencies”.</p><p>Furthermore, as of 2024, the dependency resolver in <code>poetry</code> is actually still written in Python as a depth-first search algorithm. By comparison, tools like <code>mamba</code> have resolvers written in C++ as boolean SAT solvers which are orders of magnitude faster! Dependency resolves for large projects in <code>poetry</code>, combined with the generation of multiplatform lockfiles can take an obscene amount of time… especially when there is an actual conflict in the DAG.</p><p>I have actually used <code>poetry</code> at my last job, and one of the number one issues with the tool is in how most folks (even incredibly experienced folks!) used it incorrectly to specify dependency bounds on library code intended to be widely shared. In <code>poetry</code> there is the option to use a caret <code>^</code> operator implicitly specify upper and lower bounds. For example, specifying <code>^0.2.3</code> is equivalent to specifying <code>&gt;=0.2.3,&lt;0.3.0</code>. This ceiling pinning seems like a good idea on the surface, but can wreck havok when applied across a large RnD organization, with numerous “false positive” unresolvable dependency DAGs when well-intentioned software engineers apply it too liberally. This sort of well intentioned ceiling pinning can have <a href="https://iscinumpy.dev/post/bound-version-constraints/">devastating consequences for libraries intended to be used widely</a>.</p><h3 id="pdmhttpsgithubcompdm-projectpdm"><a href="https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm"><code>pdm</code></a></h3><p><code>pdm</code> is incredibly similar to <code>poetry</code>, but has a core difference difference in that it also supports <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/"><code>PEP-582</code></a>. This PEP basically brings <code>pdm</code> in line with other programming language environment setups by jettisoning the idea of virtual environments that are independent of a given project/folder. When you are in your project directory, you are effectively in your virtual environment (which is not necessarily totally isolated from the system environment and any other active virtual environments). This can greatly reduce the futzing around of having to activate and deactivate various virtual environment tools in Python.</p><h3 id="hatchhttpsgithubcompypahatch"><a href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch"><code>hatch</code></a></h3><p>Unlike the other tools on this list, <code>hatch</code> is a full build system for python which support <code>pyproject.toml</code>. I have not actually tried this tool, but it mostly overlaps with <code>poetry</code> and is not as popular. Unfortunately its documentation does not do a particularly good job of enumerating its strengths or benefits over <code>poetry</code>.</p><h2 id="the-conda-ecosystem">The Conda ecosystem</h2><p>It would be impossible to dive into an article on Python tooling without talking about Conda. <code>conda</code> was created by some of the most prominent members of the Python open source community - Travis Oliphant (one of the creators of Numpy, Numba, and SciPy) and Peter Wang who was a developer of Bokeh.</p><h3 id="condahttpscondaioprojectscondaenlatestuser-guidegetting-startedhtml"><a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html"><code>conda</code></a></h3><p>In many ways <code>conda</code> and <code>anaconda</code> solves most of the core problems with Python environment setups for data science work. <code>conda</code> actually can manage non-Python dependencies along with Python packages within its own <code>conda</code> virtual environments. This provided a fairly ergonomic way for scientists to swap around non-python dependencies without resorting to using Docker (which is significantly higher friction to use). This is the tool I use outside of work, and it’s great for experimenting.</p><p>Like <code>poetry</code>, <code>conda</code> performs a full dependency resolve when building an environment, but unlike <code>poetry</code>, in recent years the <code>conda</code> dependency resolver has been <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community">swapped out for a faster one written in C++</a> called <code>libmamba</code>. Additionally, unlike <code>poetry</code>, there is no need to go and attempt to parse python packages directly when insufficient metadata was provided by upstream package maintainers. This is because <code>conda</code> has entirely separate metadata api servers which force package uploaders to maintain stricter standards of dependency declarations.</p><p>The core tradeoff with <code>conda</code> is that it attempts to do package metadata the “right” way by enforcing the existence of a separate <code>environment.yml</code> which properly declares dependencies and other metadata. It is actually this information which is served by <code>conda</code>’s separate metadata API servers. This can be onerous to adapt in a company that already has many internal python packages. If there is some obscure python package out there that does not have this file, then you won’t be able to install it using <code>conda</code> cleanly. However, <code>pip</code> installs within conda environments are possible leading to a potentially awkward mishmash of relying on two package managers. Another thing to keep in mind with <code>conda</code> is that it neither generates lock files out-of-the-box nor supports <code>pyproject.toml</code> config files.</p><p>In 2024, <code>conda</code> is not ideally ergonomic. Users still have to fiddle around with <code>conda</code> virtual environments which are decoupled from specific project folders. Dependencies and config for a project can be difficult to keep track of across conda <code>environment.yml</code> files, pip installs, and other configuration files. Publishing a package is neither particularly simple nor easy.</p><p>I have also seen some organizations avoid using <code>conda</code> for production deployments due to the fact <code>conda</code> tends to install a lot of cruft since it manages non-python dependencies as well. Such orgs will lean towards using <code>Docker</code> and <code>*.lock</code> style files to enumerate dependencies.</p><p>That being said, <code>conda</code> is probably the best tool for data scientists and experimentalists right now. It is treated as a first-class citizen by a number of third party tools widely used in the Python ecosystem such as <a href="https://www.ray.io/">Ray</a> and <a href="https://metaflow.org/">Metaflow</a>.</p><h4 id="mambahttpsgithubcommamba-orgmamba"><a href="https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba"><code>mamba</code></a></h4><p>There are actually multiple implementations of <code>conda</code>. <code>mamba</code> is basically a full rewrite of <code>conda</code> in C++, making it substantially faster. The slowest bits of <code>conda</code> however were actually the solver, and as of 2024, the <code>libmamba</code> solver has been ported over to <code>conda</code> from the <code>mamba</code> project. Perhaps in the future <code>conda</code> may be totally replaced by <code>mamba</code>.</p><h2 id="python-package-management-meets-rust">Python Package management meets Rust</h2><p>Some of the most promising developments in the Python package management world have been from the Rust community. No doubt Rustaceans have a clear example of how a package manager setup <em>should</em> work in the from of <code>Cargo</code>, and so several promising solutions have cropped up in the past 2 years, most notable of which has been <code>uv</code>.</p><h3 id="huakhttpsgithubcomcnpryerhuak"><a href="https://github.com/cnpryer/huak"><code>huak</code></a></h3><p>Just to illustrate that multiple groups have tried to make a “Cargo for Python”, I wanted to briefly mention <code>huak</code>. The tool is completely experimental as of the writing of this article and not widely used, but attempts to graft the ergonomics of Cargo into a python package manager.</p><h3 id="ryehttpsgithubcomastral-shrye"><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye"><code>rye</code></a></h3><p>One of the first attempts to redo Python package management in Rust by <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko">Armin Ronacher</a>. Unfortunately, the actual slow part (dependency resolution) was simply calling <code>piptools</code> under the hood, leading to no discernable gain in speed or performance. This project was ultimately abandoned by its author in 2023 and given to <code>Astral.sh</code> in favor of supporting <code>uv</code> instead…</p><h3 id="uvhttpsastralshbloguv"><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv"><code>uv</code></a></h3><p><code>uv</code> is by far the most promising package management tool in the Python ecosystem as of the writing of this post. This project actually aims to be a drop-in replacement for <code>pip</code> on top of being a <code>Cargo</code> for Python. The API is currently in no ways stable (as of 2024), but the benchmarks are incredibly promsing. Most notably, the development is backed by Astral.sh, a company formed by <a href="https://twitter.com/charliermarsh">Charlie Marsh</a> and the creators of the <a href="https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster"><code>ruff</code> linter</a>, a widely beloved tool that virtually supplanted all incumbants overnight when it was released in 2022.</p><p>Like <code>poetry</code>, this project supports <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and like <code>pip</code> it uses a backtracking approach for dependency resolution. Unlike <code>pip</code> this algorithm is written in Rust and is very fast! Benchmarks show that <code>uv</code> is at least order of magnitude faster than <code>poetry</code> <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md">when it comes to dependency resolution</a>. I fully expect <code>uv</code> to supersede <code>poetry</code> in the future as the project matures and API stabilizes.</p><h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3><p>Hopefully one day there will be a cohesive solution to bring Python package management to the simplicity and ergonomics seen in the Javascript and Rust development ecosystems. Until then, I would simply recommend that most data science/experimentalists stick to using <code>conda</code>, and production oriented folks use <code>pip</code> or <code>poetry</code> (with some mindfulness towards slow dependency resolve for complex projects with <code>poetry</code>).</p><p>Fingers crossed, though, I hope <code>uv</code> takes off and the Python community can one day coalesce around a single standardized tool!</p></div></div>
