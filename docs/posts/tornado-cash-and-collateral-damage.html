On August 8, the US government <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">sanctioned</a>
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash">Tornado Cash</a>
cryptocurrency 
mixer for money laundering.  The sanction means that no US citizen or
company can interact with Tornado Cash in any way, all assets of the
organization are to be reported so that they can be seized, and more.  But
at the core of Tornado Cash is a chunk of open-source code for &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contracts</a>&#34;
that run in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> blockchain; that
code was &#34;seized&#34; as well.  There 
are some disturbing implications here for our communities.
</p>

<h4>Mixing</h4>

<p>
Tornado Cash is (or was) a service for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_tumbler">mixing
cryptocurrency</a> in order to 
provide privacy protection for the owners.  While transactions on
cryptocurrency blockchains are pseudonymous, the parties are only
identified by public keys, there are ways to trace the transactions and to
associate individuals with their holdings.  Early on, one of the
attractions of Bitcoin was its anonymity, but that turned out to be
illusory.  Cryptocurrency mixers provide a means to restore some level of
anonymity to the system.
</p>

<p>
Mixers (or &#34;tumblers&#34;) work by collecting up a bunch of deposits, which get
coalesced into larger chunks over a random period of time, then doling out
portions of that chunk as withdrawals at a later time.  Naturally, a
percentage of the deposits (1-3% normally) typically stay with the service as
profit.  Because the deposits and withdrawals are not synchronized in time,
users can break the link between a particular chunk of cryptocurrency and
their holdings. Privacy-conscious users presumably change the patterns of
their withdrawals by using differing amounts than those of the
deposits to further obfuscate any links. 
</p>

<p>
Someone who wants to donate to a cause that might be unpopular with some
nation-states (say, money for Ukraine) might use a mixer to avoid problems
from a donation being traced back to them.  Of course, there are others who
want privacy for less savory reasons: criminals of various sorts. It seems
clear that mixers are used for money laundering, but many tools, perhaps
all, can be used for both good and ill.  Typically, however, tools are not
prosecuted (or sanctioned), people are.
</p>

<p>
There is a point at which any anonymity or pseudonymity generally must be
shed due to existing anti-money-laundering protocols.
In particular, when someone
wants to turn their cryptocurrency into, say, US dollars (or any other real
currency), they have to work with a financial organization that is subject
to the &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">know
your customer</a>&#34; (KYC) guidelines/rules.  The financial organization will
gather identity information from its customers establishing a link between
a given address and a person. That is one of the prime reasons a
criminal might want to mix their ill-gotten gains before a withdrawal, but
there are perfectly legitimate reasons for others to do so.
</p>

<p>
We do not normally post our bank balances to the world at large, nor our
credit-card purchase history.  But if a link can be made between a
particular address/key and an individual, that&#39;s effectively what would be
available—stored immutably on the blockchain.  A data breach at a KYC-following
organization could &#34;out&#34; all of its customers, their
holdings, and their transactions.  It does not take a criminal mind to want
to avoid that kind of disclosure.
</p>

<p>
What is the legal status of ten
units of cryptocurrency obtained legally that is mixed with one unit, say,
from some crime 
source?   We deposit our money into banks that undoubtedly take in some
deposits from dubious sources as well, but the presence of the &#34;bad&#34; money
does not normally taint withdrawals made from them.  Perhaps the goal is to
force these mixers to follow KYC, but the nature of the Tornado Cash
transaction means that 
there really is no &#34;custodian&#34; to do so.
</p>

<p>
The smart contracts that underlie Tornado Cash work in such a way that the
participants and the smart-contract code share the custodial duties at some
level.  The contracts are programs that run on the blockchain to ensure
(assuming 
no bugs) that all of the various parties perform the actions required of
them. The code to make that all happen used to be available in the GitHub
repository for Tornado Cash, but the repository disappeared on
August 8 as well. 
</p>

<p>
Beyond that, these smart contracts are still floating around the Ethereum
blockchain and nothing—other than concern for being tainted by association
with Tornado Cash perhaps—is stopping anyone from using them.  In
fact, someone would appear to be trolling the authorities by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/09/someone-is-trolling-celebs-by-sending-eth-from-tornado-cash/">sending
small amounts</a> from prohibited Tornado Cash addresses to prominent
people; those 
transactions cannot be declined, but receiving such a &#34;gift&#34; is technically
in violation of the sanctions.
</p>

<h4>Reactions</h4>

<p>
Given that code has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States">found to be
protected free speech</a>, at least in the US, causing its removal from
GitHub seems like a clear violation of the constitution. Cryptographer
Matthew Green <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1556764387796340736">noted
that</a>, but also pointed out the irony of removing code from a
distributed, decentralized revision-control system like Git.  One suspects
there are thousands of copies of the Git repository available in various
places and that any attempt to &#34;disappear&#34; the code further will only make
it spread.
</p>

<p>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is also <a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1559224086491934720">concerned</a>
about this action, noting that the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20220808">list
of sanctioned entities</a> has an open-source project (i.e. Tornado Cash)
on it. It is worth noting that no individuals are on that list, which is
mostly just a long list of cryptocurrency addresses, along with three other
entries:
&#34;<q>TORNADO CASH (a.k.a. TORNADO CASH CLASSIC; a.k.a. TORNADO CASH NOVA);
Website tornado.cash; [...] Organization Established Date 2019; [...]</q>&#34;
</p>

<p>
However, GitHub went further than just taking down the repository for
Tornado Cash; it also suspended the accounts of founders and contributors
to the project.  Beyond that, authorities in the Netherlands <a href="https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/">arrested</a>
one of the founders on August 12.  Various other organizations have
completely distanced themselves from Tornado Cash as well, including other
cryptocurrency firms freezing assets associated with Tornado Cash.
Meanwhile, anyone subject to US laws who has cryptocurrency deposited into
Tornado Cash contracts cannot (legally) access it.  Given the nature of the
smart contracts, and the tenacity of the US government, anyone in that
position should probably plan to simply 
walk away from those assets—ill-gained or no.
</p>

<p>
GitHub may well have had no choice but to remove the Tornado Cash
repository, though the futility of doing so is fairly obvious.  The code is
effectively just collateral damage.  But it would
not be surprising to learn that repositories with the full history of the
project, albeit with different hash values, already exists elsewhere on
GitHub itself.  Creating a mirror-image repository from a starting point
one byte different than the original will create an entirely
different Git &#34;blockchain&#34;, after all; evading checks for identical object
hashes is similarly trivial.  
</p>

<p>
Suspending the contributor accounts is harder to understand, however.  As
noted, no individuals are on the sanctions list so there is no obvious
reason (other than taint) to suspend them. 
It also seems likely that those
contributors 
had other projects on GitHub; now those projects are unavailable, which may
have a ripple effect throughout our communities.  Those who are using
GitHub for their projects may want to carefully consider what the company
might do to their repositories—without any real evidence and no
charges—down the road.  GitHub is certainly not required to host anything
or anyone, but these kinds of actions seem sure to give developers pause
about using its services. 
</p>

<p>
The press release from the US paints a typically bleak picture of what
Tornado Cash has &#34;done&#34;, though &#34;facilitated&#34; seems far more
accurate. There are several 
notorious 
cryptocurrency thefts mentioned, including one made by a rogue state (North
Korea), where the proceeds were laundered via Tornado Cash.  Some
$7-billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency was laundered that way, the
release said, 
though that seems to lump any legitimate uses in with the criminals since
that is the figure widely used for the total of all Tornado Cash
transactions.  
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that criminals should be caught, convicted, and punished
for these and other crimes, but it is easy to downplay the collateral
damage of this kind of action by trying to paint it as mostly affecting
criminals. It is all part of the same playbook that attacks strong encryption
and tools like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor</a>
because they can also be used by terrorists, child sexual abuse offenders, and
the like.  It is true that those tools can be used to facilitate
such activities, but so can a wide variety of other things.  The tools are not
at fault.
</p>

<p>
Here at LWN, we generally do not pay much attention to the machinations of
the cryptocurrency 
world—all of that tends to be far outside of our remit.
There is a fair amount of distasteful hype, snake oil, and scams that go
with that territory as well.  But this event is not about any of that
stuff, really; 
this comes down to a question of fundamental freedoms and human
rights. As with the much-maligned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture">asset forfeiture</a>
scheme, governments are taking things away, without due process, and forcing
those wrongly affected to demonstrate how they were wronged—often at great
expense.  
</p>

<p>
This kind of event could
also be something of a bellwether test for the &#34;freedoms&#34; and &#34;rights&#34;
of code.  The Tornado Cash code exists, it is running on an infrastructure
that cannot 
(easily) be shut down; meanwhile, it can be used for good or not.  To what
lengths 
will humans go to try to make the bad things stop happening?  Perhaps
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000">HAL 9000</a> is
watching—with popcorn.
