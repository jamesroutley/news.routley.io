    <h1>Carp</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>As some of you might know, I recently became enamoured with a new programming language, <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/carp">Carp</a>. While you might have caught me fawning over it already, in this post I want to give you a little introduction into the language and its concepts, and maybe you’ll understand why I decided to work on it. A little word of caution before we begin, though: the language is in a pre-alpha stage and is thus subject to change. The syntax and APIs I’m about to show you might change in the future, making my post obsolete. It won’t be the last time you’ll hear me talk about Carp anyway, so I suggest you be on the lookout for follow-ups.</p>
<p><em>Warning</em>: This post is <em>very</em> long. You’ll have a good initial grasp on the language once you’ve read it, but feel free to skip the parts that you don’t care about. If you only care about how it works with memory, for instance, feel free to skip the language guide. If you plan on learning Carp, however, this is probably the most exhaustive resource in existence at the time of writing.</p>
<h2 id="a-palatable-fish-from-a-reputable-source">A palatable fish from a reputable source</h2>
<p>Let me get those dry, hard facts out of the way first. Carp is a compiled Lisp that utilizes type inference and a mechanism akin to Rust’s<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> borrow checker to produce a language that is both functional and fast. Due to its lack of a garbage collector it can be used for hard realtime systems while still not requiring the programmer to do manual memory allocations. Instead, the user has to think about ownership and references versus values. Those are familiar concepts to systems programmers, even more so if they happen to have prior experience with Rust. It provides machinery we know and love from other modern programming languages, such as a module system and metaprogramming capabilities—in its infamous Lisp ways—, and, most delicious of all, it has near-seamless C interoperability.</p>
<pre><code>(defn main []
  (IO.println &#34;Hello, Carp!&#34;))</code></pre>
<p>Fig. 1: The inaugural program, as seen in any piece of literature ever produced in programming.</p>
<p>Carp compiles to C. This is an unusual design choice and seems almost anachronistic in a world where building a compiler more often than not means working with LLVM. It also likely doesn’t matter much, because chances are your machine has a C compiler<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. What’s interesting about this, though, is that the C code produced is actually decent to read.</p>
<pre><code>int main() {
    string _4 = &#34;Hello, Carp!&#34;;
    string *_4_ref = &amp;_4;
    IO_println(_4_ref);
}</code></pre>
<p>Fig. 2: The compiler’s output for the program above. <code>IO_println</code> is a predefined function.</p>
<p>In the snippet above you can already see the borrow checker in use, if you’re looking at the treatment of the string; it is stack allocated, then dereferenced and passed to the function <code>IO_println</code>. Ownership is the simple idea on which the memory model of Carp is based: which function owns which references, and who’s in charge of cleaning them up. The Rust programmers among you will know what I mean.</p>
<p>That’s not really what it’s about, though, at least not in our day-to-day business. So let’s talk a bit about the language itself.</p>
<h2 id="plating-the-meal">Plating the meal</h2>
<p>In this part I want to give you a little overview of what Carp looks like and how one works with it. Alas, there is a lot of ground to cover and I probably won’t be able to give you anything more than a glimpse of Carp’s potential. As I mentioned before, though, I plan on writing more about it in the future. Until Carp is a bit more stable, and I have the time to write a good, exhaustive tutorial, this will have to do.</p>
<h3 id="the-repl">The REPL</h3>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do after installing will be to play around. When you run <code>carp</code> with no arguments, you’ll be greeted by a slick REPL<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. “Play with me”, it seems to say. If you do decide to play with it, however, you’re in for a surprise.</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to Carp 0.2.0
This is free software with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
Evaluate (help) for more information.
鲮 (def x 1)
鲮 (+ x 10)
int _3 = Int__PLUS_(x, 1);</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 3: Wait, what?!
</p>
<p>An enigmatic little beauty, it won’t tell you the results of your typings right away. Instead it will barf generated code back at you, like a leaky compiler sewer. This REPL isn’t meant to be played with like that, you see. You’ll have to adhere to the program/build/run cycle so typical of compiled languages, but with a twist. You can regain some of the rapid development experience the developer has when programming in an interpreted language by making the program/build/run cycle itself interactive. That’s exactly what we’re seeing here: We’re in the compiler.</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to Carp 0.2.0
This is free software with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
Evaluate (help) for more information.
鲮 (def x 1)
鲮 (defn main [] (IO.println &amp;(Int.str (+ x 10))))
鲮 (build)
Compiled to &#39;./out/a.out&#39;
鲮 (run)
11</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 4: Compiling, interactive.
</p>
<p>The above snippet showcases the whole cycle. First, we define a variable called <code>x</code>. Then we define the <code>main</code> function, which will serve as an entry point to our program. In it, we print the result of the computation <code>x + 10</code>. As you can see, there is a certain amount of ritual involved; bear with me, I will explain what those glyphs mean later. For now, you’re a stranger in a foreign land, and I’m your handwavy guide.</p>
<p>Then we <code>build</code> our program, to which our compiler helpfully remarks that the program was, in fact, compiled.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Lastly, we <code>run</code> it. Lo and behold, 1 and 10 do equal 11! Tamensi movetur!</p>
<p>This marks the end of my introduction into Carp’s REPL. I suggest you play around with it some more on your own (if you want). It is really quite different, but also quite fun.</p>
<h3 id="the-language">The language</h3>
<p>Carp is a Lisp, and, as such, it doesn’t have a lot of syntax. So, let’s forget about the parens, and dive right into keywords. Just know that semicolons start line comments. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/blob/master/docs/LanguageGuide.md">brief language guide</a> in the Carp repository. We will cover roughly the same bits here, so feel free to skip this part and read the official document instead.</p>
<h3 id="defining-things">Defining things</h3>
<pre><code>; defines a variable called x and binds it to 1
(def x 1)

; defines a function y that takes one argument a
(defn y [a]
  (+ a 1)) ; and which adds 1 to a</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 5: Defining things.
</p>
<p>Defining variables and functions looks similar to Clojure, meaning that you use <code>def</code> to define variables and <code>defn</code> to define functions. Global variables can only have stack-allocated types right now, but this is listed as a bug and will probably change fairly soon.</p>
<h4 id="types-literals">Types &amp; Literals</h4>
<p>There are a few different kinds of literals.</p>
<pre><code>100     ;; Int
100l    ;; Long
3.14f   ;; Float
10.0    ;; Double
true    ;; Bool
&#34;hello&#34; ;; String
\e      ;; Char
[1 2 3] ;; (Array Int)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 6: All data literals.
</p>
<p>As you can see, there aren’t that many native data types. That’s alright, though, because we can define our own data types. They are similar to structs, and have a few autogenerated functions associated with them, meaning they can only have data. That’s how I personally like my data types to be.</p>
<pre><code>(deftype Point2D [x Int, y Int])

(def p (Point2D.init 1 0)) ; initialize a point

; we can now access and update the points members
(Point2D.x p) ; =&gt; 1
(Point2D.set-x p 2) ; =&gt; (Point2D 2 0)
(Point2D.update-x p dec) ; =&gt; (Point2D 0 0)
(Point2D.str p) ; =&gt; &#34;(Point2D 1 0)&#34;</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 7: Defining and working with a data type.
</p>
<p>Updating things can get quite tedious using that syntax. Luckily, we have threading macros that allow you to apply a whole lot of updates at once without hassle.</p>
<pre><code>; using our point from Figure 7
(=&gt; p
    (Point2D.update-x dec)
    (Point2D.update-y dec)) ; =&gt; (Point2D 0 -1)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 8: The threading macro in action.
</p>
<p>This mechanism is in best Lisp tradition: simple and powerful, versatile and elegant. Though, let me be frank with you here: when you are working with Carp for some time, you’ll likely discover bugs. A source of some of the more interesting bugs historically has been the combination of the module system with defining data types. For instance, I’m currently working on fixing some name mangling problems with types in modules. As I said, Carp is still in flux, and sometimes we have to get our hands dirty.</p>
<h4 id="special-forms">Special forms</h4>
<p>With this off my chest, I’m ready to guide you deeper into the heart of the wild. We have so much more ground to cover; for now let’s talk some more about special forms!</p>
<pre><code>(let [x 1] ; let is used local bindings
  (+ x 1))

(do ; group multiple functions together
  (IO.println &#34;hi&#34;)
  1)

(if (= 1 2) ; if is used for branching
  (IO.println &#34;Math is broken&#34;)
  (IO.println &#34;Math is fine&#34;))

(while (&lt; 1 x) ; while is used for looping
  (+ x 1))

(for [i 0 10] ; ... and so is for
  (IO.println &#34;print me tenfold!&#34;))

(def x 1)
; set! is used for resetting, ignore the &amp; for now
(set! &amp;x 2)

(address x) ; get a C-style pointer from a value</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 9: A few special forms.
</p>
<p>That’s a lot! But all of these forms are quite essential for programming, and so I have to get them out of the way. If you look at the official documentation, you’ll see that I have omitted <code>ref</code> and added <code>for</code>. The reasons for this are simple: <code>for</code> is a macro, but super useful, and I’ll talk about <code>ref</code> later, when we talk about the memory model some more. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWqLiy9TLdg">Hold your horses!</a></p>
<p>We’re about halfway through, and I think it’s time for a breather. We have yet to talk about modules and macros, and those advanced topics will probably require your utmost attention. If you have time and the view from your room is nice, I suggest you make yourself a nice, calming beverage, hot or cold, and look out the window for some time, asking yourself why you haven’t discovered this magnificent language sooner. That’s what I did when I discovered it, anyway.</p>
<h4 id="modules">Modules</h4>
<p>Welcome back, traveler! I hope you’ve left weary and woe behind, ready to take on a new challenge. I am certainly excited to tell you about modules!</p>
<pre><code>(defmodule Math
  (defn add [x y]
    (+ x y))

  (defn sub [x y]
    (- x y))

  ; TODO: write more stuff
)</code></pre>
<p>Fig. 10: A module with everything your math heart desires.</p>
<p>Okay, defining a module is simple enough. You basically just wrap whatever you want to encapsulate into a <code>defmodule</code> form and give it a name. But how do we actually use it? Well, there are two ways to get to the juicy meat inside the module’s shell. We can either just load the source file and then use everything in a qualified manner, prefixing the function name with the module name and a period, or we can load the file and then <code>use</code> the module. Using the module means making everything inside directly accessible, but it can also introduce name collisions. If you’ve ever programmed Python, think of it as the difference between <code>import foo</code> and <code>from foo import *</code>.</p>
<pre><code>; with the module we defined in figure 10
(Math.add 1 2) ; works out the box

(use Math)
(add 1 2) ; works after use form</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 11: Using a module.
</p>
<p>Now, this is all well and good, but there is another little twist to this. Modules also have some interesting properties for the type checker. Note, for instance, that <code>+</code> is not generic. It is defined for every numerical type, and the typechecker then chooses the appropriate function according to its signature. I think that merits a bit of illustration.</p>
<pre><code>(use Double)
(use Int)

(+ 1 1) ; uses Int.+
(+ 1.0 1.0) ; uses Double.+
(+ 1l 1l) ; errors, because no + for longs is known</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 12: Addition, complected.
</p>
<p>Until now I’ve spared you the necessary <code>use</code> statements to avoid confusion. But, now that you’re learning to walk on your own, you can look at all the previous figures and see that they’re full of lies. Whenever I used <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> or <code>inc</code> or <code>dec</code> I would have needed to either qualify it or <code>use</code> the appropriate modules. Sorry about that, but it was for your own good.</p>
<p>You can also define your own datatypes within modules, but note that the dot-syntax then needs to be nested as well. If, for instance, <code>Point2D</code> were defined within <code>Math</code>, we would have to write <code>Math.Point2D.set-x</code> and so on.</p>
<p>That’s all the magic there is to modules, which means that we can move on to macros! Are you excited? I’m excited!</p>
<h4 id="macros">Macros</h4>
<p>If you’ve ever programmed in Lisp, you probably know about macros. I also wrote <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Scheme_Macros_I:_Modules.html">a</a> <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Scheme_Macros_II:_Generics.html">series</a> <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Scheme_Macros_III:_Defining_let.html">of</a> blog posts about writing Lisp macros, but let me try to sum the most important ideas up for those of you who don’t have the time to do all of the research: since Lisp code is essentially only lists, we can easily rewrite it programmatically. Lisp macro systems exploit this fact; the compiler introduces a separate step into its compilation toolchain that evaluates macros and expands their use. It’s essentially a small interpreter that is geared towards rewriting Lisp forms into other forms. This enables us to introduce interesting new syntax without changing the language proper, and in fact that is how <code>for</code> and the threading macro <code>=&gt;</code> are defined in Carp.</p>
<p>This tremendous power is easily abused and indeed macros have for a long time had the reputation of being too powerful and leading to programmers writing their own languages on top of their implemenation Lisp that only they themselves understand. <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/33611/7/paper.pdf">I renounce any catalogue of despair</a>. It is perfectly feasible to write maintainable and understandable macros, and tying the programmers hands to avoid bad code isn’t exactly what I want my language to do. But this is a topic for another day. For now I will show you how to write macros in Carp, and you can make up your own mind as to whether you want your code to make use of them. Yet another caveat before we begin, though: I’m planning on rewriting the macro system to a full-featured, hygienic piece of craftmanship. These things take time, however, and for now I’m going to show you the current state of the art.</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro incr [x]
  (list &#39;+ x 1))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 13: A simple incrementor macro.
</p>
<p>As you can see in Figure 13, defining macros looks somewhat similar to defining functions. The main difference is the body, which constructs a list instead of applying the <code>+</code> function. Please note that the <code>list</code> keyword can only be used within macros, and it is used to make a list from everything following it. The <code>+</code> function is also quoted, which is a fancy Lisp term for saying that instead of looking up the value of symbol right now, the runtime will just pass it as is, not caring whether it’s actually defined or not.</p>
<p>So what is the value of doing that here? Doing this enables us to write <code>(incr x)</code> instead of <code>(+ x 1)</code> wherever we want. The same would be possible with a function, though, right? Well, kind of. But at runtime, there will be no function. Instead, the macro system will have transformed <code>(incr x)</code> into <code>(+ x 1)</code> <em>directly</em>, within its context. Beautiful, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Maybe that just knocked you out of your knickers, but I know that back in the day before I knew Lisp macros, it would certainly not have impressed me very much. So, let’s look at a more involved example, and take advantage of all of the exciting features the Carp macro runtime has to offer: infix math!</p>
<pre><code>(defdynamic rewrite-infix [form]
  (if (= (count form) 0)
    (list)
    (if (= (count form) 1)
      (car form)
      (list (car (cdr form))
            (car form)
            (rewrite-infix (cdr (cdr form)))))))

(defmacro infix [:rest form]
  (rewrite-infix form))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 14: Infix math.
</p>
<p>Figure 14 contains code that rewrites infix math expressions—that is, math that follows the conventional form of <code>1 + 2 * 2</code>—to Lisp-compatible prefix math. Most Lisps provide some kind of mechanism to do that, and even one of the more famous books on programming in Scheme<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> includes an implementation of that.</p>
<p>The above code contains a slew of new concepts; let me walk you through them. First, you will notice the definition <code>defdynamic</code>, which we haven’t encountered before. Dynamic functions are functions that you can use from within a macro, but not during runtime. They’re the basic building blocks for abstraction during macro evaluation, so to speak. From the outside, they’re very similar to regular functions, but they have a whole host of functions that only work within them. Some of these functions are used in the snippet in Figure 14, like <code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code>, <code>cons</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>quote</code>—though we use the reader macro <code>&#39;</code> instead—, and, somewhat surprisingly, <code>array</code>.</p>
<p>At this point I expect all of the old Lisp hackers who have found this blog are screaming in terror, no <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, or <code>cdr</code>? The audacity! The blasphemy! I too had to squint at this in disbelief. But it makes sense: lists are replaced by random access arrays in Carp. Lists only exist during macro evaluation, where they are linked lists of code. Arrays, however, are random access data structures, like C arrays—Carp does compile to C, after all. This removes a bit of the beautiful abstraction of Lisp—one data structure to rule them all—and it makes runtime metaprogramming nigh impossible, but it does make sense for a language compiled to C. And, as seen in Figure 14, it’s not really that much harder to write a macro like that.</p>
<p>For all of the people above who don’t know what <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>, or <code>cdr</code> are and didn’t appreciate my tangent directed at only the enlightened few Lispers scoffing at me in their ivory tower<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>, these functions are the pinnacle ofworking with lists in Lisp. <code>car</code> takes a list and returns its first element,<code>cdr</code> takes the rest—i.e. everything but the first element—, and <code>cons</code> takes an element and a list and prepends the element onto the list. These functions are incredibly handy for working with linked lists, but again, Carp works with array, and it really doesn’t make sense here.</p>
<p>In general, the functions listed above are overly generic and not incredibly useful in the context of Carp. Including them certainly poses a trade-off, and in my opinion the maintainers took the right step in allowing these constructs only where they made sense. Feel free to disagree.</p>
<p>There is at least one more syntactic item we haven’t looked at yet, and that is <code>:rest</code>. This little beauty is, like its friends, not available in Carp proper. It signifies that this macro is variadic, that is, it can have a varying number of arguments. The symbol that comes after <code>:rest</code> will bind all of the “overflowing” parameters in a list. Let’s look at a few examples:</p>
<pre><code>; none of this will compile
(defmacro macro1 [:rest x]
  x)

(macro1 1 2 3) ; x=(1 2 3)

(defmacro macro2 [a b :rest c]
  a b c)

(macro2 1 2 3 4 5) ; a=1, b=2, c=(3 4 5)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 15: Illustrative macros.
</p>
<p>As you can see, you can also have variadic macros that take a certain number of parameters, but then a variable number of extra ones. For the Lispers: it’s equivalent to <code>(a b . c)</code>. For the Pythonistas: it’s equivalent to <code>(a, b, *c)</code>.</p>
<p>This concludes our short—by which I mean approximately 3000 words—whirlwind tour of the language. This is enough to get you started, but Carp has more up its apparently very large sleeve: I’ve omitted type annotations and C interop, both of which I will cover in later posts.</p>
<p>Next up we’ll talk about references and values!</p>
<h3 id="the-memory-model-references-values">The memory model: references &amp; values</h3>
<p>Somewhere down the road in your programming career, you’ll have to think about memory, no matter the programming language you chose. Some of us choose languages that are very explicit about who owns what (like Rust), or even let you choose who has to allocate and free it (like C). Others include a garbage collector (Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, and the like) to avoid the cognitive complexity manual memory management introduces. But memory will rear its ugly head sooner or later, be it through contention, corruption, races, or any other of the countless horsemen of the software apocalypse it employs.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m being melodramatic here, but sleepless nights and loss of hair are not unheard of when dealing with these types of problems, so I couldn’t be dramatic enough, not even with a skull in my hand and leggings on, declaiming: “To collect or not to collect…”. I’m not sure whether you like the picture of me in leggings, but I’d rather avoid it, so I’ll try to have you believe in the Carp way.</p>
<p>Who owns memory in Carp? Simple: whoever created it, unless it is returned to the encompassing scope. That means that at the end of each function or <code>let</code> form, things defined inside it get destroyed. Within this block, it is free to do with this datum as it pleases, even lending it to another function is alright. Remember the function <code>ref</code> I talked about earlier? Yeah, that’s what that is. And because this is done fairly often, Carp decided to sprinkle a bit of syntactic sugar on top of that construct, in the form of the abbreviation—or reader macro, if you like—<code>&amp;</code>. The two constructs <code>(ref &#34;string&#34;)</code> and <code>&amp;&#34;string&#34;</code> are functionally equivalent.</p>
<pre><code>; println takes a reference to a string,
; but str returns a normal string, so we have
; to add &amp;
(IO.println &amp;(Int.str 1))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 16: A simple use case of references.
</p>
<p>This also explains the ampersand we used in Figure 4. I hope it’s all starting to make sense.</p>
<p>The inverse of referencing is copying. This can either be used through <code>copy</code> or the abbreviation <code>@</code>. Be aware that in the current iteration of Carp, <code>copy</code> without a namespace—or <code>@</code>—will be interpreted as <code>String.copy</code>, and the type system will complain if you pass anything else. The current workaround is either <code>use</code>ing the type you’re copying, or referencing the fully qualified function. This might be fixed in the future, or so I hope.</p>
<pre><code>@1 ; uh oh

(Int.copy 1) ; this is fine

(use Int)
@1 ; this is fine now</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 17: Copying stuff and its oddities.
</p>
<p>That’s all there is to memory in Carp. The <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/blob/master/docs/Memory.md">official documentation</a> has a little bit of additional information and illustration, if you need it.</p>
<h3 id="the-libraries">The libraries</h3>
<p>Libraries are an integral part of any language. No programming language will get adoption without a proper ecosystem, no matter how well it is designed. And this is where things get sad in Carp. There is no dependency managment, no package manager. I plan on porting my package manager for zepto, <a href="https://github.com/zeps-system/zeps">zeps</a>, to Carp sooner or later, but that might take a while. Also, there’s not much of a standard library yet, though the team and I are working on that too, having introduced a few hundred lines of new code to the system in the last few weeks. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, sed ars longa, vita brevis.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I want to introduce you to at least a few libraries that exist right now and show you how to use them. There is an emberassing scarcity of documentation, but we plan on changing that as well.</p>
<p>Here is an exhaustive list of modules with a little bit of preliminary information, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Array: includes a few functions for working with arrays. All of them are generic.</li>
<li>Bench: a simple benchmarking library, for testing the performance of small snippets of code. Modeled after Rust’s benchmarking tooling.</li>
<li>Bool: includes a few functions for working with boolean values.</li>
<li>Char: includes a few functions for working with and converting boolean values.</li>
<li>Double: see above, but for Doubles. Also includes all mathematical functions from <code>math.h</code>.</li>
<li>Float: see above, but for Floats.</li>
<li>Geometry: includes very few functions for geometrical computations.</li>
<li>IO: includes a few functions for input and output, like printing, reading lines, and exiting.</li>
<li>Int: see above numerical modules, but for Ints.</li>
<li>Long: see above numerical modules, but for Longs.</li>
<li>Macros: non-namespaced macro utilities, like <code>for</code>, <code>cond</code> and the threading macros.</li>
<li>sdl: includes bindings to the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library.</li>
<li>Statistics: includes statistical functions, like <code>mean</code>, <code>median</code>, and <code>winsorize</code>.</li>
<li>String: includes all kinds of utilities for working with and converting strings.</li>
<li>System: includes a few functions for working with the OS, such as timing, seeding the random number generator, etc.</li>
<li>Test: includes a testing library.</li>
<li>Vector: includes an implementation of 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional vectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your best bet for getting detailed information for these modules is currently by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/tree/master/core">source</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/tree/master/examples">examples directory</a>, or, for a few modules, the <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/tree/master/test">test cases</a>. We hope this will change soon.</p>
<p>A few of my babies are the testing and benchmarking libraries, and I intend to write about them specifically in future posts.</p>
<h3 id="fin">Fin</h3>
<p>As promised, this post was fairly long. You were warned. I hope it gave you a taste of what Carp is like. I’ll write a few more practical posts in the future, but I needed to help you understand the syntax to be comfortable with showing you the fun things we can do with Carp. I hope you agree.</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> I’m going to compare Carp to a whole lot of programming languages; you don’t need to know all—or any—of them to understand what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> It’s arguably more likely that your machine has a C compiler than the LLVM library.</p>
<p><span id="3">3.</span> Readline support thanks to yours truly.</p>
<p><span id="4">4.</span> There are shortcuts for building and running. These are prefixed with a colon, and are <code>b</code> and <code>x</code>, respectively, and can be combined in any order. <code>:bx</code> is your friend for a quick development cycle.</p>
<p><span id="5">5.</span> I am talking about “Simply Scheme: Introducing Computer Science” by Harvey and Wright, Chapter 18.</p>
<p><span id="6">6.</span> Where is that ivory tower, anyway? I’ve written thousands of lines of Lisp and built some Lisps on my own, so I’d appreciate an invite, guys n’ gals, lest I doubt its existence.</p>
