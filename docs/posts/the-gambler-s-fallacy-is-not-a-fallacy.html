I&#39;ll spend most of this post defending this claim for koins, and then talk about how it generalizes to real-life random processes––like <em>c</em>oins––at the end.</p></div>

<p><strong>Steady:</strong> <span>On each toss, the koin has a 50% chance of landing heads.</span>

<div><p>
Given your knowledge about koins, you should leave open that Steady is true.</p></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div><p>
​The Switchy hypothesis says that the koin has a tendency to switch how it lands. For example, perhaps after landing heads (tails), it&#39;s 40% likely to land heads (tails) on the next toss, and 60% likely to switch to tails (heads).  Similarly, the Sticky hypothesis says the koin has a tendency to stick to how it lands. For example, perhaps after landing heads (tails) it&#39;s 60% likely to stick with heads (tails) on the next toss, and 40% likely to land tails (heads).</p></div>

Fig. 1: A Switchy hypothesis
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
This diagram indicates that whenever the koin is in state H (has just landed heads), it&#39;s 40% likely to land heads on the next flip and 60% likely to land tails on the next flip. Vice versa for when it&#39;s in state T (has just landed tails).  We can similarly represent our Sticky and Steady hypotheses this way:

Fig. 3: The Steady hypothesis
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div><p>
Given their symmetry, all of these hypotheses will make it so that the koin usually lands heads around half the time. (For aficionados: their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_distribution" target="_blank">stationary distributions</a> are all 50-50.) Since that&#39;s all the evidence you have about koins, you should be uncertain which is true.</p></div>

<div>
<p> \[P(H) ~=~ P(Switchy)\cdot 0.6 ~+~ P(Steady)\cdot 0.5 ~+~ P(Sticky)\cdot 0.4\]
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><span>Notice: whenever P(Switchy) &gt; P(Sticky), this will average out to something greater than 50%. That is, whenever you should be more confident that the koin is Switchy than that it&#39;s Sticky, you should think a heads is more than 50% likely to follow from a tails, and (by parallel reasoning) that a tails is more than 50% likely to follow a heads.</span></p></div>

<p>
<SPAN color="#818181">(1500 words left.)</SPAN>
</p>

<div><p>
And you <em>should</em> be more confident in Switchy than Sticky––this is step two of the reasoning.</p></div>

Note that although all three hypotheses generate bell-shaped curves centered around 50% heads, the Switchy hypothesis generates a <em>tighter</em> bell curve around 50% heads.</p></div>

<p> \begin{align*} Switchy &amp;= [Ch(H)&gt;0.5] \\ Steady &amp;= [Ch(H)=0.5] \\ Sticky &amp;= [Ch(H)&lt;0.5] \end{align*}

<div><p>
It follows from total probability that your confidence should be the following weighted average:</p></div>

<div>
<p> \begin{align*} P(\small H\normalsize ) ~=~ P(\small Ch(H)&gt;0.5\normalsize )P(\small H\normalsize |\small Ch(H) &gt; 0.5\normalsize) ~+~ P(\small Ch(H)=0.5\normalsize )P(\small H | Ch(H) = 0.5\normalsize) \\ ~+~ P(\small Ch(H)&lt;0.5\normalsize )P(\small H | Ch(H) &lt; 0.5\normalsize ) \end{align*}
</p>
</div>

<p>
It follows from the Principal Principle that P(H | Ch(H) &gt; 0.5) &gt; 0.5 and that P(H | Ch(H) &lt; 0.5) &lt; 0.5.  In our situation you have no reason to treat these two options asymmetrically, so there should be some constant c such that P(H | Ch(H) &gt; 0.5) = 0.5 + c, while P(H | Ch(H)&lt;0.5) = 0.5 - c.  It follows that:
</p>

<div>
<p> \[ P(\small H\normalsize ) = P(\small Ch(H)&gt;0.5\normalsize )(\small 0.5+c\normalsize ) + P(\small Ch(H)=0.5\normalsize )(\small 0.5\normalsize ) + P(\small Ch(H)&lt;0.5\normalsize )(\small 0.5-c\normalsize ) \]

As you’d expect, the qualitative results from these hypotheses are the same as before, but (very) slightly dampened.  For example, here are the likelihoods of various outcomes of 100 tosses from our original 1-memory 60% hypotheses (reproduced from Figure 4), vs. the likelihoods of outcomes with the 2-memory, 3-memory, and 5-memory 60% hypotheses:</p></div>

</div>

<div><p>
And it&#39;s worth noting that the <em>qualitative</em> results will be the same in all these cases, though the degree of gambler&#39;s fallacy warranted will decrease as the differences in the likelihoods get smaller.</p></div>

<div><p>
After learning the proportion of heads out of 100 tosses, should be more confident of Switchy than Sticky iff the blue curve is higher than the green one for the outcome (proportion of heads) you observe, and less confident if vice versa. In fact, there is <em>no</em> outcome of a 100-toss sequence that would make these exactly equal, so given any outcome, you should either commit the gambler’s or the hot-hands fallacy on the next toss.</p></div>

40%-heads Steady hypothesis.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
You might think natural Sticky and Switchy hypotheses centered around this would simply add or subtract a fixed amount (say, 0.1) to the probabilities depending on the state, as before:
</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.kevindorst.com/uploads/8/8/1/7/88177244/published/non-50-switchy-1.png?1588958367" alt="Picture"/></a></p><p>

Conjectured 40%-heads Sticky hypothesis (WRONG).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div><p>
But that’s wrong.  The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_distribution">stationary distribution</a>” of these two Markov chains is <em>not</em> 40/60—rather, for the Sticky hypothesis it’s around 38/62 and for the Switchy one it’s around 42/58, meaning that in the long run we would expect them to have <em>these</em> proportions of heads to tails, rather than 40-60.  Accordingly, the likelihood graphs are not properly overlapping:</p></div>

Likelihoods for conjectured (WRONG) 40%-heads hypotheses, 100 tosses.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The proper Sticky/Switchy hypotheses if the overall proportion of heads is 40% are ones whose probabilities move depending on where they are, but in a way that leads them to have the same stationary as the Steady hypothesis. I haven’t yet figured out a general recipe for this (<strong>any mathematicians care to help?</strong>), but here is an example of 1-memory Sticky and Shifty hypotheses that have the correct stationaries:
</p>

<div>

40%-heads Sticky hypothesis.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div><p>
And here are the likelihood graphs for 100 tosses of these two hypotheses vs. the 40%-heads Steady hypothesis:</p></div>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.kevindorst.com/uploads/8/8/1/7/88177244/non-50-100toss-2_orig.jpg" alt="Picture"/></a></p><p>
40%-heads likelihoods, 100 tosses.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div><p>
Upshot: the same qualitative lessons hold for processes that don&#39;t come up &#34;heads&#34; 50% of the time; <span>if</span><span> all you know is that &#34;roughly x% of the tosses land heads&#34;, you should be more confident in (the right version of) Switchy than Sticky, and so should commit the gambler&#39;s fallacy.</span></p></div>

							You&#39;ve convinced me that, if I see a coin land HT, I should believe it has a greater than 50% chance of landing H on the next toss, but (1) I&#39;m not sure this is the &#39;gambler&#39;s fallacy,&#39; as people ordinarily use the term, and (2) I don&#39;t think people intuitively believe that the chance of H is greater than 50% in this case.</p>

							Thinking a bit more on this: this is super helpful. You&#39;re right: even with the background knowledge in place (say, &#34;500 of 1000 tosses landed heads&#34;), the probabilities of Sticky/Switchy are still close enough that runs like this will potentially change the comparison.  Turns out that assuming ⅓ in the three 40/50/60% hypotheses I used in the main text, you should commit the gambler&#39;s fallacy with &#34;THTTT&#34;, but with &#34;THTTTT&#34; you should be even between Sticky and Switchy, and with &#34;THTTTTT&#34; you should actually be more confident in Sticky.  So you&#39;re right about that––good catch, thanks!</p>

							Thanks! Quick update: I added some material (in purple) right before the &#34;The Fallacy in Real Life&#34; section, and then also in the (new) first &#34;Full Calculation&#34; section of the Appendix on this issue.  Thanks again or the helpful comments!

							Those first four figures under the Robustness section. Do they show the distributions converging? If yes, that means that knowing that heads came up 50% of time in 100 hypothetical prior tosses will give you more skewed priors than knowing that heads came up in 1000000 hypothetical tosses. In other words, what does it exactly mean to say “you know the coin comes up heads 50% of time on average”?</p>

							Thanks for your comment!  Wrt convergence, I mean several different thing there (should&#39;ve been clearer).  First, they&#39;re all converging to putting most of their mass on &#34;roughly 50%&#34;––that&#39;s because they all have a 50%-heads stationary distribution.  But more importantly for that section, the *ratios of likelihoods* at 50% (and thereabouts) are converging as well: Switchy gives about 1.224 times as much probability to &#34;exactly 50%&#34; as Steady does; Sticky gives about 0.816 times as much probability to &#34;exactly 50%&#34; as Steady does.  Since the ratios of likelihoods converge, that means the posteriors will converge as the tosses get larger and larger; if they started out equally likely, learning &#34;50% heads out of N tosses&#34;, as N–&gt; ∞, will lead to a posterior in Switchy/Steady/Sticky of around 40.3% / 32.9% / 26.8%.</p>

							FWIW, I think it&#39;s extremely important to be unwilling to take at face value either the logic or the empirics of the mountain of studies that purport to show irrationality (or anything else). The social scientists who produce them are mere mortals and, as one can see by critically inspecting the work of Kahneman and Tversky, are not very good philosophers. You are showing that they can be not very good statisticians, too.</p>

							Thanks Jeff!  I agree with a lot of what you say (though I think K&amp;T were better philosophers than you give them credit for!  I honestly think lots of stuff by them is quite interesting and well-done, even if I disagree with the direction they/ their followers ended up going with it).</p>

							A few points.  First, the kind of tricks you applied above can only work so long.  Suppose that in fact coins don&#39;t show the gambler&#39;s fallacy type behavior but that one theory (measures on coin flips) predicts they do.  Then conditioning on what is actually observed will keep favoring the standard theory over this alternate gambler&#39;s fallacy endorsing view.  If you assume you start with some prior probability distribution over some countable collection of such theories I&#39;m pretty confident you can get a nice result that you concentrate all your probability in the limit on theories which don&#39;t endorse the gamblers fallacy (or at least don&#39;t do so except on some super sparse set).</p>

							In fact why can&#39;t I refute your claim thusly.  If you really think that, all things considered, it&#39;s not irrational to believe in the gamblers fallacy with respect to coin flips then you should be perfectly willing to wager against me at say 2:1 odds (or really any favorable ones) in my favor on the next coinflip not continuing the run whenever there has been a sufficiently long run of heads or tails previously. </p>

							Conditional probability is about as unintuitive as a subject can be, and it&#39;s easy to mistake different conditional probability statements for the same thing. For example, if we *know with certainty*, that the coin is fair, we should commit the gambler&#39;s fallacy, because, given the previous streak, we also know that reversion to the mean is inevitable on a long enough timeline. Eventually, the ratio of heads to tails will even out, which implies that (over some scale unknowable to us) the excess number of tails will be balanced out by a surplus of heads. The statement for this would be something like P(H|X,F=1), where H is heads, X is the trajectory up to that point, and F=1 is the knowledge that the coin is fair.</p>
