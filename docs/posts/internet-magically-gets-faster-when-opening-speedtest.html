    <h1>Internet magically gets faster when opening speedtest?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I want to start by saying this is anecdotal, and I feel paranoid for even thinking it. But often my internet will feel very slow, so I&#39;ll open speedtest to check if something&#39;s wrong. When I do, all of my stalled tabs suddenly spring into action and finish loading.<p>The tinfoil hat wearer inside of me speculates that my internet provider is overloaded and throttling my bandwidth, but immediately prioritizes me when it senses that I&#39;m trying to check if I&#39;m getting what I pay for.</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this pattern? Is there a way I can test this more scientifically?</p></td></div></div>
