There are at present 11 public telephones available, two in Jamestown and the remainder in the rural areas, from which some 1,400 calls are handled annually.</blockquote><p>The system remained manual until 1983. Due to the shortage of exchange lines, many people used a shared line (‘Party Line’) and there was an ingenious system for the parties to know for whom was an incoming call: one ring for party 1; two rings for party 2; etc., sometimes with as many as five parties sharing a line.

The Pacific Cable, jointly owned by the British Government and the Governments of Canada, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, New Zealand, Tasmania and Western Australia in a unique partnership arrangement was, <tt>effected in obedience to the strong desire of the people of the wide-spread British Empire to utilize electricity for the accomplishment of Imperial consolidation</tt>, and to ensure that ‘The All Red Line’ touched only the territories of the British Empire.</p><p>Some parts of the line had been completed considerably earlier. In 1866, the Great Eastern connected Ireland to Newfoundland, by 1870 Suez was linked to Bombay and from there to Madras, Penang and Singapore. Australia was linked to British telegraph cables directly in 1870, by extending a line from Singapore to Port Darwin and by 1872, messages could be sent direct from London to Sydney.</p><p>To complete the network, the final major cable laying project was the trans-Pacific section. The route selected was Bamfield, Vancouver Island - Fanning Island - Fiji - Norfolk Island. From Norfolk Island, two cables would be laid, one to Southport, Queensland, with a landline to Sydney, while the other would land at Doubtless Bay, Auckland and in total <ins title="7,837 nm, 9,000 miles">14,500Km</ins> of cable would be required.</p><p>It was decided to lay the Bamfield-Fanning Island section in one continuous length. At the time no cable ship existed that could carry the cable to do this, so the Telegraph Construction &amp; Maintenance Company had CS Colonia built. Laying of the <ins title="3,459 nm, 4,000 mile">6,400Km</ins> long cable began at Bamfield on 18<samp>th</samp> September 1902, reaching Fanning Island on 6<samp>th</samp> October. Fanning Island had been formally annexed to Great Britain in 1888.</p><p>The CS Anglia which had been used to connect Cape Town and St Helena then laid all the sections from Fanning Island to Australia and New Zealand during 1902.</p><p>The ‘All Red Line’ was inaugurated on 31<samp>st</samp> October 1902 and the Imperial Defence Committee was able to report to the British Government, <tt>The dependence of the United Kingdom on cable stations situated upon foreign territory has been generally eliminated.</tt></p><p>Britain dominated the international cable networks and no other country possessed such an extensive network. In 1896 there were 30 cable-laying ships in the world, 24 of them owned by British companies. The <a href="#easterntelegraph" type="text/html" title="The Eastern Telegraph Company: Communications: Getting the message">Eastern Telegraph Company</a> controlled almost 50 per cent of the world’s submarine cables while other British companies owned another 30 per cent of the cable routes.
