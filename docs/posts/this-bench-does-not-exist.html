    <h1>This Bench Does Not Exist</h1>

<p>We forced an AI to look at <a href="https://openbenches.org">thousands of photos of memorial benches</a>. Just because. Here are the results.</p><p>This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><p>You can view more at <a href="https://thisbench.doesnotexi.st/">This Bench Does Not Exist</a>.</p><p>Here&#39;s a video which shows how the process generates images. It gives you an idea of what the model &#34;thinks&#34; a bench is.</p><h2 id="download-the-model"><a href="#download-the-model">Download the model</a></h2><p>You can <a href="https://g-75671f.f5dc97.75bc.dn.glob.us/benches/network-snapshot-011000.pkl">download a 300MB StyleGAN neural net .PKL</a> for your own use.</p><h2 id="why"><a href="#why">WHY?!?</a></h2><p>What does a bench look like? How can you recognise it? Does the human brain process images of inanimate objects differently than it does with faces and animals? Is there an &#34;uncanny valley&#34; for seats?</p><p>5 years ago, my wife and I launched <a href="https://openbenches.org/">OpenBenches</a> - a site to crowdsource photos, inscriptions, and locations of memorial benches. We have been <em>astonished</em> at how popular it has. People have uploaded over 55,000 photos of about 22,000 benches!  That&#39;s around <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/01/how-we-organise-and-store-thousands-of-ugc-photos/">191GB of photos</a>. Nice ☺</p><p>I wanted to take all the photos of the benches, and train a computer to produce artificial images of benches. In a similar vein to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/this-person-does-not-exist">This [Cat|Person|Paper] Does Not Exist</a>, it&#39;s just an interesting way to show off how good (or not) computers are at generating images based off a large dataset.</p><h2 id="how"><a href="#how">HOW?!?!</a></h2><p>It is <em>relatively</em> simple to create this. There is a pre-built set of scripts called <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3">StyleGAN3</a>. You can follow along with the tutorial provided. I was doing relatively well, until I hit the system requirements:</p><blockquote><p>
1–8 high-end NVIDIA GPUs with at least 12 GB of memory. We have done all testing and development using Tesla V100 and A100 GPUs.</p></blockquote><p>Ah. I don&#39;t even have <em>one</em> NVIDIA GPU - let alone 12! And the sponsorship for OpenBenches barely covers hosting. Let along buying expensive hardware.</p><p>I put the call out on Twitter and, very kindly, <a href="https://twitter.com/simonjbutcher/status/1500051051084455945">Simon Butcher</a> volunteered some hardware. Aren&#39;t people on the Internet nice!</p><p>The computation for the 512x512px training set was run for 20 days on an IBM AC922 POWER9 server running RHEL7, utilising all four Nvidia Tesla V100 SXM2 16GB GPUs.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/openbenches/openbenches.org#open-data-api">OpenBenches API</a> lets us grab the URls of all images, and metadata about whether they&#39;re a photo of the inscription or the bench.  There were about 25,000 photos to download and crunch through.</p><p>With that many images, it wasn&#39;t possible to manually go through to find images which shouldn&#39;t have been in the set. That might have led to some weirdness in the generation process.</p><h2 id="copyright"><a href="#copyright">COPYRIGHT?!?!</a></h2><p>OK, so here&#39;s an odd question. All of the photos on the site have been licenced under Creative Commons. Mostly <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">BY-SA 4.0</a> but a few imported from Flickr and other sites with different CC licences.</p><p>What&#39;s the copyright situation of the generated images?</p><p>I honestly don&#39;t know. If you do, stick a comment in the box below.</p><h2 id="weird"><a href="#weird">WEIRD?!?!</a></h2><p>There are a number of &#34;glitches&#34; which seem inherent in AI generated images. Some are just weird little graphical quirks.</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/glitch-bench.jpg" alt="A bench with a deformed arm." width="512" height="512"/></p><p>It&#39;s pretty easy to see where the AI has got a little confused. It is <em>totally</em> recognisable as a bench - but just the wrong side of the &#34;uncanny valley&#34; to look real.</p><p>Others, however, are full-on psychedelic hellscapes.</p><p>This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><h2 id="inscriptions"><a href="#inscriptions">Inscriptions</a></h2><p>Training a text model using GPT-2 was relatively easy. A few years ago <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/02/her-frown-lies-betwixt-two-fickle-eyes-teaching-an-ai-to-write-shakespearean-sonnets/">I taught an AI to write Shakespearean sonnets</a>. I used the same Google notebook to read in several thousand inscriptions and then generate new ones.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/en.png" alt="EN.

It&#39;s <em>downright creepy</em> generating the name of someone and their date of death. It would be horrible to stumble on the website and find the details of you or a friend listed on there.</p><p>As there have already been lots of attempts to automatically generate semantically valid text based on an existing corpus - we dropped it from the site.</p><h2 id="thanks"><a href="#thanks">THANKS!!!</a></h2><p>Huge thanks to:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/simonjbutcher">Simon Butcher</a> for training the model on his supercomputer.</li><li><a href="https://blog.devopstom.com/">Tom O&#39;Connor</a> for the <code>doesnotexi.st</code> subdomain.</li><li>All the hundreds of people who have generously uploaded their photos to OpenBenches.</li></ul><p>Here is another video for you to enjoy:</p><p>You can view more at <a href="https://thisbench.doesnotexi.st/">ThisBench.DoesNotExi.st</a>.</p></div></div>
