    <h1>Activision leak details Warzone 2 and Modern Warfare 2 2023 roadmap</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                                <!-- Article Start -->
<p>All six seasons of the live-action post-launch service for <a href="https://www.ggrecon.com/modern-warfare-2/" title="Modern Warfare 2"><em>Modern Warfare 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.ggrecon.com/warzone/" title="Warzone"><em>Warzone 2</em></a> have been leaked in a massive data breach at Activision. This details everything from the number of weapons they plan to release to a Halloween special event.</p>
<p>Following the launch of <a href="https://www.ggrecon.com/call-of-duty/" title="Call of Duty"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>&#39;s newest battle royale and multiplayer annual release, the company has apparently been subject to a huge data brief which has been swept under the carpet.</p>
<p>The breach supposedly occurred in December and has only just come to light. The hackers have allegedly phished information from one user&#39;s account, which details the entire 2023 roadmap for the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise.</p>
<h2>Leaks Detail The Entire Call of Duty 2023 Roadmap</h2>

<p dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/Activision?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">@Activision</a> was breached December 4th, 2022. The Threat Actors successfully phished a privileged user on the network. They exfiltrated sensitive work place documents as well as scheduled to be released content dating to November 17th, 2023.</p>

<p>With the data breach now hitting the public eye, the roadmap for <em>Call of Duty</em> 2023 has appeared online - including everything that we can expect to see throughout Seasons 3, 4, and 6.</p>
<p>The leak suggests that three new weapons are planned in each season, alongside two Operators, a battle pass, one themed event, and 70 bundles worth of skins in the store.</p>
<h2>Modern Warfare 2 And Warzone 2 To Get &#39;Haunting of Saba&#39; Event</h2>
<p>One of the most eye-opening leaks suggests that &#34;Saba&#34; is set to be a <em>Warzone 2</em> map released in Season 4, which will work similarly to <a href="https://www.ggrecon.com/guides/warzone-2-ashika-island-all-poi/" title="Every Ashika Island POI In Warzone 2">Ashika Island</a> in it being a small-based battle royale map.</p>
<p>While the leak in the Season 4 section claims &#34;1 small map&#34; will come to <em>Warzone</em>, it doesn&#39;t necessarily claim that it will be called Saba. However, come Season 6, a &#34;Haunting of Saba Event&#34; is planned. Given that the <em>Warzone 1</em> Halloween event was called the &#34;Haunting of Verdansk,&#34; it&#39;s safe to assume Saba will be a map.</p>
<p>The only thing that is off-beat is the dates, but Activision delaying Season 2 by a few weeks after the time of the data breach makes up for this discrepancy. Whether the leak is the real deal or not, we&#39;ll be keeping our eyes on this data breach. </p>
