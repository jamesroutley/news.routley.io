      Haskell has become the functional programming language of choice
      for many developers due to its excellent tools for abstraction
      and principled program design. The open source <a href="https://clash-lang.org/">Clash</a> hardware description
      language now brings these features to FPGA development.
    </p>

    <p>
      <cite>Retrocomputing with Clash</cite> takes the experienced
      Haskell programmer on a journey into the world of hardware
      design with Clash. Our approach is based on using Haskell to its
      fullest potential, using abstractions like monads and lenses in
      building a library of reusable components.

      But that wouldn&#39;t put the <i>fun</i> in <i>functional programming</i>! And so we
      put these components to good use in implementing various
      retro-computing devices:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pocket calculator</li>
      <li>Pong <a href="https://unsafeperform.io/retroclash/retroclash-chapter09-pong.pdf">(sample chapter)</a></li>
      <li>A simple, but Turing-complete computer that uses Brainfuck as its machine code</li>
      <li>An implementation of the CHIP-8 virtual computer specification</li>
      <li>Intel 8080 CPU</li>
      <li>Space Invaders arcade machine</li>     
      <li>Compucolor II, a home computer from 1977 complete with keyboard, color video, and a floppy drive</li>
    </ul>

          I absolutely love the very Haskell approach to circuit design
          in this book, as opposed to my own write-Verilog-in-Haskell
          style. It leverages Haskell&#39;s type system in a very
          natural way to protect against many traps we as circuit
          designers often fall into.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book clearly demonstrates the benefits of using a modern
          programming language for circuit design, where it builds
          reusable functionality and components at a far finer
          granularity than what I&#39;m used to in traditional hardware
          description languages.
        </p>
        <p>       
          Another thing that&#39;s absolutely great is the book&#39;s use of SDL2 multimedia library to
          emulate peripherals like monitors which enables you to fully interact with the
          computers and games that you&#39;ll be building without having to go through the sometimes
          long and painful process of programming an FPGA.

          This is <strong>the</strong> book for functional programmers
          looking to get into FPGAs and digital logic design.  Learn
          Clash, the &#34;I can’t believe it&#39;s not Haskell!&#34; hardware
          description language, while indulging in nostalgia for the
          1980s.  Take a joyride through a variety of hands-on projects,
          including Pong, Space Invaders, and the Compucolor II, a
          personal computer based on the Intel 8080.  Recommended.
