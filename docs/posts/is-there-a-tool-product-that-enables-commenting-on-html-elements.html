    <h1>Ask HN: Is there a tool / product that enables commenting on HTML elements?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I&#39;m searching for a commercial product that enables commenting on HTML elements on a product so it can be shared with an org. Think google comments connected to Inspect Element in chrome that can be shared with an organization.<p>I want to get away from creating tickets or sending emails highlighting UX concerns. This is cumbersome and not very transparent or collaborative.</p><p>Does a tool like this already exist?</p></div></div>
