But as the reentry volume goes up, so too do the odds of a destructive impact.</p><p>There are other potential consequences as well. For instance, researchers are calling attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/montreal-protocol-satellites-air-pollution" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/montreal-protocol-satellites-air-pollution">pollution created by reentering satellites</a>, which could damage Earth&#39;s ozone layer and also affect our planet&#39;s climate.</p><p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: </strong></em><em>This story was updated at 12:10 p.m. ET on May 10 to state that tracking organizations predicted several different possible reentry locales for Kosmos 482.</em></p>
