    <h1>Ask HN: Can one be self-employed fixing bugs?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>By far my favourite software development task is to fix bugs.</p><p>Investigating, documenting, and fixing the root cause of a nasty bug has the ability to keep me in a mental state of flow for a full working day (and probably more).</p><p>Thus far in my career I’ve been employed, but I’d like to give self-employment a try. I’m not looking to create the next unicorn, just earn enough to become financially independent sooner rather than later.</p><p>My question is: can one be self-employed fixing bugs? If so, what are some effective strategies to make it a reality?</p></div></div></div>
