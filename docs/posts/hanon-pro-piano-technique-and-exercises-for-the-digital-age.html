    <h1>Show HN: Hanon Pro – piano technique and exercises for the digital age</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

			<div>
				<p>Hanon Pro is an app for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that offers a fresh, modern take on
						keyboard and piano technique and exercises for the digital age. Just like health and fitness
						apps track your physical health over time, Hanon Pro does the same for piano practice. It
						enables you to get feedback on your playing, visualize trends, and track practice habits over
						time.</p>

				</p>

				<p>The app features a catalog of content specifically designed to look great on iPhone, iPad, and
						Mac. We design each book and score with support for responsive layouts, Dark Mode, rich
						metadata, embedded finger numbers, and more. You can listen to each piece, practice with the
						built-in metronome, and adjust the tempo.</p>

				</p>

				<p>The real magic of Hanon Pro is unlocked when you connect your iPhone, iPad, or Mac with a MIDI
						keyboard or piano over a Bluetooth or USB connection. Hanon Pro&#39;s intelligence engine can
						analyze your playing, including accuracy, tempo, and dynamics, and even turn pages as you play.
						To help make piano practice a habit, the app lets you sign up for daily practice reminder
						notifications and earn achievements over time with built-in Game Center integration.</p>

						like to request a score, you can do so directly in the app!</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h3>Pricing</h3>
					<p>We&#39;re committed to maintaining Hanon Pro for years to come. However, it&#39;s a niche product and
						each score and book needs to be prepared for the interactive capabilities of the app such as
						automatic page turning, responsive layout, and computer aided evaluation. In other words, it&#39;s
						not just a PDF. In order to sustain the development of Hanon Pro, we charge for the content in
						our catalog.</p>

					<h3>Reviews</h3>
					<p>★★★★★</p>
					<p><em>Since trying Hanon Pro, I&#39;ve
							practiced playing the piano every day this week, which almost never happened before. The
							gamification of practicing piano technique with feedback, charts, achievements, and
							reminders keeps me coming back. Looking forward to seeing more content over time!</em></p>
