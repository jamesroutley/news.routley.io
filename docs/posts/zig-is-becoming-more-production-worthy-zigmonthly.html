It should be more than just a link aggregator, it should be a community update crafted with care and love. Behind the scenes, this involves a <em>lot</em> of work, and I haven’t always been true to that statement: (a) it’s not always clear when the best time to feature projects is, so I have to coordinate with project maintainers. Curating content and deciding if it’s representative of the quality we all want of Zig, and making the tough call of when to exclude something, while trying to acknowledge my biases - is all very time consuming and challenging.</p><p>I do this work because nobody else is, and I want something like zigmonthly to exist for the community.</p><p>To make my life easier, and to improve the quality of zigmonthly, I’m adopting a bi-monthly schedule. Hopefully this gives me more time to focus on <a href="https://machengine.org">Mach engine</a>, more weekends where I can sit down and prepare these to publish on time, and give me a better selection of the highest quality content from the Zig community to go into these articles. The next one will go out <em>sometime</em> in September and cover July-Aug.</p><p>I’m also adopting a new format: orienting the articles more around <em>new and highly-notable developments that should be highlighted</em>, rather than speaking so much about <em>incremental developments to established projects</em> (excluding the Zig project itself.) I want these to be things that get people excited about what is going on in Zig, not a dump of links.</p><p>The idea is that if you have a new project, if you wrote a new application in Zig, etc. and you’d like everyone to be aware of it - then you can use zigmonthly to ‘launch’ it to 600+ readers and build your own audience/community from that. Updates to established projects (like say Mach or zig-gamedev) will still be mentioned, they’ll just be footnotes briefly summarizing (and linking to) their own status reports.</p><p>If you like my work, you can be one of the 9 people needed to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/slimsag">help me reach my goal of 50 sponsors on GitHub</a> and I’ll forever appreciate you.</p></div></article></div>
