    <h1>Loneliness is a measure of self-understanding</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

  <p><em>Definition 1</em>: Loneliness is when we are surrounded by people and feel misunderstood by others.</p>
<p><em>Definition 2</em>: You don’t really understand something if you can not explain it using simple words.</p>
<p>By combining these two definitions we get interesting causality:</p>
<p>Let’s start with replacing <em>something</em> with <em>yourself</em>. We get: <strong>you don’t really understand yourself if you can not explain yourself using simple words</strong>.</p>
<p>Now let’s imply the first definition by the second one:</p>
<ul>
<li>From Definition 1, the <strong>loneliness is caused by</strong> lack of understanding you by other people, and</li>
<li>the lack of understanding you by other people is caused by the lack of skills to explain yourself to others,</li>
<li>from Definition 2, lack of skills to explain yourself is caused by <strong>lack of understanding yourself</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deduction says <strong>loneliness is caused by lack of understanding yourself</strong>, or even <strong>loneliness is a measure of self-understanding</strong>.</p>
<p>If you think you understand yourself well, but you feel a deep sense of being misunderstood. You need to explain yourself to other people, you have to help them to understand you, you need to learn to communicate who you are.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are the recipient of feeling understood or misunderstood, not others. So it’s your task to make others understand you.</p>
