    <h1>Mullvad VPN now accepts Monero payments</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Mullvad is now accepting payments in the Monero cryptocurrency.</p>

<p><a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> is designed from the ground up with privacy as its main focus. It fulfills this goal admirably, making it a good match for our privacy focused VPN service.</p>

<p>As with our other cryptocurrencies, we run the wallet and node ourselves and do not rely on any third parties.</p>

<p>We do not provide refunds and account recovery for Monero transactions but all purchases using Monero, as well as any other cryptocurrency, get a 10% discount.</p>

<p>You can find the option to pay using Monero alongside our other payment methods on the <a href="https://mullvad.net/account/">account page</a>.</p>
