<p>The Internet presents a serious conundrum. Though well known to have security problems, the network is globally relied upon for commerce and used to control many critical systems and infrastructure. This inconsistency is partially explained by the fact that when someone says, “The Internet is insecure,” they are often not referring to the communications network, but rather the applications that run on it. But it is also true that a network itself can be insecure and nonetheless be widely used—because the network provides value and risk can be managed.</p>
<p>The Internet’s communications protocols—TCP/IP—do not authenticate communication senders; this allows various attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), and simplifies attacker intrusions into endpoint networks. The decentralized nature of Internet routing—routers on the network share routing information with their neighbors—allows packets to be routed incorrectly,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> sometimes leading to eavesdropping on communications, theft,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> and even shutting down important and well-known websites due to traffic diversion.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A solution to many of these problems exists: cryptography. The technology, which can provide confidentiality (ensuring no one but the intended recipients can read a message), integrity (ensuring that the communication has not been altered), and authenticity (proof that the message came from an authorized source), is essential to providing security and privacy to communications protocols (e.g., https).</p>
<p>Cryptography presents a peculiar problem to communications security. Cryptographic algorithms have been used to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication to many Internet communications protocols. These include, for example, the cipher suites<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> in TLS,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> which is the protocol that provides end-to-end security for web browsing, email, and other Internet applications. For a protocol such as TLS to transit international borders and securely transmit IP-based communications, there must be international acceptance and use of the cryptography employed within the protocols.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Protocols transit international borders of nations that do not necessarily trust each other—and, in particular, do not necessarily trust the developer of the cryptographic standard. In spite of this lack of trust, the use of these cryptographic standards has prevailed—an impressive success.</p>
<p>There have been occasional breaks in protocols and more frequent ones in the implementation of communications protocols. But breaks of approved cryptographic standards are quite uncommon, in large part due to public vetting of the proposed standards prior to adoption. One situation where such a break occurred deserves particular attention. In September 2013, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>ProPublica</em>, and <em>The Guardian</em> reported that the NSA “[had] been deliberately weakening international encryption standards.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Times pointed to an algorithm, Dual_EC_DRBG,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> about which cryptographers had previously expressed doubts regarding its security. The algorithm, which supplied “random bits” for determining an encryption key, apparently had a cryptographic “backdoor.”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Such a backdoor functions much like a key under a doormat, providing a way for those who know it to bypass the encryption and access the encrypted content.</p>
<p>In this case, the key under the doormat was the relationship between two parameters of the curve. Each elliptic-curve cryptosystem has two parameters, P and Q. If the curves are secure curves suitable for use in cryptography,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> then finding a mathematical relationship between P and Q is computationally infeasible. But there was strong reason to believe that the NSA knew the mathematical relationship between the two parameters in Dual_EC_DRBG.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Knowing this would provide the agency with a backdoor that allowed it to quickly decrypt communications ostensibly secured through Dual_EC_DRBG.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> In addition, there appeared to be statistical bias in Dual_EC_DRBG’s output,<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> a major flaw in any random-bit generator. This bias simplified the use of the backdoor for anyone with knowledge of the mathematical relationship between P and Q.</p>
<p>Even worse, the system was an approved cryptographic standard. When Dual_EC_DRBG had initially been proposed as a standard, a number of cryptographers raised concerns about the potential of a cryptographic backdoor.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> Despite the cryptographers’ misgivings, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> Dual_EC_DRBG as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS),<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> a standard for non-national security agencies of the federal government. Although FIPSs only apply to federal non-national security agencies, the impact of the designation is far broader. FIPSs are often adopted by industries, including those outside the United States, for private sector use. That NIST had designated a corrupted cryptosystem as a FIPS thus had reverberations well beyond U.S. borders.</p>
<p>The problem of the algorithm was quickly handled. NIST, which had approved<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> Dual_EC_DRBG as a FIPS, immediately responded by recommending that the algorithm not be used and opened a public comment period on the standard.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> Seven months later, NIST permanently removed Dual_EC_DRBG from its list of recommended random-number generators.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> The problem of reestablishing NIST as a purveyor of widely used cryptographic standards—a role it had been successfully filling—was more complex.</p>
<p>This situation provides a conundrum. The Snowden disclosure of a cryptographic backdoor in Dual_EC_DRBG revealed, at best, a weakness in the NIST process of developing cryptographic standards. At worst, it showed nefarious intent on the part of the U.S. government agency. Yet within just a short period it became clear that NIST’s Computer Security Division (CSD) was able to successfully continue as a largely trusted developer of internationally accepted cryptographic standards, most recently with its efforts to develop post-quantum cryptographic standards<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> and lightweight cryptography for the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>In this paper we explain this conundrum. We begin, in Part I, by providing context through a short primer on cryptography and on NIST’s role in developing cryptographic standards. In Part II, we discuss what NIST did to address the problems that allowed a problematic algorithm to be approved as a FIPS and the reaction of the international cryptography community. We next examine in Part III why the situation resolved in this way.</p>
<p>Yet the story does not end with NIST’s successful regaining of the international cryptographic research community’s trust. The Dual_EC_DRBG situation played out against a nearly forty-year continuing conflict between the U.S. government and cryptographers and computer security experts and a fifteen-year history of cooperation between NIST and the cryptographic research community. In Part IV, we briefly discuss the stability of this resolution against two sets of changes: the role of the U.S. in Europe and elsewhere and the increasing fragmentation of the Internet.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> From the point of view of security, TLS 1.3 is a vast improvement over TLS 1.2. It introduces forward secrecy, in which new encryption keys are used for each communication session, sharply reduces the number of choices of implementations (which public -key algorithm with which private-key algorithm), thus reducing complexity (the bane of security), eliminates problematic ciphers from being considered, speeds up and secures the “handshake” between two systems in which they negotiate a key, and allows encryption in “resumed” messages between two entities. <em>See</em> Nick Sullivan, <em>A Detailed Look at RFC 8446 (a.k.a. TLS 1.3)</em>, CLOUDFLARE BLOG (Aug. 10, 2018), https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446- aka-tls-1-3 [https://perma.cc/3EFQ-A7CA]; Rescorla, <em>supra</em> note 4. The former provides a simplified explanation, and the latter gives more technical details.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> In fact, in 2019 Russia explored banning the use of TLS 1.3, apparently because the protocol could be used to hide the name of a destination website. This would thwart government censorship and surveillance efforts.

<p><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> The original news article by Perlroth, et al., <em>supra</em> note 7, did not explicitly name the standard but made clear which it was.

<p><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> Essentially this means avoiding “supersingular” curves and “prime-field anomalous elliptic” curves. See Alfred J.

<p><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> In 2007, which was after the standard’s approval, Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson raised the possibility of a backdoor in the algorithm.

In fact, the Canadian company Certicom had filed a patent application on the backdoor in Dual_EC_DRBG in 2005, but Certicom never publicized this information. <em>Certicom’s Patent Applications Regarding Dual EC Key Escrow</em>, PROJECT BULLRUN (July 29, 2005), https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/patent.html [https://perma.cc/WR7C-V8MP].</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13">[13]</a> In March 2006, Kristian Gjøsteen sent a paper to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) showing that the bit strings output from Dual_EC_DRBG were biased.
