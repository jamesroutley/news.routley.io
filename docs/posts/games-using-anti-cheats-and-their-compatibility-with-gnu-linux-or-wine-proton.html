      <p>I’ve never experienced a company with a completely healthy
performance review culture. To be fair, it’s quite likely that my sample
size is just skewed. Still, <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Feedback_Sans_Sandwiches.html">giving
feedback well is tricky</a>, and performance reviews always have the
added complexities of introducing a power dynamic and being
fundamentally transactional. Not the coziest starting point.</p>
<p>And yet there is room for a middle ground between pretending it’s a
coffee chat between friends and a professional colonoscopy. On paper,
performance reviews should work great for both parties: the manager gets
to help propel the report into a position as a more productive member of
the team, and the report learns what is expected of them to reach the
next stage of growth and compensation—or sometimes just avoiding getting
terminated.</p>
<p>Mandatory disclaimer: my background is not in HR. I’m reporting what
has worked for me, as well as some wishful thinking that I hope is still
actionable. As always, my bias is towards small to medium-sized
teams.</p>
<h2 id="a-working-definition">A working definition</h2>
<p>We need to start defining stuff before we get into the weeds, so here
goes: a performance review is a periodic written summary of impact and
behaviors over a defined time window, plus an agreed growth plan. It is
often accompanied by an in-person check-in, but doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>It is not a compensation negotiation (which is related but separate),
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve">stack ranking
ritual</a>, or a place to air our grievances from the last six months.
We don’t just collect feedback so we can shove it into a two-page
document about all our latest failings, ideally we have a better process
for giving quick, actionable, kind feedback.</p>
<p>So, what do we want to achieve, then?</p>
<h3 id="goals-of-a-good-review">Goals of a good review</h3>
<p>After the performance review is done, we want to feel aligned and
ready to tackle the next period of work as an even better team. To do
this, we need to strive for <strong>clarity</strong> in our
communication, <strong>fairness</strong> in our evaluation, and stay
<strong>actionable</strong>. Let’s go through these in turn.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity</strong> is achieved by avoiding hedging while
staying kind. Hopefully there are no surprises anyway, since your
company has an ongoing feedback culture and avoids in-office politics
that reward backstabbing and careerism, right? On the off chance that
there is a political component, we do our best to stay evidence-based
and bring receipts.</p>
<p>This brings us to <strong>fairness</strong> immediately. We need to
factor in things like the individual’s experience in the job vs. in the
wider industry, team and company situation within that
period<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, and any potential biases we might
have (this includes things like charisma and manager proximity).</p>
<p>Finally, our review needs to be <strong>actionable</strong>. No
matter whether there are things to improve or we mostly want to stay on
our current trajectory, we still need to set explicit goals to make
performance measurable. I also advocate for at least two levels of
goals: goals for satisfactory performance, and goals for exceptional
performance. This makes room for stretch goals while reducing anxiety
about what is necessary vs. good to have.</p>
<h3 id="no-nos">No-nos</h3>
<p>We should probably also be explicit about what we <em>don’t</em>
want.</p>
<p>Conversely to our goals above, we do not want to be
<strong>vague</strong>, <strong>personal</strong>, or give
<strong>surprise feedback</strong>. These non-goals are just derived
from the above.</p>
<p>But there’s more failure modes I’ve seen, often related to problems
in middle management and their KPIs.</p>
<p>Firstly, managers shouldn’t be obligated to hit a quota or give out a
certain number of positive or negative reviews. We’re not doing
curve-fitting here.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should keep the number of goals manageable. 20 tiny
goals will lead to less overall change than 3-5 big ticket items. And of
course all of them should be explicit; hidden criteria that only pop up
once review rolls around are embarrassingly common and directly lead to
frustration and, consequentially, a loss of valuable team members.</p>
<p>Finally, we should look at “non-primary” work as well, and reward it.
Mentoring, incident response, reviews, quality documentation should all
be rewarded, especially the higher the report’s level. Of course this
must be tailored to the career track the person is on, especially if
there is a “manager” vs. “technical” track. Again, be as explicit about
everything as possible.</p>
<h2 id="cadence-format">Cadence &amp; format</h2>
<p>We should briefly talk about how long our review cycle should be, and
how it should work.</p>
<p>I’ve seen everything from yearly to bi-annual to quarterly.
Generally, the younger the company (and thus faster moving), the shorter
the cycles. I’d personally try to keep the cycles as short as possible
organizationally while still providing enough input into how performance
actually trended. Six months is what I see most often. I personally find
a year too slow, but I’ve also never worked at a corporate behemoth.</p>
<p>The review is informed by two reviews (one by the report and one by
the manager), artifacts the report produced (code, documentation, PRs,
incident reports in my domain), expectations set by our career
ladder<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, as well as any on-topic 1:1s and
ongoing feedback logs we still have. This gives us more than enough data
to figure out a rough trajectory.</p>
<p>You don’t need a formal document for the reviews themselves, but I’ll
sketch up an example that more or less contains all the inputs and
output I’d expect:</p>
<pre><code># Performance review &lt;name&gt;: &lt;period&gt;

**Role**: &lt;role with link to description&gt;
**Next follow-up**: &lt;date&gt;

## Summary

&lt;2-3 lines of summary, longer if desired&gt;

### Role alignment

&lt;how did we do in comparison to our ladder, including flagging over-performance&gt;

## Outcomes last period

| Description | Achieved | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
|             | &lt;marker&gt; |       |

## Growth plan next period

- &lt;bulleted list is good enough&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>Reviews are always scary, and it’s probably impossible to make them
completely anxiety-free. But an organization that commits to making
growth the goal goes a long way towards making reviews productive and
actually motivate team members rather than scare them.</p>
<p>In the end, I just want to have people leave the room feeling seen
and ready to tackle the next 3-6 months. If we achieve that, we did most
things right.</p>
<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>
<p><span id="1">1.</span> It should go without saying that if you had a
lot of attrition or a market crash throw a wrench in our last quarter
this should factor into our performance review and whether we reached
our goals. I can tell you, however, that it doesn’t go without
saying.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> I’ve seen a lot of places that have roles
without descriptions what they actually mean (i.e., staff, senior, and
junior handled at the discretion of the manager). Don’t do that. You
don’t have to spell out every single metric, but having expectations for
your roles makes everyone’s lives easier: managers know what to expect,
and reports know what to strive for to climb the ladder.</p>
