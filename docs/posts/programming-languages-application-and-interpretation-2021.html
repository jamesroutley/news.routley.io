<p>We often seek to “straighten out” a maze-like, loop-containing situation. We try to find a “path” through “causal” explanations that go in only one direction. Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are countless different types of networks that contain loops. But all networks that contain no loops are basically the same: each has the form of a simple chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be linearized, i.e. topologically sorted. And we can apply the same types of reasoning to <em>everything</em> we can represent in terms of chains of causes and effects. We can proceed from start to end without any need for a novel thought.</p>
<p>But frequently, to construct such a path, we have to ignore important interactions and dependencies that run in other directions.</p>
<p>In loopy situations, one may find success in shifting from “causal” learning to “clausal” learning. If data values are annotated with dependencies, e.g. labeled with external provenance, with justifications for data-processing decisions, etc., then dependency-directed backtracking may help to path-find by avoiding sets of premises that support previously discovered contradictions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In this way, annotating data with provenance metadata can formally help to “straighten things out”.</p>
