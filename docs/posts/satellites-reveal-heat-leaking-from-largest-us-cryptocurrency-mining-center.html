<p id="5e483461-85ab-4cc9-83a9-47658d69eecf">One of the world&#39;s largest Bitcoin mining facilities is seen leaking heat into the environment in a new image captured from orbit by a heat-seeking satellite that was recently released by the U.K.-based company SatVu.</p><p>The image reveals the thermal footprint of a major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/25626-bitcoins-satellites-deep-space-industries.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/25626-bitcoins-satellites-deep-space-industries.html"><u>Bitcoin-mining</u></a> data center in Rockdale, Texas, which has been widely criticized for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"><u>electricity consumption</u></a> and carbon footprint.</p><p id="5e483461-85ab-4cc9-83a9-47658d69eecf-2" aria-hidden="true">SatVu didn&#39;t disclose which specific facility is in the image, but Rockdale is home to the Riot Platforms Bitcoin mine. The facility, considered the largest in the U.S., has an energy consumption of 700 megawatts, requiring about as much electricity as 300,000 homes.</p><p id="a5aaffb5-e5d2-47c6-a387-eb35e3c3782b">The satellite image reveals in a resolution of 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) where and how much heat leaks into the environment from the plant. SatVu thinks that the insights that could be gleaned from such images could help regulators and grid operators better understand the impact such facilities have on the environment and local power networks.</p><p>&#34;Today&#39;s data center buildout is moving incredibly quickly, and the world needs better ways to understand what&#39;s actually happening on the ground,&#34; Thomas Cobti, SatVu&#39;s VP for Business Development, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.satellitevu.com/news/satvu-releases-first-of-its-kind-thermal-image-revealing-true-operational-activity-inside-major-u-s-data-centre" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.satellitevu.com/news/satvu-releases-first-of-its-kind-thermal-image-revealing-true-operational-activity-inside-major-u-s-data-centre" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"><u>in a statement</u></a>. &#34;Thermal data gives an objective view of operational activity as it occurs — not weeks later through reports or announcements.&#34;</p><p>Although the image was only released on Dec. 17, it was most likely captured already in 2023, before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/satellite-satvu-hotsat-dead-after-six-months" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/satellite-satvu-hotsat-dead-after-six-months"><u>SatVu&#39;s HotSat-1 satellites failed in orbit</u></a> in December that year.
