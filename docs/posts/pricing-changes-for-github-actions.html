    <h1>Pricing Changes for GitHub Actions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>TLDR - On January 1, 2026, we are lowering the price of hosted runners, and beginning March 1, 2026, we are charging $0.002 per-minute across self-hosted runners. The vast majority of customers will not see a change to their bill. Actions will remain free in public repositories. </p><div><p>We’re announcing updates to our pricing and product models for GitHub Actions. </p>
<p>Historically, self-hosted runner customers were able to leverage much of GitHub Actions’ infrastructure and services at no cost. This meant that the cost of maintaining and evolving these essential services was largely being subsidized by the prices set for GitHub-hosted runners. By updating our pricing, we’re aligning costs more closely with usage and the value delivered to every Actions user,  while fueling further innovation and investment across the platform. The vast majority of users, especially individuals and small teams, will see no price increase.</p>
<p>We will have a GitHub Actions pricing calculator available where you will know how much you will be charged. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/pricing/calculator#actions">Actions pricing calculator</a> to estimate your future costs. 96% of customers will see no change to their bill. Of the 4% of Actions users impacted by this change, 85% of this cohort will see their Actions bill decrease and the remaining 15% who are impacted across all face a median increase around $13. </p>
<p>GitHub Actions will remain free for public repositories. In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total Actions minutes in public projects for free (~$184 million) and we will continue to invest in Actions to provide a fast, reliable, and predictable experience for our users. </p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>When we shipped Actions in 2018, we had no idea how popular it would become. By early 2024, the platform was running about 23 million jobs per day and our existing architecture couldn’t reliably support our growth curve. In order to increase feature velocity, we first needed to improve reliability and modernize the legacy frameworks that supported GitHub Actions. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/lets-talk-about-github-actions/">Our solution was to re-architect the core backend services powering GitHub Actions jobs</a> and runners with the goals of improving uptime and resilience against infrastructure issues, enhancing performance, reducing internal throttles, and leveraging GitHub’s broader platform investments and developer experience improvements. This work is paying off by helping us handle our current scale, even as we work through the last pieces of stabilizing our new platform.</p>
<p>Since August, all GitHub Actions jobs have run on our new architecture, which handles 71 million jobs per day (over 3x from where we started). Individual enterprises are able to start 7x more jobs per minute than our previous architecture could support. </p>
<p>As with any product, our goal at GitHub has been to meet customer needs while providing enterprises with flexibility and transparency.</p>
<p>This change better supports a world where CI/CD must be faster and more reliable, better caching, more workflow flexibility, rock-solid reliability, and strengthens the core experience while positioning GitHub Actions to power GitHub’s open, secure platform for agentic workloads. </p>
<h2>What’s changing?</h2>
<h3>Lower prices for GitHub-hosted runners</h3>
<p>Starting today, we’re charging fairly for Actions across the board which reduces the price of GItHub Hosted Runners and the price the average GitHub customer pays. And we’re <strong>reducing the net cost of GitHub-hosted runners by up to 39%</strong>, depending on which machine type is used.</p>
<p>This reduction is driven by a ~40% price reduction across all runner sizes, paired with the addition of a new $0.002 per-minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge. For GitHub-hosted runners, the new Actions cloud platform charge is <strong>already included into the reduced meter price.</strong> </p>
<p>Standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on <strong>public repositories will remain free</strong>. <strong>GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted</strong> by this change.</p>
<p>The price reduction you will see in your account depends on the types of machines that you use most frequently – smaller runners will have a smaller relative price reduction, larger runners will see a larger relative reduction.</p>
<p>This price reduction makes high-performance compute more accessible for both high-volume CI workloads and the agent jobs that rely on fast, secure execution environments.</p>
<p>For full pricing update details, see the updated Actions runner prices <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing">in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This price change will <strong>go into effect on January 1, 2026</strong>.</p>
<h3>Introduction of the GitHub Actions cloud platform charge</h3>
<p>We are introducing a <strong>$0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform</strong> <strong>charge</strong> for all Actions workflows across GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners. The new listed GitHub-runner rates include this charge. This will not impact Actions usage in public repositories or GitHub Enterprise Server customers.  </p>
<p>This aligns pricing to match consumption patterns and ensures consistent service quality as usage grows across both hosting modalities.</p>
<p>This will impact <strong>self-hosted runner pricing starting March 1, 2026.</strong></p>
<h3>Deepened investment in the Actions self-hosted experience</h3>
<p>We are increasing our investment into our self-hosted experience to ensure that we can provide autoscaling for scenarios beyond just Linux containers. This will include new approaches to scaling, new platform support, Windows support, and more as we move through the next 12 months. Here’s a preview of what to expect in the new year:</p>
<h4>GitHub Scale Set Client</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1192">new client</a> provides enterprises with a lightweight Go SDK to build custom autoscaling solutions without the complexity of Kubernetes or reliance on ARC. It integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure—containers, virtual machines, cloud instances, or bare metal—while managing job queuing, secure configuration, and intelligent scaling logic. Customers gain a supported path to implement flexible autoscaling, reduce setup friction, and extend GitHub Actions beyond workflows to scenarios such as self-hosted Dependabot and Copilot Coding Agent.</p>
<h4>Multi-label support</h4>
<p>We are reintroducing <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1195">multi-label functionality</a> for both GitHub-hosted larger runners and self-hosted runners, including those managed by Actions Runner Controller (ARC) and the new Scale Set Client.</p>
<h4>Actions Runner Controller 0.14.0</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1194">This upcoming release</a> introduces major quality-of-life improvements, including refined Helm charts for easier Docker configuration, enhanced logging, updated metrics, and formalized versioning requirements. It also announces the deprecation of legacy ARC, providing a clear migration path to a more reliable and maintainable architecture. Customers benefit from simplified setup, improved observability, and confidence in long-term support, reducing operational friction and improving scalability.</p>
<h4>Actions Data Stream</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1193">Actions Data Stream</a> will deliver a near real-time, authoritative feed of GitHub Actions workflow and job event data, including metadata such as the version of the action that was executed on any given workflow run. This capability enhances observability and troubleshooting by enabling organizations to integrate event data into monitoring and analytics systems for compliance and operational insights. By providing structured, high-fidelity data at scale, it eliminates reliance on manual log parsing and empowers teams to proactively manage reliability and performance.</p>
<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>Agents are expanding what teams can automate—but CI/CD remains the heartbeat of modern software delivery. These updates enable both a faster, more reliable CI/CD experience for every developer, and a scalable, flexible, secure execution layer to power GitHub’s agentic platform.</p>
<p>Our goal is to ensure GitHub Actions continues to meet the needs of the largest enterprises and of individual developers alike, with clear pricing, stronger performance, and a product direction built for the next decade of software development.</p>
