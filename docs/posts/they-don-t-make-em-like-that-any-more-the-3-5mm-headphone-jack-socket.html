<p>“It it ain’t broke, replace it with something that is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About five years ago I was suddenly, unexpectedly taken ill. Not just
‘that’s a bit nasty’ ill, but ‘prepare for the worst’ ill. One thing
that kept my spirits up in hospital, in the long watches of the night,
was listening to comedy shows and audiobooks. I used my smartphone for
this, since I had it with me, and a pair of old, wired headphones that I
just had time to grab on my way to the ambulance.</p>
<p>I survived, of course, as evidenced by my continued ramblings on this
site. But it was an unpleasant experience, made just a little better by
a simple piece of technology: the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I do own wireless headphones and earbuds – I think
almost everybody does. I also own several of those irritating USB
dongles, that provide a 3.5mm port for devices that don’t have one. But
here’s the problem: I can’t use my Bluetooth earbuds while they’re
charging. And I can’t easily charge my phone whilst it’s connected to
the USB dongle. In a critical-care facility, it’s hard enough to find
one free mains socket to connect a charger to, let alone two.</p>
<p>In the debate about the benefits of wired and wireless headphones, I
doubt anybody is thinking “What if I get sick?” It certainly wasn’t
something I was thinking, either, until I actually did. Still, that
experience made me think about all the advantages of having a headphone
jack, some of which I’d thought about before, and some I hadn’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound quality is better. Maybe that won’t always be the case, but it
is now. All decent headphones have an analog jack.</li>
<li>Almost any headphone or earphone will work with almost anything with
a standard jack socket. That isn’t the case for USB dongles. Maybe that
won’t always be the case, but it is now.</li>
<li>I can use the headphone jack to connect my phone or tablet to an
amplifier, should the need arise. For certain headphones, that need
<em>does</em> arise.</li>
<li>I can charge my phone whilst listening to music, which I do all
day.</li>
<li>I don’t have to carry around a stupid dongle, which I will
invariably lose.</li>
<li>Ordinary wired earbuds can be small enough to wear whilst sleeping.
I’ve never seen Bluetooth earbuds that are.</li>
</ul>
<p>The headphone jack is a “just works” kind of technology: there’s
nothing complicated about it, and its not encumbered by patents, so
anybody can make compatible equipment.</p>
<p>So, although “What if I get sick?” probably isn’t at the top of the
list of questions that will guide your buying decision, we have to
wonder what other things we lose, by replacing a well-established,
robust technology with a complicated, flaky one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <em>advantages</em> of doing away with the
headphone jack are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your cellphone is about ten pence cheaper.</li>
<li>Er… that’s it.</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes the loss of the headphone jack so hard to bear is that
<em>it wasn’t done for the consumer’s benefit</em>. To be sure,
manufacturers made certain claims about the alleged benefits of losing
the jack, but few of them stand up to much logical scrutiny.</p>
<p>The first manufacturer to make a point of dropping the headphone jack
(I believe) was not Apple – as is commonly believed – but Oppo, and back
in 2014. Their reason for doing so was at least a credible technical
one: they said it made their phones about half a millimetre thinner.
Maybe that was a selling point, maybe it wasn’t. But Apple couldn’t fall
back even on this claim, because people found ways to fit a 3.5mm jack
socket into the iPhones that lacked one, and even posted videos on
Youtube showing how they did it. It wasn’t easy, but it was clearly
<em>possible</em>. If Apple genuinely thought that omitting the jack
would leave more room for other features, they didn’t actually provide
any.</p>
<p>It’s notable that a number of companies mocked Apple’s decision to
drop the headphone jack, before quietly doing the same themselves:
Samsung and Google in particular. Samsung even cynically tried to
withdraw all the advertising in which they had mocked Apple. Of course,
nothing is ever really gone on the Internet, so we can continue to
marvel at Samsung’s barefaced duplicity.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claimed that the presence of the headphone jack
made it difficult to keep their phones waterproof; but there’s a whole
range of good-quality phones from around 2019-2020 that are waterproof
to a reasonable degree, without sacrificing the jack.</p>
<p>No. All of these weak excuses are simply distractions from the
<em>real</em> reason Apple, Samsung, and Google dropped the headphone
jack: they all have a substantial investment in the manufacture of
wireless headphones.</p>
<p>Apple owns Beats – this was a multi-billion dollar investment, in a
company that manufactures Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>Samsung owns Harmon, which is know for the Harmon-Kardon and JBL
audio brands. Again, these were multi-billion dollar acquisitions for
Samsung, in companies with a strong interest in wireless audio.</p>
<p>Google owns Synaptics, Dysonics, RevX, and Tempow, all of which are
active in the development of wireless audio. Google also hired Peter Liu
from Bose, who was one of the original developers of the Bluetooth Low
Energy specification.</p>
<p>It is very much in the interest of companies like Apple, Samsung, and
Google to encourage their customers to buy into wireless Bluetooth
headphones. Or, better yet, to force them to do so, by taking away the
means to do anything else. After all, their executives have to justify
the billions of dollars they’ve spent, acquiring suppliers and
developers of wireless audio equipment.</p>
<p>The 3.5mm headphone jack has almost nothing to recommend it,
technically speaking. It was criticized by hi-fi enthusiasts almost from
its inception. The only things it has going for it are its simplicity,
and the fact that everybody uses it. Well, everybody outside the world
of mobile gadgets, anyway. This simplicity and ubiquity is a great
benefit to consumers, which is why Apple, et al., don’t want to provide
it – they have nothing to gain if consumers spend less money on their
products.</p>
<p>The loss of the headphone jack would have hurt even if there were
good technical reasons for it. As it turns out, there are none – it’s
just another cynical way for big businesses to gouge consumers. A side
effect of their strategy is that wired headphones themselves are
becoming less available, as cellphone users were until recently major
purchasers of these devices. It’s not difficult to get top-quality
headphones with a jack – they all have one; but there are fewer and
fewer mid-priced wired earbuds on the market.</p>
<p>The way to discourage companies behaving this way is for us all to
take our business elsewhere. It’s still possible to get decent
cellphones from Motorola, Asus, and Sony that retain the 3.5mm jack. I
don’t believe that anything recent from Apple, Samsung, or Google has
one, for reasons I explained earlier. Still, there are older cellphone
models from these suppliers that do have a jack, and which are still
good phones. I own the Samsung S10+, S10e, and Note 9, for example.
They’re a few years old, but they still do everything I want and
more.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the 3.5mm jack, it’s time to vote with your
wallet.</p>
