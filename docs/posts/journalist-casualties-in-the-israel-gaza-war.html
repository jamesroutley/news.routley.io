<p><em><strong>Editor’s notes:</strong> The list below is CPJ’s most recent and preliminary account of journalist deaths in the war. Our database will not include all of these casualties until we have completed further investigations into the circumstances surrounding them. For more information, read our <a href="https://cpj.org/2023/11/faq-how-cpj-documents-journalist-deaths-in-the-war/">FAQ</a></em>.</p>



<p>The Israel-Gaza war has taken a severe toll on journalists since Hamas launched its unprecedented <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/sirens-warning-incoming-rockets-sound-around-gaza-near-tel-aviv-2023-10-07/">attack</a> against Israel on October 7 and Israel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/08/middleeast/israel-gaza-attack-hostages-response-intl-hnk/index.html">declared war</a> on the militant Palestinian group, launching strikes on the blockaded Gaza Strip. </p>



<p>CPJ is investigating all reports of journalists and media workers killed, injured, or missing in the war, which has led to the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992. </p>



<p>As of March 7, 2024, CPJ’s preliminary investigations showed at least 95 journalists and media workers were among the more than 31,000 killed since the war began on October 7—with more than <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/">30,000 Palestinian deaths</a> in Gaza and the West Bank and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-revises-death-toll-oct-7-hamas-attack-around-1200-2023-11-10/">1,200 deaths</a> in Israel. </p>



<p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Reuters and Agence France Press news agencies in October that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip, after they had sought assurances that their journalists would not be targeted by Israeli strikes, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-cant-guarantee-journalists-safety-gaza-2023-10-27/">Reuters</a> report.</p>



<p>Journalists in Gaza face particularly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-militants-conflict-war-b6ea877aa1ee96303aa0870d741da777">high</a> risks as they try to cover the conflict during the Israeli <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-11-15-2023-b85e828db648f5f911278fa217e827e7">ground assault</a>, including devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, supply shortages, and extensive power outages.</p>



<p>As of March 7:</p>



<ul>
<li>95 journalists and media workers were confirmed dead: 90 Palestinian, 2 Israeli, and 3 Lebanese.</li>



<li>16 journalists were reported injured.</li>



<li>4 journalists were reported missing.</li>



<li>25 journalists were reported <a href="https://cpj.org/2023/11/attacks-arrests-threats-censorship-the-high-risks-of-reporting-the-israel-hamas-war/">arrested</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/10/attacks-arrests-threats-censorship-the-high-risks-of-reporting-the-israel-hamas-war/">Multiple assaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and killings of family members</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>CPJ is also investigating numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt, or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes.</p>



<p>“CPJ emphasizes that journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. “Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heart-breaking conflict. Those in Gaza, in particular, have paid, and continue to pay, an unprecedented toll and face exponential threats. Many have lost colleagues, families, and media facilities, and have fled seeking safety when there is no safe haven or exit.”</p>



<p>The list published here includes names based on information obtained from CPJ’s sources in the region and media reports. It includes all journalists* involved in news-gathering activity. It is unclear whether all of these journalists were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths, but CPJ has included them in our count as we investigate their circumstances. The list is being updated on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Muhammad Salama</p>



<p>Salama, a Palestinian journalist who worked as a host for the Hamas affiliated Al-Aqsa TV channel, was killed with his family in an Israeli airstrike on his home in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, according to <a href="https://www.palestinechronicle.com/obliterating-the-truth-israeli-airstrike-kills-palestinian-journalist-his-entire-family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several</a> <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/entertainment_media/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%AD-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media</a> <a href="https://www.alquds.co.uk/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PALESTINIANJOURNALISTSSYNDICATE/posts/pfbid0xgScc41FF1sanbaYZZ6mm4nXkoTESgwfSWg7mSNTnNr5yy2g8KRWBWgfFn4xgR9Sl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate</a>, and the Turkish owned <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/palestinian-journalist-killed-in-gaza-strip-bringing-tally-since-oct-7-to-133/3156493#:~:text=Muhammad%20Salama%2C%20who%20worked%20for,Office%20said%20in%20a%20statement." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anadolu Agency</a>.</p>



<p>CPJ wasn’t immediately able to specify the number of family members killed with Salama. A report by the Qatari funded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6RlFTOI9aA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Al-Araby TV</a> in the area showed damage from the airstrikes on the residential area, and Al-Araby’s reporter on the ground, Bassel Khalaf, said at least 6 people were pulled from under the rubble, while others remain missing. A witness in the area told the channel that the family was having dinner when they were killed. </p>



<p>According to Al-Aqsa Voice radio and the Egypt based <a href="https://www.albawabhnews.com/4970668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Al-Bawaba News</a>, Salama was buried in Gaza on March 6, 2024.</p>

<p><strong>February 6, 2024</strong></p>



<p>Rizq Al-Gharabli</p>

<p>The Palestinian Information Center <a href="https://palinfo.com/news/2024/02/08/875469/">said</a> that Al-Gharabli was its Gaza office director since 2015, and worked as a writer and editor until his death.</p>



<p><strong>January 29, 2024</strong></p>



<p>Mohammed Atallah</p>



<p>Atallah, a 24-year-old Palestinian editor for the local Al-Resalah news website and a writer for the regional independent website <a href="https://raseef22.net/author/1075432-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%B7%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87">Raseef22</a>, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beach refugee camp in northern Gaza City, along with an unidentified number of family members, according to a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/Raseef22/status/1752323815059624041">Raseef22</a> that included his last voice message, the local news agency <a href="https://twitter.com/SafaPs/status/1751890433054015642">Safa</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PALESTINIANJOURNALISTSSYNDICATE/posts/pfbid0dXkn2sHZGFQsD7b8PuJqmWEBpkChEjMYGix1qywbTAk9wKo3N1t6FuYDoYg9iFCKl">Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate</a>, and the <a href="https://www.ifj.org/war-in-gaza">International Federation of Journalists</a>.</p>



<p>Ayman Sharrouf, Raseef22’s political editor, told CPJ that Atallah “wrote for Raseef22 under his name and another pseudonym. He was particularly interested in the daily life stories of the Gazans, despite the siege on Gaza, the corruption, and the narrow political interests in the strip. When the war started, we started collaborating, and he wrote 3 pieces, but he lived in the north where there was intense bombing, and one of the Israeli airstrikes hit his parents’ house, which killed one of his brothers and all of his family members.”</p>



<p>Sharrouf told CPJ that “Atallah evacuated after surviving a lot of near-death situations. In his last correspondence with us, he told me that he’s safe and he wants to resume working soon, but I later learned about his death from the news.” Sharrouf added, “Mohammed was a very professional journalist. He wanted to relay the voices of the people. He worked hard on his pieces and was very keen on factual reporting of the daily life of Gaza’s people, despite all the challenges that a journalist like him faces. Unfortunately, he was killed before he got to do what he wanted in journalism; and the most horrific heartbreaking part was that he thought he would survive.”</p>



<p><strong>January 25, 2024</strong></p>



<p>Iyad El-Ruwagh</p>

<p><em><strong>Clarifications and corrections:  </strong></em></p>



<p><em>CPJ has removed a Palestinan man, Mohamed Khaireddine, from this list. Khaireddine was previously identified as a journalist, but his family later clarified that he was neither a journalist nor a media support worker.</em></p>



<p><em>CPJ has removed two Israeli journalists, Shai Regev and Ayelet Arnin, from this list after their outlets confirmed that the journalists were not on assignment to cover the music festival, nor did they have any opportunity to begin reporting on the attack by Hamas militants that killed them on October 7. CPJ’s global database of killed journalists includes only those who have been killed in connection with their work or where there is still some doubt that their death was work-related.</em></p>



<p><em>After receiving reports that Palestinian journalist and presenter Alaa Taher Al-Hassanat may have survived the attack thought to have killed her, CPJ has removed her name from its casualties list pending further investigation.</em></p>



<p><em>*CPJ’s research and documentation covers all journalists, defined as individuals involved in news-gathering activity. This definition covers those working for a broad range of publicly and privately funded news outlets, as well as freelancers. In the cases CPJ has documented, multiple sources have found no evidence to date that any journalist was engaged in militant activity. </em></p>



<p><em>This text has been updated to correct the spelling of Alma Al-Shaab</em> <em>in Issam Abdallah’s October 13, 2023 entry</em>, <em>and of the outlet Palestine TV in Abu Hatab’s November 2, 2023 entry. </em></p>



<p><em>On February 6, 2024, Canadian-Palestinian journalist Mansour Shouman was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mansour-shouman-turns-up-alive-1.7106034">found alive</a> after being reported missing more than two weeks before. We have removed him from our list of missing journalists.</em></p>
