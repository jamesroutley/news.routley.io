                Your data should be owned by you! Memories is a self-hosted app, which means that
                your photos are stored on your own Nextcloud instance and not on someone else&#39;s
                servers. You can even encrypt your data with a secret key. And it&#39;s completely free
                and open source!

                on-demand video transcoder. You can also give the transcoding process a boost by using

                Fast &amp; Battle Tested
            </h2>
            <p>
                Memories is built with performance in mind. It is designed and highly optimized for
                handling large photo libraries even when running on modest hardware such as a Raspberry Pi.
                It also relies on the battle tested Nextcloud platform as the underlying storage layer,
                which is used by thousands of organizations around the world.

                No Lock-In
            </h2>
            <p>
                Memories stores most of the metadata in the EXIF headers of your photos, which means
                that you can easily migrate to other solutions without losing your data. It also utilizes
                your existing filesystem structure for organization without converting it to any
                specialized format.
