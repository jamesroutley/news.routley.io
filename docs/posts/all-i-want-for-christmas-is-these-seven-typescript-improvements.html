    <h1>All I want for Christmas is these seven TypeScript improvements</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://freesvg.org/vector-clip-art-of-cartoon-presents-under-christmas-tree" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;all i want for christmas is these seven typescript improvements&#39;, &#39;https://freesvg.org/vector-clip-art-of-cartoon-presents-under-christmas-tree&#39;, event);"><img src="https://effectivetypescript.com/images/christmas-tree.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Christmas tree with presents"/></a> It&#39;s Christmastime and I&#39;ve been happily working through this year&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://adventofcode.com" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;all i want for christmas is these seven typescript improvements&#39;, &#39;https://adventofcode.com&#39;, event);">Advent of Code</a> in Deno (look forward to a blog post in the new year). What with all the presents, it&#39;s a good time to think about what we&#39;d most like to see from TypeScript in the new year. Here are my top seven feature requests for 2023. Yes, that&#39;s a lot, but really I&#39;d be thrilled with just one or two. Pretty please?</p>
<h2 id="A-faster-language-service"><a href="#A-faster-language-service" title="A faster language service"></a>A faster language service</h2><p>When you install TypeScript, you get two executables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tsc</code>, which checks your code for type errors and converts it to executable JavaScript</li>
<li><code>tsserver</code>, which provides language services for your editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This is discussed in Item 6 of <em>Effective TypeScript</em>: Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System.)</p>
<p>The faster these two programs can do their job, the happier you&#39;ll be as a developer. The TypeScript team is acutely aware of this: the release notes for new versions of TypeScript always talk about performance improvements in addition to new language features. The sluggishness of <code>tsc</code> remains a pain point for many developers, though. One of them even got so frustrated that he <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.totaltypescript.com/rewriting-typescript-in-rust" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a faster language service&#39;, &#39;https://www.totaltypescript.com/rewriting-typescript-in-rust&#39;, event);">decided to rewrite <code>tsc</code> in Rust!</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#39;t care much about the performance of <code>tsc</code>. I only tend to run as part of a continuous integration service or in &#34;watch&#34; mode without type checking via <code>webpack</code> or <code>ts-node</code>. The performance there is good enough for me.</p>
<p>What I <em>do</em> care about is the performance of <code>tsserver</code>. When you apply a refactor or change a type and have to wait for the red squiggly lines to catch up, that&#39;s <code>tsserver</code> being slow. Here&#39;s a GIF showing the language service having trouble keeping up:</p>
<p><img src="https://effectivetypescript.com/images/sluggish-ts-comment-with-user.gif" with="636" height="488" alt="A type error appearing and disappearing slowly after changing an import"/></p><p>These performance issues impact your moment-to-moment experience of TypeScript: did that red squiggle go away because I fixed the error, or because I&#39;m waiting for <code>tsserver</code> to catch up? They&#39;re also hard to isolate for a bug report. If <code>tsc</code> is slow, I can point the TS team at my repo and report how long <code>tsc</code> takes to run. But to reproduce language server issues, you have to open a repo in your editor and then perform a particular action. It&#39;s not automated. And performance is inconsistent since it depends on caching.</p>
<p>So for 2023, I&#39;d love to see a faster <code>tsserver</code>. Maybe we should rewrite that in Rust, too!</p>
<h2 id="A-typed-pipe"><a href="#A-typed-pipe" title="A typed pipe"></a>A typed <code>pipe</code></h2><p>When you compose several functions:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code>f(g(h(x)))<br/></code></pre></div></figure>

<p>the functions are run in the right-to-left order: first <code>h</code> then <code>g</code> then <code>f</code>. This is counter to how code typically executes: top to bottom, left to right.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator&#39;, event);">pipeline proposal</a> aims to offer a more readable alternative by introducing a new operator, <code>|&gt;</code>:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code>x</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator&#39;, event);">proposal page</a> has lots of great material about why this is a good idea and is well worth reading. Unfortunately, though, there are two competing operator proposals and I don&#39;t anticipate this making it into JavaScript (and hence TypeScript) anytime soon. Axel Rauschmayer&#39;s blog has a good writeup on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://2ality.com/2022/01/pipe-operator.html" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://2ality.com/2022/01/pipe-operator.html&#39;, event);">current state of things</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an alternative, though: we can implement a function (commonly called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ramdajs.com/docs/#pipe" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://ramdajs.com/docs/#pipe&#39;, event);"><code>pipe</code></a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flow" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flow&#39;, event);"><code>flow</code></a> in lodash) that composes the functions in the order we expect:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> square = <span>(<span>n: <span>number</span></span>) =&gt;</span> n ** <span>2</span>;</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>Here <code>square</code> is applied first, then <code>add1</code>, then <code>halve</code> and finally <code>String</code> to convert the number to a <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>This solves the pipelining problem nicely but it has a problem: it&#39;s impossible to type. For details, see this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/39094#issuecomment-647042984" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/39094#issuecomment-647042984&#39;, event);">Anders comment</a>. The issue is that there needs to be a relationship between each of the arguments to <code>pipe</code>: the parameter type of each argument needs to match the return type of the previous one. And this just can&#39;t be modeled with TS.</p>
<p>The lodash and Ramda typings resort to the classic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/#:~:text=like%20to%20call%20%E2%80%9C-,death%20by%20a%20thousand%20overloads,-%E2%80%9D%2C%20and%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/#:~:text=like%20to%20call%20%E2%80%9C-,death%20by%20a%20thousand%20overloads,-%E2%80%9D%2C%20and%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t&#39;, event);">&#34;death by a thousand overloads&#34;</a> solution: define safe versions for a small number of arguments (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/266cf9b006800a1de3836257443920b828c2e589/types/lodash/common/util.d.ts#L169-L204" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/266cf9b006800a1de3836257443920b828c2e589/types/lodash/common/util.d.ts#L169-L204&#39;, event);">seven</a> in lodash&#39;s case, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/76ebb1cce06b08cc5ef2f31d718fd84cb9df7cc6/types/ramda/index.d.ts#L1458-L1513" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a typed pipe&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/76ebb1cce06b08cc5ef2f31d718fd84cb9df7cc6/types/ramda/index.d.ts#L1458-L1513&#39;, event);">ten in Ramda&#39;s</a>) and give up on typing larger invocations.</p>
<p>This probably works fine in 99% of cases, but it doesn&#39;t feel right! I&#39;d love to see the TypeScript type system expand to be able to type <code>pipe</code>, or see some form of the pipeline operator proposal adopted.</p>
<h2 id="Records-and-Tuples"><a href="#Records-and-Tuples" title="Records and Tuples"></a>Records and Tuples</h2><p>I&#39;m cheating here since this is more of a JavaScript Christmas wish. But JS is TS, right? The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;records and tuples&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple&#39;, event);">Records and Tuples proposal</a>, currently at Stage 2, seeks to add two new data structures to JavaScript. As the proposal puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This proposal introduces two new deeply immutable data structures to JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Record</code>, a deeply immutable Object-like structure #{ x: 1, y: 2 }</li>
<li><code>Tuple</code>, a deeply immutable Array-like structure #[1, 2, 3, 4]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>TypeScript already has a notion of tuple <em>types</em> (<code>[number, number]</code>). This proposal would add tuple values, which would neatly resolve a number of ambiguities in type inference.</p>
<p>For example, if you write:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> pt = [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>]<br/></code></pre></div></figure>

<p>then what should the type of <code>pt</code> be? It could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tuple type (<code>[number, number]</code>)</li>
<li>a readonly type (<code>readonly [number, number]</code>)</li>
<li>a mutable list (<code>number[]</code>)</li>
<li>an immutable list (<code>readonly number[]</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Without more information, TypeScript has to guess. In this case it infers the mutable list, <code>number[]</code>. You can use a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66993264/what-does-the-as-const-mean-in-typescript-and-what-is-its-use-case" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;records and tuples&#39;, &#39;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66993264/what-does-the-as-const-mean-in-typescript-and-what-is-its-use-case&#39;, event);">const assertion</a> (<code>as const</code>) to get (<code>readonly [number, number]</code>) or a <a href="https://effectivetypescript.com/2020/06/16/typed-identity-functions/">typed identity function</a> to get one of the others.</p>
<p>With this proposal, you&#39;d write:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> pt = #[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>];<br/></code></pre></div></figure>

<p>and it would be unambiguous that you want a tuple type. This is just the tip of the iceberg: functional programming and static typing work much better when you don&#39;t have to worry about mutability (see Item 27 of <em>Effective TypeScript</em>: Use Functional Constructs and Libraries to Help Types Flow).</p>
<p>The other great thing about this proposal is that we&#39;d be able to use <code>===</code> to do structural comparisons between tuples and records:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code>&gt; [1, 2] === [1, 2]</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>The first comparison is <code>false</code> because the two arrays aren&#39;t the same object. Tuples have a more intuitive behavior. There is some risk of the Array / Tuple distinction being confusing, but Python has this and generally it works great.</p>
<p>We&#39;d also be able to use tuples as keys in <code>Set</code> and <code>Map</code> structures. This is top of mind because tuples would have been wildly useful in the Advent of Code this year (see my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://danvdk.medium.com/python-tips-tricks-for-the-advent-of-code-2019-89ec23a595dd#9719" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;records and tuples&#39;, &#39;https://danvdk.medium.com/python-tips-tricks-for-the-advent-of-code-2019-89ec23a595dd#9719&#39;, event);">2020 post</a> about using tuples as <code>dict</code> keys in Python).</p>
<h2 id="Optional-generics"><a href="#Optional-generics" title="Optional generics"></a>Optional generics</h2><p>While building the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/danvk/crosswalk" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;optional generics&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/danvk/crosswalk&#39;, event);">crosswalk</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/danvk/crudely-typed" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;optional generics&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/danvk/crudely-typed&#39;, event);">crudely-typed</a> libraries, I frequently ran into this situation: you have a function that takes several generic arguments, you want the user to provide one of them explicitly, but you want TypeScript to infer the others.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of what this would like:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>makeLookup</span>&lt;<span>T</span>, <span>K</span> <span>extends</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>T</span>&gt;(<span>k: K</span>): (<span>obj: T</span>) =&gt; <span>T</span>[<span>K</span>] </span>{</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>TypeScript doesn&#39;t let you do this.

<p>I wrote about two workarounds back in 2020: <a href="https://effectivetypescript.com/2020/12/04/gentips-1-curry/">Use Classes and Currying to create new inference sites</a>. But these are workarounds. I&#39;d really love to have a way to do this without having to change my API!</p>
<p>The canonical issue for this feature request is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;optional generics&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571&#39;, event);">#10571</a>. There was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/26349" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;optional generics&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/26349&#39;, event);">some work on it in 2018</a> and I put up a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/42388" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;optional generics&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/42388&#39;, event);">proposal</a> two years ago, but it hasn&#39;t seen much attention recently.</p>
<h2 id="quot-Evolving-quot-function-types"><a href="#quot-Evolving-quot-function-types" title="&#34;Evolving&#34; function types"></a>&#34;Evolving&#34; function types</h2><p>TypeScript typically does a great job of inferring function parameter types from whatever context it has:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> squares = [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>].map(<span><span>x</span> =&gt;</span> x ** <span>2</span>);</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>The key point here is that you don&#39;t need to write <code>(x: number) =&gt; x ** 2</code>: TypeScript is able to infer that <code>x</code> is of type <code>number</code> from the types of <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> and the type of <code>Array.prototype.map</code>.</p>
<p>Now try factoring out a <code>square</code> function:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> square = <span><span>x</span> =&gt;</span> x ** <span>2</span>;</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>What worked so well in the first example completely fails here. This code is correct and is a simple refactor of the other code, but TypeScript demands a type annotation here. This is a frequent source of frustration in React components, where factoring out a callback can require writing out some very complex types. I wrote a blog post about this in 2019: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.logrocket.com/how-typescript-breaks-referential-transparency-7a82c0345f2c/" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;quotevolvingquot function types&#39;, &#39;https://blog.logrocket.com/how-typescript-breaks-referential-transparency-7a82c0345f2c/&#39;, event);">How TypeScript breaks referential transparency
…and what to do about it</a>.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t TypeScript infer the type of <code>square</code> (and hence <code>x</code>) from its usage on the next line? Anders is famously skeptical of &#34;spooky action at a distance&#34; where changing code in one place can cause a type to change and produce errors in other places that aren&#39;t obviously related.</p>
<p>But it does have one limited form of this: &#34;evolving <code>any</code>&#34;, which is discussed in <em>Effective TypeScript</em> Item 41: <a href="https://effectivetypescript.com/2020/03/09/evolving-any/">Understand Evolving any</a>. The gist is that TypeScript will sometimes let the type of a symbol change based on subsequent usage:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> out = [];</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>I have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38083" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;quotevolvingquot function types&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38083&#39;, event);">three year old proposal</a> to expand this behavior to local function variables and make the <code>square</code> example valid. React developers around the world don&#39;t know that they want this feature for Christmas, but they do!</p>
<h2 id="ES-Module-clarity"><a href="#ES-Module-clarity" title="ES Module clarity"></a>ES Module clarity</h2><p>The JavaScript world is finally moving to ES modules (<code>import</code> and <code>export</code>). I&#39;ve been blissfully ignoring some of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-7.html#control-over-module-detection" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;es module clarity&#39;, &#39;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-7.html#control-over-module-detection&#39;, event);">changes</a> that Node.js and TypeScript have been making to support them, but I get the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51302" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;es module clarity&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51302&#39;, event);">sense</a> that this is an awkward transition for both of them. Hopefully we&#39;ll be through this by the end of 2023!</p>
<h2 id="A-canonical-types-→-runtime-path"><a href="#A-canonical-types-→-runtime-path" title="A canonical types → runtime path"></a>A canonical types → runtime path</h2><p>One of the keys to really understanding TypeScript is recognizing that TypeScript types don&#39;t exist at runtime. They are <em>erased</em>. This is so fundamental that it&#39;s Item 1 in <em>Effective TypeScript</em> (&#34;Understand the Relationship Between TypeScript and JavaScript&#34;).</p>
<p>But sometimes you really do want access to your TypeScript types at runtime, perhaps to do validation on untrusted inputs. There&#39;s a proliferation of libraries that let you define types in JavaScript and derive TypeScript types from them: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a canonical types  runtime path&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/colinhacks/zod&#39;, event);">zod</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jquense/yup" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a canonical types  runtime path&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/jquense/yup&#39;, event);">yup</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a canonical types  runtime path&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts&#39;, event);">io-ts</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a canonical types  runtime path&#39;, &#39;https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html&#39;, event);">React PropTypes</a> are just a few. Here&#39;s how you&#39;d define a <code>Student</code> type with Zod, for example:</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> Student = z.object({</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>The advantage of defining a type in this way (rather than with a TypeScript <code>interface</code>) is that you can do runtime validation using the <code>Student</code> value (which you cannot do with the <code>Student</code> <em>type</em>):</p>
<figure><div><pre><code><span>const</span> missingAge = Student.parse({<span>name</span>: <span>&#34;Bobby&#34;</span>});</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>I prefer a different approach, though. TypeScript already has a great language for defining types and the relationships between them. Why learn another one? In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/danvk/crosswalk" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a canonical types  runtime path&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/danvk/crosswalk&#39;, event);">crosswalk</a>, I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a canonical types  runtime path&#39;, &#39;https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema&#39;, event);">typescript-json-schema</a> to generate JSON Schema from my TypeScript type declarations. This JSON Schema is used to validate requests and generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.</p>
<p>But again, all these approaches are workarounds for the root issue: there&#39;s no way to get access to a TypeScript type at runtime. I&#39;d love it if there were a canonical solution to this problem, so that we could all use the same solution. Perhaps <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://2ality.com/2022/10/javascript-decorators.html" onclick="return trackOutboundLink(&#39;a canonical types  runtime path&#39;, &#39;https://2ality.com/2022/10/javascript-decorators.html&#39;, event);">decorators</a> can help.</p>
<p>This would be a big change for TypeScript, and would generally go against its design philosophy. So while I have some hope for my other wishes, I have very little hope for this last one.</p>
