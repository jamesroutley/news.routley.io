                        <p>Peter Thiel&#39;s Founders Fund had no cash left in Silicon Valley Bank by Thursday as it began to unravel, Bloomberg reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-11/thiel-s-founders-fund-withdrew-millions-from-silicon-valley-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">A source told Bloomberg</a> the PayPal cofounder&#39;s fund had moved to close its exposure to the failing bank after running into problems using SVB&#39;s services.</p><p>The venture capital group had been engaging in a &#34;capital call&#34; — where it asked investment partners to send funds to invest in a company  — by transferring funds to its Silicon Valley Bank account. However, the funds didn&#39;t immediately go through as expected. </p><p>Following the withdrawals, the fund no longer had any exposure to SVB as of Thursday morning, the unnamed source told Bloomberg. It wasn&#39;t clear whether the transfers happened on that day, or earlier. </p>

                        <p>Thiel&#39;s Founders Fund is thought to have propped up several startups that banked with SVB, which provided banking for nearly half of all US venture-backed startups, <a href="https://www.svb.com/venture-funded" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">per its website</a>. The fund had also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/svb-european-vcs-urge-portcos-pull-funds-from-troubled-lender-2023-3" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">called for its startups</a> to withdraw their funds from the bank as well.  </p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-10/some-vcs-see-supporting-silicon-valley-bank-as-act-of-loyalty" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">Bloomberg reported</a> that VC funds Coatue Management, Union Square Ventures, and Founder Collective had all told their portfolio companies to pull their funds from SVB. </p><p>Founders Fund and SVB didn&#39;t immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider, made outside normal working hours.</p>
