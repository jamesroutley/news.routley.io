    <h1>Apple, fix my keyboard before the timer ends or I&#39;m leaving iPhone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        Deadline: end of WWDC 2026. The exact dates haven&#39;t been announced yet
        and this timer is based on the estimated schedule (June 9–13).
        I&#39;ll update it when Apple confirms the dates. They have until the
        conference ends.

          The iOS keyboard has been broken since at least iOS 17 and it&#39;s
          somehow only gotten worse. iOS 26 has been my breaking point.
          Autocorrect is nearly useless and often hostile, that part I&#39;m used
          to. But now the correctly tapped letters aren&#39;t even registering
          correctly.

        <div>
          <p><strong>My Keyboard Grievances</strong></p><ul>
            <li>Autocorrect fails to correct minor mistakes</li>
            <li>Autocorrect &#34;correcting&#34; a mistake with another mistake</li>
            <li>Autocorrect &#34;correcting&#34; correctly typed words</li>
            <li>Swipe to type is painfully behind Gboard (third-party keyboards are universally under-supported and inferior to Android equivalents)</li>
            <li>&#34;Select All&#34; is often hidden away</li>
            <li>Selecting text in general is a pain</li>
            <li>Keyboard seems to run out of steam after hitting an arbitrary word count in apps like Notes or iMessage and takes forever to register taps</li>
            <li>Key taps register incorrectly: clearly tapping one letter but a different letter is entered (hot spots poorly calibrated), or a correctly tapped letter (keyboard highlight confirms it) but an incorrect letter is rendered</li>
          </ul>

          iOS has bugs across the whole ecosystem. But having the keyboard,
          the thing I interact with hundreds of times a day on my primary
          device, get progressively worse with every update is absolutely
          maddening.
        </p>

          I randomly tried Android again for a few months last spring. Using a
          functioning keyboard was revelatory. But I came crawling back to iOS
          because I&#39;m weak and the orange iPhone was pretty and the Pixel 10
          was boring and I caved to the blue bubble pressure. But the keyboard
          on this beautiful phone is worse than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here&#39;s the deal, Apple, if that&#39;s even your real name: fix this
          broken keyboard, or at the very least <strong>publicly
          acknowledge</strong> it&#39;s broken and commit to fixing it in iOS 27
          or earlier. If that countdown hits zero without either of those
          things happening, I&#39;m switching to Android for good. (Good = at
          least 2 calendar years)

          I know losing one customer means absolutely nothing to your bottom
          line. But I&#39;d like to think it should mean something to the
          engineers, UX designers, product people, and whoever else had a hand
          in building this thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were the &#34;it just works&#34; company. Now you&#39;re just a fruit that
          I used to know.
