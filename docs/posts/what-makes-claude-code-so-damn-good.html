    <h1>What makes Claude Code so damn good</h1>

Not only does it make targeted edits or vibe coding throwaway tools less annoying, using Claude Code makes me happy. It has enough autonomy to do interesting things, while not inducing a jarring loss of control like some other tools do. Of course most of the heavy lifting is done by the new Claude 4 model (especially interleaved thinking). But I find Claude Code objectively less annoying to use compared to Cursor, or Github Copilot agents even with the same underlying model! What makes it so damn good? If you&#39;re reading this and nodding along, I&#39;m going to try and provide some answers.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is not a blogpost with Claude Code&#39;s architecture dump (there are some good ones out there). This blogpost is meant to be a guide for building delightful LLM agents, based on my own experience using and tinkering with Claude Code over the last few months (and all the logs we intercepted and analyzed). You can find <a href="#appendix">prompts</a> and <a href="#appendix">tools</a> in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix section</a>. This post is ~2k words long, so strap in! If you&#39;re looking for some quick takeaways, the <a href="#how-to-build-a-claude-code-like-agent-tldr">TL;DR</a> section is a good place to start.</p>
