    <h1>Week 5: Generation EX</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last week, </span><strong>I promised I’d talk some about code generation in Phoenix</strong><span>, and specifically, </span><strong>in the context of making model objects</strong><span> for my app. And I’m happy to say that </span><strong>it worked out! Eventually.</strong></p><p><span>I started by trying to </span><strong>pair with another Recurser on Phoenix code generation</strong><span> using </span><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">phx.gen</a><span>. But I quickly realized that, when I was poking around in there, </span><strong>there were too many concepts I didn’t understand</strong><span>, like </span><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Context.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">contexts</a><span> and </span><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Schema.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">schemas</a><span> (at least, how schemas work in Elixir). So I took an unusual step for me: last weekend, </span><strong><span>I blocked off a few hours, started with the </span><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/directory_structure.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">first official Phoenix guide</a><span>, and then read it and all the other guides after that one.</span></strong></p><p><strong>It turned out to be </strong><em><strong>really</strong></em><strong> useful.</strong><span> So many half-understood things, where I poked around docs online and put something into my app that I only kind of understood, became clear as I read the docs, and many things I didn’t even knew existed were revealed. Overall, this taught me </span><strong>a really important point for the future</strong><span>: </span><strong>if I know a piece of coding technology</strong><span> (framework, language, database, whatever) </span><strong>may be significantly different</strong><span> from other technologies I’ve used, </span><strong>I need to read a decently long tutorial on it before using it</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Actually, </span><strong>this is what I normally do, but in the interest of trying something different</strong><span> in the spirit of Recurse (and internally saying to myself “can this web framework be THAT different from all the other web frameworks I’ve used?”, heh), </span><strong>I tried diving in after a little bit of reading</strong><span>. Note to self: </span><strong>don’t do that again</strong><span>!</span></p><p><span>(As an aside, it’s important to say that, for sustainability (both for me and for my partner), </span><strong>it’s important to me not to take too many weekend / after-hours excursions</strong><span> like reading the docs was. It was very useful this one time, but I know making it a habit will turn out badly for me in the program, personally.)</span></p><p><span>Armed with the knowledge from the guides, </span><strong>I paired again today with a Recurser</strong><span>, </span><strong>and it went very well</strong><span>! They were very helpful in pointing out lots of bugs and logic errors I was making, and they were especially awesome in discovering embedded schemas for me, because that was just what I needed right now: models without backing database tables.</span></p><p><strong>And we got a backing model working!</strong><span> Check it out:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png" width="1456" height="421" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:421,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:193952,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514072cc-e9c1-472b-8db3-4a99e3fba47b_3744x1082.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Still looks mostly the same</strong><span>, right? But this time, it’s using (mostly) the default HTML generated by Phoenix, and most importantly, </span><strong>it’s using the built-in data model</strong><span>! So it’s a lot nicer on the backend.</span></p><p><span>Now </span><strong>I need to get some other data members from the API into the model and display them in a nice way</strong><span>. Also, there’s a few other cleanups I’d like to do to make my app more Phoenix-y on the backend.</span></p><p><span>Next week, </span><strong>I hope I can show you a lot nicer model on the screen</strong><span>, in preparation for making my app look pretty!</span></p><p><span>PS: </span><strong><span>Look out for a post sometime soon on </span><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/pattern-matching.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Elixir’s pattern matching</a></strong><span>, because I finally realized how powerful </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">pattern matching</a><span> is in the context of Elixir. I’ve showed it to a few other Recursers already and they all seemed pretty impressed by the concept too, so I’m excited to show it off to you all in the near future!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
