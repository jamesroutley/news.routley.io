    <h1>Fruits and vegetables are less nutritious than they used to be</h1>

Mounting evidence shows that many fruits, vegetables, and grains grown today carry fewer nutrients than those grown decades ago. This trend means that “what our grandparents ate was healthier than what we’re eating today,” says Kristie Ebi, an expert in climate change and health at the University of Washington in Seattle. But studies have shown that changing farming methods can reverse these nutrient declines. Produce cultivated on farms that embrace regenerative farming practices is more nutritious.</span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
