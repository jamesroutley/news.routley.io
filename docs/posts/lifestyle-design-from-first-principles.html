<p>
Few truths are self-evident. To start from zero, choose independently-verifiable axioms.</p>
<p>
Few truths are useful. Philosophy is generally impractical.</p>
<p>
Two premises seem obvious and useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Premise 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering-focused_ethics">suffering is bad</a> <ul>
<li>
<a href="#survive"><strong>survive:</strong></a> prevent yourself from immediate suffering </li>
<li>
<a href="#live"><strong>live:</strong></a> prevent yourself from future suffering </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Premise 2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">consciousness exists</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics">entropy exists</a>; attention is scarce <ul>
<li>
<a href="#thrive"><strong>thrive:</strong></a> maximize attention </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="survive">
1. Survive</h2>
<p>
Don’t suffer. Thirst, hunger, sickness, cold, fatigue, etc. are not mysterious forces.</p>
<h2 id="live">
2. Live</h2>
<p>
To continue living, maintain your body and mind for as long as possible.</p>
<h3>
Sustain Your Body</h3>
<p>
Health sciences are complex.
It can take a lifetime to master biology, chemistry, and nutrition.
In the beginning, use simple heuristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
What traits do healthy people have in common? </li>
<li>
What traits do unhealthy people have in common? </li>
</ul>
<p>
Consensus favors the following advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
drink a moderate amount of water </li>
<li>
eat a moderate amount of nutritious foods </li>
<li>
sleep plenty </li>
<li>
regulate body temperature </li>
<li>
exercise often </li>
</ul>
<p>
Most people earn money to procure food, water, and housing.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://taylor.town/make-money">Convincing others to give you money</a> can be difficult.
Finance isn’t friendly.
Much like health, use simple heuristics to strategize wealth accumulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
What traits do wealthy people have in common? </li>
<li>
What traits do poor people have in common? </li>
</ul>
<h3>
Don’t Diverge</h3>
<p>
To make living easy, align yourself with reality.
Many problems are fabricated when your mind diverges from the world around you.</p>
<p>
You can independently verify your software bugs by studying your mind.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">Your experience exists</a>, but do you control it?
Sit idly and focus on your breath – what can you observe about yourself?</p>
<p>
Your brain is plastic.
Many errant thought patterns can be corrected through observation and practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>
mistaking sensory input for reality </li>
<li>
maintaining unproductive emotions </li>
<li>
obsessing over trifles </li>
<li>
hallucinating facts </li>
<li>
ignoring biases </li>
</ul>
<p>
To supercharge self-observations, probe others.
Engage in deep conversations.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">Assume others exist.</a>
Pretend like everybody experiences your same range of pain and pleasure.</p>
<h2 id="thrive">
3. Thrive</h2>

<p>
Life is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map–territory_relation">mapless territory</a>.
You are a faulty compass.</p>
<p>
Many people peddle maps for the mapless territory.
Few worldviews produce any consistent effect.
Simple heuristics fail at this level.</p>
<p>
Maps may not be suitable, but your mind guides your body like a magnet suspended in fluid.
Consciousness is a clunky compass.</p>
<h3>
Attention &amp; Happiness</h3>
<p>
You are finite.</p>
<p>
To maximize your remaining experience, optimize the two largest levers in your mind: attention &amp; happiness.</p>

<h3>
Euphoric Twilights</h3>
<p>
Pursue balance.
Unconscious bliss is pointless; neutral focus is boring.</p>
<p>
Drugs enable you to sacrifice attention for happiness.
Would you choose to live in a euphoric ketamine/fentanyl twilight?
Would you prefer to be dimly aware but incredibly happy?</p>
<p>
True happiness demands <em>awareness of</em> happiness.</p>
<h3>
Attention</h3>
<p>
Attention is the act of spending consciousness.</p>
<p>
But attention varies in quality.
Observe your mind driving, sleeping, cooking, watching television, writing, doing math homework, etc.</p>
<h3>
Delights</h3>
<p>
Human compasses tend toward <a href="https://taylor.town/delights">delights</a>.
Nobody chooses their interests; delights are unique and unexplainable.
Avoid self-destructive delights to extend your healthspan.</p>
<p>
To find delights, follow your attention. </p>
<p>
Focus on fun.</p>
