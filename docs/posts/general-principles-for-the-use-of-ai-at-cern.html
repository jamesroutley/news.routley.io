    <h1>General principles for the use of AI at CERN</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can be found at CERN in many contexts: embedded in devices, software products and cloud services procured by CERN, brought on-site by individuals or developed in-house.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="http://alok.github.io/news/opinion/knowledge-sharing/why-we-need-cern-wide-ai-strategy">approval of a CERN-wide AI strategy</a>, these general principles are designed to promote the responsible and ethical use, development and deployment (collectively “use”) of AI at CERN.</p>

<p>They are technology neutral and apply to all AI technologies as they become available.</p>

<p>The principles apply across all areas of CERN’s activities, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>AI for scientific and technical research</strong>: data analysis, anomaly detection, simulation, predictive maintenance and optimisation of accelerator performance or detector operations, and</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>AI for productivity and administrative use</strong>: document drafting, note taking, automated translation, language correction and enhancement, coding assistants, and workflow automation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General Principles  </strong></p>

<p>CERN, members of its personnel, and anyone using CERN computing facilities shall ensure that AI is used in accordance with the following principles:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Transparency and explainability</strong>: Document and communicate when and how AI is used, and how AI contributes to specific tasks or decisions.</li>
	<li><strong>Responsibility and accountability</strong>: The use of AI, including its impact and resulting outputs throughout its lifecycle, must not displace ultimate human responsibility and accountability.  </li>
	<li><strong>Lawfulness and conduct</strong>: The use of AI must be lawful, compliant with CERN’s internal legal framework and respect third-party rights and CERN’s Code of Conduct.</li>
	<li><strong>Fairness, non-discrimination, and “do no harm”</strong>: AI must be used in a way that promotes fairness and inclusiveness and prevents bias, discrimination and any other form of harm.</li>
	<li><strong>Security and safety</strong>: AI must be adequately protected to reduce the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents. AI must be used in a way that is safe, respects confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements, and prevents negative outcomes. </li>
	<li><strong>Sustainability</strong>: The use of AI must be assessed with the goal of mitigating environmental and social risks and enhancing CERN&#39;s positive impact in relation to society and the environment.</li>
	<li><strong>Human oversight</strong>: The use of AI must always remain under human control. Its functioning and outputs must be consistently and critically assessed and validated by a human. </li>
	<li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: AI must be used in a manner that respects privacy and the protection of personal data.</li>
	<li><strong>Non-military purposes</strong>: Any use of AI at CERN must be for non-military purposes only.</li>
</ol>
