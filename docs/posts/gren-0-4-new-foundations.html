    <h1>Gren 0.4: New Foundations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><header><h2>Gren 0.4: New foundations</h2><small>Published: 2024-06-24</small></header><p><i>Gren is a pure functional programmming language that aims to be easy to learn and to reason about, while remaining powerful and portable enough for real-world use.</i></p><p>The core packages have been updated with new functionality and quality-of-life improvements. The compiler has started its transition from Haskell to Gren. The book has seen a face lift, and Zulip has been replaced by Discord.</p><p>Interested? Let&#39;s dig in.</p><h2>New filesystem API</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwLP6WVLJWU"><img alt="Robin demonstrates the new FileSystem API" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/fwLP6WVLJWU/0.jpg"/></a></p><p>The FileSystem API was functional, but minimal. It has been replaced by three new modules: <code>FileSystem</code>, <code>FileSystem.FileHandle</code> and <code>FileSystem.Path</code>.</p><ul><li><code>FileSystem</code> contains functions for working with the file system.</li><li><code>FileSystem.FileHandle</code> allows you to open a file, perform several operations on it and then close it again.</li><li><code>FileSystem.Path</code> gives you a statically typed, cross-platform, representation of a file system path.</li></ul><p>Together, these modules give you access to most of the file system operations available in NodeJS.</p><p>If you want more information about the new FileSystem API, be sure to watch the video linked above.</p><h2>Gren-in-Gren</h2><p>This release contains the first few lines of what will eventually be a ground-up rewrite of the compiler in Gren. While
it currently does little more than downloading and executing the Haskell-based compiler, it will eventually enable the
use of compiler functionality (parsing, type checking, formatting) in Gren applications.</p><p>There are also several indirect benefits of the Gren-in-Gren rewrite, like lowering the barrier of contributing to the
compiler, and improving the quality of the Gren core packages by virtue of compiler authors now also being Gren-developers.</p><p>In fact, the mentioned rewrite of the FileSystem API is a direct consequence of the compiler needing more functionality
than what was previously available.</p><p>We&#39;ll talk more about the importance of Gren-in-Gren at a later time.</p><h2>The book has received a face lift</h2><p>Justin Blake has contributed big changes to <a href="https://gren-lang.org/book">the book</a>, which serves as our language guide.</p><p>Not only has he filled in empty chapters and added a few new ones, he&#39;s also replaced the generator with Astro Starlight.
One of the biggest consequences of this change is that you can now search for topics of interest.</p><h2>We&#39;ve moved to Discord</h2><p>Since the very first release of Gren we&#39;ve been using Zulip to coordinate development of the language. Over time we&#39;ve received feedback
that Zulip might not have been the best choice. Many people feel that they&#39;re drowning in communication platforms, so the bar for joining
yet another platform is pretty high.</p><p>While our experience with Zulip has been good, the future success of Gren depends on an active community.
Using the best tool means nothing if we&#39;re using it alone.</p><p>We&#39;ve now decided to use <a href="https://discord.gg/J8aaGMfz">Discord</a> for discussing and sharing all things related to Gren. Why don&#39;t you join us?</p><h2>Misc. changes</h2><ul><li>Using multi-line string syntax for a single-line string is now a compile error.</li><li>If the <code>NO_COLOR</code> environment variable is set, color will be stripped from the compiler output.</li><li><code>Stream.sendX</code> and <code>Node.exit</code> functions are now <code>Task</code>-based. This makes them easier to compose with other <code>Task</code>s.</li><li>You now have access to the location of the current executing program.</li><li>You can now set the title of the currently running process.</li><li>Removed <code>always</code>, use anonymous functions instead.</li><li><code>Bytes</code> now have convenience functions for converting between <code>Bytes</code> and <code>String</code>.</li><li><code>Bytes.join</code> allow you to build <code>Bytes</code> from <code>Array Bytes</code>. Useful when retrieving several <code>Bytes</code> from <code>HttpClient</code>.</li><li>Performance improvements of several <code>Array</code> functions.</li><li>Added <code>Array.indexedFold</code>.</li><li>Added several new functions to <code>Dict</code> and <code>Set</code>.</li><li>Removed <code>Dict.fromArray</code>. Use a pipeline of <code>Dict.set</code>, or <code>Dict.set</code> in a <code>fold</code>.</li><li>Added <code>Task.execute</code> to run a <code>Task</code> without triggering a message to your application&#39;s <code>update</code> function.</li><li>Added <code>Task.await</code> for imperative-style composition of <code>Task</code>s.</li></ul><h2>Thank you, contributors</h2><p>This release was made possible through contributions from the following people:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/CharlonTank">CharlonTank</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Gauteab">Gaute Berge</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/blaix">Justin Blake</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/pushfoo">pushfoo</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/revathskumar">Revath S Kumar</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robinheghan">Robin Heggelund Hansen</a></li></ul></section></div>
