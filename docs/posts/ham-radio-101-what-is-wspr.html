<p>Let’s start with the basics:</p>



<ul>
<li>WSPR stands for Weak Signal Propagation Reporter—a protocol implemented in a computer program used for weak-signal radio communication between hams.</li>



<li>It lets users send and receive low-power transmissions for testing MF and HF propagation paths.</li>



<li>Pronounced “whisper,” WSPR was designed and written initially by Nobel Prize winner and <strong><a href="https://www.onallbands.com/category/technical-articles/ft8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT8</a></strong> creator Joe Taylor, K1JT.</li>



<li>The software code is now open source and updated by a small team.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve wondered if a band is open, WSPR can tell you.</p>

<p>As noted by Joe Taylor, K1JT, and Bruce Walker, W1BW, in their November 2010 <em>QST</em> article, “<strong><a href="https://www.arrl.org/files/file/History/History%20of%20QST%20Volume%201%20-%20Technology/QS11-2010-Taylor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSPRing Around the World</a></strong>,” WSPR transmits and receives but does not support normal types of on-the-air conversation. It sends and receives specially coded, beacon-like transmissions which establish whether particular propagation paths are open. Transmissions convey a callsign, station location, and power level using a compressed data format with strong forward error correction (FEC) and narrow-band, four-tone frequency-shift-keying (FSK).</p>



<p>K1JT notes that FEC greatly improves chances of copy and reduces errors to an extremely low rate. The signal bandwidth is only 6 Hz. Combined with randomized time-sharing, this assures that dozens of WSPR signals can fit into a 200 Hz segment of each amateur band. The WSPR protocol is effective at signal-to-noise ratios as low as -28 dB in a 2500 Hz bandwidth, about 10 to 15 dB below the threshold of audibility. On most bands, typical WSPR power levels are 5W or less (sometimes significantly less).</p>



<p>As the protocol has evolved, enhancements to WSPR have included upgrades in its decoder’s sensitivity, improved ability to handle larger numbers of signals in crowded sub-bands, and better detection of false decodes.</p>



<p>To take advantage of WSPR on the amateur bands, you’ll need a radio (one with USB audio is preferred) and a computer with an Internet connection. As users have pointed out online, you don’t need to transmit. Your system can still report what it hears.</p>



<p>The standard message is &lt;callsign&gt; + &lt;4 character locator&gt; + &lt;dBm transmit power&gt;. For example, “KE8FMJ EM89 37” is a signal from station KE8FMJ in Maidenhead grid cell “EM89,” sending 37 dBm, or about 5.0W.</p>
