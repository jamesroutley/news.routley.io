    <h1>Legal art forgery, for the sake of movies (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Imagine this: You’ve just spent three weeks painstakingly replicating a Picasso painting from scratch—you’ve scrutinized documentation about the artist’s creative process; you’ve practiced his brushstrokes, so your work will look convincing; you’ve even painted in noted preliminary images, then covered them up, because that’s what he did. You’ve toiled over this, all for mere seconds of screen time in a film.</p><p>And then you have to destroy it.</p><p>Such was the case for scenic artist Michael Stockton’s copy of <em>Guernica</em>, in the film <em>Basquiat</em>. Turns out, when you want to feature a famous painting in a movie, you can&#39;t simply slap a poster of a Monet or a Picasso in a frame and yell, “Action!”—nor can you cart the real thing from its space on a museum wall to the set (there’s too much margin for loss or destruction). The task is often a “thorny challenge,” as described by <em>Basquiat</em> production designer Dan Leigh, and it involves a rights-clearance process so time-consuming and detail-oriented, it’s worthy of a department unto itself. And once an image is supplied for use in a film, its disposal is governed by an entirely separate set of rules—<em>Guernica</em>’s being a particularly unique example.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t always this complicated. Prior to the mid-90s, art-image rights were less regulated—until two major copyright lawsuits, for <em>12 Monkeys</em> and <em>The Devil’s Advocate</em>, resulted in major compensation for production studios. “Rights issues are generally more restrictive now than in the past,&#34; explained <em>The Devil’s Advocate</em>’s art director Dennis Bradford. He wasn&#39;t involved in Advocate&#39;s clearance issues or its ensuing consequences, but believes, “Studios are now more risk averse and take a more conservative approach in their policies in general.”</p><p>A painting image’s journey from conception to perception is labyrinthine—and wildly different—from film to film. We discussed the faux <em>Guernica</em>’s rise and demise, behind the scenes of <em>Basquiat</em>, learned about the ancient painting techniques employed on <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em>’s Vermeer reproductions, investigated how the drip paintings were made in <em>Pollock</em>, and discovered how digital technology played a major role in the recreations of <em>The Monuments Men</em>.</p><figure><p><span><p>Jeffrey Wright as Jean-Michel Basquiat in <em>Basquiat.</em></p>

So Jeffrey would go to Julian’s studio, and they would work on the Basquiat, and at the same time, Julian was teaching Jeffrey how to use these things, so he could get Jeffrey really relaxed. So all of those paintings were actually handled and touched and worked on by Julian and Jeffrey and the scenic artist and a couple of times, I drew stuff on there.”</p><p>Schnabel, a noted artist and collector in his own right, also donated many pieces from his own collection. Gary Oldman’s character in the film, Albert Milo, is based on Schnabel, who was a prominent part of the art scene, during Basquiat’s rise to fame, so Milo’s paintings are Schnabel’s own creations, pulled from storage. “There are several Warhol paintings in <em>Basquiat</em>—those are real paintings,” said Leigh. “Julian Schnabel has maintained a very close relationship with the Warhol estate and the Warhol museum in Pittsburgh. And Julian himself owns a significant amount of Warhol paintings. Any of the Warhols in the film—I believe—all of the Warhols were owned by Julian.”</p><p>One particular special exception was made thanks to Schnabel’s personal connection to an artist’s estate: the use of Picasso’s <em>Guernica</em>. “It’s so large and at the time the movie was being made, it couldn&#39;t really be a print—Julian wanted it to be a painting,” said Leigh. “And the Picasso family, or the estate, had never had a request to reproduce, to copy a painting in paint—that’s a big deal! That’s basically a forgery.”</p><p>“Eventually . . . the deal that was struck is that we would be allowed to make one copy of Guernica in paint for use in the film, but it had to be destroyed after it was filmed, and we had to document the destruction, and the documentation had to be given to the Picasso estate.”</p><p>The task fell to scenic artist Michael Stockton, who made the piece from scratch. “He worked basically in the same steps and stages that Picasso worked in,” said Leigh. “I think he worked on that for probably two to three weeks.” Leigh added, “We left a few small things undone on purpose, because we knew that when we got there to shoot that day, Julian would want to put paint on the canvas himself. I remember Julian looked at it and said, ‘That&#39;s not <em>Guernica</em>, that&#39;s a sketch for <em>Guernica</em>—give me paint!’”</p><p>The aforementioned destruction, as detailed in the contract from the Picasso estate, was no small feat. “We basically took all of our garbage paint and dumped it in a big barrel, mixed it up and we ended up with this dark gray glop,” said Leigh. “And with a very heavy roller, he rolled paint onto the face of the canvas, and while the paint was wet, it was folded in a way so that there was absolutely no way that somebody could unfold it and restore the painting. All of that was done in cuts of video, and then the video was sent to the Picasso estate, so they were aware that the forgery had been completely trashed.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><figure><p><span><p>Scarlett Johansson in <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring.</em></p>
</span><span>By Jaap Buitendijk/© Pathe Distribution Ltd/Photofest.</span></p></figure><p><em><strong>Girl with a Pearl Earring</strong></em></p><p>The 2003 portrayal of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer’s (played by Colin Firth) struggle to create his most famous piece required intense coordination on the part of production designer Ben van Os, art director <a data-offer-url="http://christinaschaffer.eu/%22%20http://christinaschaffer.eu/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://christinaschaffer.eu/%22%20http://christinaschaffer.eu/&#34;}" href="http://christinaschaffer.eu/%22%20http://christinaschaffer.eu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Christina Schaffer</a>, and set designer <a data-offer-url="http://vanhulzen.com/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://vanhulzen.com/&#34;}" href="http://vanhulzen.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Todd van Hulzen</a>. “Ben was very, very precise about what he liked and why,” explained Schaffer. “He was a real art lover and to the point on historic styles.” Van Hulzen had been a protégé of van Os’s for many years, and the duo then brought on Licia Zappatore, a restaurateur familiar with ancient painting techniques.</p><p>Zappatore oversaw training Firth to look convincing as a painter (though van Hulzen’s hand often doubled as Firth’s in the film), and van Os and van Hulzen visited a pigment mill in the Netherlands to research pigment grinding from the period, which they then taught to Scarlett Johansson, who plays Vermeer’s assistant and the subject of the titular painting. The team was tasked with creating 75 painting reproductions, which they first attempted to outsource to artists in China, to disastrous effect. In one reproduction, <em>The Girl with a Wineglass</em>, “They re-painted her to not have the expression, kind of the drunk look, and they kind of orientalized her face,” said van Hulzen. “And then in another one they even added nail polish to the girl in the painting! And they didn’t get the perspectives right.”</p><p>“The impression people have is that a painting has to have the texturality of a real painting to look convincing on film, but in fact, film is incredibly forgiving when it comes to flat work,” explained van Hulzen. “What the camera&#39;s going to notice is the larger sheen—the reflection of the whole piece in a doorway or in the light.” The paintings began with digital printouts, but Zappatore developed the winning technique for re-surfacing and texturizing them for the camera, which involved affixing paper reproductions to untreated canvas, with homemade animal-skin glue. “We went to a printer, and we had these large-scale prints made,” said van Hulzen. “And then after she [Zappatore] pasted it down, she’d iron it in . . . and then we shellacked them, with this handmade shellac. It was the best solution for most of the paintings in the collection.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The finished film only shows the infamous <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> upon completion (that shot, in fact, is of the real painting—used with permission from the Mauritshuis Museum), but the team had created various versions, “From raw canvas, to drawing, to filled-in blocks of color, to the first stages of working it out,” said van Hulzen. “We also had different stages where he decides that it&#39;s not working out without the turban. In the end, they decided not to use any of those to create the mystery around the painting.” Once production was completed, the paintings were property of the studio and were placed into storage.</p><figure><p><span><p>Ed Harris as Jackson Pollock in <em>Pollock</em></p>
</span><span>From Moviestore Collection/Rex/REX USA.</span></p></figure><p><em><strong>Pollock</strong></em></p><p>In the case of director and star Ed Harris’s 2000 production, two things were essential: cooperation from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation estate, and staffing a talented team of scenics to create the film’s drip paintings. The image rights for Pollock and his wife, Lee Krasner, were negotiated together at the outset, and the estate allowed the production to reproduce just about anything from their catalogue. Many of Pollock’s infamous drip paintings were crafted in four or five stages, to illustrate the process of Harris painting them live on camera.</p><p>Unlike other productions, where an image is first affixed to a canvas and then paint is applied on top, a Pollock needs to be started from scratch. “There’s too many layers,” explained the film’s fine art coordinator Alexandra Tager, who went on to create <a data-offer-url="http://www.availableart.com/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://www.availableart.com/&#34;}" href="http://www.availableart.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Available Art</a>, after her experience on <em>Pollock</em>, to fulfill the growing need for cleared art in productions.</p><p>“There had been discussions about digital reproduction, which was a much newer idea back then,” said the film’s production designer, Mark Friedberg. “There was also talk about hiring specific re-creators. All of that was about getting the graphic part of Pollock’s paintings right, but it didn’t capture the energy. They were dead. My suggestion was that we look at the paintings and figure out how they were made. What colors, in what order, etc. Then we hired some of New York’s best scenic artists and we all watched the [Hans] Namuth films, looked at research about the implements he used—sticks and brushes, etc.—and figured out what music he listened to. Based on that, we commenced to re-create the paintings.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The scenic team created upward of 125 pieces, and often worked next to a Museum of Modern Art show catalogue, as reference. “It was sort of a miracle, the way they were able to capture the essence and the colors of the existing drip paintings,” said Tager. “There was no attempt to copy color for color, drip for drip—they didn&#39;t attempt to make a copy like that. They would have a canvas on the floor, as Pollock did, by standing above it and throwing paint.”</p><figure><p><span>By Claudette Barius/© 2013 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.</span></p></figure><p><em><strong>The Monuments Men</strong></em></p><p>The 2014 film required thousands of physical art pieces to populate cavernous sets, which called for a heavy dose of movie magic. “What was more important than the art itself was the frame,” explained <em>The Monuments Men</em> production designer James D. Bissell. “When you looked into this large cache of art and saw frame after frame stacked up—you needed good quality frames to imply there was wonderful art associated with it.” Much of the background decoration consisted of cleared art, borrowed from London vendors and other film productions, and the frames were reproduced using foam casts, then stacked against each other.</p><p>Such an undertaking would’ve been incredibly time-consuming without the use digital technology. “Most high-quality historically significant art is very well documented these days,” said Bissell. “They have beautiful digital files on all of them, which is what we availed ourselves of, and used the high resolution digital files to reprint them and then we did of course all kinds of glazes over the top that were hand-applied and hand-etched to create cracklature and all of the effects of age.”</p><p>The largest hurdle for Bissell and his team was reproducing the prominently featured <em>Ghent Altarpiece</em>. “There were a couple of things that were really technical that we had to overcome,” explained Bissell. “We had to find the right materials, especially for the <em>Ghent Altarpiece</em>, which was painted on boards. We obviously took the digital file, which shows the effect of the wood coming through the surface in some places, and we had to re-create from the original the actual framing. When you look at the painting surface, the digital print is right on wood, and the way that it&#39;s affixed was of critical importance, because then when we put the over-glazes on, we did run into some problems with bubbling and things you might expect with interaction between glazes and the printed material and the way it was affixed to the wood.”</p><p>After working out the glitches, Bissell tasked his scenic artists with using fine tools to create cracks and dimensions on the portions that would be featured in close-up, to give it an aged, wood-grain effect. And where is all that hard work housed now? “They went back to Sony,” said Bissell. “Some of those <em>Ghent Altarpiece</em> pieces are really fantastic, and I&#39;d love to have a copy! But, not so lucky!”</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
