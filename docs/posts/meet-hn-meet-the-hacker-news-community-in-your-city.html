    <h1>Show HN: Meet.hn â€“ Meet the Hacker News community in your city</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN!</p><p>I just published <a href="https://meet.hn" rel="nofollow">https://meet.hn</a>, a map to find hackers in your city.</p><p>How it works?</p><p>Demo of the signup process: <a href="https://x.com/meet_hn/status/1834918518904746329" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/meet_hn/status/1834918518904746329</a></p><p>1. Fill the form: username, city+country</p><p>2. Copy the text generated in the box below the form, and paste it in your HN description.</p><p>3. Click &#34;Add me on the map&#34;</p><p>Optionnaly (it&#39;s recommended!) you can add links to your socials as well as some tags to showcase your interests.</p><p>Why does it exist?</p><p>I created this because, despite its harsh reputation on the internet, I love the HN community.
I have fewer than a handful of friends who are as curious and eager to think and reflect as the people on HN.
Also, the city I currently live in is more focused on industry than on technology and entrepreneurship, which are core to HN.</p><p>This led me to want to meet the HN community IRL.
After trying `site:news.ycombinator.com/user toulouse` on Google and getting only one result, I decided to create meet.hn.</p><p>My first goal with this is to meet at least one HN member in my city: Toulouse, France.
If you are ever in the area, hit me up! I&#39;m sirobg at <a href="https://meet.hn/city/fr-Toulouse" rel="nofollow">https://meet.hn/city/fr-Toulouse</a></p><p>Additional details:</p><p>- meet.hn has a twitter page: <a href="https://x.com/meet_hn" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/meet_hn</a>.
