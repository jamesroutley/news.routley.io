                I got a fancy bidet toilet seat. It works fairly well and having
water for washing is great. But I don’t love some details, see notes
below. Mostly I wanted to share how much power the thing uses.

                The tech industry always has a reason why any new laws or regulations are 
bad - indeed, so does any industry. They always say that! The trouble is, 
sometimes it’s true, and some laws are (or would be) disasters. So which is
