    <h1>Why do people keep writing about the imaginary compound Cr2Gr2Te6?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8645973081022379120" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I was reading the latest issue of the journal <em>Science</em>, and a paper mentioned the compound Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>.
For a moment, I thought my knowledge of the periodic table was slipping, since I couldn&#39;t remember the element Gr.
It turns out that <em>Gr</em> was supposed to be <em>Ge</em>, germanium, but that raises two issues.
First, shouldn&#39;t the peer reviewers and proofreaders at a top journal catch this error?
But more curiously, it appears that this formula is a mistake that has been copied around several times.</p>
<p>The <em>Science</em> paper [1] states, &#34;Intrinsic ferromagnetism in these materials was discovered in Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> down to the bilayer and monolayer thickness limit in 2017.&#34;
I checked the referenced paper [2] and verified that the correct compound is Cr<sub>2</sub><strong>Ge</strong><sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>, with Ge for germanium.</p>
<p>But in the process, I found more publications that <em>specifically</em> mention the 2017 discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in both Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub>.
A 2021 paper in <em>Nanoscale</em> [3] says,
&#34;Since the discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in atomically thin Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> in 2017, research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials has become a highlighted topic.&#34;
Then, a 2023 book chaper [4] opens with the abstract: &#34;Since the discovery of intrinsic long-range magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) layered magnets, e.g., Cr<sub>2</sub>Gr<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> in 2017, [...]&#34;</p>
<p>This illustrates how easy it is for a random phrase to get copied around with nobody checking it.
(Earlier, I found a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2019/10/how-special-register-groups-invaded.html">bogus computer definition</a> that has persisted for over 50 years.)
To be sure, these could all be independent typos—it&#39;s an easy typo to make since G<strong>e</strong> and G<strong>r</strong> are neighbors on the keyboard and Cr2Gr2 scans better than Cr2Ge2.
A few other papers [5, 6, 7] have the same typo, but in different contexts.
My bigger concern is that once AI picks up the erroneous formula,
it will propagate as misinformation forever.
I hope that by calling out this error, I can bring an end to it.
In any case, if anyone ends up here after a web search, I can at least confirm that
there isn&#39;t a new element Gr and
the real compound is Cr<sub>2</sub><strong>Ge</strong><sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>, chromium germanium telluride.</p>
