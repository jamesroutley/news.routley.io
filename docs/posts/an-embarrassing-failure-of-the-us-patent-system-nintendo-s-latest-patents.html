<p id="e18f1086-e0a0-4382-8402-f4212a99c750">The last 10 days have brought a string of patent wins for Nintendo. Yesterday, the company was granted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://archive.org/details/12409387" data-url="https://archive.org/details/12409387" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">US patent 12,409,387</a>, a patent covering riding and flying systems similar to those Nintendo has been criticized for claiming in its Palworld lawsuit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/" data-url="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Gamesfray</a>).

It&#39;s a patent on summoning and battling with &#34;sub-characters,&#34; using specific language suggesting it&#39;s based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://serebii.net/scarletviolet/letsgo.shtml" data-url="https://serebii.net/scarletviolet/letsgo.shtml" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Let&#39;s Go! mechanics</a> in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games. Despite its relevance to a conceit in countless games—calling characters to battle enemies for you—it was allowed without any pushback whatsoever from the USPTO, which Sigmon said is essentially unheard of.</p><p>&#34;Like the above case, the reasons for allowance don&#39;t give us even a hint of why it was allowed: the Examiner just paraphrases the claims (after block quoting them) without explaining <em>why </em>the claims are allowed over the prior art,&#34; Sigmon said. &#34;This is extremely unusual and raises a large number of red flags.&#34;</p><p>According to Sigmon, USPTO records show that the allowance of the &#39;397 patent was based on a review of a relatively miniscule number of documents: 16 US patents, seven Japanese patents, and—apparently—one article from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://pokemon.com" data-url="http://pokemon.com" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Pokemon.com</a>.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2aac727e-7e22-4301-ac42-ff1b56914a36"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

But, Sigmon said, &#34;even that doesn&#39;t excuse this quick allowance.&#34;</p><p>&#34;This allowance should not have happened, full stop,&#34; he said.</p><p>On paper, the patent might not seem like a threat to Nintendo&#39;s competitors: The claims as constructed in the &#39;397 outline a very specific sequence of events and inputs, and patent claims must be met word-for-word to be infringed.</p><p>&#34;Pragmatically speaking, though, it&#39;s not impossible to be sued for patent infringement even when a claim infringement argument is weak, and bad patents like this cast a massive shadow on the industry,&#34; Sigmon said.</p><p>For a company at Nintendo&#39;s scale, the claims of the &#39;397 patent don&#39;t need to make for a strong argument that would hold up in court. The threat of a lawsuit can stifle competition well enough on its own when it would cost millions of dollars to defend against.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="6364beec-6fe7-4072-bc4c-d9fe8f5c985a"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

It&#39;s shocking and offensive that they were,&#34; Sigmon said. &#34;The USPTO dropped the ball big time, and it&#39;s going to externalize a lot of uncertainty (and, potentially, litigation cost) onto developers and companies that do not deserve it.&#34;</p><p>Sigmon, who says he&#39;s helped inventors protect their inventions from IP theft perpetrated by major companies, insists that the patent system still has merit. &#34;That&#39;s the kind of thing that patents are meant to do,&#34; he said. &#34;They were not made to allow a big player to game the system, get an overly broad patent that they should have never received in the first place, and then go around bullying would-be competition with the threat of a legally questionable lawsuit.&#34;</p><p>Unfortunately, Nintendo has gained these patents at a moment when the USPTO has made challenging bad patents more difficult. Currently, US patent officials under USPTO Acting Director Coke Morgan Stewart have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ipr-discretionary-denial-rates-at-the-5772745/" data-url="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ipr-discretionary-denial-rates-at-the-5772745/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">refusing to hear a huge number of Inter Partes Review cases</a>—special proceedings in which parties can argue that a patent should never have been granted—for &#34;discretionary&#34; reasons.</p><p>&#34;Realistically, this means that patent validity issues are being relegated to lawsuits: not a good situation, as that often entails millions of dollars in costs and a lot of risk,&#34; Sigmon said. &#34;In practice, this means that bad patents get to fester on the market for longer and provide a bigger threat for the industry as a whole.&#34;</p>
