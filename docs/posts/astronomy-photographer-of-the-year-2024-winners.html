            <p>&#34;It’s very challenging to create this sort of composition without tipping the balance in favour of either foreground or background. Here, the grass and central rock retain wonderful detail, as do the midground mountains, but the vibrance and detail in the cosmic background shine through as well. </p><p>&#34;Even the airglow adds to the image, which is no easy feat! As well as being technically impressive, the balance also produces a sort of surreal quality. A slightly dream-like connection between the Earth-bound and the celestial.&#34;</p><p>– Ed Bloomer, competition judge</p><p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/skyscapes-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="144ebd7a-1f52-4905-affd-4eaa7e2fb0b9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Skyscapes 2024 – Astronomy Photographer of the Year" data-gtm-name="CTA" data-gtm-detail="formatted content">See the full Skyscapes shortlist</a></p>

            <p>&#34;Galaxies are among the most amazing phenomena you can observe with a telescope. Each is unique, but some are more special than others. Centaurus A is one of the most extraordinary of its kind, and this image certainly stands out among galaxy photos. Thanks to accurate photon collection, precise image processing and cooperation between fellow astrophotographers, a photo taken on a challenging expedition has become one of the best captures of this object to date.&#34;</p><p>– László Francsics, competition judge</p><p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/galaxies-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6afa0eb3-4926-4ec9-9dce-41a80bb8e208" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Galaxies 2024 - Astronomy Photographer of the Year" data-gtm-name="CTA" data-gtm-detail="formatted content">See the full Galaxies shortlist</a></p>

Sinus Iridum, known as the &#39;Bay of Rainbows&#39;, is about 260 km in diameter and is bordered by several smaller craters, showcasing the Moon’s rugged terrain.</p><p>&#34;The detailed capture of Pythagoras, noted for its depth and complex features, is enhanced by the phenomenon of libration, where slight oscillations in the Moon’s orientation allow Earth-bound observers a glimpse of areas typically hidden from view. This image not only highlights the capabilities of modern astrophotography equipment but also offers a vivid illustration of lunar surface features, contributing valuable insights into lunar geology.&#34;</p><p>– Yuri Beletsky, competition judge</p><p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/our-moon-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="87bb24ef-6d32-4c1f-8e29-4f969533135c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Our Moon 2024 - Astronomy Photographer of the Year" data-gtm-name="CTA" data-gtm-detail="formatted content">See the full Our Moon shortlist</a></p>

            <p>&#34;This extraordinary panoramic image captures an aurora with rare red and pink hues over New Zealand. This is a phenomenon typically seen near the poles but appears here due to intense solar activity. The vivid red colours are produced at high altitudes when charged particles from solar flares and coronal mass ejections interact with oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. </p><p>&#34;Red aurorae are less common than green ones, which occur at lower altitudes where there is more oxygen to interact with and a higher density of atoms. This makes the observation more unique and special; an event typically associated with significant solar activity and usually only visible under clear, dark sky conditions.&#34;</p><p>– Yuri Beletsky, competition judge</p><p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/aurorae-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5015161-7fe5-4911-b5b0-06d2f5c94be0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Aurorae 2024 – Astronomy Photographer of the Year" data-gtm-name="CTA" data-gtm-detail="formatted content">See the full Aurorae shortlist</a></p>

            <p>&#34;Venus shares very little with Earth-bound observers. Its highly reflective clouds show no detail when using conventional imaging methods. This photographer, however, has managed to tease a startling level of detail out of the phases shown here. Although the colours used are false, they are not too far from the natural colour of the planet. The thoughtful compositional work in the accurate scaling of the three phases is just the icing on the cake.&#34;</p><p>– Steve Marsh, competition judge</p><p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/planets-comets-asteroids-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5ad6088-ae9e-4510-9af1-7b24fa53ffd9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Planets, Comets and Asteroids 2024 - Astronomy Photographer of the Year" data-gtm-name="CTA" data-gtm-detail="formatted content">See the full Planets, Comets and Asteroids shortlist</a></p>

            <p>&#34;The hits keep on coming from this team with another stunning revelation for us. Who knew this fantastic and delicate structure was there all along in one of the best-known constellations in the night sky? The thoughtful processing and clever use of colouring really make the supernova remnant pop against its background. It’s one of those images that you can stare into for hours and still find more detail. Stunning!&#34;</p><p>– Steve Marsh, competition judge</p><p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/stars-nebulae-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f020dfb-7c21-4b6a-881d-a9d37c656966" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Stars and Nebulae 2024 – Astronomy Photographer of the Year" data-gtm-name="CTA" data-gtm-detail="formatted content">See the full Stars and Nebulae shortlist</a></p>

                <div>
          
            <p>&#34;The Dolphin Head Nebula is a bubble of hydrogen pushed out from a very luminous Wolf-Rayet star. Stellar winds of over 1,500 km per second make the region rather more lively than even its animal namesake.</p><p>&#34;This image is wonderfully detailed, and really displays the three-dimensional nature of the nebula. It is vibrant, without losing the very delicate surrounding structures, and you can clearly make out another little planetary nebula bubble (called PN G234.9-09.7) towards the bottom of the dolphin’s head, which is rarely imaged with any clarity. Very, very impressive work from any astrophotographer, let alone a newcomer.&#34;</p><p>– Ed Bloomer, competition judge</p><p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/best-newcomer-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="edf7197f-cdc7-44b1-87f6-d96c3da5f132" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Best Newcomer 2024 - Astronomy Photographer of the Year" data-gtm-name="CTA" data-gtm-detail="formatted content">See the full Best Newcomer shortlist</a></p>
