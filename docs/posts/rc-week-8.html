  <h2 id="mon">Mon</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pairing chat with @<strong>Daniel</strong> on a variety of things: self-hosting personal website, self-hosted RSS feeds, whoogle, open source debian/fedora</li>
  <li>Chat with @<strong>Shenai</strong>  to design a more streamlined, guiding UI – feeling much better about it, I knew something was missing and this was it, ty Shenai!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tues">Tues</h2>

<p>Yesterday:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GPU puzzles with @<strong>Suhith</strong> @<strong>Daniel</strong> @<strong>Nate</strong>! Nice meeting y’all</li>
  <li>Struggles with integrating Supabase and React; continued working on UI interactivity in the meantime</li>
</ul>

<p>My first time at a Moth story slam with @<strong>Katrina</strong> !</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI/ML paper cuts</li>
  <li>Can now get letters from the db and insert new letters into the db! I had the <code>insert</code> working without too much pain but then suddenly it stopped working and after several hours, I found out I just needed to restart <code>npm run dev</code>??? well now we know. Also I might’ve figured out sooner that it wasn’t an issue with my code if I had known that VSCode has a Timeline feature that shows the diff from every <em>save</em> (much more granularity than a git commit, for me at least) and that might’ve saved me time in realizing the issue didn’t have to do with my code…</li>
  <li>If anyone would be open to <del>giving me feedback on</del> roasting <a href="https://github.com/grkw/open-when">my React code</a>, I’d really appreciate that! Please feel free to send me a DM or come find me in the hub. I’ve just been throwing it together and don’t know if I’m using React in nice and appropriate ways!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thurs">Thurs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>chugging along on Open When! database GETing and POSTing but let’s be honest I’m really just TRUSTing the supabase API</li>
  <li>watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo5m92-9_QI">home-cooked software</a> talk that @<strong>Karen</strong>  linked and omg omg my next project will be inspired by this — I’m thinking of doing either 1) a simple menstrual cycle tracker (I haven’t found one that I quite like and I want to make something that’s completely my own) or 2) a fun dashboard/scrapbook for my partner and I to keep track of things in our relationship (like a notion page, but purpose-built and we own our data)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fri">Fri</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pairing with @<strong>Priya</strong>  to fix the widths of my divs!</li>
  <li>Really nice chat with @<strong>Michael</strong> until next time  :smiling_face_with_tear_cry:</li>
  <li>Chugging along on Open When. Implementing the “letter credits” concept and cleaning up the UI</li>
</ul>
