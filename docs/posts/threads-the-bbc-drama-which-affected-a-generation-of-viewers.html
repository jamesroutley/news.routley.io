However, the name of the service conjures up a rather different meaning to viewers who caught a seminal BBC drama aired almost 40 years ago.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As families settled down in front of the TV on a Sunday evening in September 1984, little did they suspect the impact of the horror to come.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At 9:30 the BBC aired the 112-minute film Threads.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>With only four channels to choose from, the harrowing post-apocalyptic Cold War drama found its way into millions of homes - and led to sleepless nights for many who saw the Sheffield-based dystopian drama unfold.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Written by Kes author Barry Hines, the film showed the unrelenting impact of a thermonuclear blast on ordinary Britons - in graphic detail.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Produced on a low budget and directed by documentary maker Mick Jackson, who would later go on to helm Hollywood blockbuster The Bodyguard, it managed to horrify people at a time when nuclear war seemed a very real possibility.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>From a kitchen sink drama focused around a young couple in a South Yorkshire, then riven by the Miners&#39; Strike, Threads shows society breaking down as nuclear winter sets in.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The drama depicts the grim reality of the impact of a thermonuclear blast on Sheffield</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It never loses its power, ever. I have never seen anything so horrible and bleak in my life,&#34; said Stephen Brotherstone.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He and David Lawrence are the authors of Scarred for Life - a series of books looking at the impact of 70s and 80s pop culture.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Both vividly remember the film, with Brotherstone admitting he only managed to watch the first half when it was broadcast as it &#34;wrecked&#34; his head.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, he finally saw the full movie when it was repeated - and it has stayed with him ever since.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I can still remember lying in bed in my bedroom and you can kind of see the next street on from my mum and dad&#39;s and it was almost like an overlaid image of blasted houses and rubble, because it affected me that much.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Karen Meagher and Reece Dinsdale played the young couple at the heart of the film&#39;s opening</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Reece Dinsdale, who played central character Jimmy in the film, said it had &#34;looked really special&#34; when he read the script, largely because he admired the work of writer Hines.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, the Normanton-born actor, who was shortly to star in sitcom Home to Roost with John Thaw, had no idea of the drama&#39;s impact.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We said &#39;wow if we can pull this off it&#39;ll be great,&#39; but I didn&#39;t have a clue that it held that much of a punch.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The film was shot on location in Sheffield and, after it was completed, 500 guests were attended a special screening in the city.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There was complete silence and all you could hear was various people sobbing around the room,&#34; the actor recalled.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;People blame me to this day for scarring them for life. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;People say it is the most scary thing they&#39;ve ever seen in their life and remains so to this day.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The film was written by Barry Hines and entirely filmed on location in Sheffield</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Threads was made and shown in an era of heightened tension between the West and the then USSR.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lawrence and Brotherstone are currently working on a third volume of their series, which looks at the Cold War and includes a chapter on Threads.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think &#39;83, &#39;84 was the peak of Cold War paranoia in the 80s,&#34; said Lawrence.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You&#39;ve got nuclear war mentioned in a million pop songs, you&#39;ve got it on TV, in your comics, and then Threads comes on and there&#39;s every nightmare you&#39;ve ever had on screen.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Brotherstone remembers feeling convinced he would not live to see 1990.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t a question of if they pressed the button, but when are they going to press the button,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The nuclear blast sees streets in Sheffield reduced to rubble</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Jimmy, played by Dinsdale, and Ruth, played by Karen Meagher, have just learnt that Ruth is expecting a baby as the film opens.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The growing tensions between East and West appear on TV and newspapers as Sheffield&#39;s residents go about their daily lives, ignoring the looming threat.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;There&#39;s the build-up to war, but you don&#39;t see it you, just hear about it in the background as they are discussing what to have for tea,&#34; Lawrence said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They are so wrapped up in their own lives, that is very powerful I think.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Vaporised"><span role="text">&#39;Vaporised&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>For Dinsdale, it was a &#34;fantastic&#34; piece of writing by Hines.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They are everyman and everywoman, they are just normal people with normal lives, there&#39;s nothing special about them and this very special event happens to them and it just draws you in.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Brotherstone said director Jackson had initially thought of using the cast of Coronation Street.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Until it was pointed out to him that it would be massively distracting to watch Deirdre Barlow get blown up,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It is very 70s, 80s Play for Today, but I think it works in its favour because it was so British.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;That was a house that looked like mine, there&#39;s Woolworths getting vaporised, it really struck home.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Reece Dinsdale says Threads was a &#34;golden time&#34; in his career</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The final parts of the film follow the characters as they struggle through the nuclear winter in the aftermath of the blasts.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It is watching everyone die and it is watching society collapse forever. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It makes the point we are never coming back as a society, language is gone, skills are gone, we are just in rags grunting at each other,&#34; Brotherstone said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For the actors and crew it was &#34;a ball&#34; to make, according to Dinsdale.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We had the biggest laugh I remember, it was one of the happiest crews ever.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>To him though, Threads remains a &#34;seminal&#34; piece of television which still resonates with audiences.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It was one of the most outstanding pieces of work the BBC has ever created,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It is so grim and gruesome and so truthful and real and so horrific.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><i>Follow BBC Yorkshire on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCYorkshire/">Facebook</a><i>, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclooknorth">Twitter</a><i> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcyorkshire/">Instagram</a><i>.
