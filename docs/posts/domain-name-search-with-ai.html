    <h1>Show HN: Domain Name Search with AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In my exploration of OpenAI, I just created a domain-name search that takes business description as an input, and generates interesting domain names for it. It then uses DNSimple API to check if .com is available.</p><p>In my view it is a much easier way to find a suitable domain, as the AI thinks of a much large pool of possible names than my own brain. SmartyNames found its own name, using the tool itself.</p><p>Hope you enjoy it! <a href="https://smartynames.com/" rel="nofollow">https://smartynames.com/</a></p></div></div></div>
