long.
</p><!-- l. 34 --><p>   The length is the reason for the delay in my response. I hope that OCR
technologies are effective at saving you from having to type this in. Could you
carefully proof the OCR results? I apologize for the burden it will be. I hope you
understand the length as my taking your request seriously, and are pleased rather
than dismayed. It was alot of work to write it. If you sign up for text messaging

<h2 id="introduction"><span>§ 2</span></h2>
<!-- l. 59 --><p><span><span><span>I</span> </span></span><span>was asked</span> by a kind Fredrick Brennan for my comments that I might offer on
the discussion of removing ReiserFS V3 from the kernel. I don’t post directly
because I am in prison for killing my wife Nina in 2006.
</p><!-- l. 64 --><p>   I am very sorry for my crime–a proper apology would be off topic for this
forum, but available to any who ask.
</p><!-- l. 67 --><p>   A detailed apology for how I interacted with the Linux kernel community,
and some history of V3 and V4, are included, along with descriptions of what the
technical issues were. I have been attending prison workshops, and working hard
on improving my social skills to aid my becoming less of a danger to society. The
man I am now would do things very differently from how I did things
then.
</p><!-- l. 75 --><p>   Perhaps some might accept my apology; others might learn from
my mistakes if I describe them well; some might find the design issues
interesting.
</p><!-- l. 79 --><p>   I will leave it to the users to decide whether ReiserFS V3 is still useful. Users
should understand that it is a burden for those who maintain VFS and the like to
have to test their changes on an additional filesystem, especially given Linux
filesystems are hard code at the VFS layer.
</p><!-- l. 85 --><p>   ReiserFS 4 provides a more maintainable basis for the future for those users
who like the features of V3. If V3 isn’t used it should go, I trust the users and the
kernel maintainers to discuss whether it is used, and to make the right decision
together.
                                                                     

                                                                     
</p>   
<h2 id="main-text"><span>§ 3</span></h2>
<!-- l. 93 --><p><span><span><span>V</span> </span></span><span>3</span> had a moment in time when it was useful, and I am happy that we were
able to contribute to the success of GNU/Linux for a few crucial years during
which it was growing rapidly in usage. Chris<sup><span>[page 2 follows]</span></sup> Mason’s contribution
of journaling was the most practically useful feature of V3, and I thank him for
it.
</p><!-- l. 102 --><p>   I am sad that SUSE didn’t make it in the market place, I found it to be a
well-crafted distro, and it was a privilege to be able to contribute to it. I am
grateful for their sponsorship and support.
</p><!-- l. 107 --><p>   Reiser FS V3 was our first filesystem, and in doing it we made mistakes,
because we didn’t know what we were doing. I have to tell you that when I did
the first benchmarks the performance was terrible, and I didn’t know why. By
terrible I mean that no sane person would use it for anything, there were
years of dark depression before it was debugged enough to run at all,
and then, 5% here and 5% there, I dragged it into being a little faster
than the competition, and saving some space for traditional filesystem
sizes, and more space for small files. Changing the allocation of blocks to
files—simple code fortunately—yielded most of the performance gains. In V3
performance tweaking, Ext2, the existing GNU/Linux filesystem, was
actually a very high performance filesystem—probably the best in the
world.<a id="x1-3001f1"></a>
   
The man I was then presented papers with benchmarks showing that ReiserFS
was faster than ext2. The man I am now would start his papers <sup><span>[page 3 follows]</span></sup>
crediting them for being faster than the filesystems of other operating systems,
and thanking them for the years we used their filesystem to write ours. Not doing
that was my first serious social mistake in the Linux community, and it was
completely unnecessary.
</p><!-- l. 132 --><p>   Vladimir Saveliev, who had pity on me and came back after everyone else had
quit, was the man who made the code work well enough that anyone would want
to use it for more than a benchmark. After he came back, I left the debugging to
him. He is one of the most good, mild-mannered, and hard working men that
exists, anyone who has ever worked with him will agree with that. He didn’t say
much about it, but he believed in the Free Software Movement. Through force of
will, and hard work, he made himself into a programmer of extraordinary
skill, the effects of which you can see manifested in our Reiser4 code.
He went from being the must junior of the programmers at the start of
V3 to being the lead programmer, earning it through hard work all the
way,
</p><!-- l. 148 --><p>   Assuming that the decision is to remove V3 from the kernel, I have just one
request: that for one last release the README be edited to add Mikhail Gilula,
                                                                     

                                                                     
Konstantin Shvachko, and Anatoly Pinchuk to the credits, and to delete anything
in there I might have said about why they were not credited. It is time to let
go.<sup><span>[page 4 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 155 --><p>   In prison I have been working quite hard on developing my social skills,
especially my conflict resolution and conflict avoidance skills. There is a lot of
conflict in prison, as you can imagine, and it is quite a good place to learn those
skills. Nothing like lots of practice, and the groups they let us take if we want to
have a quite well developed curriculum, Repetition helps, at least for me. It has
changed me.
</p><!-- l. 165 --><p>   I had a tendency to see people in extremes. That I am working on by being
mindful of it, and by being around people who it would be easy to see in
extremes, Many of them have become very good persons <span>[sic] </span>since their
crimes.
</p><!-- l. 171 --><p>   I look back, with the advantage of the passing of years helping to improve my
vision, and I see that while I intended to be helpful to researchers in Russia living
on less than a hundred dollars a month, I could not be as helpful as
a job working in America earning a Western salary. I put everything
I had into the project, working 40+ hours a week at a day job, most
employers not happy that I wanted to work only 40 hours if I could, and
then I spent 15-20 hours a week arguing over algorithms, architecture,
code, etc., by email. I learned to cut out everything in my life besides
the<sup><span>[page 5 follows]</span></sup> project because otherwise my dream just would not make
it.
</p><!-- l. 186 --><p>   I had more dream than experience. With Mikhail there running things in
Russia it went pretty well because we had an ability to understand each
other, I believe Mikhail Gilvla was the brightest mind in his generation of
computer scientists, and his talent was wasted. First it was wasted by
Russia’s economy making his success impossible, and then in America it was
wasted by most of the database field not being able to understand that he
was right in wanting to rewrite the basics of their field in the ways be
wanted to because he was just so much brighter than they were. I don’t
think they could even understand why it mattered, what he wanted to
do.
</p><!-- l. 200 --><p>   We both believed that relational algebra was a special case of something more
general, something that was needed for “semi-structured data&#34;. He called his
approach “set-theoretic&#34;, and implemented it in the form of a database. I had my
own syntax that expanded the filesystem namespace, instead. We came up with
our ideas independently, before we met.<sup><span>[page 6 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 208 --><p>   I had the idea that the place to implement it was in a filesystem, and that the
motivation for implementing it there was to evolve it into a namespace that
would allow unifying all of the namespaces of the operating system into one
namespace. I thought this would be the most important refactoring of code ever,
and would increase the expressive power of everything in those namespaces. I
drew analogies between the effect of roads and waterways on the development of
                                                                     

                                                                     
civilization according to Adam Smith, and the effects of free trade on
specialization thus wealth according to Adam Smith again, and the effects
of unifying the namespaces on the expressive power of the operating
system.
</p><!-- l. 221 --><p>   That was my dream.
</p><!-- l. 223 --><p>   I was not the only one with this dream. The term “namespace&#34; is pretty much
only used by people who share in that dream enough to use a term that implies
an equivalency between databases, filesystems, DNS, etc. Rob Pike and
Plan 9 are examples of work to increase the Filesystem namespace, My
particular flavor of the dream was that I had a syntax that could expand
the filesystem hierarchical namespace to handle “semi-structured data&#34;.
That means queries that are constructed from primitives that can be
combined into the equivalent of searche engine queries (unstructured
associations), database queries (unordered ordered pairs to search tables), or
filesystems (fully<sup><span>[page 7 follows]</span></sup> ordered names to search hierarchies), or
things that are richer than any of those special cases. Now that was my
dream! Sigh, It probably won’t surprise you that I was a teenager when I
came up with this dream, and its syntax for searching semi-structured
data.
</p><!-- l. 240 --><p>   I apologize to the users that I never got to that dream because of my crime
and my going to prison, and they never got to see any semantic enhancements to
Reiser 4.
</p><!-- l. 244 --><p>   The most technically difficult task that was a prerequisite to someday
implementing my syntax, a task that had to be implemented first to do things
right, was to make the filesystem efficient for small files.
</p><!-- l. 249 --><p>   I was very sensitive from the start to the power of net work effects to drown
efforts to shift paradigms, to introduce better ways to do things. Network effects
were abstract, so I understood them better than the importance of believing that
I can make friends and allies of people who start out hostile because I had not
made them feel included.
</p><!-- l. 257 --><p>   Awareness of network effects was why I decided that the path to unifying the
namespaces of the operating system started with enhancing filesystem semantics
which started with creating a storage layer that could emulate a filesystem faster
than any existing filesystem but could also be<sup><span>[page 8 follows]</span></sup> effective for storing
small objects like databases are. Yes, it was arrogant to attempt that, but it
seemed like it should be possible to do it. I had no idea how long it would take to
get it right.
</p><!-- l. 267 --><p>   Mikhail advised me to use balanced trees instead of extensible hashing (what
<span>dcache </span>uses). I would come to understand that locality of reference is the <span>sina
qua non </span>of performance, and that balanced trees are the best of all tools for
implementing clever ways of maximizing locality of reference, Mikhail had tried
extensible hashing, and learned the hard way that trying to fix its problems leads
to using balanced trees. Locality of reference doesn’t just affect hard
drive performance, it affects compressed data performance (that means
                                                                     

                                                                     
SPRAM performance), and even affects CPU cache performance (and thus
DRAM stored data performance). He told me he was saving me 2 years by
telling me to use balanced trees, and that’s true, and I thank him for
that,
</p><!-- l. 282 --><p>   I never told Mikhail that Oracle had tried implementing a filesystem using
balanced trees, and its performance was terrible leading to most insiders in the
industry concluding that balanced trees performed poorly for filesystem File size
patterns. I didn’t tell Mikhail; I didn’t tell any of the programmers; I didn’t tell
anyone involved in the project. I couldn’t see why they should be slower so I
disregarded it, Vladimir would<sup><span>[page 9–1 follows]</span></sup> have good cause to be angry with
me if he reads this.
</p><!-- l. 292 --><p>   I think part of their performance problems were how they did their
journaling. I’ve observed that most balanced tree implementations are too
synchronous, and most filesystems aren’t very synchronous for performance
reasons. <span>fsync() </span>is like using a sledge hammer to turn a screw with repeated
sideways blows on the hoad of the screw. What is needed to have high data
integrity guarantees with no unnecessary performance losses is a new API
that allows intelligence in doing it by allowing the different layers to
share their greater intelligence with the other layers. We need to allow
the user to share their intelligence with the application, the application
to share its intelligence with the filesystem, the filesystem and process
scheduler to share their intelligence with the I/O scheduler, the I/O
scheduler to share its intelligence with the I/O scheduler and other aspects of
the hard drive, and then share intelligence back up the other direction
of that stack, and then also tie in the memory manager in there too.

<a id="x1-3003f2"></a>

 It
requires not just ordering of I/O’s, but specifying groupings of I/O’s
that should commit or not commit as a group, to communicate that
intelligence, and not be more synchronous than necessary. Other features
relating to priorities, fairness, guaranteeing I/O rates, etc, would also be
desirable. If more details are wanted by anyone, ask, please, This is an
area where Reiser 4 should do more<sup><span>[page 9-2 follows]</span></sup> than we had time to
do.
</p><!-- l. 318 --><p>   I wish I had had the money to retain Joshua MacDonald when Orade hired
him away from me, and learn more from him about logical journaling ideas he
had then, I hope he is doing well—he was simply a brilliant young man, I’ll just
say that block aligning journaling isn’t necessarily optimal for all needs that
userspace has, and refer the reader to him for more. What I didn’t know when we
were arguing over the V3 design is that the FFS bench marks are misleading,
                                                                     

                                                                     
and fail to highlight something that also hurts database performance,
FFS is the BSD filesystem, and it was regarded as the best of its day.
It used 4k blocks except for the tail end of files for which it used 1k
blocks, and it would combine those 1k blocks from different files into the
same 4k, thereby allowing them to increase block size but still conserve
space.
</p><!-- l. 333 --><p>   Sounds clearly correct, yes? Alas, the performance cost of pulling the tails of
files out of line with the rest of the file to combine it with the tails of other files is
a seek plus a rotational delay (20 ms), That’s hugely expensive compared to the
tail size divided by the transfer rate, Seeks dominate filesystem performance
unless the layout is perfect. You can see the importance of avoiding adding any
seeks by having the tail of a<sup><span>[page 10 follows]</span></sup> file located inline with the rest of the
file,
</p><!-- l. 342 --><p>   Databases with their &#34;BLOBS&#34;, ReiserFS V3, and FFS all combine tails in a
way that adds seeks and hurts performance substantially. For Databases and
Reiserts V3 it’s even worse though, because BLOBS make it not really a
balanced tree, and the ability to effectively cache all the internal nodes of
the tree is lost. Google “Reiser 4 twigs”, and hopefully that will find
a longer discussion of that for interested readers, including how to fix
it,
</p><!-- l. 351 --><p>   That performance failing drove me crazy—I felt the design was just wrong,
and I resolved to redo everything from scratch with Reiser 4, The plugins, and
the modularity of the code they created, are the most important feature of Reiser
4, It is far easier to add features to Reiser 4 than to add them to other
filesystems, because you just add new plugins. The hard stuff is done, and new
features are a downhill ride. Well, except that I am in prison, and so I must leave
all that to others.
</p><!-- l. 362 --><p>   There is a problem that filesystems have, and that is that format changes are
unwanted by many for good reasons, That is the primary reason that filesystems
stagnate, Well, that, and stagnating is easy…<sup><span>[page 11 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 367 --><p>   I just had to fix all these flaws, fix them and make a filesystem that was done
right. It’s hard to explain why I had to do it, but I just couldn’t rest as long as
the design was wrong and I knew it was wrong.
</p><!-- l. 372 --><p>   SUSE didn’t want a format change, they wanted incremental improvements to
V3. That’s the way it is for a lot of filesystem architects. Incrementally changing
things they know are deeply wrong to their cores, but stuck in that misery of
doing so. I said no to that, which I won’t apologize for and don’t regret, because
I have a soul, and I had a dream. What I do apologize for is how utterly
inarticulate and unsociable I was in explaining that to SUSE. What I
essentially said to SUSE was that the code was unmaintainable terrible
code that needed to be rewritten from scratch, trust me, it needed to be
done, we didn’t know what we were doing then and now we have learned
what we should have known, but we will fix every bug in V3 that is
found.
                                                                     

                                                                     
</p><!-- l. 386 --><p>   I could have said that I hear them, and I hear them well, so well that Reiser 4
has node format plugins that solve the format change problem. I could have told
them of our plans for a repacker for Reiser 4, so that partitions could be shrunk,
and layout perfectly optimized, and …spent a day visiting them and making
Reiser 4 our dream not my dream. Instead I<sup><span>[page 12 follows]</span></sup> communicated
that I couldn’t pursue my dream without a format change. Both SUSE
and I wanted what was best for Linux and SUSE, so the reason for my
failure was that I had failed to socially connect by reaching past the initial
hostility to the format change to I make my (and DARPA’s) dream into
our<a id="x1-3005f3"></a>
   
dream. I would repeat this failure style with the Linux kernel community when
Reiser 4 was submitted for inclusion, only worse.
</p><!-- l. 405 --><p>   Let me go back in time though to the early days of V3. Not long after the
computers were purchased, and then the project really got going, Mikhail got a
job in America, Mikhail was the reason I had hired this group. Now I no
longer had somebody running things on site that I was intellectually
compatible with, and frictions developed. I had not chosen them, and they
had not chosen me, nor had they chosen my dream or the Free Software
Movement. Alas, I was inexperienced, and they didn’t respect. that, which is
understandable, yes? I had a feel for abstractions that was stronger than my feel
for people, and a casual delight for tossing socially established algorithms
that made them even less comfortable than my wearing a cowboy hat
instead of a tie, None of this was a problem with Mikhails but Mikhail had
left.
</p><!-- l. 421 --><p>   It was to be expected that there would be problems, but I was too young and
hopeful to see that. There was a cost to going from system administrator to
architect without first spending a few years as a coder.<sup><span>[page 13 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 425 --><p>   An example of this was their use of BLOBS in V3. I didn’t know that putting
unformatted nodes on a level of the tree below the putative leaves of the tree was
the standard way of doing things in the database world. When I saw it in the
code I objected to it. I was asked to just let them try it their way, and if it
didn’t work it could be removed , I was too inexperienced as a software
project manager to know that that was an argument to only entertain
after the first version of a product has shipped, because whatever gets
written before product shipment is not likely to get rewritten until after
product shipment, especially if you know the design is wrong. That’s
especially true if you know the design is wrong. What I didn’t know was
just how wrong the design was, The performance cost was higher than I
feared it would be, I should also say that the coding cost of doing it
right was higher than I thought it would be, To the young architects
out there, let me say that if you know something is wrong, don’t lot it
                                                                     

                                                                     
happen just to be agreeable or to accept the consensus, Yes, listen to all
the arguments, but if you don’t have a better feel for algorithms, you
should not be in the job of architect. Believe in yourself, I paid the price
for not knowing when to be firm, when the benchmarks came in, and
then again when fixing it required a format change that lost me SUSE.

<a id="x1-3007f4"></a>


<sup><span>[page 14 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 456 --><p>   Then Mikhail’s employer hired the rest of them, and left me with a
pile of poorly commented code that was not able to run. It would have
been wiser for me to write it again from scratch, but that would have
meant admitting that all I had invested into the project was a total
loss.<a id="x1-3009f5"></a>
   
</p><!-- l. 464 --><p>   Now, with the distance of time, I can see that their leaving was simply the
reasonable thing from their point of view, There were some unkindnesses in how
they left, but that’s to be expected, says the distance of time, Then I felt so
betrayed. Now I wish to let go of that. They were just ordinary people
caught in economic forces, and not enjoying working for the guy with more
dream than experience. They too were inexperienced: none of us had
worked on a filesystem before. We were all young, and impatient. I never
did get to where we made enough money that I could pay people well,
and I am truly sorry for that. If I had not committed my crime, that
day when Reiser 4 was a worthy use of the extraordinary talent of the
programmers working on it probably would have come. I was callous and
indifferent to their needs and dreams when I committed my crime, and
victimized them financially and ruined their dreams that I had talked them
into.
</p><!-- l. 483 --><p>   One of my great regrets is that I let go of Mikhail as a friend. I hope be is
alive, and doing well.<sup><span>[page 15 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 486 --><p>   I read about a DARPA request for proposals for open source software on a
Friday on Slashdot, and it had a Monday submission deadline. I went into a
writing Frenzy, and proposed what became Reiser 4, DARPA was very good to
us, very and I learned a lot about accounting and security both from them. I’d
like to apologize to DARPA for two things:
</p>     
<ol>
<li id="x1-3012x1">All we were able to complete was the infrastructure that would enable
the security features I proposed, and that was despite my putting
several times the money they gave us into the project from every where

Now that Reiser 4 is stable, the plugin infrastructure would make it so
easy to add extra features, we could probably have done the encryption

one of them told me that my wife was in a lot of pain. Now I can see clearly that
that was exactly correct, and perfectly illuminated the path I should have
taken. Alas, I lacked the wisdom to understand the words with just one
repetition.

</p><!-- l. 540 --><p>   In prison I have learned that alienation, which I intend to use to
protect myself, is often a cage I bulld around myself instead. A fear of
being naïve can often be as dangerous in its reality distortions as being
naïve,<sup><span>[page 17 follows]</span></sup> Now is not the time to try to be a light in US-Russian
relations. I hope that there will again be such a time, and an end to all the
death and dying. I hope the time will come again for reaching past the
alienation, and finding friendship<sup><span>[page 18 follows]</span></sup> and love, between Russia and
Ukraine and the U.S, and between my children and I. Call me a fool, or
simply someone who thinks the pain is too much for us all, I leave that to
you.
</p><!-- l. 552 --><p>   Back to Reiser4: We<a id="x1-3023f10"></a>
    
built a beautiful filesystem that embedied everything we had figured out we
should have done the first time, called Reiser 4, and it smoked, What’s more, it
had this plugin architecture that I had proposed to DARPA in that writing
frenzy, but that Nikita Danilov had made even better than what I had proposed
(he made the balancing operations plugins too, and I am so glad that
he was smarter than me and showed that the performance costs were
acceptable).
</p><!-- l. 564 --><p>   With most filesystems, adding a feature is 80% altering the existing code and
20% writing the new feature, and then you will be likely adding a Format change
that someone not even working in the filesystem group will say no to. With
Reiser 4 we made every aspect of it that we could imagine doing so for into a
plugin. If you want to add a new feature, you just spend your time writing the
new plugins for it, and 90% of the time that is all you will have to write, or
failing that, it will be 80% of what you will have to write, You get to spand
your time on your clever idea instead of on why it was so much harder
than it should have been to write it. I think you’ll find it is more than
3 times faster to add it to Reiser 4 than to any<sup><span>[page 19 follows]</span></sup> other
filesystem, with all the features required of a filesystem for compatibility
(an enormous burden to write—if you have a clever filesystem idea save
yourself that burden and add a plugin to Reiser 4 instead—you can be one
programmer doing a 6 month plugin instead of having to fund a team for
5 years to do a filesystem) completed, it was going to be all downhill
                                                                     

                                                                     
from there. We would have been theones implementing a substantive
new feature per programmer per 6 months, The code that Alexander
Zarochentcev, Nikita Danilov, and Vladimir Saveliev wrote (all three of
them contributing equally, working together like the three musketeers)
was beautiful code, and then the junior programmer Edward Shishkin
came along as the fourth musketeer and his compression plugin doubled
performance again for compressible files. I cannot remember ever finding
anything I could improve in Alexander Zarochentcev’s code: it was always
perfectly written: “read it and learn how things should be written” kind of
code.
</p><!-- l. 594 --><p>   I am not known for being unable to find things to criticize, or praising easily.
Somehow with the smallest budget for paying them in the filesystem world, I
lucked onto the best programming team in the filesystem world. The filesystem
was worthy of their talents—I wish that I as a person had been worthy of
them.<sup><span>[page 20 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 601 --><p>   The problem was that it didn’t use the code that had been written by others
in the kernel community, and people don’t really like their code not being used.
People want to feel included. I responded to their social need by, well, screwing
the pooch in response (benchmarks and disputing their expertise). Imagine if I
had responded by saying that I needed their help in imagining new file plugins
instead?
</p><!-- l. 609 --><p>   You know how people are much more likely to read an email if it is
one screen long, rather than the length of this <span>:-/ </span>? It is similar with
contributing code to the kernel. It is much more social and relationship
developing to contribute a screenful or two of code once every week or two
over the course of years. We were dropping 90,000 lines of code on them
all at once, having worked on it in total social isolation for 5 years in
Moscow, Socially it was all bad. Small increments are the more social way
to go. Incremental improvements to V3 would have met no opposition.
We could have lived a life of being a little bit better than <span>ext3</span>, and
been respected in the field as we waited for someone young to obsolete
us,

revealed to an empiricist. My leadership and project management failures needed
to be atoned for. The maintainability of a plugin based filesystem was
perhaps more important than the<sup><span>[page 21 follows]</span></sup> benchmarks, I had added
                                                                     

                                                                     
comments, and we had added bug Fixes, but I am so glad I kept none of it for
V4.
</p><!-- l. 633 --><p>   If I had had then the conflict resolution skills I have learned in prison
Cognitive Behavioral Intervention classes I might would have been able to
overcome all that.
</p><!-- l. 637 --><p>   Then, my attitude was, it’s the fastest filesystem in the world, why aren’t you
happy and helpful?! Look at these benchmarks! These plugins! Why do I
have to deal with these people who didn’t write as fast of a filesystem ?
Let them write theirs, and us write ours - VFS should allow that ! My
attitude should have been, ignore the hostility, that’s to be expected at
first and overcome, I can overcome hostility, and the way to do that
is simple : 1) make people Feel appreciated and cared about, 2) make
people Feel included, 3) make people want to do things with those plugins
themselves by asking them for their ideas on what plugins they could
imagine.
</p><!-- l. 650 --><p>   Now I Know that it is possible to overcome such problems if I actively apply
my mind to Finding an emotional or social path to making people Feel
good.
</p><!-- l. 654 --><p>   The most important part of that is to believe that I can do that successfully. I
used to lack the ability to imagine that I could succeed at overcoming hostility,
but by doing the exercises in my Cognitive Behavioral Intervention classes in
prison situations, I have started to see that I can,<sup><span>[page 22 follows]</span></sup> started to
believe that I can,
</p><!-- l. 661 --><p>   If you believe you can do it, you usually can, when it comps to making things
go well with others, If you focus on Finding a way past a problem, instead of
on your Feelings of having been wronged, you can usually get past a
relationship hiccop. If you Fail, you’ve lost little to nothing in making the
attempt, so why Fear to make the attempt? Contrary to what young men
so often Fear, if you Fail in such an attempt you don’t lose Face - you
gain respect From others watching you try - especially the older ones.
If you make a habit of always trying, you will inevitably get good at
it,

</p><!-- l. 676 --><p>   One of my dreams is to someday convince the State Legislature to teach the
curriculum they teach us prisoners, in elementary school, that people like me can
learn it better without having to go to prison to learn it, I’m try my to
convince some people to pitch it to legislators—if any one would like to help
with that please let me know. It will help with more than just avoiding
prison—it will help with all relationship conflicts, and who does not
have those…? The prison parenting class should be taught in High School
                                                                     

                                                                     
too…<sup><span>[page 23 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 689 --><p>   An example of what I could have hand led differently was when Viro
announced that there was a race condition in our code, but that he would
not tell us where it was because if we could not audit our code for race
conditions we should not be allowed into the kernel, Viro was this guy
whose career focus was lacking, I didn’t know any thing about auditing
code for race conditions, and disappointingly Google didn’t get me any
where in looking for how does one audit for race conditions. My attitude
at the time was that it sounded like necessary but tedious work, really
tedious, that hopefully the guys who were doing the debugging would
figure out while I tried to get the money for their next pay check.

<a id="x1-3031f14"></a>

 I
should have done more than communicate the problem, I should have asked
“what is the audit for race conditions plan, and help me find literature on
how to do it, and then let’s divide up the relevant code and do it, all
code to be audited by two different people&#34;. Race conditions are very
expensive to debug when they are rare—auditing would have saved money.
This was an area where we all needed to improve our methodology.

<a id="x1-3033f15"></a>


</p><!-- l. 716 --><p>   I Failed to communicate by Failing to ask if this was an area where my guys
didn’t know how to do it and were too shy to say so, and in this were just like
me.<sup><span>[page 24 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 720 --><p>   What I should have done was ask Viro instead of Google, and invite him to
come to Moscow, stay in my spare room, sample the world’s wildest nightlife
(Moscow), and give our team a seminar on auditing for race conditions and
supervise us as we each took a part of the code and did the audit per his
instructions, We had as much motivation to eliminate race conditions, no,
much more because it was our code and business, as Viro, There was no
good reason for us to not be allies in this. There was only a bad reason I
was responding to the initial hostility rather than reaching past it to
make an ally of someone who had a lot of potential to be very helpful
to us. Now of course he might well have refused the invitation, said he
was too busy, told us to get better at using Google, etc., but even if he
refused the invitation he would probably have felt mollified somewhat.
If he took us up on the invitation all of us could have made valuable
Friendships likely to have been useful for the rest of our lives, as we
                                                                     

                                                                     
fed him shi <span>[sic] </span>(щи, Russian soup, one of the best aspects of Russian
cuisine is their soups) and pelmenie (<span>elmeni</span>, Georgian spicy pot stickers),
and took him to dance the night away when the race conditions were
gone.
</p><!-- l. 741 --><p>   I could have similarly approached other Key persons in the Kernel community
who expressed unhappiness at our contribution offering, if only I had had then
the social confidence, and belief that it is possible to overcome initial touches of
alienation, that I have now developed.<sup><span>[page 25 follows]</span></sup>
</p><!-- l. 747 --><p>   Instead I responded to hostility with my own hostility.
</p><!-- l. 749 --><p>   In prison, on MLK day, I learned of MLK’s words:
</p>   
<blockquote>  
<!-- l. 752 --><p><span><span><span>“O</span> </span></span><span>nly love</span> can fight hate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- l. 757 --><p>   I have come to appreciate, and fully understand those words, I wish I had
understood them then.
</p><!-- l. 760 --><p>   There were a bunch of such situations that I handled in ways that did not
make people Feel appreciated or included, and I want to take this opportunity to
apologize For those.
</p><!-- l. 764 --><p>   I especially want to apologize to the other members of our team who invested
so much of their lives into our dream only to be failed by me, and by my
alienating others in the Linux kernel community.
</p><!-- l. 769 --><p>   The Linux kernel is not about benchmarks, it is about a community of
people who enjoy working together in the Christmas Spirit to give to the
users all year long. Now that I have changed who I am I can better see
that.
</p><!-- l. 774 --><p>   I don’t know what is in Reiser 5—I haven’t been told, and I cannot go on the
Internet. Edward Shishkin is a very bright man though, and one of my regrets is
that I didn’t spend more time with him, I am confident he has done some thing
nice in Reiser 5. Who knows, maybe he has done some nice plugins that I would
never have imagined. The compression plugin Edward coded was the one
thing yielding the biggest performance boost of all the things we did in
Reiser 4. Chances are high that I won’t be<sup><span>[page 26 follows]</span></sup> released anytime
soon. I encourage people to allow those who worked so hard to build a
beautiful filesystem for the users to escape the effects of my reputation.
I invite you to empathize with what this has been like for them for a
minute.
</p><!-- l. 787 --><p>   Let their dreams escape from the harm I have done, if that feels right to
you.
