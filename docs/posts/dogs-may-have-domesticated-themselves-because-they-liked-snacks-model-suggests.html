These periods of domestication were driven by different evolutionary forces, according to a new study published Feb. 12 in the journal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.2646" target="_blank" data-url="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.2646" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</u></a>.</p><p>The second domestication period is thought to have been mostly driven by artificial selection: humans chose more tame wolves to accompany them for hunting and companionship, and purposely bred the least-wild animals together, which ultimately produced the tame species we know as the domestic dog.</p><p>But the selective forces that drove the first domestication period are less clear. According to one hypothesis, wolves underwent &#34;self-domestication&#34;: after prehistoric animals started coming to human settlements to scavenge for food scraps, they grew more accustomed to living near people. These more-tolerant wolves preferred a steady food supply over inconsistent sources in the wild, and their descendants gave rise to the first domestic dogs.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/dogs/smarter-dogs-have-smaller-brains-surprising-study-reveals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/dogs/smarter-dogs-have-smaller-brains-surprising-study-reveals"><u><strong>Smarter dogs have smaller brains, surprising study reveals</strong></u></a></p><p>A similar process is believed to have occurred with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/59538-cat-domestication-dispersal-in-ancient-world.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/59538-cat-domestication-dispersal-in-ancient-world.html"><u>cat domestication</u></a>, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;xcust=livescience_us_3220871986965120385&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41559-017-0139&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fanimals%2Fdogs%2Fdogs-may-have-domesticated-themselves-because-they-really-liked-snacks-model-suggests" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0139" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41559-017-0139&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fanimals%2Fdogs%2Fdogs-may-have-domesticated-themselves-because-they-really-liked-snacks-model-suggests" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"><u>research found</u></a> that the ancestors of house cats spent time near farming communities around 10,000 years ago, before settling into a mutually-beneficial relationship in which they hunted and ate rodents <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7414175/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7414175/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>in exchange for food</u></a>.</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Qhg84EAgRXm6mHHLQvGd6g"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.</p></section></div></div></div><h2 id="dog-domestication-debate-3">Dog domestication debate</h2><p>Scientists have long debated the dog self-domestication hypothesis. One criticism is that natural selection may not be able to work quickly enough to turn wild wolves into domestic dogs over thousands of years — without selective breeding by humans to speed the process up.</p><p>In the new study, researchers addressed this question of time constraint by using a statistical model that considered potential timelines of dog domestication and gave its computerized canines some agency over choosing their lifestyle and mates.</p><p>The model showed that over 15,000 years, natural selection could potentially drive dog self-domestication. But for this to happen, two conditions had to be met: Wolves had to choose to stay near humans to eat food scraps, and they had to select mates with a similar temperament.</p><p>&#34;When females were selecting mates, they also had to select males that had a similar tameness to themselves,&#34; study co-author <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jmu.edu/mathstat/people/faculty-full-time/capaldi-alex.shtml" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.jmu.edu/mathstat/people/faculty-full-time/capaldi-alex.shtml" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Alex Capaldi</u></a>, a mathematician and statistician at James Madison University in Virginia, told Live Science. &#34;So if both of those processes are in play, then it is possible for the self-domestication hypothesis to beat the time constraint critique.&#34;</p><p>The scientists pointed out that while the model doesn&#39;t show exactly how wolves became domesticated, the model&#39;s results do mean self-domestication is a possibility.</p><p>Dogs are the earliest animal to be domesticated, so studying their evolution can help scientists better understand how domestication may work in other species.
