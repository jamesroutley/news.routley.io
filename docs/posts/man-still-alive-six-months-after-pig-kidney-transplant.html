This is the longest a pig organ has survived in a living person. Researchers say the outcome is a landmark case of successful <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00368-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00368-w" data-track-category="body text link">xenotransplantation</a> — the process of transplanting organs from animals to humans.</p><p>The recipient, Tim Andrews, had end-stage kidney disease and had been receiving dialysis for more than two years before he underwent the surgery in January. He has been dialysis-free since receiving the kidney. Andrews was one of three patients to receive genetically modified pig kidneys supplied by the biotechnology company eGenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on compassionate grounds.</p><p>Reaching six months’ survival is an amazing feat, says Wayne Hawthorne, a transplant surgeon at the University of Sydney in Australia. The first six months is the period of “highest risk for the patient and also the transplant”, he adds. Possible complications include anaemia and graft rejection, when the immune system attacks the new organ. “The six-month time point marks that things have gone extremely well,” Hawthorne says. Reaching 12 months would be another milestone and a “fantastic long-term outcome”, he adds.</p><p>Previously, the recipient with longest-surviving genetically modified pig organ was a 53-year-old US woman, Towana Looney, who had a functioning pig kidney for four months and nine days. However, the organ was removed earlier this year because her immune system began to reject it.</p><h2>Genetically modified</h2><p>Andrews received a kidney from a pig with three types of genetic modification. One involved the elimination of three antigens to prevent organ rejection; another the addition of seven human genes that reduce inflammation and the risk of bleeding complications. Retroviruses that are found in the pig genome were also deactivated.</p></div></div>
