It’s a process used to bond wires, cables, and electrically conductive materials via a filler metal, which is, <em>well ... </em>solder. Commonly used to assemble and fix electronics, it establishes a connection between wires and other metal surfaces—among many other uses. Sometimes conflated with welding, this process heats the adjoining metals, but doesn’t melt them.   </p><p data-node-id="2">Just last week, I broke out my soldering iron to fix a set of cheaply made <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/g36106404/best-outdoor-string-lights/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/g36106404/best-outdoor-string-lights/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="string lights">string lights</a>; the solder joints connecting the lights themselves to the power source had fizzled out—frankly, it had created an apocalyptic fire hazard.

Once you get the hang of things and have been soldering up a storm for a couple of years, you might want to upgrade to a nicer soldering iron. While these theoretically won’t get much hotter,  they’ll warm up more quickly and come packaged with an actual base station to put your soldering iron in while heating up. You’ll also get extras like removable soldering tips—narrower for intricate work and wider for bigger solder joints where you want to flow more heat.<br/></p><h2 data-node-id="8">Solder</h2><div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" data-node-id="9"><div><p><img alt="solder" title="solder" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0019-641dd092e6757.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.902xh;0.0345xw,0&amp;resize=320:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0019-641dd092e6757.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.902xh;0.0345xw,0&amp;resize=480:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0019-641dd092e6757.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.902xh;0.0345xw,0&amp;resize=640:* 1120w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0019-641dd092e6757.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.902xh;0.0345xw,0&amp;resize=640:* 1200w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0019-641dd092e6757.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.902xh;0.0345xw,0&amp;resize=640:* 1920w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0019-641dd092e6757.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.902xh;0.0345xw,0&amp;resize=640:*"/></p><p><figcaption><span>Trevor Raab</span></figcaption></p></div></div><p data-node-id="10">Solder may sound dead obvious to buy, given that we’re writing a story about it. It’s a metal alloy comprised of tin and lead (often 60 percent tin and 40 percent lead) used to bond items together. However, it’s easy to buy the wrong stuff as soldering can not only be used for electronics, but also for plumbing—different solders are designed for each discipline. <a href="https://www.team-blacksheep.com/products/prod:tbs_solder" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.team-blacksheep.com/products/prod:tbs_solder" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rosin-core solder">Rosin-core solder</a> is the best stuff to buy for electronics.

Here are some basic jobs that are perfectly manageable for beginners:</p><ul data-node-id="19"><li>Fixing an old set of string lights<br/></li><li>Upgrading speaker drivers<br/></li><li>Replacing guitar pickups</li><li>Lithium-ion battery replacement<br/></li></ul><p data-node-id="20">So where do you start? One of the best tips I can give you before you even touch your soldering iron is to get it as hot as possible. If you’re lucky enough to have a soldering iron that has a temperature knob, crank it to the max—for more basic soldering irons (that are always on when plugged in) let them warm up for longer. In any case, you’ll want that thing hotter than a seatbelt sitting in the summer sun all day.</p><p data-node-id="21">⚠️ <strong><u>CAUTION</u>:</strong> Running an iron hot makes things easier to solder, but also runs the risk of melting components. The best tip we can give you is to not leave the tip of your soldering iron on your electronics for longer than 2–3 seconds. Get in, get out, and you’re done. </p><p data-node-id="22">Preparation is the name of the game when it comes to making a clean connection, so we’re going to start by adding solder to both the wire and the pad that it’s being soldered to—this process is often referred to as <em>tinning</em>. </p><div data-embed="composite" data-node-id="23"><div><div><div size="medium" data-embed="body-image"><div><p><img alt="holding soldering iron to wire" title="holding soldering iron to wire" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0084-641dd1c0812de.jpg?crop=0.558xw:0.837xh;0.164xw,0&amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0084-641dd1c0812de.jpg?crop=0.558xw:0.837xh;0.164xw,0&amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0084-641dd1c0812de.jpg?crop=0.558xw:0.837xh;0.164xw,0&amp;resize=980:* 1120w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0084-641dd1c0812de.jpg?crop=0.558xw:0.837xh;0.164xw,0&amp;resize=980:* 1200w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0084-641dd1c0812de.jpg?crop=0.558xw:0.837xh;0.164xw,0&amp;resize=980:* 1920w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0084-641dd1c0812de.jpg?crop=0.558xw:0.837xh;0.164xw,0&amp;resize=980:*"/></p><p><figcaption><span>Trevor Raab</span></figcaption></p></div></div></div><div><div size="medium" data-embed="body-image"><div><p><img alt="hold the wire to the pad to melt the solder" title="hold the wire to the pad to melt the solder" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0092-641dd1f1e6e27.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.0259xw,0&amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0092-641dd1f1e6e27.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.0259xw,0&amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0092-641dd1f1e6e27.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.0259xw,0&amp;resize=980:* 1120w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0092-641dd1f1e6e27.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.0259xw,0&amp;resize=980:* 1200w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0092-641dd1f1e6e27.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.0259xw,0&amp;resize=980:* 1920w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0092-641dd1f1e6e27.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.0259xw,0&amp;resize=980:*"/></p><p><figcaption><span>Trevor Raab</span></figcaption></p></div></div></div></div></div><p data-node-id="24">Once everything is tinned and ready, all you need to do is hold the wire to the pad and melt the solder. As you’re applying heat with your soldering iron, it’s important to have the metal tip heating both the pad <em>and</em> the solder that’s going onto it—note the location where I’m placing the iron. This helps you achieve a much neater solder joint. When the solder warms up, you’ll be able to move the wire closer to the board. Remove the iron, keep the wire where it is, wait for the solder to cool off, and congratulations, you’ve successfully done soldering. With an ultra-hot soldering iron, it’s important to get in and get out quickly, or else you run the risk of damaging components.</p><div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" data-node-id="25"><div><p><img alt="electronic components with wires soldered to board" title="electronic components with wires soldered to board" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0141-641dd23d9dffb.jpg?crop=0.694xw:0.694xh;0.114xw,0.264xh&amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0141-641dd23d9dffb.jpg?crop=0.694xw:0.694xh;0.114xw,0.264xh&amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0141-641dd23d9dffb.jpg?crop=0.694xw:0.694xh;0.114xw,0.264xh&amp;resize=980:* 1120w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0141-641dd23d9dffb.jpg?crop=0.694xw:0.694xh;0.114xw,0.264xh&amp;resize=980:* 1200w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0141-641dd23d9dffb.jpg?crop=0.694xw:0.694xh;0.114xw,0.264xh&amp;resize=980:* 1920w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/soldering-tips-0141-641dd23d9dffb.jpg?crop=0.694xw:0.694xh;0.114xw,0.264xh&amp;resize=980:*"/></p><p><figcaption><span>Trevor Raab</span></figcaption></p></div></div><h2 data-node-id="26">Practice, Practice, Practice</h2><p data-node-id="27">I can say with absolute certainty that your first solder joints will likely be pretty dull and messy. However, there are plenty of ways you can practice without messing up expensive electronic components. One of the easiest is to find a buddy that already knows how to solder. Not only will he or she be able to train you up, but they’ll likely have old electronics that you can practice on. If not, some companies make <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TKBP933" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TKBP933" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="practice boards" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TKBP933" data-vars-ga-product-id="0df75b97-b54d-429c-af3d-9e0e774f8b6e" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TKBP933" data-affiliate-network="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;585e38ac-716f-4f92-9fbc-ca8721de9979&#34;,&#34;site_id&#34;:&#34;a4f9566a-1fd0-484c-b731-150b9bda9ffa&#34;,&#34;metadata&#34;:{},&#34;network&#34;:{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Amazon&#34;,&#34;metadata&#34;:{}}}" data-vars-ga-media-role="" data-vars-ga-media-type="" data-vars-ga-product-brand="SPEEDY BEE" data-vars-ga-product-price="$16.99" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="9bb0fe9a-38d7-4e2b-8d4b-a1c148143804" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="SPEEDY BEE" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="" data-vars-ga-gallery-id="" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)">practice boards</a><em></em>, which are just circuit boards full of pads that you can practice tinning and soldering wires to. </p><div data-node-id="28" data-interactive="VideoPlayer-1"><div><div data-embed="embed-video"><p><img width="2000" height="1000" alt="preview for Hone your Woodworking Skills and Build a Log Rack" title="Video player poster image" fetchpriority="auto" decoding="async" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/log-rack-1636034331.jpg?crop=0.995xw:1.00xh;0.00321xw,0&amp;resize=1120:*" size="auto" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/log-rack-1636034331.jpg?crop=0.995xw:1.00xh;0.00321xw,0&amp;resize=1120:* 2240w,https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/log-rack-1636034331.jpg?crop=0.995xw:1.00xh;0.00321xw,0&amp;resize=1024:* 2048w,https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/log-rack-1636034331.jpg?crop=0.995xw:1.00xh;0.00321xw,0&amp;resize=980:* 1960w,https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/log-rack-1636034331.jpg?crop=0.995xw:1.00xh;0.00321xw,0&amp;resize=640:* 1280w,https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/log-rack-1636034331.jpg?crop=0.995xw:1.00xh;0.00321xw,0&amp;resize=480:* 960w" loading="lazy"/></p></div></div></div><p data-node-id="29">Thankfully, there’s a very low probability that you’ll ruin the electronics you’re soldering, even if your work is a bit messy; I’ve never ruined any electronics with a soldering iron for what it’s worth. Most of the gains I’ve made from the moment I picked up a soldering iron until now have been working with smaller components and making cleaner solder joints. Start simple and work your way up to more complex jobs. </p><p data-node-id="31">Whether you’re fixing a set of string lights, putting together a custom-built drone, or fixing a lamp, the sense of accomplishment when you complete a successful job will always keep you looking for another new project.

Sure, it’s not an inherently difficult job, but there’s a lot of soldering involved.
