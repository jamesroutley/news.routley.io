    <div><p>As summer begins to fade, and autumn draws nearer, I reflect. </p></div>

          <div><div><h3><strong>Rhythms of nature</strong></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the traineeship, I was venturing into unfamiliar places. New areas, new reserves. But day after day, I learned. Now, I recognise a chiff chaff’s song, the smell of garlic mustard and the texture of English elm. I can now confidently make my way along winding woodland paths, which once bewildered me. It’s like returning to a place I always knew.</p>
<p>Over the last four months, I watched the Goslings grow and listened to the Cygnets chirp. Now they&#39;re all grown, and I hardly recognise them. But that is the nature of nature, things are forever changing.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  
  <div>
          <div><div><h3><strong>Discovery</strong></h3>
<p>Everyday was a new adventure, a new challenge. I learned to mend fences, teach children about minibeasts, create paths, survey ancient trees, design social media content, build benches, make new habitats, identify butterflies, maintain ponds, sharpen tools and so much more. Trying new things everyday, with the encouragement of London Wildlife Trust&#39;s amazing staff, making me realise I was capable of doing many things. Week by week, my confidence grew. </p>
<p>The traineeship has given me the opportunity to develop skills and the knowledge to pursue a career in conservation. Recently, I made a list of all the plant and tree species I had learned on the traineeship. If you would have told me four months ago that I would learn to identify almost 80 different species, I would have laughed. But, it actually happened. Now when I walk through a woodland, or through a meadow, or beside a river, I can identify many plants which used to be foreign to me. I’m determined to keep learning though, to pursue knowledge endlessly. Nature is so complex, there’s so much more I want to understand. So, as I come to the end of my traineeship, my promise to myself is to always keep learning, just like I have done for the last four months. </p>

<p>Before this traineeship, I thought London was a city devoid of wildlife. A concrete mass with no nature. When I thought of wildlife in London, I could only imagine foxes, the occasional hedgehog, garden birds and gulls. But now I realise London is brimming with wildlife! Over the course of my traineeship, I was amazed at the variety of animals and plants that share this city with us. I have seen Kingfishers, Stag Beetles, Woodpeckers, Slowworms, Deer, Wasp Spiders, Pipistrelle Bats, Emperor Dragonflies, Red Kites, Banded Demoiselle (Damselfly), Marbled White Butterflies and so much more.</p>
<p>We saw Arctic Terns in Walthamstow Wetlands, a species that migrates from the Arctic to the Antarctic every year! It&#39;s incredible that on their long journey each year, they choose to stop off in London. I was amazed to find out that Hutchinson&#39;s Bank, a site in south London, is home to many of the UK’s butterfly species. We conducted a butterfly survey which involved walking along transects through the reserve, and identifying any butterflies within 2m radius of our path. Along the way, we saw Small Blues, Dingy Skippers, Brimstones, Orange Tips, Peacocks, Red Admirals, Commas and more. Butterfly transects are completed weekly, from April to September. The data is used to monitor butterfly populations across the UK. </p>

<p>During the time I spent writing this blog, I came to a halt many times - in disbelief that 16 weeks had already almost come to an end. I’m sad my traineeship will be over soon, but I have gained so many valuable skills and expanded my knowledge, and I’m so excited to take my first steps into the conservation sector. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading my blog. I hope it’s inspired you to spend time in nature and discover London’s amazing natural spaces and wildlife.</p>
