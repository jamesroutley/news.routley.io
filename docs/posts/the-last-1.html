    <p>
      You&#39;ve done it. You&#39;ve launched the next great feature. You&#39;ve spent months working with your team to design, build, and test. It&#39;s
      in users&#39; hands. You&#39;re done.
    </p>

    <p>But are you really? Probably not.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve seen (and been on) so many projects that claim success and move on to the next thing when they are 99% done and fail to 
      complete the last 1%. This last 1% isn&#39;t just what separates a great product from a good product, it&#39;s what separates a product that
      <i>might not</i> eventually fail from one that <i>will</i> eventually fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what&#39;s in this last 1%? Here are some of the most frequently skipped things I&#39;ve seen:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Internal (maintenance) documentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>External (how-to/FAQ) documentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Performance metric instrumentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Easy-to-decipher performance metric dashboard</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Usage metric instrumentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Easy-to-decipher usage metric dashboard</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Error metric instrumentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Easy-to-decipher error metric dashboard</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Alerting</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Automated testing</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I know the temptation. I&#39;ve been there many times myself. After months of hard work and sleepless nights, you want to put it behind
      you and move on to the next thing. But don&#39;t. Take the time to finish the last 1%. It&#39;s worth it.
