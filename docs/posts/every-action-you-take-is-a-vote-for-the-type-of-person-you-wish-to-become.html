<p>The title of this blog is a quote from James Clear’s <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> book. The tl;dr of this book is a set of strategies to get 1% “better” each day.</p>



<p>If that’s the case (and I certainly agree), here are some of the recent votes I cast and why.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.smartcertificate.com/SmartCertificate/?1%7c910eb1aa-9ef0-4ed3-8a44-e8554e195d16%7cad8bdea7-dcff-43e7-9cb5-8e1ec3276077">Completed</a> a higher ed management curriculum in strategy and innovation.  I cast this vote so that I could learn new models for expressing existing or new ideas in a way that more effectively conveys the substance to stakeholders.  I also met a ton of wildly successful business leaders and faculty that I otherwise would not have had access to.</li><li>Worked with our engineering and management teams to re-plan a major project so that we can incorporate additional engineering resources and adjust to more aggressive timelines.  I cast this vote because our existing plan would not meet business objectives and that’s not my style.</li><li>Proposed structural changes for Red Hat engineering as a whole to set ourselves up for a more sustainable future (firm believer that structure dictates behavior).  I cast this vote because our strategic goals were drifting out of alignment with incentives and goals for the IC levels.</li><li>Met with Emerging Tech group to identify ways for them to support our managed services growth and technical strategy.  I cast this vote because while our CTO office incubates fantastic new and innovative technologies, we have to leverage those skills in different ways in the future.</li><li>Worked with an internal team on strategy documents to draft a position paper on “Open Services”.  I cast this vote because I believe firmly in Red Hat’s business model and want to see its core ethos carried forward into the managed services world.</li><li>Kept up my mentoring schedule.  I cast this vote because I want to remember how my mentors affected me and pay it forward.  Oliver Parker, here’s to you sir.</li><li>Worked with a small group of folks to create a coloring book on Site Reliability Engineering called <a href="https://github.com/operate-first/sre/raw/main/sre-coloring-book/red-hat-sre-coloring-book.pdf">Reliability Nightmares</a>.  Red Hat has over the years delivered a number of coloring books for topics we care about.  I cast this vote because “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/11/20/why-does-culture-eat-strategy-for-breakfast/?sh=28451c3e1e09">culture eats strategy for breakfast</a>” and I felt this would be a fun tool in fostering a <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/changing-company-culture-requires-a-movement-not-a-mandate">movement</a>.</li></ul>



<p>I’m still digesting the rest of this book, but wanted to get some basic thoughts about this particular quote written down.</p>



<p>What votes have you cast lately?</p>
