    <h1>Becoming an Amateur Polyglot</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p id="block0">Setting the stage</p><p id="block1">Being a polyglot is a problem of definition first. Who can be described as a polyglot? At what level do you actually “speak” the given language? Some sources cite that polyglot means speaking more than 4 languages, others 6. My take is it doesn’t matter. I am more interested in the definition of when you speak the language. If you can greet and order a coffee in 20 languages do you actually speak them? I don’t think so. Do you need to present a scientific document or write a newspaper worthy article to be considered? That’s too much. I think the best definition would be that you can go out with a group of native speakers, understand what they are saying and participate in the discussion that would range from everyday stuff to maybe work related stuff and not switching too often to English nor using google translate. It’s ok to pause and maybe ask for a specific word or ask the group if your message got across. This is what I am aiming for when I study a specific language. </p><p id="block2">Why learn a foreign language when soon we will have AI auto-translate from our glasses and other wearables? This is a valid question for work related purposes but socially it’s not. You can never be interacting with glasses talking in another language while having dinner with friends nor at a date for example. The small things that make you part of the culture are hidden in the language. The respect and the motivation to blend in is irreplaceable. </p><p id="block3">For reference here are the languages I speak at approximate levels:</p><ul><li id="block4">Greek - native</li><li id="block5">English - proficient (C2)</li><li id="block6">Spanish - high level (C1) active learning</li><li id="block7">French - medium level (B2) active learning</li><li id="block8">Italian - coffee+ level (B1) active learning</li><li id="block9">Dutch - survival level (A2) in hibernation</li></ul><p id="block10">Get started</p><p id="block11">Firstly, I think the first foreign language you learn could be  taught in a formal way with an experienced teacher. That will teach you the way to structure your thought process and learn how to learn efficiently. It’s common in Europe and non-English speaking countries to learn a second language at school. This guide is not about how to learn formally though. It’s about how to take up new foreign languages without a *permanent teacher (I will expand later). One of the most important things when learning a language is motivation. You either love the culture, the language itself (how it sounds and reads), a loved one or you are moving there or doing a long term stay. If you hate the language, it is mandatory that you learn it but you’d rather not then none of this will work. I found that to be the case with Dutch where while I did like the culture, I found the language pretty bad sounding (almost ridiculous hhh-hhh sounds) - sorry if you are Dutch. That resulted in me learning the minimum in 7 years while I picked up Italian in a summer. Now that you found your calling let’s proceed.</p><p id="block12">Methods &amp; Tools</p><p id="block13">I wholeheartedly recommend Memrise as an app for learning. It’s vastly better than Duolingo and much less repetitive and boring. It reminds you of words you have forgotten at regular intervals utilizing the spaced repetition learning techniques. It’s much more focused in everyday interactions and their unique selling point is videos of random people. It’s genius that they are asking native speakers on the street to pronounce words and phrases for you. Having a visual reference makes it much more engaging and sticks. In my experience, trying to learn a new word takes maybe 10 fictional time units and if I am in a real conversation and someone corrects me, it takes just that time and I will forever remember the face of the person correcting me and the place. In a smaller degree that’s how memrise works. But we need to be a bit more structured. After learning everyday phrases and words some grammar is in order. You can try to pick up a beginner grammar book and focus on very specific language structures and go easy on other ones. My advice for a new language that you want to pick up fast is:</p><ul><li id="block14">Learn only 4 tenses. Past for one time events, past continuous, present, future. These are enough to go by and explain yourself.</li><li id="block15">Skip conditionals and indirect speech and learn only a few important verbs in imperative form so you can give an order if need be.</li><li id="block16">If you are going there physically, learn words of everyday use such as cutlery, toilet things, city block stuff like the word fence, garbage can etc. If not, then focus on words that you will actually use such as in education,work,vacation as these are the discussions you will mostly have. (<span>fun story, I passed the C2 exam and then I realized I didn’t remember the word faucet when I went to the UK to visit a friend</span>). </li><li id="block17">Forget intonation if it’s not entirely necessary. Especially in French, there is no need to learn if a word takes a ` or ‘.</li><li id="block18">Don’t spend too much time memorizing if a noun is female or male in languages that are not easy to tell from the noun itself. Everyone will understand you in any case.</li><li id="block19">When you look up a word in one language, do it for all other languages too. The mind works like a database and each row has columns for each language you speak. Fill that database up!</li></ul><p id="block20">My favorite tools are:</p><ul><li id="block21">Memrise</li><li id="block22">Lexilize app (they have a spaced repetition technique only for words and a realtime dictionary I add words to when I watch movies or read articles. It also has lists of common groups of words for each language so you can focus on what I said earlier.</li><li id="block23">Internet website for quickly searching verb conjugation. Looking at the charts frequently will make you remember them. I usually repeat some charts when I read them mentally.</li><li id="block24">Preply* for hiring an occasional teacher by the hour online.</li><li id="block25">ChatGPT**</li></ul><p id="block26">*A note about hiring teachers by the hour. I explain to them what exactly I want and don’t want. In this specific case I want to practice speaking in different scenarios with a native speaker. I tell them to correct me. I usually send them pictures of a situation that we can expand on or photos of an event and then I start describing everything there is in the photo, the people, their fictional lives etc. What not to do: there is no value in paying a teacher to be your google translate. You can look up words later on your own. But you can ask the teacher for differences in words or how exactly to use them in sentences, there is a lot of nuance in synonyms. There is also no value in a teacher repeating the present tense verb chart to you.  </p><p id="block27">**How I use chatGPT. I use it to ask grammar questions or nuances between the use of words such as what I did with the live teacher. But the most fun is either starting up a chat with it in the target language about life, poetry and robots or making it create language games for me.</p><p id="block28">Pro tip: try the following prompt &#34;create a repeating game for me in <i>Italian</i> where I need to fill in the blanks with conjugated verbs in one of the following tenses: past continuous, present, simple future. After I give you my answer tell me if it’s right or wrong and if the latter, explain to me why. Then give me another exercise. Keep repeating the game forever&#34;.</p><p id="block29">It’s not my place of job to think how will the education industry cope with a teacher that costs $20/month but makes you wonder.</p><p id="block30">Continuous improvement</p><p id="block31">TV</p><p id="block32">After I have a basic grasp of the language I try to have daily exposure to it. For example Netflix is awesome for this. I start watching my favorite series and gradually make it more difficult for me. </p><p id="block33">Level 1 - Series in English or native language and subtitles in target language OR  Series in target language and subtitles in English or native language</p><p id="block34">Level 2 - Series in target language and subtitles in target language</p><p id="block35">Level 3 - Series in target language without subtitles </p><p id="block36">Books</p><p id="block37">If you reach a sufficient level in the target language you can also start reading books in it. What I do in order not to get bored with reading books I never intended to, I pick a book that I wanted to read that requires a medium level of understanding (reading Nietsche while learning German would be quite bold). I recommend reading the book using a Kindle so you can achieve 2 things: a) press on a word and immediately search the dictionary or a whole sentence and see the translation and b) when you end the book have a place that you can repeat and see all the unknown words you had.</p><p id="block38">Podcasts and news</p><p id="block39">I listen to the news in different languages every day. Sometimes I put hour long podcasts to listen to although if the subject is boring you will find your mind wandering.</p><p id="block40">I also switch Google news to other languages too but you may read too many local news that you don&#39;t care about.</p><p id="block41">Friends</p><p id="block42">Try to start messaging your friends that are native speakers (better to avoid at first other friends that are trying to learn the language because you may repeat their mistakes). Try to say a few words or kick start a conversation in a group with the native speaker. They will be happy to respond back unless they are Spanish(!) and they will reply back in English. You need to specifically tell Spaniards that you want to practice their language. I am kidding of course but I have multiple real-world examples of me having a chat going like: Hola como estas? (native speaker answers) I’m fine, how about you! (me) Todo bien, vamos hoy por la playa? (native speaker) Sure what time? (me) sobre las 7? (native speaker) OK great see you at the beach! (me irritated) amigo, entiendes que estoy hablando en tu idioma? (native speaker) yes but I also want to practice my English!</p><p id="block43">Final wisdom</p><p id="block44">There is always what I call an inflection point where the complicated pasta in your head starts to make sense and have structure. You finally see something behind the fog. This is the time that you feel like “I got this, I just have to keep going”. This is a good time to start having casual chats. It’s a mortal sin to wait until you are proficient in a language to start chatting because you are too shy or can’t accept being wrong or being corrected. You can’t learn a language like that, you need to dive deep now!</p><p id="block45">I usually remember my breakthrough chat in each language. It’s the time where I had a chat with someone for a long time and didn’t have to switch back to another language which usually happens around the 10 minute mark when you cannot support the whole conversation in the target language. In this breakthrough chat I may occasionally ask for a word or even look it up if it’s important but I don’t need to say whole sentences in another language. I remember the person, the place and many other details usually in these chats because your mind is working in overdrive and your neurons are firing up with happy excitement. Don’t drink too much in this chat. One glass of wine augments the chat, 3 glasses destroy it! Happy learning. I’m always up for a chat <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arisalexiseco/"><u>@arisalexiseco</u></a></p></div></div></div></div></div>
