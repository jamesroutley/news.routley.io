    <h1>Why to Not Write a Book</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-metadata">
        
        <p>A discussion of why I don’t intend to turn Gwern.net into a book, and how trying to write a book can harm writers.</p>
        
      </div><div id="markdownBody">
        
        <p>Along with asking about doing podcasts, people sometimes ask me whether I am going to write a book or turn Gwern.net into a book. To their surprise, I have no such intention. Writing a book can be harmful; for many writers, writing a book is about the last thing they should do (unless they feel a book bursting out of them, much like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facehugger" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facehugger#bodyContent" title="Facehugger">facehugger</a>).</p>
        <p>But how can I not want to write a <em>book</em>? And I get it: writing a book is the ultimate achievement for Western intellectuals—better than being arrested in a protest (because you don’t have to get sweaty), better than a PhD (because not so devalued), and better even than going to Harvard (because that mostly means you got lucky in admissions). It’s something I’ve definitely aspired to since I became a bookworm, to join the pantheon of authors shelved in my local library, to be able to hold <em>my</em> book in my hands, and carp about how ‘the publisher chose the cover’.</p>
        <section id="bad-reasons-for-books">
          
          <p>Yet, that’s the problem: I am in love with the idea of <em>having published</em> a book, but not with publishing <em>a specific book</em>. I want to have published a book and have the identity of ‘author’<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, in the same way one might want to have ‘learned to read Mandarin’ or ‘become a bodybuilder’, but not to actually sweat through memorizing (and then forgetting) endless arbitrary characters or hours in the gym (followed by gluttony as cruel as the starvation).</p>

          <p>It is easy for someone like a book agent or editor to suggest “hey, you should publish a book!”, since they aren’t the one writing it, and they have plenty on their plate. But what book, exactly, would I publish? “Gwern.net”? Leaving aside all the fun hypertext features, what would such a book be? It would have to be some sort of anthology, I suppose; but what a mongrel of an anthology it would be, if I look over my past few essays: <a href="https://hannahilea.com/review/the-last-unicorn" id="gwern-review-the-last-unicorn" title="‘Review Of &lt;em&gt;The Last Unicorn&lt;/em&gt;’, Gwern 2024">a review</a> of a children’s movie about unicorns, then the moral philosophy of <a href="https://hannahilea.com/review/timecrimes" id="gwern-review-timecrimes" title="‘&lt;em&gt;Timecrimes&lt;/em&gt;: Time Travel In Hell’, Gwern 2023">self-consistent time travel</a>, then there’s the <a href="https://hannahilea.com/dropcap" id="gwern-dropcap" title="‘Dropcap Generation With AI’, Gwern 2023">detailed technical tutorial</a> about generating fonts with 2023 generative AI models… (The anthology would not be ordered chronologically, safe to say.)</p>
          <p>I don’t feel enthused about it; but to make a book I would not be ashamed of, I would have to spend many hours revising, rewriting, stripping out hypertext features and deciding what should stay, reformatting for some arcane publisher workflow like EPUB (or worse). This is true whether it’s a big professional publication or a small boutique style, like the <a href="https://hannahilea.com/doc/www/www.greaterwrong.com/d3da45f18dc2a83fb731c453083f757a0337331b.html" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.greaterwrong.com/d3da45f18dc2a83fb731c453083f757a0337331b.html" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/tag/lesswrong-books?sortedBy=new&amp;format=preview&amp;theme=classic" data-url-original="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/lesswrong-books?sortedBy=new" title="LessWrong Books">LessWrong anthologies</a>—which are nice indeed, but I recall Oliver Habryka ballparking the necessary total effort at in the hundreds of man-hours. (For already-written LW posts!) And while I was in the middle of that, if I wanted to write something else, well, now I would get to feel extra-guilty about procrastinating on The Book™. I definitely won’t have time or energy to follow up on weird anomalies or interesting new rabbit-holes, and even if my output appears unaffected by The Book™, I am in reality eating my intellectual seed-corn and gradually falling out of date, as I neglect the ordinary work of reading &amp; discussion that may flower years later. (Authors who write books have a distinct tendency to <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/public-intellectuals-have-short-shelf-lives-but-why/" data-link-icon="Ss" data-link-icon-type="text">‘go stale’</a>.)</p>
          <p>I finish all this, and then what? Now it has to spend months working its way through the pipeline, still a distraction, and then—<em>mirabile dictu!</em>—it is done.</p>
          <p>Uh oh—that’s just the start, isn’t it? Now I have to go out and shill for pre-orders (as we are endlessly assured by apologetic authors that pre-orders are about the only sales number that matters these days and <em>oh god if you ever liked my writing please pre-order and don’t wait until afterwards just think of it as a donation if you have to but pre-order now</em>). If you opt for a low-key launch, skipping the pre-publication publicity campaign, well, you’re still going to have to publicize it once it’s out (<em>free copy to the first person to retweet this!</em>), and deal with reviews (soliciting them, specifically—you should be so lucky anyone actually wrote a review, good or bad, unsolicited) etc.</p>
          <p>And of course, the double-edged blade of the physical immutability of books as artifacts begins to cut both ways—now that your thoughts are committed to a book, you can never take them back or change them or tweak them. You are now in some respects frozen and reduced to a caricature, to a much greater degree watching your caricature self go around and about (<a href="https://hannahilea.com/doc/borges/1962-borges-borgesandi.pdf" id="borges-1962" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="&#39;Borges and I&#39;, Borges 1962">“Borges and I”</a>).</p>
          <p>So, a book is a lot of work for a writer, even if it is mostly already-written writing, which crowds out new writing or exploration, and which tends to freeze them in place. But it gets worse.</p>
          <p>A book commits you to a single task, one which will devour your time for years to come, cutting you off from readers and from opportunity; in the time that you are laboring over the book, which usually you can’t talk much about with readers or enjoy the feedback, you may be driving yourself <a href="https://hannahilea.com/doc/psychiatry/bipolar/energy/1989-jamison.pdf" id="jamison-1989" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="‘Mood Disorders and Patterns of Creativity in British Writers and Artists’, Jamison 1989">into depression</a>.</p>

          <p>PhD attrition rates are well-known, and much of it happens after qualifications, while writing the thesis; those who pay attention to biographies of writers will recall many more instances attested, if only in those odd lacuna to which biographers dismiss with a line entire years in which nothing seems to happen but a discarded manuscript.</p>
          <p>To these, I’ll add two case-studies that I often think about.</p>

            <h2><a href="#wait-but-why" title="Link to section: § &#39;Wait But Why?&#39;"><em>Wait But Why</em>?</a></h2>
            <p>The long-form essayist/blogger Tim Urban of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_But_Why" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_But_Why#bodyContent" title="Wait But Why">“Wait But Why”</a> (WBW) made a name for himself in the mid-2010s by writing long enthusiastic essays, leavened with crude but effective comics, about various rabbit-hole topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics#bodyContent" title="Cryonics">cryonics</a>, the rise of deep learning, willpower/procrastination etc; at his peak he became a <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/03/elon-musk-post-series.html" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="The Elon Musk Post Series">favored mouthpiece of Elon Musk</a>.

WBW… not so much. The reader will have one of two reactions: “who’s that?” and “oh yeah, whatever happened to him?”</p>
            <p>The answer is simple: on 2016-06-18, disgusted by the 2016 US Presidential election and American political trends (especially the Great Awokening), as he explains in his post-mortem, he <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2023/02/last-six-years.html" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="A Short History of My Last Six Years">decided to begin writing what would be a book</a> about politics, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="What’s Our Problem?"><em>What’s Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies</em></a> <span>(2023). This was a mistake.</span></p>
            <p>Re-emerging over half a decade later (or 2,440 days) to break his silence, he explains at length how it was a mistake: the scope kept sprawling, he kept thinking he was almost done only to redo more, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#bodyContent" title="Sunk cost § Fallacy effect">sunk cost fallacy</a> kept him from killing it, while he kept procrastinating and trying to do it all, to the extent that:</p>

            <p>Eventually, his girlfriend, then fiancee, then wife, got pregnant. The thought of having a kid while <em>still</em> writing the book terrified him into finishing it off before the pregnancy did.</p>
            <p>Was the book any good? I couldn’t tell you. I’ve never read it or seen anyone mention it; when I brought it up in a chat, only one person had read it (and they didn’t like it). I suspect many more people read his post about writing the book than will ever read the book.</p>
            <p>And one can see the impact looking at <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/archive" data-link-icon="♔" data-link-icon-type="text" title="Archive">his archives</a>. You do not need advanced statistics to see a change ~2016–2017 in the posting rate. (And this is neglecting that the later WBW posts are often short; counting words &amp; illustrations would probably show a larger loss.)</p>
            <p>Another way to put the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost#bodyContent" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a> is to note that if WBW had kept up its lowest pre-book annual rate (2015’s 11 posts), then instead of a total of 11 posts to show for <span title="The date range 2017–2024 lasted 7 years.">2017<span><sup>–</sup><sub>7</sub></span>2024</span> (ie. less than an average year), it would have <em>55</em> more (66 total) posts.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
          </section>
          <section id="anonymous">
            <h2><a href="#anonymous" title="Link to section: § &#39;Anonymous&#39;">Anonymous</a></h2>
            <p>In another case, the author has not written a post-mortem, but I think the same thing happened.</p>
            <p>Around roughly the same time as WBW, there was another popular Internet blogger and writer, who gave well-received talks; he too decided to write a book to sum it all up and popularize his views, and went silent.</p>
            <p>About 2–3 years later, I went to dinner with him; I tried to avoid bringing up the book at all, and felt I could sense his constant strain and anxiety that I would ask about it, which made conversation a little difficult. This depression was also clearly visible in their minimal online activity. I wondered if they would ever publish the book, or if the moment had already passed.</p>
            <p>And then <em>4 years</em> after that, somewhat to my surprise, the book finally came out—and it was good! It was positively reviewed and I still see it mentioned (which is more than &gt;99% of books can say), and people still ask occasionally “whatever happened to him?” (If you google his name, “what happened to <em>X</em>” is the first suggested search query.)</p>
            <p>So, the reward was real but modest. What was the cost? Unfortunately, he has not returned to his previous activities; so in his case, the opportunity cost appears to have been… <em>everything</em>. Everything he would’ve written if he hadn’t been writing the book. As far as I can tell, several years later, he has not begun writing another book nor taken up any major non-writing activities; he just exists—burned out by the trauma of writing the book. And you can’t fix burnout by doing the same kind of thing, I think, <a href="https://hannahilea.com/backstop#burnout" id="gwern-backstop--burnout">only totally different things</a>.</p>
            <p>This is regrettable.</p>
            
            <p>As a third case, one could mention Scott Alexander again—at the same time as WBW he was writing, and finishing (on 2017-05-17), his online fantasy novel <a href="https://unsongbook.com/" id="alexander-2015" data-link-icon="ℵ" data-link-icon-type="text" title="&#39;&lt;em&gt;Unsong&lt;/em&gt;&#39;, Alexander 2015"><em>Unsong</em></a>, which <a href="https://hannahilea.com/review/book#unsong-alexander-2017" id="gwern-review-book--unsong-alexander-2017">I enjoyed</a>. He has since been editing and polishing it up for publication, according to occasional mentions on SSC and later on ACX up to the present. After 7 years of ‘editing’ and negotiations for publication, during which “various things went wrong and I procrastinated”, a fan volunteered to <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/unsong-available-in-paperback" data-link-icon="SSC" data-link-icon-type="text,tri" title="&#39;&lt;em&gt;Unsong&lt;/em&gt; Available In Paperback&#39;, Scott Alexander 2024-04-31">help get it self-published on Amazon</a>. It’s nice that <em>a</em> book now exists, technically, but it feels like the mountain gave birth to a mouse, and one wonders if Scott Alexander would’ve been even more prolific <span title="The date range 2017–2024 lasted 7 years.">2017<span><sup>–</sup><sub>7</sub></span>2024</span> had he not had <em>Unsong</em> hanging from his neck…?</p>
            
            <p>And a fourth case would be The Last Psychiatrist: he stopped blogging in May 2014, a book having been mentioned, which arrived only in December 2020, almost 7 years later. Reviews were mixed, but one thing is clear—as of August 2024, he has not returned to any known public writing.</p>
            
            <p>Also worth mentioning Wildbow’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)#bodyContent" title="Worm (web serial)"><em>Worm</em></a>, supposedly undergoing intense editing—admittedly, quite necessary in <em>Worm</em>’s case—since <span>2013<sub>11ya</sub></span> for ebook &amp; print publication. Last I knew, it was still being edited, with no sign of <em>Worm</em> publication imminent; although meanwhile Wildbow has written at least 3 other web serials, of vast length &amp; at similar update speed, so it is unclear if the ‘editing’ has done him any harm.</p>

          <p>Now of course, there is a second kind of author: authors who write books with little discernible impact on their newsletter or blog. They sit down for an hour (statistically, <a href="https://hannahilea.com/morning-writing" id="gwern-morning-writing" title="‘What Is The Morning Writing Effect?’, Gwern 2011">in the morning</a>), pound out their quota, and turn to the next task. The book does not weigh on their minds, and they are confident that they will have it out, as usual, in 12 months. More power to them—but I also think that most would-be book authors already know if they are one of <em>that</em> latter kind of writers, or if they are the former kind I’ve been discussing.</p>
          <p>If they are the former kind, then they should seriously doubt any plan to write a book: why do they think they will finish? Or that it will be worthwhile? Is there a clear professional reason that the writing has to be a <em>book</em>? (Unless they are named “J. K. Rowling”, they can usually rule out “sales” as an adequate professional reason.)</p>
          <p>More importantly, what will the effect on <em>them</em> be? And what is the opportunity cost of writing a book: if they spend the next 5 years devoting all their energies to a book, what will be excluded? Would they happily throw everything they wrote in the previous 5 years into a fireplace in exchange for a finished manuscript of the book they are fantasizing about? Would they willing to wager everything they might ever write on the book going well, rather than becoming an albatross and burning them out? If I had decided in 2019 to write up “a book about AI” in the wake of my <a href="https://hannahilea.com/gpt-2" id="gwern-presser-2019-poetry" title="‘GPT-2 Neural Network Poetry’, Gwern &amp; Presser 2019">GPT-2 experiments</a><span>, say, and only published it in 2024, and sacrificed writing like</span> <a href="https://hannahilea.com/scaling-hypothesis" id="gwern-scaling-hypothesis" title="&#39;The Scaling Hypothesis&#39;, Gwern 2020">“The Scaling Hypothesis”</a> <span>(visionary in May 2020, hopelessly obsolete in August 2024), would I be better off than I am now?</span><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
          <p>I suspect that if many writers took seriously writing a book as a real project, rather than an aspirational cultural ideal of ‘being an author’ along the lines of ‘being a foreign language speaker’ or ‘being a PhD’, they would realize that it is a serious risk which can backfire. Everyone may have a book inside them, but some should keep it inside them.</p>
          <p>And for now, should a book come out of me despite my best efforts, I will take off and nuke it from orbit. (It’s the only way to be sure.)</p>
