<p>Some of India‚Äôs top wrestlers, led by Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, and Sakshi Malik, were detained by Delhi Police on Sunday, May 28, after they had been stopped from marching towards the new Parliament building from their site of protest at Jantar Mantar.

</p> <p>According to <a href="https://theprint.in/india/naya-desh-mubarak-ho-says-vinesh-phogat-as-police-detain-wrestlers-before-stir-near-new-parliament/1598650/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThePrint</a>, eight to nine buses filled with protesters were taken to different police stations. The police then removed all the tents, hoardings, and the Tricolour that the wrestlers had put up. The protest site at Jantar Mantar was emptied by the police who also took down all the arrangements the wrestlers had made for themselves.</p> <p>After the wrestlers were taken into custody, a selfie of Vinesh Phogat, Sangeeta Phogat and others apparently clicked in a police vehicle started circulating on social media, with the claim that the wrestlers were seen smiling even after being detained by the police.</p> <p>Abhijit Majumder, who describes himself as a journalist in his Twitter bio, shared the viral image and wrote, ‚ÄúMission Toolkit accomplished. #WrestlersProtest‚Äù.

</p> <p>Coming to the details of the viral image itself, we found that the image had been morphed using Artificial Intelligence app called FaceApp. We performed the same exercise on the original image tweeted by Mandeep Punia and found the exact viral image. This exercise was also performed by journalist Uzair Rizvi in a <a href="https://twitter.com/RizviUzair/status/1662816753624424449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a>.</p> <p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/831159639" width="810" height="456" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> <p>Moreover, Vinesh and Sangeeta Phogat have dimples in the viral image. By comparing Vinesh and Sangeeta‚Äôs faces in the viral image with images from their Instagram accounts, we found that neither of the sisters has a dimple. (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Coy9LoZNHLJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sangeeta‚Äôs Instagram picture</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg82oXXL5kK/">Vinesh‚Äôs Instagram picture</a>)</p> <p>This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p> <p>Some users also shared a video of Vinesh Phogat smiling and waving from the police vehicle, while she was being taken away. Users sarcastically asked if the video of her smiling was also edited. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230529101110/https://twitter.com/MrSinha_/status/1662845862635257856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive</a>)</p> <blockquote> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Is this video also edited? <a href="https://t.co/eR7ocqhwlk">https://t.co/eR7ocqhwlk</a> <a href="https://t.co/KilrZdVYR2">pic.twitter.com/KilrZdVYR2</a></p> <p>‚Äî Mr Sinha (@MrSinha_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrSinha_/status/1662845862635257856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote> <p>In reality, Vinesh was sarcastically saying ‚ÄúNaya Desh Mubarak Ho‚Äù (Translation: Congratulations on a new India) while being taken away by the police. The video was taken out of context by the above user. In this video too, one can clearly see that Vinesh Phogat does not have a dimple.</p> <p>Hence, a selfie taken by wrestlers Vinesh Phogat, Sangeeta Phogat and others in a police van while being taken away for detention has been edited using an Artificial Intelligence app to show that the wrestlers were smiling. The narrative was grossly manipulated to show that the protest was just a propaganda tactic.</p> <div><p><span><strong>Donate to Alt News!</strong></span></p></div> <p id="jp-relatedposts"> <h3><em>Related</em></h3> </p> </div></div>
