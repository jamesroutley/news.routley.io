    <h1>How will the correction in the stock market impact startup fundraising?</h1>

  <p>The public software sector is weathering the second deepest multiple contraction in the last decade. Only the 2016 reduction of 57% surpasses it. Public market investors are rotating out of high growth technology companies as the Fed’s policies of quantitative easing, asset purchases, and low rates abate.</p>

<p>The question on every software founder’s mind today must be, how will this affect the private financing markets? As a company’s scale approaches that of a public company, the greater the impact on their fundraising.</p>

<p>Three corrections in the last ten years have contracted multiples by 40% or more. These are marked in peachpuff orange rectangles above. The Series D mean round size is plotted in red. 2014’s correction stalled and then reversed Series D round sizes for 2 years through the second correction in 2016. For the next 3 years, Series Ds increased in size until the late 2019/early 2020 correction of 41%.</p>
<p>If history serves as an occasionally-correct guide, later stage valuations should flatten and fall in 2022, especially in light of the doubling of round sizes in the last 18 months.</p>

<p>Series As don’t imitate this pattern, remaining insulated from the vacillations of the market. Corrections may subdue the growth rates, but haven’t reversed them in the past.</p>
<p>One could argue the slopes in the round sizes differ from last time. Ds doubled in 18 months starting in 2016, and again doubled from $75m to $150m in 2020-2021 - so the growth has been steeper on the way up and that may suggest a more sudden correction on the other side of the peak.</p>
