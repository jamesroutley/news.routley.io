    <h1>Longform.org Is Shutting Down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><b>Readers,</b></p>
<p><b>Longform.org is shutting down its article recommendations service. (The Longform Podcast will continue to publish new episodes weekly.)</b></p>
<p><b>We started the site in April 2010 on a whim. Since then, we have recommended more than 10,000 pieces of nonfiction. It has been immensely gratifying to watch millions of readers enjoying the work of our favorite writers.</b></p>
<p><b>Thank you to Longform.org&#39;s contributing editors, its supporters, and the publications, writers, and readers who made it all possible. We will miss you.</b></p>
<p><b><em>-Max Linsky &amp; Aaron Lammer, founders</em></b></p>
