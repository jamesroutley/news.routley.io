    <h1>Is Show HN Dead? No, but It&#39;s Drowning</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><a href="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/">← Back</a><p>Feb 17, 2026 · Arthur Cnops</p><p>A few days ago I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47023255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to Show HN</a>. I had good fun building that useless little internet experience. The post quickly disappeared from Show HN&#39;s first page, amongst the rest of the vibecoded pulp. And to be clear, I&#39;m fine with that.</p>
<p>The behavior on Show HN was interesting to see though. So I pulled the data.</p>
<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Show HN of course isn&#39;t dead. You could even say it&#39;s more alive than ever. What has changed is the volume of posts and engagement per post. It&#39;s only natural when more projects are being built in a single weekend. There&#39;s less &#34;Proof of Work&#34;.</p>
<p>From the business side of this, Johan Halse recently called this <a href="https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2026/02/03/the-sideprocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sideprocalypse</a>: the end of the small indie developer&#39;s dream. Every idea has been built, marketed better, and SEO&#39;d into oblivion by someone with more money.</p>
<p>Some cool projects aren&#39;t getting through this noise, which is a pity. Here are a few I thought were interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47012984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neohabit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenRun</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47003384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uForwarder</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I just upvoted them!</p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s look at some data.</p>
<h2>Volume Is Exploding</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-share.svg" alt="Show HN monthly share of all HN story volume"/></p>
<h2>The Graveyard Is Growing</h2>

<p>Show HN started out <em>better</em> than regular submissions. Now it&#39;s significantly <em>worse</em>.</p>
<h2>The Shrinking Window</h2>
<p>How long does a Show HN post stay on page 1 before being pushed off? During peak hours (US daytime):</p>

<h2>Discussion Is Dying Too</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-comments.svg" alt="Average comments per Show HN post"/></p>
<h2>So Is Show HN Dead?</h2>
<p>No. There&#39;s just more noise, and less opportunity to get attention and have a discussion with other folks on HN about your project. Some gems go completely unnoticed. Maybe something for HN to think about: how do these subjective &#34;gems&#34; get more spotlight? How does HN remain the coolest place to talk about the coolest tech?</p>
