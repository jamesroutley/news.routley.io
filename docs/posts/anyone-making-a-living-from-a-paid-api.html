    <h1>Ask HN: Anyone making a living from a paid API?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Are there any solo devs or small teams out there genuinely paying their rent from selling API access?</p><p>What&#39;s your API? How much MRR? What&#39;s your pricing model? How did you find your first paying customers? And most importantly - what problem are you solving that people will actually pay for monthly?</p><p>Bonus points if you can share:
- Your biggest challenge (rate limiting? customer support? competition?)
- Whether you&#39;d do it again
- Any &#34;I wish I knew this before starting&#34; wisdom</p></div></div></div>
