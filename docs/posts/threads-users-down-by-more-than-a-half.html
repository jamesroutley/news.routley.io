We&#39;re not there yet,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Zuckerberg - who made the comments in a call to employees, heard by the Reuters news agency - described the situation as &#34;normal&#34; and said he anticipated retention to improve as new features were added to the app.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Threads <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66155433">was criticised</a> for the limited functionality it had when it launched.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Meta has since added new features, such as separate &#34;following&#34; and &#34;for you&#34;&#39; feeds, and increased scope to translate posts into different languages.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company&#39;s chief product officer, Chris Cox, told staff it was now focused on adding more &#34;retention-driving hooks&#34; to draw people back to the platform.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He gave the example of &#34;making sure people who are on the Instagram app can see important Threads&#34;. The two platforms are closely tied - in order to sign up for Threads, users must have an Instagram account.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Zuckerberg also updated employees on the company&#39;s enormous bet on a yet-to-be-created virtual reality world, called the Metaverse.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He said work on the augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology that would power it was &#34;not massively ahead of schedule, but on track&#34;, adding that he didn&#39;t anticipate it going mainstream until the next decade.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That prediction may intensify concerns that Meta has dedicated too much time and money to the Metaverse - its Reality Labs division, which produces VR headsets and other products, has racked up <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66027073">multi-billion dollar losses.</a></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The company as a whole though continues to perform well financially - announcing this week it made <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66316712">a profit of $7.79bn in the last quarter</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Mr Zuckerberg also addressed one other headline-making issue - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65981876">his proposed cage fight with fellow tech titan Elon Musk</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>From the safety of their keyboards, the two men indicated in June that they were both keen on a bout - even going as far as suggesting a venue in Las Vegas.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, when pressed about it on the call, Mr Zuckerberg said he was &#34;not sure if it&#39;s going to come together&#34;.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
