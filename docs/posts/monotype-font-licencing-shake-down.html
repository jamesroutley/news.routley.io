  <p>tl;dr Don’t try to shake-down a typography nerd with your dubious, automated claims about his employer using unlicensed fonts.  </p><h2>How it started</h2><p>It started with a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543895/inmail-overview?lang=en">InMail</a> message (sanitised to protect privacy):  </p><blockquote><p><strong>Subject: [Urgent] Font Software Licensing Review</strong>  </p><p>Hi Ameel</p><p>I hope you’re doing well.</p><p>I’m [NAME] from Monotype and have been trying to reach you at [WORK EMAIL ADDRESS], but I’m unsure if my emails have been received.</p><p>Our team has identified Monotype font software embedded in the websites/apps of [YOUR COMPANY], but we couldn’t locate the corresponding licenses in our database.</p><p>Would you be able to share the correct email address so I can provide more details and documentation? Alternatively, you’re welcome to reach out to me directly at [SENDER’S EMAIL ADDRESS]</p><p>I appreciate your time and look forward to resolving this with you at your earliest convenience.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>[NAME]</p><p>Business Development Representative | Monotype, Australia</p></blockquote><p>I was puzzled by this for two reasons:  </p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>This person had my correct work email address, but at no point had they sent me an email about this issue or about anything else. I checked. (Starting with a lie? Not a good look.)</p></li><li><p>As far as I knew, my employer didn’t use <em>any</em> Monotype fonts on its websites and apps.  </p></li></ol><h2>Always good to check</h2><p>Just in case there was any merit to this claim, I did a quick review and found that I was right. In Australia we have one corporate website, one retail website, and one retail app (with iOS and Android versions) and all of those use our official font which, for better or for worse, is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a>.</p><p>Now, not only is Open Sans <em>not</em> a Monotype typeface, it is available under the <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font License</a> (OFL) meaning we can <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/how-to-use-ofl-fonts/">use this typeface</a> for literally anything except selling the font itself. So that couldn’t be what this person was talking about.  </p>

  <h2>Fishing (phishing?) around</h2><p>What the Monotype rep did next is kind of what a malicious hacker does when they’re trying to get someone from your company to click on a link that’ll install malware on your computer. Over the next couple of weeks, the rep messaged a dozen or so more people from different parts of the business, hoping to hook just one person who would reply to the scary message they were sending.</p><p>Now I’d already emailed my design, brand, and digital team colleagues to tell them about this mass-messaging campaign and our plan of action for it, but the Monotype rep expanded their campaign to include people from our procurement team, who I hadn’t thought to forewarn.  </p><p>So not long after, I received a message from one of my procurement team colleagues who’d been forwarded that LinkedIn message from their senior manager with an instruction to deal with this. I explained to my colleague that, as far as I could tell, this Monotype campaign was similar to the <a href="https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/consumers-and-businesses/scams/small-business-scams/domain-name-scam">domain name scams</a> the procurement team is already familiar with. So please sit tight till our digital team colleagues have completed their audit and then we’ll figure out which one person should start the conversation with Monotype.</p><p>But, like any successful phishing campaign, the Monotype rep’s LinkedIn messages eventually reached someone who did respond. This was another person in the procurement team and, just to be completely clear, I don’t blame them for responding. They were just doing their job of protecting our business from potential copyright liability.  </p><h2>Being forced to deal with the issue  </h2><p>Since I’d handed this over to the digital team, I hadn’t kept track of how things were progressing. I was brought back into the discussion when our brand manager included me in an email thread between her and the procurement person who’d responded to Monotype.  </p><p>I quickly brought this second procurement person up to speed with our earlier plan of action and then I looped in the digital team again. Turns out the digital team had completed their audit, found that we were in compliance, but had gotten busy with other work so no one had responded to Monotype. *sigh*</p>

  <p>Now, of course, everyone was on the back foot because our new procurement rep had shared the PDF that Monotype had sent, listing all the places where we <em>were </em>using Monotype fonts without a proper licence.  </p><p>And, to quote from the procurement rep’s email:  </p><blockquote><p>Supplier has confirmed two options:</p><p>Past Use License Agreement is used (PULA) to cover the usage for the period without a license if the software is to be removed.</p><p>Process the PULA with a Go Forward license agreement to allow compliant continued use of the fonts in use.</p></blockquote><p>Reading that, I got this procurement rep to quickly convene a meeting with everyone involved, though it turned out the person from the digital team who’d done the font audit had gone on annual leave.</p><p>The rest of the digital team didn’t know anything about font licencing and this was the first time this procurement rep was dealing with font licencing as well. So, partly spurred on by their senior manager’s instruction to deal with this, the procurement rep was seriously considering paying the licencing fee that Monotype had asked for, just to make this whole headache go away.  </p><p>This is where I jumped in and told everyone to hold up. I said I would take the lead on this internally and I would take over the discussion we were having with Monotype as well. The procurement rep, I think somewhat relieved to have this taken out of their hands, agreed.  </p><p>Why did I insist on taking this over? Two reasons: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.insanityworks.org/typography">I’m a bit of a typography nerd</a> so I know what I’m talking about and</p></li><li><p>a quick look at the document Monotype had sent over with the list our alleged copyright infringements had told me that <em>everything</em> the Monotype rep was alleging was wrong.  </p></li></ul>

  <h2>Never send an AI to do a human’s job</h2><p>An April 2025 blog post from Studio Twofold’s Jamie Walker titled ‘<a href="https://studiotwofold.com.au/unlicensed-fonts-hidden-risk-in-branding/">Unlicensed Fonts: The Hidden Risk in your Branding</a>’ opens with:  </p><blockquote><p>Lately, we’ve seen a noticeable uptick in copyright issues related to both images and fonts. Several clients have reached out after receiving emails about fonts [an] agency used on their site years ago.</p><p>Naturally, they’re a bit rattled — and with good reason. These kinds of copyright claims can come with hefty fees if you’re found to be in breach.</p></blockquote><p>Further down Jamie writes:  </p><blockquote><p>Smaller businesses can get caught off guard — and with <a href="https://www.redpoints.com/usecase/copyright-infringement-protection/">AI now scanning the web for even the tiniest copyright infringements</a>, it’s more important than ever to stay protected.</p><p>Think they’re only picking on the small guys? Think again. Even giants have been caught out – proving no one is too big to face the music (or in this case, the typography).</p></blockquote><p>Basically, the reason so many organisations are getting out-of-the-blue copyright claims these days is because major copyright holders have started using automated, AI-powered copyright infringement detection software, of which there is a lot out there. *sigh*</p><p>Monotype seems to have used one of these products too, because the two fonts its report claimed we were using without a valid licence are:  </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/credit-cards-p01-font-monotype-imaging">Credit Cards</a> in our iOS and Android apps and</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova/">Proxima Nova</a> in one of our project websites.  </p></li></ul><p>Let’s take those one at a time, shall we?</p>

  <p>Having worked with a great many font files over the years, when I saw that filename I thought to myself, “Are we sure that’s <em>actually</em> the Credit Cards font that Monotype claims it is?”  </p><p>So I checked. I did a web search for fonts with “credit card” in their name and very quickly found one called ‘<a href="https://www.k-type.com/fonts/credit-card/">Credit Card</a>’ – singular – from K-Type. This is a regular text font (as opposed to an icon font) that looks like the raised text that’s printed on credit cards.  </p>

  <p>Yup, the filename is <strong>CREDC___.ttf</strong> – which is <em>exactly</em> the filename that was in the app payload analysis from Monotype.  </p><p>Seeing this, I reached out to my design team contact who then got me in touch with the person who manages our smartphone apps. From them I found out that, sure enough, the only font over and above Open Sans that we use in our smartphone apps is Credit Card by K-Type.  </p><p><strong>SCORE: Ameel 1, Monotype 0</strong></p><h3>Proxima Nova, really?</h3><p>Unlike the Credit Cards font, our use of Mark Simonson’s <a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova/">Proxima Nova</a> was never in contention. We clearly use it in one of our project websites. My employer didn’t actually build that website – we bought this under-construction project from another entity – but this website is very much our responsibility now.  </p><p>The problem for Monotype here was that it no longer sells licences to Proxima Nova. There was a time you could buy a licence to Proxima Nova from Fonts.com, which was Linotype’s online marketplace. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotype_Imaging">Monotype</a> bought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergenthaler_Linotype_Company">Linotype</a> and eventually killed off Fonts.com and, some time after that (I don’t know when or why), the font’s designer stopped selling licences to Proxima Nova through MyFonts.com.  </p>

  <p>Of course learning this fact didn’t mean that I was just going to stop my investigation. I reached out to a person, who reached out to a person, who reached out to the design agency that designed (and still maintains) our project website. The design agency contact did their own investigation and quickly confirmed that, yes, they do indeed have a licence to use Proxima Nova on this site – one that they had <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova">purchased from Adobe</a> several years ago.  </p><p><strong>SCORE: Ameel 2, Monotype 0</strong></p><h2>Closing the book on this whole affair</h2><p>Armed with this knowledge, I got the procurement person to introduce me to the Monotype rep. The rep and one of their colleagues were very eager to talk, replying to this introductory email within fifteen minutes. They wanted to organise a meeting so they could finally get the font licencing agreement signed. Instead what they got was a long email from me in which I explained the situation in detail, complete with annotated screenshots like the one above :)</p><p>The Monotype rep chewed on this for a few days and then made one final attempt at getting money out of us. They agreed that they were currently unable to sell a licence to Proxima Nova, but it turns out Monotype is one of K-Type’s authorised resellers and [they] “currently cannot see the license on our files for this use” – meaning there wasn’t a record of us purchasing a licence to Credit Card from Monotype. So could we please “confirm if there is one that we for some reason are unable to see in our systems?”.  </p><p>*sigh*</p><p>I wrote back and told them the reason Monotype doesn’t have a record of this licence is because we purchased a one-off Enterprise Licence directly from K-Type several years ago.</p><p>This was several weeks ago and I haven’t heard a peep from them since.  </p><p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

  <h2>Two sides to the story</h2><p>Despite my making light of the situation, I don’t actually hate Monotype for doing this. Using fonts without purchasing a proper license (or purchasing the fonts outright) is stealing and you absolutely should not do it.  </p><p>The fact that font licensing can be a complicated issue is not an excuse; lots of things are complicated and we figure them out.  </p><p>More importantly, I think the type designers and type foundries that create fonts should be fairly compensated for their work. Paying for fonts, or an ongoing licence to those fonts, is how you do that.  </p><p>In short, you should pay for fonts and you should call out people and organisations when they use fonts without a proper licence.</p><p>(For completeness’ sake, I should say that I also don’t mind that Monotype used automated systems to find copyright violations. The internet is so large that it’s impossible to manually find all the people who have stolen your stuff!)   </p><h3>It’s not what you do, it’s how you do it</h3><p>That said, I hate how Monotype’s business development people went about doing this. Much like the blatantly overzealous content blockers on YouTube, the Monotype reps who reached out to us didn’t even bother to verify whether the report their AI spat out at them showed an actual copyright violation or not.  </p><p>I mean, I know why they didn’t double-check. Just like with scammers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishers</a>, this is a volume game, not an accuracy or fairness game. You bombard people with messages, scaring them with your (potentially unverified) claims, and eventually some of the thousands of people you’ve messaged will reply. You then rush these folks into paying a licence fee because your targets don’t have enough information about font licencing and, frankly, they just want the problem to go away. This is a shitty way to do business and it reflects poorly on your organisation.  </p>

  <h3>You’re not making any friends</h3><p>Not that reputation seems to matter too much to popular digital marketplaces – Amazon being the poster child for this. They’re big, they’re arguably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittified</a>, and all they appear to care about is making as much money as possible.  </p><p>I mean there’s a reason why so many type designers urge people not to licence fonts – even their own fonts – from MyFonts and instead buy or licence fonts directly from designer and type foundry websites. And, barring that, buying or licencing fonts from smaller, independent stores like <a href="https://www.fontspring.com/">Fontspring</a> instead.</p><p>This is also why <a href="https://typetype.org/font-subscription/">TypeType</a> and <a href="https://fontstand.com/apps/">Fontstand</a> offer font subscriptions that are alternatives to those from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/">Adobe Fonts</a> and Monotype.  </p><p>And this is why, for example, the independent video streaming site <a href="https://nebula.tv/">Nebula</a> was forced to design their custom <a href="https://www.nebulasans.com/">Nebula Sans</a> font. Nebula’s website and streaming apps used to use the Screen Smart version of the <a href="https://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/styles/screensmart">Whitney</a> font from <a href="https://www.typography.com/">Hoefler&amp;Co</a>. But when Monotype purchased Hoefler&amp;Co, the <a href="https://foundrysupport.monotype.com/hc/en-us/articles/15723177145236-Monotype-Fonts-Royalty-Model">new Monotype licencing/royalty structure</a> meant that a licence to Whitney was suddenly unaffordable to Nebula. Since paying that (apparently much) higher amount to Monotype wasn’t going to be financially sustainable, Nebula instead paid Paul D. Hunt, the original designer of the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans_3">Source Sans</a> font, to modify his font so it would be a drop-in replacement for Whitney in all of Nebula’s digital products. And because Source Sans was released under the SIL Open Font License, Nebula also released Nebula Sans under this OFL.  </p><p>If that’s how much effort folks are willing to make to to avoid using your company, you probably already know that you’re not very well loved.  </p>
