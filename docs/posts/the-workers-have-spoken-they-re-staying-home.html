<p>I’m sorry, Dell. This is 2024, not 2014. Now that people have gotten a taste of working from home, they’re not going back to the office. You’d think that would be clear by now — now just at Dell, but almost everywhere.</p>

		
		
			


<p>Why? Let me count the reasons:</p>



<ol>
<li> No commute on crowded highways;</li>



<li> A better life/work balance;</li>



<li> Cost savings;</li>



<li> Flexibility to choose where to live (and work).</li>



<li> More control over your workplace.</li>
</ol>



<p>I’ve been working from home for decades, which makes me something of an exception compared to a lot of workers. But my experience holds for people who got their work-from-home start during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>I used to work out of a Manhattan office, but I lived in New Carrollton, Maryland. How did I do it? I took Amtrak to work on Monday and returned home on Friday. I’d joke that I walked to work — first to my local train station and then from Penn Station to the office. There were just a few hours in the middle when I’d work from the dining car. </p>



<p>More often than not, though, I’d just work from home. </p>



<p>When I decided to move to Asheville, NC, in 2001, my bosses agreed to let me move because, as I told them then, I could always catch a same-day flight if they really needed me in the office. But, as I told them, I doubted there would be any reason I’d need to be there.</p>

<p>I was right. While I still fly to New York City occasionally for work, I never had to be there for the job. </p>



<p>Better still. I had more time to be home — and I saved money to boot. It’s cheaper to make a sandwich in my kitchen than to get lunch at a deli near the office in midtown Manhattan. Finally, I love living in mountainous and green Asheville rather than the flat and asphalt-covered area inside the Washington, DC beltway.</p>



<p>In short, I’m happy working at home and have been for more than two decades. Most <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075520/why-even-hybrid-return-to-office-mandates-are-hurting-overall-job-satisfaction.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075520/why-even-hybrid-return-to-office-mandates-are-hurting-overall-job-satisfaction.html">people who work from home feel the same</a>. </p>

<p>Companies might want people’s rumps back in office chairs, but according to a recent Gartner report, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-01-30-gartner-hr-research-finds-high-performers-women-millennials-are-greatest-flight-risks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">48% of employees say their company’s mandates prioritize what leaders want</a> rather than what employees need to do good work.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s right. At far too many companies, the desire for control trumps what people really need to do their best work. </p>



<p>In particular, Caitlin Duffy, the Gartner HR practice director, said: “High-performing employees are more easily able to pursue opportunities at organizations that offer hybrid or fully remote policies.” </p>

<p>If they don’t get those work-from-home opportunities, they’ll leave. That, in turn, “means <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138277/senior-employees-ordered-back-to-the-office-are-jumping-ship.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138277/senior-employees-ordered-back-to-the-office-are-jumping-ship.html">losing high-performers to attrition</a>, costs organizations in terms of productivity, [can cause] difficulty in backfilling the role, and the overall loss of high-quality talent available to fill critical positions,” Duffy said.</p>



<p>Ding! Ding! Ding! </p>



<p>Here’s another piece of evidence that people are not, in capital letters, returning to the office.  According to the latest Moody’s commercial real estate analysis, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/09/office-vacancy-rate-record-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">office vacancy rates have never been higher</a>. Just over one in five offices is now vacant. (The only reason that percentage isn’t higher is that companies have yet to be able to get out of long-term leases.)</p>

							<div>


<p>Might I note that once that lease has ended, companies  won’t have to pay for that office space. It’s a win-win  —unless your business is commercial real estate.</p>



<p>Put it all together, and what do you get? You get the new work culture of the early-mid-21st century and beyond. It’s all work from home from here on out, folks. </p>



<p>Deal with it. And enjoy it. </p>
