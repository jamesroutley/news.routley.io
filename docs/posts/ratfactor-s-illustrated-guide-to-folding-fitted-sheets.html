<p><strong>Note to the impatient:</strong> You can just scroll down to the drawings of fitted
sheets being folded. You won’t hurt my feelings. (I’ll never even know.) But
you may want to bookmark this page for later instead. You can get fast at
folding fitted sheets. But to <em>learn</em> how to fold fitted sheets is going to
take some patience. I do not recommend learning anything, and especially not
anything that involves elastic, when you’re in a hurry.</p>
<hr/>
<div>
<p>I used to believe that folding a fitted sheet
<a href="http://thedoghousediaries.com/4491">was a task improved by an accelerant</a>
(thedoghousediaries.com).</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps you feel this way as well?</p>
<p>Well, one night, I found myself with an unfolded fitted sheet and a half-serious
desire to learn how to fold it once and for all.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-goals1.png" alt="A Mastodon toot that reads, I wonder: If I wanted it bad enough, if I studied the problem and practiced and checked my work against the goal, concentrated on the fundamentals, and practiced some more. If I truly buried myself in the task until I couldn&#39;t tell where my Self ended and the Craft began. If I gave it *everything*. Maybe, just maybe, I could learn how to fold fitted sheets?"/>
</center>
<p>Thirty minutes later, I had paused and replayed portions of a video from
Martha Stewart’s old TV show countless times and…​folded the fitted sheet!</p>

<h2 id="_why_we_fit_the_sheets">Why we fit the sheets</h2>
<div>
<p>It is a well-known fact that an ordinary unsecured bed sheet will escape during
the night in the form of a ghost. You will likely find it in the corner the
next morning. Or, if you leave the window open, you may never find it at all!</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-ghost.png" alt="A hasty three-color drawing of a bedroom at night. A white sheet ghost escapes out from under a sleeping person in a bed. The window is open and the ghost is headed in that direction. The walls and shadows are in magenta and pink."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>To solve this problem, elastic was used to to convert a normal sheet into a
<em>creature</em> which loves nothing more than to hug a bed mattress. A fitted sheet
will happily remain on a mattress for as long as you allow it.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-creature.png" alt="Two drawings. The first is in an inset circle and shows a fitted sheet as a smiling scalloped creature with limb-like appendages ready for hugging. The second drawing shows the same sheet on a bed with a heart floating above it to show how happy it is to be fitted to a mattress."/>

<h2 id="_is_it_even_possible_to_fold_a_fitted_sheet">Is it even possible to fold a fitted sheet?</h2>
<div>
<p>I’m not a topologist. Not even close. But even <em>I</em> can take comfort in knowing
that all commercially-available fitted sheets are orientable, two-sided surfaces.</p>
<p>This is in contrast with non-orientable surfaces such as the Möbius strip,
which is a single surface with a boundary, or a Klein bottle, which doesn’t
even have a boundary.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-topology.png" alt="sheet topology"/>
</p>
</div>
<p>You can fold a Möbius strip all you want, but you’ll never get rid of that
twist. If you fold a Klein bottle, you’ll make Clifford Stoll sad.</p>
<p>But a fitted sheet - it can be tamed! It can be folded!</p>
<p>Let’s prove it with a practical demonstration.</p>
<p>The first, and most obvious observation is that a fitted sheet makes a nice,
neat rectangle when it is spread over a mattress.</p>
<p>This leads to the most obvious <em>insight</em>: If you flip the sheet over and pull
the corners of the sheet to the corners of the mattress, the &#34;bottom&#34; of the
turned-over sheet makes that same reasonably neat rectangle.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-on-its-back.png" alt="Two drawings of a fitted sheet on a mattress. The first is the normal situation except for the fact that the sheet has eyes and a mouth. The second has the fitted sheet upside down on the mattress. The ruffled edges of the elastic are now in the center of the rectangle of sheet. Arrows show that you’ll pull the corners of the sheet straight to the corners of the mattress."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>A rectangle of cloth can be folded like paper, even if the inner elastic
makes it a particularly hell-spawned paper.</p>
<p>Understanding this leads to a simple, but tedious method of folding a fitted sheet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_a_simple_but_tedious_method">A simple, but tedious method</h2>
<div>
<p>Lay the fitted sheet neatly upside-down (troublesome ruffled elastic center on the top) so that it’s fully flat on a sheet-sized surface such as a bed. Or the floor. Or outside in the road, what do I care, it’s your sheet.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-on-its-back-fold.png" alt="Drawings of steps as described"/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Then:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the corners of the sheet and tug and tease them until the corners and edges form a pretty decent rectangle. It won’t be perfect because the elastic will always pull it a little round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold a third of the sheet down. Smooth it down as if it were paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold the second third. Keep flattening and smoothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold the sheet the short direction in thirds. (In spreadsheet terms, we did rows, now we’re doing columns.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give a kick in the style of a martial arts expert for the final fold so that the sheet is now a small, subdued bundle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrate by standing on the vanquished sheet with arms raised in victory. This will further compact the bundle for storage. (Clean feet only!)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Folding a fitted sheet by laying it out upside-down on the bed was the first
method I <em>completely understood</em>, but it was very slow and required the
entire surface of the bed. I had to keep walking around the bed to get at the
opposite corners.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s simple, but not easy, in the sense described by software
developer
<a href="https://hajimehoshi.com/">Hajime Hoshi</a> (hajimehoshi.com):</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Easy:</strong> how quickly you can achieve what you want</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As savvy sheet folders have known for a long time, arm-based corner-gathering
methods aren’t as quick to learn, but they’re much faster…​once you
understand what you’re doing and get the hang of the movements!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_initial_goal">The initial goal</h2>
<div>
<p>Of course, the <em>ultimate</em> goal is to turn the fitted sheet into a small,
roughly rectangular bundle that can sit neatly on a shelf.</p>
<p>But the <em>first</em> goal of folding a fitted sheet is to turn it into some sort of
foldable rectangle with the elastic on the <em>inside</em>. This will allow you to
enveloped the elastic safely away from sight and mind.</p>
<p>Here’s a <strong>half sheet</strong> with the corner pockets paired up at the top:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-rect-half.png" alt="A drawing of the half sheet as described."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>And here’s a <strong>quarter sheet</strong> with all four pockets together at the top left:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-rect-quarter.png" alt="A drawing of the quarter sheet as described."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Since both the half and quarter sheets give you roughly rectangular shapes with
the elastic inside, both are perfectly valid folding states. You can put either
one on a flat surface and fold it like a normal foldable object.</p>
<p>But the quarter sheet with all four corners together has three advantages for
the solo home folder:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It takes half as much flat folding space - be that bed or folding table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes half as much folding and smoothing in the final folding steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with normal length arms will be able to fold queen-size and larger sheets
with less awkward movements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<p>Aside: In making this page, I watched as many examples of professional fitted
sheet handlers as I could find. In nearly all of the fitted sheet factories, I
observed pairs of people working together on half sheets. Each person was
responsible for nesting two corner pockets and then the half sheet was folded
on a flat surface. At each step, the sheet was briskly made into a neat long
rectangle of cloth and fitted with a cardboard insert and folded end-over-end
until it was in the final shape.</p>
<p>If you have a helper to fold your sheet and plenty of flat surface, you can
crank out a perfectly crisp rectangular shelf-ready bundle in about 30 seconds
with the half sheet arrangement.</p>
</div>
<p>At last, let us begin making our quarter sheet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_arm_based_corner_gathering_quarter_sheet_folding">Arm-based, corner-gathering, quarter sheet folding</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-creature-fisted.png" alt="A fitted sheet with eyes and a mouth like a creature is being stretched over a person’s arm. It looks surprised but maybe not entirely displeased."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>This is where most fitted sheet tutorials start. Hopefully my &#34;First Person
Folder&#34; drawings give these instructions a unique twist. If it helps, you can
imagine you are in hand-to-hand combat with a cloth demon.</p>
<p>It begins by locating a corner and putting it on an outstretched hand. So let’s
do that.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_put_your_hand_in_a_corner">Put your hand in a corner</h3>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm1.png" alt="A first-person view of a pair of arms. The right one is holding the elastic along the edge of the sheet. The other is buried in the corner &#34;pocket&#34; - where the sewn mitered edge comes to a triangular point.  The sheet has eyes and a mouth at the corner. It is looking back at the viewer with surprise."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>The face may or may not appear. But know that it’s there. You’ve got your
creature in hand now.</p>
<div>
<p>Which way should the sheet be facing? Some sheets have a printed pattern on one
side, which will look better on the outside of your final folded bundle.</p>
<p>To achieve that, have these first corners <strong>inside-out</strong>. After you put the first
corner with the second one, the sheet will become right-side-out and remain that
way for the rest of the folding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_your_free_hand_goes_into_the_other_corner">Your free hand goes into the other corner</h3>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm2.png" alt="Another first-person view of two arms and a fitted sheet. Now both arms are in corner pockets of the fitted sheet. Both have faces and the first one is looking at the second. The elastic band along the edge is facing the viewer."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Now you have two creatures! Hello creatures.</p>
<div>
<p>Note that for the step above, you can go to either the corner to your left or
right and it doesn’t matter which hand you start with. Do whatever feels most
comfortable and natural.</p>
<p>Just make sure you don’t grab a diagonal corner or somehow twist the sheet
in getting that second corner. If you’ve got something that looks like my
drawing with two hands in two corners, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Also, do we have any Sesame Street fans in the house? Doesn’t the corner on
the right look like one of the &#34;Yip Yip Martians&#34; from Sesame Street? I loved
those little aliens.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_make_them_kiss">Make them kiss!</h3>
<p>Touch the tips of the corners together.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm3.png" alt="First-person view of two arms and a fitted sheet. The hands are in the sheet corners and touching. The sheet corners are creatures with eyes shut in bliss. There is a little pink heart floating over their little heads."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Aw, how sweet.  (Did the heart appear for you too?)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_cover_the_first_corner_with_the_second">Cover the first corner with the second</h3>
<p>Invert one corner over the other, keeping the tips of the corners together.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm4.png" alt="First-person view of two arms one sheet. The right arm is spreading its corner over the one on the left arm. The elastic edges overlap."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>The result is that one hand ends up in the pocket of <em>both</em> corners. The other
hand is free for action once again.</p>
<p>Okay, the next part is where everybody usually gets mixed up and frustrated.
(And I believe I know why. Check out the
<a href="#summon-cthulhu">What I do NOT recommend</a>
section below to read about that.)</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I’ve figured out a fool-proof way of explaining this. I certainly
ended up making <em>way</em> more drawings than I’d originally planned with the hopes
of getting it across. But when it’s all said and done, this is still just a
series of two-dimensional drawings and text.  It’s not telepathy.  So we’ll need to
work together to make this happen.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_find_the_other_two_corners">Find the <em>other</em> two corners</h3>
<p>With your free hand, grab the two elastic edges and trace them along until you reach the other two corners.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm5.png" alt="Left arm is in the pocket of the corners and the right arm is tugging the two elastic edges together."/>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_get_the_other_pair_of_corners_ready">Get the other pair of corners ready</h3>
<p>Try to roughly line up the seams of the corners. The elastic makes everything
all bunched up and hard to see, so perhaps try stretching it out a bit to get a
better lay of the land.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm6.png" alt="Right arm is holding the elastic where it meets the seams of two corners."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Seriously, take your time with this part. Really focus on what you’re doing
with this hand. Get into it.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Shaking the sheet occasionally between steps can help the cloth fall
straight and make it a little more manageable and understandable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_pop_that_second_pair_of_corners">Pop that second pair of corners</h3>
<p>Get your hand into that second pair of corner pockets.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm7.png" alt="Two hands are now inside opposite pairs of corner pockets with the sheet doubled between them."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>The goal here is to have both hands mirroring each other in a pair of
pockets, with the rest of the sheet between them, not twisted. It should
look roughly like the drawing above.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_line_up_the_corners_prepare_for_contact">Line up the corners, prepare for contact!</h3>
<p>Line them up like jousting combatants. Corner pointed at corner. Hot
sun overhead. Pennants snap in the wind. A hoofbeat on the sod. Here we go…​</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm8.png" alt="Similar drawing as above but corners are pointed at each other this time."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Touch corner to corner. And then…​</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_cover_the_first_corner_pair_with_the_second_corner_pair">Cover the first corner <em>pair</em> with the second corner <em>pair</em></h3>
<p>Just like when we put the first pair together, now we’re going to invert
the second pair over the first.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm9.png" alt="The right hand wraps the right corner over the left."/>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_admire_your_consolidated_corners">Admire your consolidated corners</h3>
<p>The whole sheet is now on one arm, with your hand in the overlapped corner
pockets. All four elastic corners overlap. The rest of the sheet hangs below.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm10.png" alt="Drawing as described in the text."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>It’s like you are holding a heavy cloak with your hand in the hood.
<em>Where did the rest of the wizard go?</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_find_the_inner_edge">Find the inner edge</h3>
<p>What you have now is the quarter sheet - our initial goal! But it doesn’t
look like one yet. To get that square shape when you lay it flat, you’ll
need to find a coherent edge.</p>
<p>In the drawing below, I’ve switched hands to trace the natural fold inside
the sheet.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm11.png" alt="Right hand is now in the corner pocket and left hand is tracing inner fold to the left."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>A quicker method is to get your elbow into the sheet so that your forearm
makes a clothesline for the inner fold of the sheet. Describing how to do
this is like trying to describe how to toss a pizza crust, so if what I wrote
makes sense go for it and if not, don’t worry about it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_hold_your_quarter_sheet_from_the_inside_of_an_edge">Hold your quarter sheet from the inside of an edge</h3>
<p>You’re about to put the quarter sheet down. Make sure you have figured out
at least one edge of the square that includes your hard-earned corner pocket.</p>
<p>Your hands will be at opposite ends inside the fold. Your arms will be under
the four layers of elastic.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm12.png" alt="Drawing as described in the text."/>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_lay_the_quarter_sheet_down_straighten_and_flatten">Lay the quarter sheet down, straighten and flatten</h3>
<p>At last, you can lay the quarter sheet on a flat surface. It’s not too big
anymore!</p>
<p>Get it reasonably straight. But only reasonably!</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm13.png" alt="Two arms have laid the quarter sheet flat and are still inside the elastic."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>(Yes, you can adjust by pushing the inner corners and tugging gently at the
outsides. But keep in mind that the elastic pulls the fabric out of square, so
it’s completely unreasonable to try to get four perfect 90 degree angles. Don’t
even try!)</p>
<p>Your chance to get genuine straight edges is next.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_start_folding">Start folding!</h3>
<p>I’ll be showing the rest of the process, but you’re really on the home stretch
here. The &#34;correct&#34; way to fold the quarter sheet actually depends on variables
such as the final desired shape and size, the dimensions of the sheet, etc.</p>
<p>It’s pretty safe to experiment here because the quarter sheet is relatively
stable.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm14.png" alt="Two arms fold the sheet into thirds partially covering the elastic."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>The important things to know:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These folds are your chance go get actual straight edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re entombing the elastic weirdness <em>inside</em> the folds to manage the chaos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can get it quite neat and crisp by flattening the sheet between each fold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the devil’s origami.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Let’s finish this up. I’m doing this in thirds because that worked out pretty well
for <em>my</em> sheet and thirds guarantees the rough outer edges end up inside the bundle.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm15.png" alt="Hands fold a third in."/>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm16.png" alt="Now folding the other direction in thirds."/>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm17.png" alt="Preparing for the last fold."/>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-arm18.png" alt="Done."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>The final bundle will probably resemble a pillow to some degree. The elastic is
bulky and there’s no way around that short of squashing it flat in a hydraulic
press.</p>
<p>When you put it on a shelf, put the neatest edge facing out and stack some other
stuff on it and it’ll look totally professional. Way to go!</p>

<h2 id="summon-cthulhu">What I do NOT recommend</h2>
<div>
<p>Getting the first two corners together is no problem. But the third and fourth
can cause serious confusion.</p>
<p>And having done this quite a few times in the course of making these
instructions, I believe I know why:
Many fitted sheet folding tutorials recommend finding the third corner
and wrapping it over the first two immediately. Then finding the fourth and
wrapping that on last.</p>
<p>About half of the time, that worked. But the other half, I ended up with a
tangled mess that threatened to summon mighty <strong>Cthulhu</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s my actual failed attempt:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/images/sheet-fail-full.png" alt="Series of three images with the arms going through the motions of putting the next two corners on one at a time. In the third panel the corners are together but the rest of the sheet is tangled up. Chulthu is looking at it with a floating heart."/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Why would anyone recommend this?</p>
<p>Down in the historical section at the bottom of this page, I mention that in
the not-too-distant past, fitted sheets had elastic at the corners, but not
around the entire inner perimeter.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the one-at-a-time method used to work with the older style
sheets with elastic at just the corners.</p>
<p>But with elastic all the way around the entire inner edge like most modern
fitted sheets, there is a very high likelyhood of something getting bunched up
or tangled in a way that is so hard to undo that you’re really better off just
starting over!</p>
<p><strong>My theory</strong> is that this old one-corner-at-a-time method is still being taught
and <em>that</em> is why people like me thought they couldn’t fold fitted sheets!</p>

<p><strong>1992</strong> - Gisele Jubinville of Alberta: <a href="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/files/jubinville-fitted-sheets-US5173976.pdf">MATTRESS COVER/FITTED BED SHEET</a> (PDF, 492Kb)</p>

<p>Now, if you actually look at the patents, what you’ll see is that Berman’s was a more
complex design that consisted of multiple pieces (but does feature elastic!)
And Jubinville’s design, indeed, has the stitched-in elastic design of the
mattress-hugging fitted sheet creature we all love to hate today.</p>
<p>But I was alive before 1992 and I can assure you that we had fitted sheets
when I was a kid and they weren’t anything like the Berman design.</p>
<p>It doesn’t add up.</p>
<p>A patent search reveals a number of intermediate designs. Some are wacky. But
some look very much like a modern fitted sheet. Take this one, for example:</p>
<div>
<p><strong>1965</strong> - Belvin Roddey of South Carolina: <a href="https://silly.business/blog/i-went-outside/files/roddey-fitted-sheets-US3181179.pdf">FITTED BED SHEET AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME</a> (PDF, 633Kb)</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not saying Belvin Roddey’s design is <em>the</em> design used for decades before
Jubinville’s design, I’m just saying there were definitely some steps between
1959 and 1992.  (To confirm this, you can find fitted sheets from the &#39;80s on
Ebay. I saw a set with Disney’s Snow White that looked like she was staring
across the decades into an abyss. Sure enough: Elastic at all four corners,
just like I remember from my glow-in-the-dark robot space battle set.)</p>

this article has some fun facts and vintage pictures:

<li>
<p>A <strong>1954</strong> article about the &#34;popular new fitted sheets&#34;!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fitted sheets (not elastic) were originally invented in the <strong>1940s</strong> for baby cribs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of instructions for how-to-fold a fitted sheet (pre-elastic!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The point is that fitted sheets have had an 80 year history that pre-dates the
use of elastic.</p>
<p>I don’t quite know how the Legend of the Two Patents was started, but it’s been
copied and pasted all over the Web ever since. I blame Big Sheet. Don’t let
the fitted sheet &#34;cover up&#34; keep you from the Truth!</p>
