    <h1>The guidance system and computer of the Minuteman III nuclear missile</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8302647573373825375" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>The Minuteman missile was introduced in 1962 as a key part of America&#39;s nuclear deterrent.
The Minuteman III missile is currently the only US land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with
400 missiles ready for launch, spread across five central states.<span id="fnref:counts"><a href="#fn:counts">1</a></span>
The missile contains a precision guidance system, capable of delivering a warhead to a target 13,000 km away (8000 miles) with an
<a href="https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/minuteman-iii/">accuracy</a> of 200 meters (660 feet).</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the guidance system of the Minuteman III missile (1970).
This guidance system contains over 17,000 electronic and mechanical parts, <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0877971.pdf#page=279">costing</a> $510,000 (about $4.5 million in current dollars).
The heart of the guidance system is the gyro stabilized platform, which uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to measure the missile&#39;s orientation and acceleration.
The computer uses the measurements from the platform to determine the missile&#39;s position and guide the missile on its trajectory
to the target. Other key components are the missile guidance set controller, which contains electronics to support the gyro stabilized platform, and the
amplifier, which interfaces the computer with the rest of the missile.
In this blog post, I take a close look at the components of the guidance system that was used until the early 2000s.<span id="fnref:disclaimers"><a href="#fn:disclaimers">2</a></span></p>

<p>Fundamentally,
the guidance computer constantly compares the missile position to the desired trajectory and generates the appropriate
steering commands to keep the missile on track.<span id="fnref:algorithms"><a href="#fn:algorithms">3</a></span>
The diagram below shows how directing the engine nozzles causes the missile to rotate around its three axes: roll, pitch, and yaw.<span id="fnref:nozzles"><a href="#fn:nozzles">4</a></span>
In the silo, the roll angle (the azimuth) is aligned with the direction to the target.
The missile takes off vertically and then the missile gradually rotates along the pitch axis to tilt over toward the target.
During flight, adjustments along all three axes keep the missile on target.
The Minuteman III has four rocket stages so the guidance computer jettisons each rocket stage and ignites the next stage in sequence.</p>
<!--
For an analogy, if you're standing up, the roll axis determines what direction you're facing, and you can roll by shuffling your
feet in a circle.
The analogy is if you bend forward at the hips and pitch yourself forward; note that the pitch axis is left-right, but your
motion is forward-backward.
If you're standing, yaw would be the equivalent of bending side-to-side as a yoga stretch. Again, the axis (front-back through your
belly button) is orthogonal to the direction of motion (left-right). (Of course, the rocket is moving rigidly, not bending.)
-->

<h2>The guidance platform</h2>
<p>The idea behind inertial navigation is to keep track of the missile&#39;s position by constantly measuring its acceleration.
By integrating the acceleration, you get the velocity. And by integrating the velocity, you get the position.
Inertial navigation is self-contained, a big advantage for a missile since the enemy can&#39;t jam your navigation.
The hard part is measuring the acceleration and angles with extreme accuracy, since even tiny errors are multiplied as
the missile travels.</p>
<p>In more detail, the Minuteman&#39;s inertial guidance is built around a gyroscopically stabilized platform, which is
kept in a fixed orientation. The platform is
mounted on two beryllium gimbals. Feedback from gyroscopes drives three torque motors to rotate the gimbals to keep
the stable platform in exactly the same orientation
no matter how the missile twists and turns.</p>
<!-- The Atlas missile (1957) was originally guided by sending it commands from the ground, but the Atlas E (1961) moved to an all-inertial system. The Minuteman kept the inertial approach. -->

<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/imu-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The Minuteman III stable platform.

Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="700"/></a></p>
<p>The diagram below shows the components of the stable platform, in approximately the same orientation as the photo above.
Three accelerometers are mounted on the stable platform to measure acceleration. The accelerometers are oriented along three perpendicular axes so each one measures acceleration along one axis.
(The accelerometer axes are not aligned with the platform axes; this distributes the acceleration (mostly &#34;up&#34;) across the 
accelerometers, increasing accuracy.)
The two alignment mirrors allow the stable platform to be aligned with a precise device called an autocollimator, as will be described below.
The gyrocompass uses the Earth&#39;s rotation to precisely determine North, providing a backup alignment technique.
Both the alignment mirrors and the gyrocompass can be rotated to a precise angle, reported by the resolver.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/platform.jpg"><img alt="The stable platform for Minuteman II and III. Modified from Minuteman weapon system history and description." height="454" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/platform-w600.jpg" title="The stable platform for Minuteman II and III. Modified from Minuteman weapon system history and description." width="600"/></a></p>
<p>To target a Minuteman I missile, the missile had to be physically rotated in the silo to be aligned with the target,
an angle called the launch azimuth.
This angle had to be extremely precise, since even a tiny angle error will be greatly magnified over the missile&#39;s journey.
Aligning the missile was a tedious process that used the North Star to determine North.
Since the star was not visible from inside the silo, a complex surveying technique was used, using a surveyor&#39;s theodolite to measure the angles between the North Star and three concrete monuments outside the silo.
Inside the silo, the closest monument was visible through a sighting tube, allowing the precise angle measurement to be
transferred to the silo.
After many more measurements inside the silo, a special device called an autocollimator was positioned precisely 90Â° from
the desired launch azimuth.
The autocollimator shot a beam of light through a window in the side of the missile, where it bounced off a mirror
on the stable platform and returned to the autocollimator.
If the returning beam wasn&#39;t exactly parallel, the autocollimator sent a signal to the missile, causing the stable platform to
rotate as needed.
The result of this process was that the stable platform was exactly aligned with the desired angle to the target.<span id="fnref:azimuth"><a href="#fn:azimuth">5</a></span></p>
<p>The guidance platform was completely redesigned for Minuteman II and III, eliminating the time-consuming alignment that
Minuteman I required.
The new platform had an alignment block with rotating mirrors.
Instead of rotating the missile, the autocollimator remained fixed in the East position and the mirror (and thus the
stable platform) was rotated to the desired launch azimuth.
The new guidance platform also added a gyrocompass under the alignment block, a special compass that could precisely align itself to North by precessing against the Earth&#39;s rotation.
At first, the gyrocompass was used as a backup check against the autocollimator, but eventually the gyrocompass became the primary alignment.
For calibration, the alignment block also includes electrolytic bubble levels to position the stable platform in known orientations with respect to local gravity.<span id="fnref:calibrations"><a href="#fn:calibrations">6</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mirrors.jpg"><img alt="The alignment block with mirrored surfaces. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="407" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mirrors-w450.jpg" title="The alignment block with mirrored surfaces. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="450"/></a></p>
<p>The photo above shows the alignment block on top of the gyrocompass.
The front and back of the block are the precision mirrors that reflect the light beam from the autocollimator.
The circles on top of the block and at the right are two level detectors, with set screws for exact adjustment.
The platform has four level detectors, allowing it to be aligned against gravity in multiple positions.
Like the gimbals, the gyrocompass assembly is made of beryllium due to its rigidity and light weight; it has a warning sticker because beryllium is highly toxic.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the axes align with the gimbals of the stable platform.<span id="fnref:axes"><a href="#fn:axes">7</a></span>
Note the window at the top of the photo.
Light from the autocollimator shines in through the window, reflects off the mirror on the alignment block, and returns through
the window to the autocollimator. 
The autocollimator detects any error in alignment and signals the guidance system to correct its position accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/coordinates.jpg"><img alt="Coordinate system for the stable platform. Note that these axes don&#39;t match the missile axes; the stable platform axes remain constant as the missile turns.

<p>The stable platform uses gyroscopes to maintain its fixed orientation as the missile turns.
The idea behind a gyroscope is that a spinning disk will tend to maintain its spin axis.
The problem is that any friction, even from precision ball bearings, will reduce the accuracy.
The solution in the Minuteman is a &#34;gas bearing&#34;, where the gyroscope rotor is supported by an extremely thin layer of hydrogen.
As shown below, the gyroscope is built around a stationary marble-sized ball (blue), fastened to the gyroscope frame at the top and bottom.
The rotor (pink) is clamped around the equator of the ball and spins at high speed, powered by an induction motor (windings green, rotor yellow).
If the gyroscope frame is tilted, the rotor will stay in its orientation. The resulting change in angle between the frame and the rotor is detected by sensitive capacitive pickups (purple).
The gyroscope is sensitive to tilt in two axes: left-right, and front-back.
Since nothing touches the rotor except the thin layer of gas around the ball, the influence of friction is minimal.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/gyroscope.jpg"><img alt="A gas-bearing gyroscope. Based on patent 3,025,708." height="379" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/gyroscope-w450.jpg" title="A gas-bearing gyroscope. Based on patent 3,025,708." width="450"/></a></p>
<p>A gas-bearing gyroscope has the problem that when it starts or stops, the gas layer dissipates, allowing the rotor and the bearing to rub.
The Minuteman missile&#39;s guidance system was kept continuously running, so starts and stops were infrequent.
Moreover, when the gyroscope did need to be started, the electronics gave it a 40-volt jolt to get it up to speed quickly.
Because the Minuteman&#39;s guidance system was always runningâand its solid-fuel engines didn&#39;t require fuelingâthe missile 
could be launched in under a minute.</p>
<p>To summarize the guidance trajectory,
a Minuteman flight is typically about 35 minutes,<span id="fnref:trajectories"><a href="#fn:trajectories">8</a></span> but only the first few minutes are powered by the rockets; the warheads
coast most of the way on a ballistic trajectory.
The first three rocket stages are active for just 180 seconds; this completed the boost phase for Minuteman I and II.
However, the innovation of Minuteman III was that it held three warheads, a system called MIRV (Multiple Independently-targeted Reentry Vehicles).
To direct these warheads to their targets, Minuteman III has a fourth stage, called PSRE (Propulsion System Rocket Engine),
mounted just below the guidance system.
The PSRE was active for <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0757212.pdf#page=79">440 seconds</a>,
directing each warhead on its specific path.
(Meanwhile, a retro-rocket sent the third stage in a random direction. Otherwise, it would tag along with the warheads, acting as a giant
radar beacon for enemy anti-ballistic-missile systems.)
The warheads travel very high, typically over 800 nautical miles (1500 km), more than three times the altitude of the International Space Station.
As for the multiple-warhead MIRV, the Minuteman III missiles were converted back to single warheads as part of the New START
arms reduction treaty, with the last MIRV removed in <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/article/485611/malmstrom-completes-final-minuteman-iii-configuration/">June 2014</a>.</p>

<h2>The Minuteman D-17B computer</h2>
<p>The guidance computer has a key role in the Minuteman missile, determining the missile&#39;s position from the stable platform data,
executing a guidance algorithm, and steering the missile on the desired trajectory.
Before explaining the D-37 computer used in Minuteman II and III, I&#39;ll start by discussing the D-17B computer used in the first Minuteman, since its characteristics strongly influenced the later computers.
The Minuteman I computer was very primitive by modern standards.
Although it was a 24-bit machine, it was a serial computer, operating on one bit at a time. 
The big advantage of serial processing is that it dramatically reduces the hardware requirements. Since the computer only processes one bit at a time,
it uses a one-bit ALU. Moreover, the buses and datapaths are one bit wide rather than 24 bits.
The disadvantage, of course, is that a serial computer is slow; the D-17B took 27 clock cycles (24 bits and three overhead) to perform any operation. At best, the computer could perform 12,800 additions per second.</p>
<p>The computer has an unusual cylindrical structure, 29 inches (74 cm) in diameter, designed to fit the diameter of the Minuteman missile.
The computer itself is the bottom half of the cylindrical shell.
The top half is the <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/D17_Surplus_Annoucement.pdf#page=9">electronic equipment chassis</a>, holding the power supplies for the computer and the stable platform, as well as
servo control amplifiers, oscillators, and converters.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/guidance-computer.jpg"><img alt="The Minuteman I guidance computer.

<p>The computer doesn&#39;t have any RAM. Instead, all instructions, data, and registers are stored on a hard disk, but not like a modern hard disk.
The disk has separate, fixed heads for each track so it can access tracks without seeking. 
(This approach is similar to a computer built around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_memory">drum memory</a>, except the drum is flattened.)
In total, the disk held just 2727 24-bit words (approximately 8 Kbytes).
The computer&#39;s serial processing and its disk-based storage worked well together. The disk provided data one bit at a time, which the computer would process serially.
The results were written back to the disk, one bit at a time as calculation proceeded.
The write head was positioned just behind the read head so a value could be overwritten as it was computed.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the numerous read and write heads for the D-17B&#39;s hard disk.
Note that the heads are fixed (unlike modern hard drives), and the heads are widely distributed across the surface.
(There is no need for different tracks to be aligned.)
I believe that the green and white heads in pairs are for the &#34;regular&#34; tracks, while the heads with other spacings implement
registers and short-term storage called <em>loops</em>.<span id="fnref:timing"><a href="#fn:timing">9</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/drive-heads.jpg"><img alt="Disk head assembly from the D-17B.

<p>The D-17B computer was transistorized. The photo below shows one of its circuit boards, crammed with transistors (the black cylinders), resistors, diodes, and other components.
(This board is a read amplifier, amplifying the signals from the hard disk.)
The computer used diode-resistor logic and diode-transistor logic to minimize the number of transistors;
as a result, it used 6282 diodes and 5094 resistors compared to 1521 silicon and germanium transistors (<a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/AD-760_757_Reutilization_of_the_Minuteman_Guidance_Computer_as_a_Numerical_Process_Controller_Mar73.pdf#page=28">source</a>).</p>

<p>The computer supported 39 instructions.
Many of the instructions are straightforward: add, subtract, multiply (but no divide), complement, magnitude, AND, left shift, and right shift. 
The computer handled 24-bit words as well as 11-bit split words, so many of these instructions had &#34;split&#34; versions to operate on a shorter
value.
One unusual instruction was &#34;split compare and limit&#34;, which replaced the accumulator value with a limit value from memory, if the
accumulator value exceeded the limit.</p>
<p>The focus of the computer was I/O with 48 digital inputs, 26 incremental inputs, 28 digital outputs, 12 analog voltage outputs, and 3 pulse outputs for gyro control.
The computer had special instructions to support the various inputs and outputs.<span id="fnref:analog"><a href="#fn:analog">10</a></span>
For example, to integrate pulse signals from the stable platform, the computer had instructions to enter and exit &#34;Fine Countdown&#34; mode, which caused two special registers to operate
as digital integrators, in parallel with regular computation (<a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0760757.pdf#page=62">details</a>).</p>
<h2>The D-37 computer</h2>
<p>For the Minuteman II missile, Autonetics built the D-37 computer, one of the earliest integrated circuit computers.
By using integrated circuits, the guidance computer was dramatically shrunk, increasing range, functionality, and accuracy.
The photo below compares the size of the older D-17B computer (half-cylinder) with the D-37B (held by the engineer).</p>

Using modern definitions, the computer was a minicomputer, not a microcomputer.</p>
<p>Although the main task of the computer is guidance,
with the increased capacity of the D-37, the computer took over many of the tasks formerly performed by ground support equipment.
The D-37 managed &#34;ground control and checkout, monitoring, communication coding and decoding, as well as the airborne tasks of navigation, guidance, steering, and control&#34; (<a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1982-1550">link</a>). <!--andreMinutemanInertialGuidance1982--></p>
<p>The D-37 had several models. The D-37A was the prototype system, while the D-37B was deployed in the first 60 Minuteman II missiles.
The Air Force soon realized that
nuclear radiation posed a threat to the computer, so they developed the radiation-hardened D-37C.<span id="fnref:radiation"><a href="#fn:radiation">11</a></span>
The Minuteman III used the D-37D, an improved and slightly larger version.
Even with additional disk space, program memory was so tight that software features were dropped to save just <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0757212.pdf#page=86">47 words</a>.</p>
<p>As far as architecture and performance, the D-37 computer is almost the same as the D-17B, but extended.
Most importantly, the D-37 kept the serial architecture of the D-17B, so it had the same slow instruction speed.
The D-37 kept the instruction set of the D-17B, with additional instructions such as division, logical OR, bit rotates, and more I/O, giving it 58 instructions versus 39 in the older computer.
It expanded the hard disk storage, but with a double-sided disk providing 7222 words of storage in the D37-C.<span id="fnref:capacity"><a href="#fn:capacity">12</a></span>
The D-37 included division implemented in hardware (which the D-17B didn&#39;t have), along with a faster hardware implementation of multiplication, improving the speed of those instructions.<span id="fnref:instructions"><a href="#fn:instructions">13</a></span>
The D-37C added more I/O lines, as well as radio input and 32 analog voltage inputs. <!-- https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0760757.pdf --></p>
<p>The diagram below shows the D-37C computer, used in the Minuteman II.
At the left is the hard disk that provides the computer&#39;s memory. Most of the computer is occupied by complex circuit boards
covered with flat-pack integrated circuits. At the right is the advanced switching power supply, generating numerous
voltages for the computer (Â±3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 volts).
The connectors at the top provide the interface between the computer and the rest of the system.
Because the computer has so many digital (discrete) and analog signals, it uses multiple 61-pin connectors (<a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/AD-777_244_Conversion_of_the_D37C_Computer_For_General_Purpose_Applications_Mar74.pdf#page=117">details</a>).</p>

<p>The D-37C computer was built from 22 different integrated circuits, custom-built by Texas Instruments for the Minuteman project.
These chips ranged from digital functions such as NAND gates and a flip-flop to linear amplifiers to specialized functions such as a demodulator/chopper. 
Texas Instruments sold the Minuteman series integrated circuits on the open market, but the chips were
spectacularly expensive ($55 for a flip-flop, over $500 in current dollars) and not as popular as 
TI&#39;s general-purpose integrated circuits.<span id="fnref:flip-flop"><a href="#fn:flip-flop">14</a></span>
The circuit boards were very complex for the time, with 10 interconnected layers. Each board was about 4 Ã 5Â½ inches and
held about 150 flatpack integrated circuits, with components on both sides.</p>
<p>The growth of the integrated circuit industry owes a lot to the 
Minuteman computer and the Apollo Guidance Computer, both developed during the early days of the integrated circuit.
These projects bought integrated circuits by the hundreds of thousands, helping the IC industry move from low-volume prototypes
to mass-produced commodities, both by providing demand and by motivating companies to fix
yield problems.
Moreover, both computers required high-reliability integrated circuits, forcing the industry to improve its manufacturing processes.
Finally, Minuteman and Apollo gave integrated circuits credibility, showing that ICs were a practical design choice.</p>
<p>The Minuteman III used the D-37D computer,
which had about twice the disk capacity, 14,137 words.
The layout is similar to the D-37C above, with the disk drive on the left and the power supply on the right.
Since the computer is mounted &#34;upside down&#34;, the boards are not visible inside, blocked by the
interconnect board.<span id="fnref:exploded"><a href="#fn:exploded">15</a></span>
Note the use of flexible PCBs, advanced technology for the time, soldered with low-melting-point indium/tin solder.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/d37d.jpg"><img alt="The D-37D computer.

Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="700"/></a></p>
<p>By 1970, the D-37 computer had made the cylindrical D-17B obsolete. The government gave away <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/D17_Surplus_Annoucement.pdf">surplus</a> D-17B computers to universities and other organizations for use as general-purpose microcomputers.
Dozens of organizations, from Harvard to the Center for Disease Control to Tektronix jumped at the chance to obtain a free computer, even if it was slow and difficult to use,
forming a large <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/MCUG-3-72_Proceedings_of_the_Fourth_Meeting_of_the_Minuteman_Computer_Users_Group_Jun72.pdf">users group</a> to share programming tips.</p>
<h2>The P92 amplifier</h2>
<p>The amplifier provides the interface between the computer and the rest of the missile.
The amplifier sends control signals to the missile&#39;s four stages, controlling the engines and steering.
(The electronic circuitry
from the Minuteman I&#39;s nozzle control units was moved to the amplifier, simplifying maintenance.) <!-- Minuteman: A technical history, page 224 -->
Moreover, the Minuteman has explosive ordnance in many places, ranging from small squibs that activate valves to explosives that separate the missile stages.
The amplifier sends the high-current (30 amp) signals to detonate the ordnance, while monitoring the current to detect faults.<span id="fnref:incident"><a href="#fn:incident">16</a></span>
The amplifier acts as a safety device for the ordnance, blocking signals unless the amplifier has been armed with the proper code.
The amplifier sends control signals to the reentry system (i.e. the warheads) as well as the chaff dispenser, which emits
clouds of wires to jam enemy radar.
The amplifier also sends and receives signals through the umbilical cable from the ground equipment.</p>
<!-- See LCC page 3-8 for connections. -->

Click this (or any other image) for a higher-resolution version.</p>
<p>The photo above shows the amplifier with its cover removed.
The amplifier is constructed as two stacks of six circuit boards, on top of a double-width power supply board.
At the top and bottom of each board, connectors with thick cables connect the boards to the rest of the system.
Each board is a multi-layer printed-circuit board built on a thick magnesium frame for cooling.
The amplifier has five power switching boards, a valve driver board, three servo amplifier boards, and an ACTR control board (whatever that is).
The system board is visible on the left, with large capacitors and precision 0.01% resistors. To its right is the decoder board, presumably decoding computer commands
to select a particular I/O device.
Note the extensive use of Texas Instruments flat-pack integrated circuits on this board, the tiny white rectangles.</p>
<h2>Missile Guidance Set Control</h2>
<p>The Missile Guidance Set Control (MGSC) contains the electronics to power and run the inertial measurement unit (IMU),
providing the interface to the computer.
The MGSC handles the platform servo loop, accelerometer server loops, gyroscope torquing, gyrocompass torquing and slew,
and accelerometer temperature control.<span id="fnref:platform-control"><a href="#fn:platform-control">17</a></span>
One unexpected function of the MGSC is powering the computer&#39;s hard disk,
supplying 400 Hz, 3-phase power at 27.25 volts (<a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/AD-777_244_Conversion_of_the_D37C_Computer_For_General_Purpose_Applications_Mar74.pdf#page=28">source</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mgsc.jpg"><img alt="The Missile Guidance Set Control with the modules labeled. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." height="840" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mgsc-w600.jpg" title="The Missile Guidance Set Control with the modules labeled. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="600"/></a></p>
<p>The MGSC is constructed from hinged metal modules, each with a particular function, shown above. The modules are constructed around
printed circuit boards.
Two large connectors at the right of the MGSC provide electrical connectivity with the IMU and computer.
At the top and bottom of the MGSC are connections for coolant.
The MGSC is roughly equivalent to the top half of the Minuteman I&#39;s cylindrical guidance system, opposite the computer half.
The MGSC is unchanged between the Minuteman II and Minuteman III.
The MGSC is normally covered with a metal cover that provides radiation protection, but the cover is missing in the photo above.</p>
<h2>Battery</h2>
<p>The battery in the Minuteman Guidance System is very unusual, since it is a &#34;reserve battery&#34;, completely inert until activated.
It is a silver/zinc battery with the electrolyte stored separately, giving the battery an essentially infinite shelf life.
To power up the battery during a launch, a gas generator inside the battery is ignited by a squib. The gas pressure forces the potassium hydroxide electrolyte out of a
tank and into the battery, energizing the battery in under a second.
The battery can only be used once, of course, and you can&#39;t test it. 
The battery was built by Delco-Remy (a division of General Motors) (<a href="https://www.delcoremyhistory.com/Products/missilebattery.htm">details</a>).
It provides 28 volts at 14.5 Amp-hours, powering the guidance system and most of the missile; a separate battery powers the
first-stage rocket.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/battery.jpg"><img alt="The battery inside the Minuteman III. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." height="565" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/battery-w250.jpg" title="The battery inside the Minuteman III. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="250"/></a></p>
<p>The photo above shows the battery mounted inside the guidance system. Note the two thin wires attached to the posts on the left front of the battery to enable the battery, and the thick power wires bolted to the posts on the right.
Above these posts is an &#34;electrolyte vent port&#34;; I&#39;m not sure what prevents caustic electrolyte from spraying out under high
pressure.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the construction of a Minuteman I battery, similar but with two independent battery blocks. The two round gas generators on the front of the electrolyte tube force
the electrolyte into the battery sections.</p>

<h2>Squib-activated switch</h2>
<p>Another unusual component is the squib-activated switch.
This switch is activated by a small explosive squib; when fired, the squib forces the switch to change positions.
This switch may seem excessively dramatic, but it has a few advantages over, say, an electromagnetic relay.
The squib-activated switch will switch solidly, while the contacts on a relay may &#34;chatter&#34; or bounce before settling into their new positions.
An electromagnetic relay may require more current to switch, especially if it has large contacts or many contacts.
However, like the battery, the squib-activated switch can only be used once.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/squib-switch.jpg"><img alt="The squib-activated switch, next to a coolant line.

<p>The purpose of the switch is to disconnect important signals, known as <a href="https://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/D17_Florida_State_University_Sep70.pdf#page=16">critical leads</a>, during launch.
The Minuteman missile has an umbilical connection that provides power, cooling, and signals while the missile is in the silo.
Just before the umbilical cable is disconnected, the switch severs the connections for the
master reset signal along with an enable and disable signal.
Presumably, these control signals are cleanly disconnected to avoid stray signals or electrical noise that could cause
problems when the umbilical connection is pulled off.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the umbilical cable connected to a Minuteman II missile in its silo.
Also note the window in the side of the missile to allow the light beam from the autocollimator to reflect off the guidance
platform for alignment.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/silo.jpg"><img alt="A Minuteman II missile in its silo.

Photo by Kelly Michals, CC BY-NC 2.0." width="500"/></a></p>
<h2>Cooling</h2>
<p>The guidance system is water-cooled while in the silo, using a solution of sodium chromate to inhibit corrosion.
After launch, the guidance system operated for just a few minutes before releasing the warheads, so it operated without
water cooling.
(The stable platform has a fan and heat exchanger to keep it cool during flight.)
The diagram below highlights the cooling lines.
Coolant is provided from the ground support equipment through the umbilical connector in the upper right.
It flows through the computer, diode assembly, 
MGSC, and stable platform.
Finally, the coolant exits through the umbilical connector.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/cooling.jpg"><img alt="Original image from National Air and Space Museum." height="599" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/cooling-w600.jpg" title="Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="600"/></a></p>
<h2>Diode assembly</h2>
<p>In the middle of the guidance system, the diode assembly consists of seven power diodes.
These diodes control the power flow when switching from ground power to battery power.
The photo below shows the diode assembly, with coolant connections at the top and bottom.
The thick gray wire in the center of the diode assembly receives power from the battery just to the left.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/diode-assembly.jpg"><img alt="The diode assembly. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="391" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/diode-assembly-w400.jpg" title="The diode assembly. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="400"/></a></p>
<h2>Permutation plug</h2>
<p>The Permutation plug (or P-plug) was the key cryptographic element of the guidance system, defining the launch codes for a particular missile.
The P-plug looked similar to a hockey puck and plugged into a 55-pin socket attached to the amplifier.
The retaining bar held the P-plug in place.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/p-plug.jpg"><img alt="The connector that receives the Permutation plug. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="438" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/p-plug-w450.jpg" title="The connector that receives the Permutation plug. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="450"/></a></p>
<p>Because the security of the missile hinged on the P-plug, the P-plug was handled in a highly ritualized way, transported by a two-person team, an airman and an officer, both armed (<a href="http://www.siloworld.net/STORIES/storiespg5.htm">source</a>).
After the guidance system underwent maintenance, the P-plug team would ensure that the plug was properly installed, just before
the missile was bolted back together.
There was also a lot of ritual around the disk memory, since it held security codes and targeting information.<span id="fnref:targeting"><a href="#fn:targeting">18</a></span> Before anyone could work on the computer, a special team would come to the silo and erase the memory.
Afterward, another team would load up the computer from a magnetic tape (in the case of Minuteman III) or punched tape (earlier).<span id="fnref:fill"><a href="#fn:fill">19</a></span></p>
<p>The missile launch codes are <a href="https://nuclearcompanion.com/rapid-execution-and-combat-targeting-react-armageddon-with-a-floppy-disk-and-trackball/">said</a> to be split between the hard disk
and the permutation plug.
In particular, the missile software holds a two-word code for each of the five launch control facilities.<span id="fnref:launch-control"><a href="#fn:launch-control">22</a></span>
The launch code in an Execute Launch Command (ELC) must match the combination of the P-plug value and the site-specific value on disk.<span id="fnref:select"><a href="#fn:select">23</a></span>
Thus, the launch code is unique to each launch control site and each missile.<span id="fnref:csd"><a href="#fn:csd">24</a></span>
As another security feature, a launch requires messages from two launch control sites, unless only one was available.<span id="fnref:vote"><a href="#fn:vote">25</a></span></p>
<h2>Transient current detector</h2>
<p>A nuclear blast has many bad effects on semiconductors and can cause transient errors.
A rather brute-force approach was used to minimize this risk in the D-37C and D-37D computers: if a nuclear blast is detected, the computer stops writing to disk until the burst of radiation
passes by.
When the radiation level drops, the computer carries on from where it left off, extrapolating to make up for the lost time
to minimize the error.
Since all data is stored on the hard disk, the system doesn&#39;t need to worry about memory corruption as could happen with semiconductor RAM.</p>
<p>The Minuteman documents euphemistically refer to &#34;operating in a hostile environment&#34; for the ability to handle large pulses of radiation from a nearby nuclear explosion.
Another euphemism is &#34;seismic environment&#34;, when a nuclear blast near a silo could disturb the missile&#39;s targeting alignment.
To get an idea of the expected forces, note that the launch officers were strapped into their seats with four-point harnesses to protect against the seismic environment.<span id="fnref:displacement"><a href="#fn:displacement">27</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/transient-detector.jpg"><img alt="The Transient Current Detector. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="302" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/transient-detector-w700.jpg" title="The Transient Current Detector. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="700"/></a></p>
<p>The &#34;transient current detector&#34; above detects dangerous levels of radiation. 
I couldn&#39;t find any details, but I suspect that it contains a semiconductor and detects transient current through the semiconductor induced by radiation.
It would make sense to use a semiconductor similar to the ones in the computer so the detector&#39;s response matches the response of the computer, perhaps a matching Texas Instruments IC.</p>
<p>The Minuteman III also has two &#34;field detectors&#34; mounted on the outside of the guidance ring. These presumably detect large fluctuations in the electromagnetic field, indicating an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), different from the ionizing radiation picked up by the Transient Current Detector.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Minuteman guidance system is full of innovative technologies. Among other things, Minuteman I used an early transistorized
computer, and Minuteman II used one of the first integrated circuit computers.
The Minuteman missile isn&#39;t just something from the past, though. There are currently 400 Minuteman missiles in the United States, ready
to launch at a moment&#39;s notice and create global devastation.
Thus, its technical achievements can&#39;t be glorified without reflecting on the negativity of its underlying purpose.
On the other hand, Minuteman has succeeded (so far) in its purpose of deterrence, so it can also be viewed in a positive, peacekeeping role.
In any case, the Minuteman technology is morally ambiguous, compared to, say, the Apollo Guidance Computer.</p>
<p>I plan to write more about the role of Minuteman and Apollo in the IC industry, so follow me on Mastodon as <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff">@<span data-cfemail="bdd6d8d3ced5d4cfcfd4dbdbfdd2d1d9dfc4c9d8ce93cecddcded8">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>
