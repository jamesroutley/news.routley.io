<h4>Disclaimer (last updated October 2014)</h4><p>

The original 2004 <a href="#HTDO">How to Drop Out</a> is easily the most popular thing I&#39;ve written, and thousands of people have found my site by putting &#34;how to drop out of society&#34; into Google, but I wonder if it was worth it. The message I was aiming for was something like &#34;If you have the mental focus and self-discipline to be successful in the dominant society, but you don&#39;t like it, here&#39;s how you can change your value system to reduce your need for money and status, and gain some benefits of industrial civilization without being in a position of forced obedience.&#34; Or: &#34;Society is your enemy, it attacks you by making you need money, and if you are better than the average person at sacrificing comfort for long-term goals, you can work toward a position where you need relatively little money and have more free time.&#34;</p></div>
