<p>I have to confess that I see this as a proper challenge, as I am usually quite creative in finding/combining functions to provide a desired behavior. So I will give it another try.</p>

<p>which is generated using</p>

<pre><code>box[x_, x1_, x2_, a_, b_] := Tanh[a (x - x1)] + Tanh[-b (x - x2)];
ex[z_, z0_, s_] := Exp[-(z - z0)^2/s]

(*and*)

r[z_, x_] := (*body*).4 (1.0 - .4 ex[z, .8, .15] + 
Sin[2 π x]^2 + .6 ex[z, .8, .25] Cos[2 π x]^2 + .3 Cos[2 π x]) 0.5 (1 + Tanh[4 z]) +
(*legs*)
(1 - .2 ex[z, -1.3, .9]) 0.5 (1 + Tanh[-4 z]) (.5 (1 + Sin[2 π x]^2 +
 .3 Cos[2 π x])*((Abs[Sin[2 π x]])^1.3 + .08 (1 + Tanh[4 z])  )  ) +
(*improve butt*)
.13 box[Cos[π x], -.45, .45, 5, 5] box[z, -.5, .2, 4, 2] - 
0.1 box[Cos[π x], -.008, .008, 30, 30] box[z, -.4, .25, 8, 6] - 
.05 Sin[π x]^16 box[z, -.55, -.35, 8, 18]

(*and finally*) 

ParametricPlot3D[

{x, 0, 1}, {z, -1.5, 1.5},
PlotPoints -&gt; {150, 50}, Mesh -&gt; None,
AxesLabel -&gt; {&#34;x&#34;, &#34;y&#34;, &#34;z&#34;}]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> <em>What was the strategy in generating the graph (answering the comment of @mcb)</em></p>

<p>Inspired by some of the solutions here and the fact that the original question seems to head direction <code>Plot3D[]</code> or <code>ParametricPlot3D[]</code>, the idea is to use a cylinder as base. I remembered from other work that a parametric curve of type <code>1+Cos[t]</code> gives something <em>butt</em>-shaped and <code>1+ a Cos[t]</code> can give something like a torso cross section. To make it a little bit more <em>elliptical</em> I added a <code>1+Sin[t]^2</code>type.
Combining this already goes in the right direction.</p>

<p>Legs are also not very complicated. Just fold the cylinder into two by,e.g, <code>Abs[Sin[t]]</code>. To make the transition from legs to torso I use a soft step based on <code>Tanh[]</code>.</p>

<p>Next step is to push it in and out in the correct way (belly and butt), so there is a shift to the cylinder based on Gaussians.</p>

<p>At the end one adds features like waist, etc. using Gaussians or adjustable smooth box-like functions. </p>

<p>Done, overall not too complicated.</p>
