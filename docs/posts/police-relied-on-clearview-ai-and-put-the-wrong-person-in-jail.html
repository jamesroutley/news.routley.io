A police officer approached his vehicle and asked for his driver’s license. Mr. Reid had left it at home, but he volunteered his name. After asking Mr. Reid if he had any weapons, the officer told him to step out of the Jeep and handcuffed him with the help of two other officers who had arrived.</p><p>“What did I do?” Mr. Reid asked. The officer said he had two theft warrants out of Baton Rouge and Jefferson Parish, a district on the outskirts of New Orleans. Mr. Reid was confused; he said he had never been to Louisiana.</p><p>Mr. Reid, a transportation analyst, was booked at the DeKalb County jail, to await extradition from Georgia to Louisiana. It took days to find out exactly what he was accused of: using stolen credit cards to buy designer purses.</p><p>“I’m locked up for something I have no clue about,” Mr. Reid, 29, said.</p><p>His parents made phone calls, hired lawyers and spent thousands of dollars to figure out why the police thought he was responsible for the crime, eventually discovering it was because Mr. Reid bore a resemblance to a suspect who had been recorded by a surveillance camera. The case eventually fell apart and the warrants were recalled, but only after Mr. Reid spent six days in jail and missed a week of work.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Mr. Reid’s wrongful arrest appears to be the result of a cascade of technologies — beginning with a bad facial recognition match — that are intended to make policing more effective and efficient but can also make it far too easy to apprehend the wrong person for a crime. None of the technologies are mentioned in official documents, and Mr. Reid was not told exactly why he had been arrested, a typical but troubling practice, according to legal experts and public defenders.</p><p>“In a democratic society, we should know what tools are being used to police us,” said Jennifer Granick, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><h2 id="link-5640da42">A Contract With Clearview AI</h2></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Detective Andrew Bartholomew’s affidavit seeking an arrest warrant for Mr. Reid.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>In a panic, Mr. Reid’s family immediately retained an Atlanta lawyer from the Cochran Firm. He could not get Mr. Reid out of jail, and he struggled to gather more information. He suggested that the family members hire someone in Louisiana, so they cold-called law firms in Jefferson Parish and Baton Rouge until they found Thomas Calogero, a criminal defense lawyer. They retained him that Sunday.</p></div><div><p>Mr. Calogero found out that Mr. Reid was accused of the summer thefts of two Chanel purses and a brown Louis Vuitton bag, collectively worth almost $13,000, from Second Act, a consignment store on the outskirts of New Orleans. Mr. Calogero went to the store and talked to the owner, who showed him a still from a surveillance camera. He realized that one of the alleged fraudsters looked like Mr. Reid, but the man was heavier.</p></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Thieves with stolen credit cards bought nearly $13,000 in merchandise from Second Act, a consignment store outside New Orleans.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Sara Essex Bradley for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>“The guy had big arms, and my client doesn’t,” Mr. Calogero said.

According to documents obtained by The Times in a public records request, the department first signed <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/clearview-ai-jefferson-parish-sheriff-s-office-contract/27c448657937078a/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a contract with Clearview</a> in 2019.</p><p>Clearview scraped billions of photos from the public web, including social media sites, to create a face-based search engine now used by law enforcement agencies. Mr. Reid has many public photos on the web linked to his name, including on LinkedIn and Facebook. The public information office for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office did not respond to requests for comment about the use of Clearview AI.</p><p>The company’s chief executive, Hoan Ton-That, said an arrest should not be based on a facial recognition search alone.</p><p>“Even if Clearview AI came up with the initial result, that is the beginning of the investigation by law enforcement to determine, based on other factors, whether the correct person has been identified,” he said. “More than one million searches have been conducted using Clearview AI. One false arrest is one too many, and we have tremendous empathy for the person who was wrongfully accused.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Detective Bartholomew’s identification of Mr. Reid led to <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/east-baton-rouge-reid-arrest-warrant-redacted/b3fb3e54d9d527cd/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a second warrant for his arrest</a> in East Baton Rouge Parish, where, according to a police report, the man he resembled had used a stolen credit card to buy a $2,800 Chanel bag at another consignment store.</p><p>The Baton Rouge Police Department “trusted the information” from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, a department spokesman, Sgt. L’Jean McKneely, said. “What methods they used, we do not know,” he added.</p><p>Law enforcement officers generally say they do not need to mention the use of facial recognition technology because it is only a lead in a case and not the sole reason for someone’s arrest, protecting it from exposure as if it were a confidential informant. But according to Clare Garvie, <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/publications/a-forensic-without-the-science-face-recognition-in-u-s-criminal-investigations/#:~:text=A%20Forensic%20Without%20the%20Science%3A%20Face%20Recognition%20in%20U.S.%20Criminal%20Investigations,-Additional%20Navigation&amp;text=A%20report%20released%20by%20the,police%20in%20the%20United%20States." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an expert</a> on the police use of facial recognition, there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html" title="">four</a> <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/07/10/facial-recognition-detroit-michael-oliver-robert-williams/5392166002/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other</a> publicly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html" title="">known</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/face-recognition-software-led-to-his-arrest-it-was-dead-wrong/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cases</a> of wrongful arrests that appear to have involved little investigation beyond a face match, all involving Black men. She has come across a handful of other examples across the country, she said, in her work with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</p><p>For Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a racial justice advocacy group, the technology exacerbates the problems of what he called “racist policing.”</p><p>“If facial recognition was misclassifying white people, white men or white women, it would not be on the shelf,” he said. “Some of us and some of our communities are expendable.”</p></div></div><div><p><h2 id="link-26f51e9">‘Rubber-Stamping Warrants’</h2></p></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Electronic warrant services like CloudGavel allow judges to sign arrest warrants digitally.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>To get a warrant to arrest someone, an officer must convince a judge there is probable cause — meaning, essentially, there is a good reason to do so — and get the judge’s signature. In the past, that meant an officer had to go to court, or even meet a judge at a diner in the middle of the night if the case was urgent. That is a moment when questions are asked about the strength of the evidence, legal experts say.</p><p>But the friction of getting a warrant has been eased by technology. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office uses an “eWarrant” service, <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/cloud-gavel-redacted/d103d66bd8b6a978/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CloudGavel</a>, for which <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/CloudGavel-Jefferson-Parish-Contract/6476813febabf52c/full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it paid $39,800 last year</a>. It’s an app that allows officers to request digital signatures from judges. “Law enforcement officers can now get an arrest warrant approved in minutes,” the company’s website states.</p><p>Many civil liberties advocates actually favor electronic warrants; they allow judges to more easily review decisions made by the police and eliminate a complaint from officers that it’s too hard to get a warrant. But advocates said it would be worrisome if judges were simply clicking a button without asking questions or providing sufficient scrutiny.</p><p>“There are real questions about whether it increases the incidence of judges rubber-stamping warrants,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, a deputy director with the A.C.L.U.’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">A warrant issued in Jefferson Parish for Mr. Reid’s arrest appears to have been signed digitally by a judge.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p>A criminal court judge signed off on Mr. Reid’s arrest warrant at 4:28 p.m. on July 18.
