    <h1>Designing a website without 404s</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started working on Pillser, I knew I am not going to get everything right the first time.</p>
<p>This is particularly true about the information architecture of the website.</p>
<p>The idea behind Pillser is simple: <em>associate research with supplements</em>. However, as there aren&#39;t many anologous websites, I have to come up with how to present this information. As such, I wanted to reduce lock-in to URL architecture as much as possible. One of the ways I&#39;ve done it is by using <strong>fuzzy matching</strong> to redirect users to the right place when they make a typo, a product is renamed, or the logic used to generate the URL changes. (The latter has happened enough times already that I am glad that I&#39;ve implemented this feature!)</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like from the user&#39;s perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pillser.com/supplements/spore-probiotic-6066">/supplements/spore-probiotic-6066</a> This is the correct URL for the supplement.</li>
<li><a href="https://pillser.com/supplements/spore-probiotic">/supplements/spore-probiotic</a> This URL is missing the ID. However, the website will redirect the user to the correct page.</li>
<li><a href="https://pillser.com/supplements/youtheory-spore-probiotic">/supplements/youtheory-spore-probiotic</a> This URL includes the brand name. However, since disregarding the brand name &#34;spore probiotic&#34; is unique enough to identify the supplement, the website will redirect the user to the correct page.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, I&#39;ve applied this logic only to the supplement pages, but I am planning to extend it to the rest of the website.</p>
<p>In practice, the implementation is so simple that I am surprised that more websites do not implement it. It is basically a fallback mechanism that queries the database to find the closest match to the URL.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
  id,
  slug
FROM supplement
ORDER BY similarity(slug, ${slug}) DESC
LIMIT 1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>similarity</code> function is a PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html"><code>pg_tgrm</code> extension</a> that calculates the similarity between two strings. The closer the value is to 1, the more similar the strings are. Since my goal is to find the closest match, I order the results by the similarity in descending order and pick the first one.</p>
<p>In the backend, I log whenever such a redirect happens. This way, I can manually override the redirect logic if I discover that the chosen supplement is not the correct one or not the most relevant substitute.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this is to provide a better user experience. I am unsure what are the implications for SEO, but I am hoping that it will be positive. I will keep you updated on this.</p></div></div>
