<p dir="auto">The <b>f32</b> is an ultra-compact ESP32 development board designed to mount directly behind a USB-C receptacle. The PCB measures just 9.85 mm x 8.45 mm. It&#39;s powered by the ESP32-C3FH4 microcontroller and was created primarily for research and as a bit of a stress test for the ESP32, since it intentionally ignores many standard design guidelines. There&#39;s only one exposed GPIO and it is connected to an onboard LED, so most of the development on here would be more catered for wifi/web.<br/></p>

<p dir="auto">To test the f32 an example application was created that users can interact with. The application turns the f32 into a captive portal so when it&#39;s powered on it will show up as an open access point that the user can select from available WiFi networks. The user is then automatically sent to the f32&#39;s control page where they can interact with some of its basic functionality such as turning on an LED or scanning for surrounding WiFi networks. There&#39;s also an &#34;About&#34; page that provides a small overview of the device. Below are some screenshots and a gif of interacting with the device.</p>
