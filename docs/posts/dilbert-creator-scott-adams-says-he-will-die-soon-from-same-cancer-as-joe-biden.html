    <h1>Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Says He Will Die Soon from Same Cancer as Joe Biden</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>“Dilbert” creator Scott Adams said on Monday morning that he expects to die soon from prostate cancer, the same disease former President Joe Biden announced he is battling.</p>



<p>Adams made the jarring revelation during the latest episode of “Coffee With Scott Adams,” the Rumble show he hosts during weekday mornings. </p>	
	



<p>“I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has. I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones, but I’ve had it longer than he’s had it – well, longer than he’s admitted having it,” Adams said. “So my life expectancy is maybe this summer. I expect to be checking out from this domain sometime this summer.” </p>

<p>The 67-year-old Adams first gained fame as the creator of “Dilbert,” the satirical comic strip that focused on corporate office inanity, in 1989. </p>



<p>Adams has written dozens of books since then, and has become more outspoken about politics in the last decade, sharing views that are mostly pro-Donald Trump and critical of Democrats, on social media. His Rumble show has 38,000 followers, and on X, he has 1.2 million followers. </p>



<p>Before revealing he also had prostate cancer on Monday’s show, Adams shared his thoughts on the disease. </p>	
	



<p> “If it’s localized and it hasn’t left your prostate, it is 100% curable. But, if it leaves your prostate and spreads to other parts of your body — in this case, Joe Biden has it in his bones — it is not curable. “</p>	
	



<p>His comments came the morning after it was announced Biden was battling an <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/president-joe-biden-diagnosed-aggressive-prostate-cancer/">“aggressive” form of prostate cancer. </a></p>



<p>“I’d like to extend my respect and compassion and sympathy for the ex president and his family, because they’re going to be going through an especially tough time,” Adams added. </p>
