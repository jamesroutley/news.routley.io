    <p>We are thrilled to announce an exciting new chapter in the evolution of Mixxx. We are embarking on a comprehensive redesign of the Mixxx user interface, transitioning from QWidget to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML">QML</a>. This significant update aims to enhance customization, improve performance, and ensure better accessibility for a variety of hardware, including tablets and touchscreen laptops, but also to users with vision deficiency thanks to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/accessible-qtquick.html">built-in capabilities of QML</a>. Further details on the original proposal can be found <a href="https://github.com/mixxxdj/proposals/blob/main/proposals/2024-11-16_qml_interface.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a preview of the current look we have designed during the proposal. Of course, as always with design work, the final version will likely look a little different, but this helps as a general guideline and goal to something we like, and hopefully you will to!</p>

<h2>Why We Are Redesigning Mixxx</h2>
<p>The current user interface of Mixxx has served us well, but as technology evolves, so must we. The shift to QML will simplify customization and maintenance, allowing us to focus more on innovative features and less on upkeep. This transition will also enable us to phase out our homemade theme system, streamlining our development process.</p>
<h2>Key Features of the New Design</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Modernized Library and Waveform Views</strong>: We are introducing a fresh look for the Library and Waveform views, making them more intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
</ol>
