    <h1>Nostr is a stupid simple P2P protocol that works, built by builders</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have been seeing a lot of shilling for mastodon lately, so I thought I would step in and shill Nostr for a bit.</p><p>https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr</p><p>Fun facts about Nostr:</p><p>* Nostr stands for &#34;Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays&#34;. It is an odd acronym, but I like it.</p><p>* Nostr uses websockets and relays to build a really simple P2P network. We also steal a few ideas from bitcoin (ECDSA ids, schnorr-signed events).</p><p>* Relays are simply dumb data stores for events that clients publish and subscribe to.</p><p>* Clients don&#39;t trust relays to be honest, so all events are self-signed. Your pubkey is your userid.</p><p>* It is stupid simple to build a Nostr client. You can easily do it in less than 400 lines of JavaScript. And it runs in the browser.</p><p>(shameless self plug)  
https://github.com/cmdruid/nostr-emitter</p><p>* Nostr is powerful enough to host chat apps very easily. Here is a rip of Telegram, running on Nostr:</p><p>https://anigma.io</p><p>* There&#39;s a lot of fun things you can do with Nostr. Check out all these cool projects!</p><p>https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr</p><p>* We are constantly discussing how to improve the protocol.

https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips</p><p>Thank you for reading my nostr shill post. I did not create nostr, nor do I get any monies for promotion. I just think it&#39;s really cool and I have a lot of fun building stuff that punches though nats.</p><p>If you have any questions about nostr please feel free to ask.</p><p>Also, Happy Thanksgiving to everyone! I hope we&#39;re all feeling fat and sassy today. :-D</p></div></div></div>
