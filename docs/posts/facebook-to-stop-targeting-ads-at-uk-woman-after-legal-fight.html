But the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) disagreed.</p><p>&#34;Organisations must respect people&#39;s choices about how their data is used,&#34; a spokesperson for the ICO said. &#34;This means giving users a clear way to opt out of their data being used in this way.&#34;</p><p>Ms O&#39;Carroll said that Meta had agreed to stop using her personal data for direct marketing purposes, &#34;which in non-legalese means I&#39;ve essentially been able to turn off all the creepy, invasive, targeted ads on Facebook&#34;.</p><p>She said that she did not want to stop using Facebook, saying that it is &#34;filled with all of those connections and family and friends, and entire chapters of my life&#34;.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Ms O&#39;Carroll said she hoped her individual settlement would make it easier for others who wanted Facebook to stop giving them targeted adverts.</p><p>&#34;If other people want to exercise their right, I believe they now have a gateway to do so knowing that the UK regulator will back them up,&#34; she said.</p><p>Meta said it disagreed with Ms O&#39;Carroll&#39;s claims, adding &#34;no business can be mandated to give away its services for free.&#34;</p><p>A spokesperson added: &#34;Facebook and Instagram cost a significant amount of money to build and maintain, and these services are free for British consumers because of personalised advertising.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Our services support British jobs and economic growth by connecting businesses with the people most likely to buy their products, while enabling universal access to online services regardless of income. We will continue to defend its value while upholding user choice and privacy.&#34;</p><p>Facebook and Instagram have a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67226394">subscription service</a> in most of Europe, where users can pay monthly so that they don&#39;t get ads on the platform.</p><p>The Meta spokesperson said the company was &#34;exploring the option&#34; of offering a similar service to UK users and would &#34;share further information in due course.&#34;</p></div></div></article></main></div></div>
