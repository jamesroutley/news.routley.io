    <h1>Size is the best predictor of code quality (2011)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- links --><section><article><a href="https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/10669678292/size-is-the-best-predictor-of-code-quality"></a><p>After my <a href="http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/10126017769/smeeds-law-for-programming">last post</a>, which hypothesized a relationship between the total size of a program and the bugs in it, I was led to <a href="https://href.li/?http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.20.2141">this paper</a>, via <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.neverworkintheory.org/?p=58">this blog post</a>, via <a href="https://href.li/?http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2991224">this comment</a>. This, by the way, is my favorite thing about blogging.</p><p><em>Khaled El Emam, Saida Benlarbi, Nishith Goel, and Shesh N. Rai: “The Confounding Effect of Class Size on the Validity of Object-Oriented Metrics“. IEEE Transasctions on Software Engineering, 27(7), July 2001.</em></p><p>It is a long and well-written paper, and contains a lot of background about code metrics.</p><p>If you want to understand all the nuances, I will not reproduce them here–go read the full paper.</p><p>However, here’s the tl;dr:</p><p>A long paper trail of software engineering studies has shown that many <em>internal</em> code metrics (such as methods per class, depth of inheritance tree, coupling among classes etc.) are correlated with <em>external</em> attributes, the most important of which is bugs. What the authors of this paper show is that when they introduce a second variable, namely, the total size of the program, into the statistical analysis and control for it, the correlation between all these code metrics and bugs <em>disappears</em>.</p><p>The old model was something like this: the structural properties of code, which can be measured with various metrics, affect its cognitive complexity, which in turn affects external attributes such as the number of bugs, maintainability etc.</p><p><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls1txcFcoN1qb0n0p.png" alt=""/></p><p>However, this paper uncovers a strong association between most code metrics and the size of the code, both of which together lead to the externally observable attributes like bugs.</p><p><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls1tx2QzZQ1qb0n0p.png" alt=""/></p><p>So this partially backs up my hypothesis that the number of bugs can primarily be predicted only by the total lines of code. Yegge got it right when he said that <a href="https://href.li/?http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html">size was code’s worst enemy</a>. However, I still haven’t found any studies which show what this relationship is like. Does the number of bugs grow linearly with code size? Sub-linearly? Super-linearly? My gut feeling still says “sub-linear”.</p></article> <!-- /post -->
