    <h1>US goverment seeks to rehire recently fired nuclear workers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>The US government is trying to bring back nuclear safety employees it fired on Thursday, but is struggling to let them know they should return to work, NBC News has reported.<!-- --></p><p>The National Nuclear Security Administration workers were among hundreds of employees in the energy department who received termination letters.<!-- --></p><p>An email obtained by NBC said the letters for some NNSA employees &#34;are being rescinded, but we do not have a good way to get in touch with those personnel&#34;. <!-- --></p><p>The terminations are part of massive effort by President Donald Trump to slash the ranks of the federal workforce, a project he began on his first day in office, less than a month ago.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Last week, nearly 10,000 federal workers were let go, according to multiple US outlets. <!-- --></p><p>That figure was in addition to the estimated 75,000 workers who have accepted an offer from the White House to leave voluntarily in the autumn. <!-- --></p><p>The nuclear security officials who were laid off on Thursday helped oversee the nation&#39;s stockpile of nuclear weapons. That included staff who are stationed at facilities where the weapons are built, according to CNN. <!-- --></p><p>Attempting to reach the workers, the email, which was sent to current employees, said: &#34;Please work with your supervisors to send this information (once you get it) to people&#39;s personal contact emails.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Trump is working to slash spending across the board, abroad and at home, and going so far as to call for eliminating the education department. He is getting help from the world&#39;s richest man, Elon Musk, who, through an effort called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has sent workers to comb through data at federal agencies and helped implement the &#34;buyout&#34; offer.<!-- --></p><p>Last week, the Trump administration ordered agencies to fire nearly all probationary employees, those who had generally been in their positions for less than a year and not yet earned job protection. That included the NNSA staff members.<!-- --></p><p>Altogether, the move could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people. <!-- --></p><p>Several of the Trump administration&#39;s efforts to shrink the government&#39;s size and spending have been met with legal challenges. <!-- --></p><p>More than 60 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration since the president was inaugurated on 20 January.<!-- --></p></div></div>
