																																	<p>One of humanity&#39;s crowning talents is called &#34;cumulative culture&#34;—our ability to build up skills, knowledge and technology over time, improving them as they pass down through the generations.</p>
<p>This ability to transfer abilities no individual could learn by themselves is credited with helping driving humanity&#39;s rise and domination of the world.</p>
<p>&#34;Imagine that you dropped some children on a deserted island,&#34; said Lars Chittka, a behavioral ecologist at the Queen Mary University of London and co-author of the bee study.</p>
<p>&#34;They might—with a bit of luck—survive, but they would never know how to read or to write because this requires learning from previous generations,&#34; he said in a video published with the study in the journal <i>Nature</i>.</p>
<p>Previous experiments have demonstrated that some animals are capable of what is known as social learning—working out how to do something by observing others of their kind.</p>
<p>Some of these behaviors seem to have been perfected over time, such as the incredible navigational talent of homing pigeons or chimpanzees&#39; ability to crack nuts, suggesting they could be examples of cumulative culture.</p>
<p>But it is difficult for scientists to rule out that an individual pigeon or chimp could not have worked out how to do achieve these feats by themselves.</p>
<p>So a UK-led team of researchers turned to the humble bumblebee.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>&#39;So surprised&#39;</h2>
<p>The first step was training a crack squad of &#34;demonstrators&#34; to do a complex skill that they could later teach to others.</p>
<p>In the lab, some bees were given a two-step puzzle box. They were tasked with first pushing a blue tab, then a red tab to release the sugary prize at the end.</p>
<p>Alice Bridges, a study co-author also from Queen Mary University, told AFP: &#34;This task is really difficult for bees because we are essentially asking them to learn to do something in exchange for nothing&#34; during the first step.</p>
<p>Initially, the baffled bees just tried to push the red tab—without first moving the blue one—and simply gave up.</p>
<p>To motivate the bees, the researchers put a sugary treat at the end of this first step which was gradually withdrawn as they mastered the process.</p>

<p>The demonstrators were then paired up with some new &#34;naive&#34; bees, which watched the demonstrators solve the puzzle before having a go themselves.</p>
<p>Five of the 15 naive bees swiftly completed the puzzle—without needing a reward after the first stage.</p>
<p>&#34;We were so surprised,&#34; Bridges said. &#34;We were all just going crazy&#34; when it first happened, she said.</p>
<p>Alex Thornton, a professor of cognitive evolution at the UK&#39;s University of Exeter not involved in the research, acknowledged that it was a small sample size.</p>
<p>&#34;But the point is clear—the task was exceptionally hard to learn alone, yet some bees could solve it through social learning,&#34; he wrote in a comment piece in Nature.</p>
<p>The authors of the research said it was the first demonstration of cumulative culture in an invertebrate.</p>

																																			<h2>Chimp off the old block</h2>
<p>Chimpanzees—our closest living relatives—also seem to possess this talent, according to a separate study in <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>.</p>
<p>The puzzle box for a troupe of semi-wild chimpanzees at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia was a little more difficult.</p>
<p>It involved retrieving a wooden ball, holding open a drawer, slotting in the ball then closing it to release the peanut prize.</p>
<p>Over three months, 66 chimps tried and failed to solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>Then the Dutch-led team of researchers trained two demonstrator chimpanzees to show the others how it was done.</p>
<p>After two months, 14 &#34;naive&#34; chimps had mastered it.</p>
<p>And the more the chimps watched the demonstrators, the quicker they learned to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Bridges said the studies &#34;can&#39;t help but fundamentally challenge the idea that cumulative culture is this extremely complex, rare ability that only the very &#39;smartest&#39; species—e.g. humans—are capable of&#34;.</p>
<p>Thornton said the research again showed how &#34;people habitually overestimate their abilities relative to those of other animals&#34;.</p>
