        <p>December Adventure was started by <a href="https://tenforward.social/@eli_oat/115646225602430501">Eli_oat </a>at <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure-2025">Oatmeal</a>.  I love seeing what others do this month - <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure#section">here</a> is a log of logs.</p><p>This December, I plan to make a generative quilt, play with origami,  doodle some mossy mandalas, set up next year&#39;s journal, and who knows what else. This post is the log where I will update and share my adventure.</p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day-1</h2><h3 id="pick-a-quilt">Pick a quilt</h3><p>I have a jellyroll of 4-5 tones of fabric, which I hope to make a small quilt with. Using randomness and p5.js, I picked a quilt. There is both a random block generator and a random rotation pattern that I used to get this. I started the code last week and plan to clean it up to share over the month. There are a lot of features and options I&#39;d like to add. My mom looked through the patterns with me, and we had fun looking at ones that sometimes seemed translucent, woven, or jittery. </p><p>Here is a snapshot:</p><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/12/image.png" alt="Screenshot of jellyroll quilt UI with the chosen quilt and the block.

The rotation pattern that wraps is 0 degrees, 0 degrees, then 270 degrees of the reflected block - so a 2:1 ratio of blocks.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/12/jellyroll-block-6.png" width="2000" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt="A light vertical stripe, then a stripe with a black square and light grey strip, the a dark grey strip and lighter grey square, then a black strip" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/jellyroll-block-6.png 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/jellyroll-block-6.png 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/12/jellyroll-block-6.png 1600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/12/jellyroll-block-6.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/12/image-2.png" width="2000" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt="reversed block with the black stripe on the left and bright stripe on the right mid tones in the middle withsquares from the light and dark." srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/image-2.png 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/12/image-2.png 1600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/12/image-2.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div></figure><p>I am not sure how much fabric I have - because I haven&#39;t done the math yet, but I am happy with various sizes of the 0-0-270R pattern with these blocks.
