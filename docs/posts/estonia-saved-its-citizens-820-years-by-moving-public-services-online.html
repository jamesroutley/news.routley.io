        <p>Estonia is a small country with a population of only 1.3 million. In <a href="https://e-estonia.com/story/">2005</a>, it became the first country in the world to allow its citizens to vote online in elections, and today 46.9% of those eligible opt to vote online. Almost everything in Estonia can now be done online – from filing taxes to signing contracts to ordering prescriptions. Only those that marry or want to get a divorce have to physically visit an office.</p><p>The Estonian government estimates that going digital has saved the state and its citizens, 820 years in time and resources, and the country routinely places first in internet freedom, online services, digital public services, and cybersecurity.</p><p>Estonia’s digital transformation is a model for other countries looking to improve the efficiency of their government services. By making it easier for citizens to access government services online, Estonia has saved millions of hours of time and millions of euros in financial and human resources.</p><p><a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/">What can states do</a> to make it easier for citizens to access government services online?</p><p>- adopting Estonia&#39;s <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/id-card/">digital ID</a> and e-residency program;</p><p>- creating a <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/interoperability-services/x-road/">single digital platform</a> for all government services; (<a href="https://www.karlsnotes.com/what-you-have-to-go-through-to-check-if-you-can-travel-to-malta-during-covid-19/">just not like this</a>)</p><p>- developing a nationwide broadband network;</p><p>- making all government <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/government-cloud/">data open and accessible</a> to citizens.</p><div><p><em>Thank you for reading.
