    <h1>Exploiting the IKKO Activebuds “AI powered” earbuds (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>So my journey with these earbuds started after I saw them on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxPHxlV8Uo2L2k_v_RNloYS80CGql6CWH8?ref=blog.mgdproductions.com" rel="noreferrer">this</a> Mrwhosetheboss video about pointless tech. This device seems to be also popular on TikTok. My suspicions were confirmed, this runs android. So of course i went ahead and bought them.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="952" height="632" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image.png 952w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>245 euros later... and they finally arrived!</p><p>Before we dive further into this, unlike with <a href="https://x.com/MarcelD505/status/1785346490635878837?ref=blog.mgdproductions.com" rel="noreferrer">rabbit</a>, this issue has been properly reported and patched.

The device itself boots up to a screen with the time and ChatGPT front and center.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3227.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1478" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_3227.jpg 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_3227.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_3227.jpg 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3227.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>There are some other AI features available too like translations. But this isn&#39;t a review of the device, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p83t0qj9SFM&amp;ref=blog.mgdproductions.com" rel="noreferrer">other YouTube videos</a> about that. The ChatGPT animation looks way too similar to the actual app and OpenAI could probably get them in legal trouble for stealing their brand identity. I will also mention that the audio quality is absolute shit if you use their EQ profiles but can be upped to a usable level by tweaking the EQ curves yourself.</p><p>There are also some apps available in the IKKO store, the reason that there is no google play store available is because these apps are modified specifically for the screen on the ActiveBuds, at least, that is what the CEO says about them. We will check that out in a bit. These apps include some music apps like Spotify, but also some gaming apps like, oh god, SUBWAY SURFERS BAYBEEEEE</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3229.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_3229.jpg 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_3229.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_3229.jpg 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3229.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Of course all of them unbearable to navigate due to the small screen. However we can now confirm that it most definitely runs android.</p><h2 id="time-for-some-hacking">Time for some hacking</h2><p>There is sadly no browser available to directly download other apps. And while you can open the native android settings app, clicking the build number 7 times does not enable developer mode. So i couldn&#39;t enable adb it seems. Is it locked that well? heh nope.</p><p>Let&#39;s just plug it into a pc and see what happens....</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="520" height="154"/></figure><p>What the fuck, they left ADB enabled. Well, this makes it a lot easier. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3221-4.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_3221-4.jpg 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_3221-4.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_3221-4.jpg 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3221-4.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>After sideloading the obligatory DOOM, i began checking out how the ChatGPT integration works on the backend. I first started HTTP inspecting the device, however since i couldn&#39;t enable the proper system certificates without rooting the device, i couldn&#39;t see exactly to what URL it communicated. Fortunately that wasn&#39;t really needed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1241" height="217" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-6.png 1241w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, it communicates DIRECTLY TO OPENAI. This means that a ChatGPT key must be present on the device!</p><p>I know that this device can be rooted to get the proper certificates installed because <a href="https://www.hovatek.com/forum/thread-32287.html?ref=blog.mgdproductions.com" rel="noreferrer">a tool</a> exists on all Spreadtrum/Unisoc devices which can be used to unlock the bootloader as long as companies use the default signing keys. This was indeed the case here too. However, i couldn&#39;t get past the confirmation screen as the device does not have a volume up key to confirm the unlock. I think you are able to sign your own partitions to make it flash them without an unlocked bootloader but that&#39;s a bit too advanced for my own liking.</p><p>So, i went back to the drawing board and just dumped all of the apps from it with an APK extractor tool. After popping the launcher app into JADX, things immediately became concerning.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="706" height="575" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-7.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-7.png 706w"/></figure><p>The device can communicate to either of these domains.</p><ul>
<li>api.openai.com</li>
<li>chat1.chat.iamjoy.cn</li>
<li>chat2.chat.iamjoy.cn</li>
<li>openspeech.bytedance.com</li>
<li>www.airdimple.cn</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing this i went hunting for api endpoints and keys. I found a file called SecurityStringsAPI which contained encrypted endpoints and authentication keys. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1339" height="784" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-8.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-8.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-8.png 1339w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>You might think, hey that&#39;s just base64 idiot, the most basic encoding known to mankind.

I am not going to even try to read that. Fortunately i didn&#39;t have to. I just sideloaded the app on a different device which was rooted, and well, <a href="https://x.com/MarcelD505/status/1785346490635878837?ref=blog.mgdproductions.com" rel="noreferrer">just like the rabbit apk</a>, it just works!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3231.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_3231.jpg 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_3231.jpg 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_3231.jpg 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3231.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Inspecting this device:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-10.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1026" height="448" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-10.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-10.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-10.png 1026w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Yup, that&#39;s an OpenAI key.</p><p>Now, while having this access, we can also expose their (pretty funny) system prompt.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="973" height="388" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-11.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-11.png 973w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>The device also has another few modes, which are Angry Dan and In-Love Dan.

(The QR code is not the IMEI itself but something encrypted) I found the API endpoint by looking at the same SecurityStringsAPI, which was less secure than i initially thought because the variable names literally expose the encrypted api endpoints (lol)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="135" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-22.png 2258w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>Plugging in the getBindDevQrCode api in postman, i could fabricate a base64 image of the QR code with any IMEI.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="678" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-24.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-24.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/image-24.png 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-24.png 2375w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>However, using this QR code to try and bind the device to my app resulted in an error, saying that the device has already been bound to someone else.

Come on, actually try to have at least some professionalism. Second, OK they are actually doing something about it. </p><p>Shortly after this email, they locked down the app and put out an announcement stating that the app will be in maintenance for a week.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-32.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="971" height="1011" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-32.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-32.png 971w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-33.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1016" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-33.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-33.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/image-33.png 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-33.png 2086w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>They also wanted to become a sponsor of my empty YouTube channel?

After the service period they put out both an app update and a device update. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-35.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1712" height="554" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-35.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-35.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/image-35.png 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-35.png 1712w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>Anyways, it is now impossible to fetch the chats without having a valid account token. Still doesn&#39;t fix the fact that i can generate a QR code with the guessable IMEI and bind the device to an app if it hasn&#39;t been bound already. That circumvents this all. </p><p>The device update broke the ChatGPT functionality from functioning on a device which is not the IkkoBuds itself. The keys remain on device and have not been rotated. So if anyone is able to figure out the broken app on another device or the key encryption system, you can still get your very own free OpenAI API key.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-37.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1625" height="468" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-37.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-37.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/image-37.png 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-37.png 1625w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>However i just gave up at this moment, also because they never replied with anything after my last email criticizing them for leaving the keys on device. This is now a month and a half ago.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-36.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="468" srcset="https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/image-36.png 600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/image-36.png 1000w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/image-36.png 1600w, https://blog.mgdproductions.com/content/images/2024/10/image-36.png 2083w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/></figure><p>So, that is it. You can still inject messages into apps of others, link devices that are not already bound to another companion app, thus leaking chat history. And leak first and last names of devices which are bound.</p><p>I am giving up, but if anyone else wants this company to fix this, be my guest.</p><h3 id="update-13-01-2025"><strong>UPDATE 13-01-2025:</strong></h3><p>I got this device rooted with help from <a href="https://x.com/haro7z?ref=blog.mgdproductions.com">@haro7z</a></p><p>They are now checking the device&#39;s imei before it is able to use the chatgpt integration and are now using a proxy api instead of calling directly to openai.
