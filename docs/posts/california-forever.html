        <p>
          Solano County sits at the crossroads of Northern California. Nestled
          between Sacramento, the Delta, San Francisco, and Napa Valley, Solano
          perfectly captures the diversity of California’s landscapes and its
          people. It is the home of agriculture and green energy industries that
          sustainably feed and power our state, strong middle-class communities,
          and our nation’s busiest Air Force base. Eastern Solano County is also
          an area ready for a new community. We’re excited to tell our story.
          </p>
        <p>
          Last month, 81% of Solano parents we surveyed said that their kids
          won’t be able to find a future in their own neighborhood when they
          grow up.
        </p>
        <p>
          These challenges often have separate, unrelated causes. But they could
          share a common solution. Instead of watching our kids leave, we have
          the opportunity to build a new community that attracts new employers,
          creates good paying local jobs, builds homes in walkable
          neighborhoods, leads in environment stewardship, and fuels a growing
          tax base to serve the county at large. And, Solano has the right
          location for a project like this in the eastern part of the county.
        </p>

          The area today.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not just our idea. In the past, when preparing long-range
          plans for the Bay Area, the Association of Bay Area Governments
          (&#34;Regional Plan 1970-1990&#34;) and the U.S. Department of Commerce
          (&#34;Future Development of the San Francisco Bay Area, 1960-2020&#34;) both
          concluded that to keep our region affordable, prosperous, and
          balanced, new industries and communities could be built in eastern
          Solano. The area had low fire risk, access to water, and was
          strategically located in the middle of the larger Northern California
          region. All that remains true today.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
          Let’s dust off those plans, </h2>
        
        <p>
          California Forever was founded in 2017 by our CEO, Jan Sramek. After
          moving to California a decade ago, Jan spent time in Solano County
          during fishing trips on the California Delta and fell in love with the
          area. Having previously lived in many of the world’s most walkable,
          livable, and sustainable towns and cities, Jan became interested in
          fusing what he learned about those livable communities with those old
          plans for eastern Solano. He became committed to a vision for the
          future of Solano County. Jan and his wife Naytri recently purchased
          their first-ever home in Solano, and they are excited to live here
          with their toddler daughter, her soon-to-arrive little brother, and
          golden retriever Bruce.

          This idea of building a new community and economic opportunity in
          eastern Solano seemed impossible on the surface, but after spending a
          lot of time learning about Solano and its people, Jan became convinced
          that with a thoughtful design, the right long-term patient investors,
          and strong partnerships with all stakeholders, there would be an
          opportunity to build a remarkable place for Solano residents, both
          current and the many generations to come.

          To make sure we could do this right, our company raised capital from
          people who shared our long-term vision and belief that California’s
          best days are still ahead. Investors in California Forever include

          Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Reid Hoffman, Michael Moritz, Laurene
          Powell Jobs, and the California investment firm Andreessen Horowitz.

          Over the past few years, we have purchased over 50,000 acres in
          eastern Solano County, between Fairfield and Rio Vista. California
          Forever owns about half of the properties in this area. Other
          landowners own the remaining half. Our project would not change the
          zoning of other landowners’ properties – they would remain zoned for
          agriculture, and those landowners would be able to continue their
          agricultural operations. In addition, on our lands, the project would
          include a variety of land uses – a new community, but also solar farms
          and open space, including both agriculture and habitat conservation.
          Our project would protect and support Travis Air Force Base, including
          by respecting Solano County’s official Travis Reserve Area, which is a
          security buffer for the protection of Travis Air Force base
          established by Solano County in its
          <a href="https://www.solanocounty.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=11013" target="_blank">General Plan</a>, and subsequently clarified through a recent ordinance.

          mailing a survey to every Solano household. Third, we are forming a
          Community Advisory Board of Solano citizens. Please send any
          nominations to <a href="mailto:community@californiaforever.com">
            community@californiaforever.com</a>. Finally, we are working on opening offices in Vallejo, Fairfield

            This is a project that must be not just designed with, but also
            approved by, all Solano residents. Solano County’s Orderly Growth
            Measure directs development into cities, and asks that new projects
            outside of cities be submitted to the voters for approval. We fully
            support these principles, and we will ultimately ask the voters to
            approve the project. The Orderly Growth Measure is the right
            approach to safeguard Solano, including our project, from sprawl and
            disorderly growth for many years to come.

            California was built on its pioneering spirit, its boundless
            optimism, and the utter conviction that if we work hard, and
            together, that our best days still lie ahead, waiting to be built,
            for our children, and their children, and for all the generations to
            come. California Forever is committed to building a place that
            embodies these ideals. Join us.

        <h3>Help solve regional infrastructure needs, including energy, transportation, water, and wildfire protection.</h3>
        <p>Eastern Solano benefits from existing transmission lines that could make it possible to build a large solar farm that creates hundreds of jobs and accelerates California’s transition to clean energy. Improvements to Highway 12 could make it safer and less congested. The North Bay Aqueduct needs  <a href="https://www.scwa2.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NBA-Funding-Flyer.pdf" target="_blank"> major upgrades</a> to deliver cleaner and more reliable water to over 400,000 people in Solano and Napa counties. Solano’s rural fire districts need more money to keep communities safe from wildfires. We cannot solve any of these issues on our own, but we want to be part of larger regional solutions.</p>

        <h3>Protect and support Travis Air Force Base.</h3>
        <p>Travis Air Force Base is critical to both our national security and to Solano County. We fully support its mission and always will. For example, when California Water Service and Travis were building a new water pipeline to Travis in 2021 and asked us to sell them a right of way for the pipeline, we immediately offered to donate the right of way for free instead. We are just beginning our dialogue with Travis about the right safeguards, but we are committed to respecting its boundaries both on the ground and in the air. We also hope to work with the Air Force in other ways, including by helping provide homes to base personnel, and training and career options for veterans.</p>

        <h3>Protect Solano’s open space and prime agricultural lands.</h3>
        <p>Solano County has a long history of city-centered growth. We believe building a compact community away from prime agricultural lands, surrounded by open space, is the best way to achieve that objective. Many nearby landowners are committed to agriculture, and have told us they do not want to sell or develop their properties. Their properties will, along with some of our properties, form this agricultural green belt around the new community.</p>
