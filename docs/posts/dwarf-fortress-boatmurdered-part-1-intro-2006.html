	<h3><strong>Part 1:</strong> Intro by Evilslug</h3><p>
	
What follows is a succession-style Let&#39;s Play of the game Dwarf Fortress.  In it, we chronicle the rise and fall of the epic Dwarven fortress, Boatmurdered.  (Actually, it&#39;s pretty much all fall.)  Each ruler was given a single year of gametime in which to manage the fortress, then they gave the reigns over to the next player in line.  I have added the occasional editor&#39;s note to clarify things, but mostly I stay out of the way.  The madness surrounding Boatmurdered is quite apparent on its own, I feel.</p></div></div>
