    <h1>Ask HN: With recent layoffs, how would you advise new grads entering the market?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The tech sector underwent rapid manpower growth, and recently, rapid reduction [1,2,3].</p><p>What advice do you have for new grads in CS/EE fields looking for jobs? For example, I am finishing my PhD in AI-related work this spring. Colleagues I&#39;ve talked to in several companies have told me about frozen hiring. Is this true in your experience?</p><p>Is it better to get <i>any</i> job than keep searching for the job I&#39;d be most suited for? Should I reach directly to managers in different teams? Who are the best people/kinds of firms to reach out to when the industry is slowing hiring?</p><p>[1]: https://layoffs.fyi/
