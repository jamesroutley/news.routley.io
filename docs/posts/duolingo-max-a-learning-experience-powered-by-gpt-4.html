            <p>We believe that AI and education make a great duo, and we‚Äôve leveraged AI to help us deliver highly-personalized language lessons, affordable and accessible <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/test-creation-machine-learning/">English proficiency testing</a>, and more. Our mission to make high-quality education available to everyone in the world is made possible by advanced AI technology. That&#39;s why we‚Äôre excited to take advantage of GPT-4, the newest technology from OpenAI, to make learning with Duolingo even more powerful. Introducing‚Ä¶ <strong>Duolingo Max!</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/2023/02/DuoNews-622x296--1-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1244" height="592" srcset="https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/DuoNews-622x296--1-.png 600w, https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/DuoNews-622x296--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/2023/02/DuoNews-622x296--1-.png 1244w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Duolingo Max is a new subscription tier above Super Duolingo that gives learners access to two brand-new features and exercises: <strong>Explain My Answer</strong> and<strong> Roleplay</strong>. Both are powered by the newest, most powerful generative AI technology. We‚Äôve been working closely with OpenAI for months to refine the technology and get it ready for learners!</p><p>Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about this exciting new experience!</p><h2 id="how-is-duolingo-max-different-than-super-duolingo">How is Duolingo Max different than Super Duolingo?</h2><p>Duolingo Max gives learners all the benefits of Super (unlimited hearts, no ads, and personalized review through the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/guide-to-duolingo-practice-hub/">Practice Hub</a>), as well as two new AI-powered features. These new features are: Explain My Answer and Roleplay. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/2023/03/DuolingoMax_HeroImage-Light--1-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1076" srcset="https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/DuolingoMax_HeroImage-Light--1-.png 600w, https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/DuolingoMax_HeroImage-Light--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/DuolingoMax_HeroImage-Light--1-.png 1600w, https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/2023/03/DuolingoMax_HeroImage-Light--1-.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Naturally, you might ask‚Ä¶ </p><h2 id="what-is-explain-my-answer">What is Explain My Answer?</h2><p>Sometimes you make a mistake, but you‚Äôre not exactly sure what the *right* answer would be. Or maybe, you keep making the same mistake again and again and you can‚Äôt figure out why. Explain My Answer offers learners the chance to learn more about their response in a lesson (whether their answer was correct or incorrect!) By tapping a button after certain exercise types, learners can enter a chat with Duo to get a simple explanation on why their answer was right or wrong, and ask for examples or further clarification. </p><h2 id="what-is-roleplay">What is Roleplay?</h2><p>Roleplay allows learners to practice real-world conversation skills with world characters in the app. These challenges, which earn XP, will live alongside the path as one of the ‚ÄúSide Quests‚Äù learners can access by tapping on the character. What will you talk about? We‚Äôll guide you through different scenarios! Learners might discuss future vacation plans with Lin, order coffee at a caf√© in Paris, go furniture shopping with Eddy, or ask a friend to go for a hike. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/2023/03/DuolingoMax_RoleplayReport.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/DuolingoMax_RoleplayReport.gif 600w, https://blog.duolingo.com/content/images/2023/03/DuolingoMax_RoleplayReport.gif 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Although learners aren‚Äôt actually talking to a live human, the AI behind this feature is responsive and interactive, meaning no two conversations will be exactly alike! After the interaction, learners get AI-powered feedback from Duo on the accuracy and complexity of their responses, as well as tips for future conversations.</p><h2 id="which-courses-have-access-to-these-new-features">Which courses have access to these new features?</h2><p>Though Duolingo Max is available to everyone, the only courses that can utilize these new features are Spanish and French for English speakers on iOS. We expect to roll these out to more courses and platforms very soon!</p><h2 id="are-humans-evaluating-the-content-at-all">Are humans evaluating the content at all?</h2><p>Yes! At Duolingo, our curriculum experts and designers are well-versed at <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-duolingo-experts-work-with-ai/">working with AI-generated content</a> to create fun and effective lessons. These new features are no different!</p><p>Humans write the scenarios that learners see in Roleplay‚Äîthey make sure the initial prompt (Talk about a vacation! Ask for directions!) is aligned with where the learner is in their course. Our experts also write the initial message in the chat and tell the model where to take the conversation.</p><p>We also constantly review AI-generated explanations in Roleplay and Explain My Answer to ensure that the answers are factually correct and have the right tone (fun, encouraging, and if you‚Äôre Duo, occasionally snarky üòÖ). </p><h2 id="what-if-the-ai-makes-a-mistake">What if the AI makes a mistake?</h2><p>We know that technology is never perfect (hey, neither are humans!). Part of the reason we‚Äôre so excited to use GPT-4 for these features is that it‚Äôs the most accurate (and fastest) version of the technology available. We‚Äôve spent months collaborating closely with OpenAI to test and train this technology, and will continue doing so until the mistakes are nearly nonexistent.</p><p>If you notice a mistake or error in an AI-generated response, you can report it by holding down the inaccurate message‚Äîa menu will pop up and allow you to select your reason for reporting. Our team will watch for these reports and use them to train the model to be more accurate. (For more about how we work with learners to ensure our lessons are accurate, <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-duolingo-works-with-learners/">click here</a>!)</p><p>Every Explain My Answer session also has the option to offer a üëç or üëé after you receive the explanation.</p><h2 id="a-new-way-to-max-imize-your-learning">A new way to Max-imize your learning</h2><p>We‚Äôve spent months testing this technology with our teams and small groups of learners, and we‚Äôre impressed by the results. Our mission has always been to bring the highest-quality education to everyone on the planet, and AI helps us do that a lot faster than if we worked alone! </p><p>We‚Äôre so excited to continue bringing new features and exercises to all of our learners around the world‚ÄîDuolingo Max is only the beginning! We&#39;re rolling this out slowly to learners on iOS devices. If you&#39;re eligible to try out Duolingo Max, you can find it in the Shop tab (click the gem icon at the top of your screen). Android and Web learners should keep an eye out for Duolingo Max in the coming months!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><iframe width="381" height="677" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-oLLqILsAU" title="Introducing Duolingo Max" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center><!--kg-card-end: html-->
