    <h1>Ask HN: What does RISC-V custom chips for under $100K mean?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In 2016, SiFive blogged about custom chips for under $100K[1]. What does this mean in practice for a business? What does a business get if they give SiFive $100K? Does the business have to give SiFive anything in addition to $100K such as a schematic? What are the steps between giving SiFive $100K and getting physical chips in your hands?</p><p>&gt; At the workshop, people asked me what it would cost to make a chip with SiFive. The room went quiet … people expected me to dance around the topic (like all other people do). Jaws dropped when I simply said “system architects and designers can get customized chips for less than $100,000” – less than the cost of just licensing most CPUs today.</p><p>[1] https://www.sifive.com/blog/custom-chips-for-under-100k</p></div></div></div>
