  <p>Radiant&#39;s purpose is to explore what personal computing could be when
  designed from <a href="https://radiant.computer/principles">first principles</a>.</p><p>

  We believe the current trajectory of personal computing is leading us to a
  less free world, and that only a new computing movement rooted in human
  dignity, creation and autonomy can change its course.

  <p><strong>Radiant is a computer reimagined from the ground up</strong>, a
  <em>clean-slate</em> design free from the historical baggage that plagues
  modern systems, and free from Big Tech&#39;s influence.</p>

  <p>It&#39;s a computer designed to help you learn, create, play, and explore.
  It&#39;s a space to focus, free from distractions. A return to the simple
  joy of computing: just you and your ideas.</p>

  <p><strong>Computers today are designed around engagement</strong> and
  surveillance business models rather than user needs. App stores are filled
  with adware. Operating systems prioritize data collection over user agency.
  Social media algorithms optimize for addiction. Big Tech fundamentally
  reshaped computing from a tool for human empowerment into an attention
  extraction machine.</p>

  <p><strong>Radiant proposes an alternative vision for computing</strong>. It
  doesn&#39;t ship with a web browser; it has its own network reminiscent of the
  early Internet: no social media, no scripts, no trackers. It&#39;s a from-scratch
  system that doesn&#39;t retrace the footsteps of the contemporary OS. It&#39;s a
  new paradigm for personal computing that uses modern advances mindfully and
  deliberately. It&#39;s fully open, from hardware to software. It&#39;s an
  offline-first space, designed for focus and creation.</p>

  <p><strong>Code is computing&#39;s native medium</strong>; the material you shape
  to build your own tools, stories, and spaces. Radiant is designed to make
  that accessible to everyone. It&#39;s a tool for personal computing where every
  application and every surface, exists as code you can read, edit, and extend.
  It&#39;s a system you can truly own. One that is designed to bring the joy of
  computing to everyone.</p>

  <p><strong>Writing software doesn&#39;t have to be daunting</strong>, but the
  platforms and tools we&#39;re stuck with make it so. Radiant aims to change that
  and truly empower users to create. Furthermore, advances in generative A.I.
  will make coding accessible to a much broader audience. One of our goals is
  to explore how an A.I.-native computer system can enhance the creative
  process, all while keeping data private.</p>

  <p>Radiant belongs to a more humane future: a personal computer that welcomes
  curiosity, invites experimentation, and keeps the power in your hands. This
  is personal computing for the next generation.</p>
