          While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural
          rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and
          splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which can lead to
          poor-quality renderings, and reliance on a good initialization. In
          this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample
          drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the
          physical representation of the scene---in other words, Markov Chain
          Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D
          Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin
          Dynamics (SGLD) update by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite
          the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as
          simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing
          these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the
          `cloning&#39; of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that
          approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient
          use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the
          removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes,
          we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy
          control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to
          initialization.
