    <h1>Hurl, the Exceptional Language</h1>

<p>Hurl is a language created for one purpose: to explore a language based around exception handling as the only control flow.
It was sparked from conversations between <a href="https://ntietz.com/">Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya</a> and friends from <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> whose identities will be withheld for their dignity.</p>
<p>This site contains documentation around how to use Hurl.
It also provides some examples and guidance for debugging and answers questions.</p>

<p>It comes highly endorsed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, uh, have changed my mind about ever implementing a language based on Hurl.
This monstrosity is beautiful, and I must never touch it.
I don&#39;t want my name associated with this in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I decided to make this language a reality. <em>I&#39;m sorry.</em></p>

<p>The source code for Hurl and for this site are both available in <a href="https://sr.ht/~ntietz/hurl-lang/">Hurl&#39;s repo</a>.
Emailed patches are welcome if you find a bug or an error, but you&#39;ll need to sign over all rights to the patch: I need to preserve the ability to relicense this and license it commercially.</p>

<p>For this project, I considered <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~boringcactus/fafol/tree/master/LICENSE-v0.2.md">joke licenses</a> and <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/bsl">unfortunate licenses</a>.
Ultimately, this software is licensed under the following three very serious licenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under AGPL-3.0</li>
<li>Under GAL-1.0 (Gay Agenda License)</li>
<li>Under a commercial license</li>
</ul>
<p>You may use the software under any one of these licenses, without regard for the others.</p>
