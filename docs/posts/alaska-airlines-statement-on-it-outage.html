				<div><h4>Thursday, Oct. 23 – 7 p.m. Pacific Time</h4>
<p>Alaska Airlines is experiencing an IT outage that has resulted in a systemwide ground stop of Alaska and Horizon Air flights across our network, causing delays and cancellations. The IT outage does not affect Hawaiian Airlines flights. The issue began around 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 23, with a failure at our primary data center.</p>
<p>The IT outage has impacted several of our key systems that enable us to run various operations, necessitating the implementation of the ground stop to keep our aircraft in position. The safety of our flights was never compromised.</p>
<p>The IT outage is not a cybersecurity event, and it’s not related to any other events.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize to our guests whose travel plans have been disrupted today. We’re working to get them to their destinations as quickly as we can. For those who have a flight with us, please check your <a aria-label="Link flight status" id="menur1at7" href="https://www.alaskaair.com/flightstatus" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.alaskaair.com/flightstatus">flight status</a> before leaving for the airport.
