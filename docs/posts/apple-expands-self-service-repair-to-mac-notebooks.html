 <p>UPDATE</p>
 <p>Apple expands Self Service Repair to Mac notebooks </p>
 <p>Genuine Apple parts and tools can be purchased by US customers on August 23</p>
 <p>Apple announced Self Service Repair will be available tomorrow for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro notebooks with the M1 family of chips, providing repair manuals and genuine Apple parts and tools through the Apple <a href="https://www.selfservicerepair.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">Self Service Repair Store</a>. Self Service Repair for iPhone launched earlier this year and the program will expand to additional countries — beginning in Europe — as well as additional Mac models later this year.</p>
 <p>Self Service Repair for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro offers more than a dozen different repair types for each model, including the display, top case with battery, and trackpad, with more to come. Customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices will be able to complete repairs on these Mac notebooks, with access to many of the same parts and tools available to Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers.</p>
 <p>To start the Self Service Repair process, a customer will first review the repair manual for the product they want to repair by visiting <a href="https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">support.apple.com/self-service-repair</a>. Then, they can visit the Apple Self Service Repair Store and order the necessary parts and tools.</p>
 <p>Every genuine Apple part is designed and engineered for each product, and goes through extensive testing to ensure the highest quality, safety, and reliability. Customers can send replaced parts back to Apple for refurbishment and recycling, and in many cases receive credit of their purchase by doing so.</p>
 <p>The Apple tools are custom designed to help provide the best repairs for Apple products, and are engineered to withstand the rigors of high-volume, professional repair operations where safety and reliability are the utmost priority. Apple will offer rental kits for $49, so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. Customers will have access to the tool kit for one week and it will be shipped free of charge.</p>
 <p>Self Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to further expand access to repairs. For the vast majority of customers who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.</p>
 <p>Over the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 3,500 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians. As a result, in the US, eight out of 10 Apple customers are located within 20 minutes of an authorized service provider.</p>
