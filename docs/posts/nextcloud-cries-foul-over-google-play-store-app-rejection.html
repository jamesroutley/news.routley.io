    <h1>Nextcloud cries foul over Google Play Store app rejection</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> European software vendor Nextcloud has accused Google of deliberately crippling its Android Files application, which it says has more than 800,000 users.</p>
<p>The problem lies with the &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage#all-files-access">All files access</a>&#34; permission, where broad access to files on a device is required. While most applications can make do with Google&#39;s more privacy-friendly storage access tools, such as Storage Access Framework (SAF) or the MediaStore API, others require more permissions – hence the &#34;All files access&#34; privilege.</p>
<p>Nextcloud&#39;s Android Files app is a file synchronization tool that, according to the company, has long had permission to read and write all file types. &#34;Nextcloud has had this feature since its inception in 2016,&#34; it said, &#34;and we never heard about any security concerns from Google about it.&#34;</p>

    

<p>That changed in 2024, when someone or something at Google&#39;s Play Store decided to revoke the permission, effectively crippling the application. Nextcloud was instructed to use &#34;a more privacy-aware replacement.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>According to Nextcloud, &#34;SAF cannot be used, as it is for sharing/exposing our files to other apps ... MediaStore API cannot be used as it does not allow access to other files, but only media files.&#34;</p>
<p>Attempts to raise the issue with Google resulted in little more than copy-and-pasted sections of the developer guide. &#34;Despite multiple appeals from our side and sharing additional background, Google is not considering reinstating upload for all files,&#34; Nextcloud said.</p>

        

<p>The issue seems to stem from the Play Store. While a fully functional version is available on F-Droid, the Play Store edition is subject to Google&#39;s imposed limitations. Regarding the All files access permission, Google&#39;s developer documentation <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage#all-files-access">states</a>: &#34;If you target Android 11 and declare All files access, it can affect your ability to publish and update your app on Google Play.&#34;</p>
<p>Nextcloud is clearly aggrieved by the change, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/14334">as are its users</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;This might look like a small technical detail but it is clearly part of a pattern of actions to fight the competition,&#34; it said. &#34;What we are experiencing is a piece of the script from the big tech playbook.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>Nextcloud cites examples, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/01/21/microsoft_seeks_dismissal_wordperfect_lawsuit/">allegations</a> leveled at Microsoft over the once-popular WordPerfect word processor, which were eventually <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/04/28/victory_for_microsoft_as_supremes_decline_to_hear_novells_wordperfect_whine/">snuffed out</a> in 2014, or the antics of Apple and Meta that have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/23/meta_apple_dma_ruling/">attracted scrutiny</a> from regulators.</p>
<p>In 2021, Nextcloud and other companies <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/02/nextcloud_onedrive_interview/">filed a complaint</a> in the EU regarding alleged anti-competitive behavior from Microsoft. &#34;We are now four years in, and nothing has happened,&#34; the company said. &#34;What do you think happens to a company that releases no updates to their app in four years?&#34;</p>

        

<p>Are there nefarious actors at play here, an automated process that auto-rejects apps with elevated access requirements, or is it just simple incompetence? &#34;Either way,&#34; Nextcloud said, &#34;it results in companies like ours just giving up, reducing functionality just to avoid getting kicked out of their app store.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The issue is that small companies – like ours – have pretty much no recourse,&#34; it added. Nextcloud went on to criticize oversight processes as slow-moving, with fines that sound hefty but amount to little more than a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>&#34;Big Tech is scared that small players like Nextcloud will disrupt them, like they once disrupted other companies. So they try to shut the door.&#34;</p>
<p>Nextcloud told us the app&#39;s installed audience is 824,000 on Android - customers that used the app in the last 30 days.</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> repeatedly asked Google to comment, but it failed to respond. ®</p>
