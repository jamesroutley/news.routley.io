<p>Sam Altman&#39;s comments on the prospects of startups hoping to break through in the AI business may have come back to bite him. Several posts on X (and probably other platforms) ridicule the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-and-microsoft-reportedly-planning-dollar100-billion-datacenter-project-for-an-ai-supercomputer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-and-microsoft-reportedly-planning-dollar100-billion-datacenter-project-for-an-ai-supercomputer">OpenAI</a> boss and co-founder&#39;s dismissal of potential competition emanating from the startup scene, particularly those with only limited financial resources in the range of $10 million. Altman&#39;s comments were made during a Q&amp;A session after a &#39;Conversations&#39; presentation to India VCs, recorded in June 2023. The comments seem way off the mark in early 2025, with DeepSeek now on the scene claiming its groundbreaking model only cost $5.6 million to train.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is pretty hilarious in retrospect.In India in 2023, Altman was asked how if a small, smart team with a budget of $10 million could build something substantial within AI.His reply: &#34;It’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation models&#34; https://t.co/pdYIhV2x1m<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884113684978622538" data-url="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884113684978622538" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Entrepreneur Arnaud Bertrand reckons that Altman&#39;s response in the above clip is &#34;pretty hilarious in retrospect.&#34; In other words, Bertrand thinks Altman&#39;s dismissal of the Indian VC&#39;s question about startups challenging the likes of OpenAI showed a startling lack of foresight.</p><p>The video begins with the VC stating that there is a very vibrant startup ecosystem in India. He goes on to muse whether Altman might see a gap in the AI business, one which an Indian startup could fill. More specifically, the VC asks whether a trio of super-smart engineers from India &#34;with say, not $100M, but $10M – could build something truly substantial?&#34;</p><p>Altman&#39;s response was quite dismissive of the VC&#39;s well-mannered query. &#34;Look, the way this works is we&#39;re going to tell you it&#39;s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation models. You shouldn&#39;t try, and it&#39;s your job to try anyway, and I believe both of those things,&#34; was Altman&#39;s disjointed stream-of-consciousness style reply, followed by audience titters. &#34;I think it is pretty hopeless,&#34; he added, possibly wishing to soften his initial response.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">deepseek&#39;s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they&#39;re able to deliver for the price.we will obviously deliver much better models and also it&#39;s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884066337103962416" data-url="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884066337103962416" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote></div><p>To Altman&#39;s credit, earlier today he posted a thread on X praising the catalyst behind his recent social media ridiculing. The launch of China&#39;s DeepSeek has caused significant AI business and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-loses-usd589-billion-in-market-cap-broad-stock-plunge-triggered-by-deepseek-ai-release" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-loses-usd589-billion-in-market-cap-broad-stock-plunge-triggered-by-deepseek-ai-release">tech industry tremors</a>, and Altman has now publicly admitted it is &#34;an impressive model, particularly around what they&#39;re able to deliver for the price.&#34;</p><p>Nevertheless, like the funding-hungry CEO he is, Altman quickly turned the thread around to OpenAI promising jam tomorrow, with the execution of the firm&#39;s roadmap, amazing next-gen AI models, and &#34;bringing you all AGI and beyond.&#34;</p><p>The amount of money DeepSeek truly spent on training its model, which it claims is $5.6 million, is contested. However, despite those contentions, it is clear that the company pulled off training a frontier model with disruptively low costs, shocking the US titans of AI.</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-HyBY2hdXNd75Zxm2t4xDaJ"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get Tom&#39;s Hardware&#39;s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div></div></div>
