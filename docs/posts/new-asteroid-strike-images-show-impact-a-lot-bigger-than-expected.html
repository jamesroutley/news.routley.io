 The James Webb and Hubble telescopes on Thursday revealed their first images of a spacecraft deliberately smashing into an asteroid, as astronomers indicated that the impact looks to have been much greater than expected.</p><p>

The world&#39;s telescopes turned their gaze towards the space rock Dimorphos earlier this week for a historic test of Earth&#39;s ability to defend itself against a potential life-threatening asteroid in the future.</p><p>

Astronomers rejoiced as NASA&#39;s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impactor slammed into its pyramid-sized, rugby ball-shaped target 11 million kilometres (6.8 million miles) from Earth on Monday night.</p><p>

Images taken by Earth-bound telescopes showed a vast cloud of dust expanding out of Dimorphos -- and its big brother Didymos which it orbits -- after the spaceship hit.</p><p>

While those images showed matter spraying out over thousands of kilometres, the James Webb and Hubble images &#34;zoom in much closer&#34;, said Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer at Queen&#39;s University Belfast involved in observations with the ATLAS project.</p><p>

James Webb and Hubble can offer a view &#34;within just a few kilometres of the asteroids and you can really clearly see how the material is flying out from that explosive impact by DART&#34;, Fitzsimmons told AFP.</p><p>

&#34;It really is quite spectacular,&#34; he said.</p><p>

An image taken by James Webb&#39;s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) four hours after impact shows &#34;plumes of material appearing as wisps streaming away from the centre of where the impact took place&#34;, according to a joint statement from the European Space Agency, James Webb and Hubble.</p><p>

Hubble images from 22 minutes, five hours and eight hours after impact show the expanding spray of matter from where DART hit.</p><p>

- &#39;Worried there was nothing left&#39; -</p><p>

Ian Carnelli of the European Space Agency said that the &#34;really impressive&#34; Webb and Hubble images were remarkably similar to those taken by the toaster-sized satellite LICIACube, which was just 50 kilometres from the asteroid after separating from the DART spacecraft a few weeks ago.</p><p>

The images depict an impact that looks &#34;a lot bigger than we expected,&#34; said Carnelli, the manager of the ESA&#39;s Hera mission which intends to inspect the damage in four years.</p><p>

&#34;I was really worried there was nothing left of Dimorphos&#34; at first, Carnelli told AFP.</p><p>

The Hera mission, which is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and arrive at the asteroid in 2026, had expected to survey a crater around 10 metres (33 feet) in diameter. </p><p>

It now looks like it will be far bigger, Carnelli said, &#34;if there is a crater at all, maybe a piece of Dimorphos was just chunked off.&#34;</p><p>

The true measure of DART&#39;s success will be exactly how much it diverted the asteroid&#39;s trajectory, so the world can start preparing to defend itself against bigger asteroids that could head our way in the future.</p><p>

It will likely take Earth-bound telescopes and radars at least a week for a first estimate of how much the asteroid&#39;s orbit has been altered, and three or four weeks before there is a precise measurement, Carnelli said.</p><p>

- &#39;Huge implications&#39; - </p><p>

&#34;I am expecting a much bigger deflection than we had planned,&#34; he said.</p><p>

That would have &#34;huge implications in planetary defence because it means that this technique could be used for much larger asteroids&#34;, Carnelli added.</p><p>

&#34;Until today, we thought that the only deflection technique would be to send a nuclear device.&#34;</p><p>

Fitzsimmons said that even if no material had been &#34;flung off&#34; Dimorphos, DART still would still have slightly affected its orbit. </p><p>

&#34;But the more material and the faster it&#39;s moving, the more of a deflection there will have been,&#34; he said.</p><p>

The observations from James Webb and Hubble will help reveal how much -- and how quickly -- matter sprayed from the asteroid, as well as the nature of its surface.</p><p>

The asteroid impact marked the first time the two space telescopes observed the same celestial body.</p><p>

Since launching in December and releasing its first images in July, James Webb has taken the title of most powerful space telescope from Hubble.</p><p>

Fitzsimmons said the images were &#34;a beautiful demonstration of the extra science you can get by using more than one telescope simultaneously&#34;.</p>
