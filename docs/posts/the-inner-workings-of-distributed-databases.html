    <h1>The Inner Workings of Distributed Databases</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><img alt="The problem of replication" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-28/database-replication.png" width="530"/></figure><blockquote><p>This post examines the various replication strategies
used by popular time-series and OLAP databases to implement high-availability.
Our learnings from this research have inspired us as we continue to build replication
into our own performance-focused database, <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuestDB</a>.
The database is built in C++, low latency Java, and recently Rust! The codebase
has no external dependencies and we implement SQL with native time-series
extensions.</p></blockquote><p>After being unable to ride my new electric bike to work yet again because it was
in the shop (this time because of a wiring problem that prevented the bike from
running!), I started to think about how I could create some redundancy in my
biking setup so I wouldn&#39;t be stuck riding the Tube for weeks at a time due to
simple maintenance or a supply chain issue. What if I had another bike to ride
while my current one is being fixed? That would definitely help, but electric
bikes are expensive, and there&#39;s little room to store a backup bike in my cozy
London apartment.</p><p>Believe it or not, this problem is similar to what I&#39;ve been tackling at my day
job as a database developer. Just like bicycles, databases can break down too!
Sometimes hardware fails mysteriously, or a network config has changed and your
database is no longer reachable. Sure, you could always restore your data from a
backup onto new hardware in the event of a failure, but then you&#39;re stuck with
downtime and potentially lost data; and that&#39;s assuming you&#39;ve tested your
restore process recently to ensure that it even works! Even if you&#39;re able to
run a restore seamlessly, just like I need to wait for the shop to finish fixing
my bike before I can start riding it to work again, you would also need to wait
for the restore to complete and the new database to be configured before using
it.</p><p>But luckily, unlike my bike situation, modern databases have the capability to
stay online and continue their normal operations when things go wrong. This is
especially important in the world of time series databases, which are designed
to be constantly writing data, in many cases almost nonstop. There&#39;s no time to
restore from a backup, since precious data could be lost during any period of
downtime.</p><p>How can this happen? The answer is through replication! By synchronizing
multiple database nodes and building a solution for moving execution over to
healthy ones when a node breaks down (write failover), databases can ensure that
no data is lost. This is like if I got a flat tire on my commute and could
switch to a spare bike right on the spot in the middle of the road! Seems pretty
cool, right?</p><p>As we start our journey towards making QuestDB distributed, we take the time to
analyze how several popular time-series/OLAP databases implement high
availability to highlight the pros and cons of each approach. Along with a
review of the fundamentals, we also share QuestDB&#39;s own approach and our plans
for the future.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="failover"></a>Failover<a href="#failover" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Let&#39;s take a look at a scenario is when an application writes to a database, but
it suddenly gets a network disconnect. What should happen in this case?</p><p>The application should switch to a replicated node and continue inserting data.</p><p>For example, if I had an application <code>App</code> writing to DB <code>Node 1</code> with replica
DB <code>Node 2</code> I could draw this scenario as a sequence diagram:</p><figure><img alt="Write failover use case" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-28/Write%20failover%20sequence%20diagram.png" width="531"/><figcaption>Write failover use case</figcaption></figure><p>Seems straightforward, but is it easy to get a database to play its part in this
dance? I believe it&#39;s not. To achieve this, the database has to be able to write
data into the same table A through multiple nodes. In the general case, the
database also has to evolve the schema to support adding/removing columns from
multiple nodes and applying the transaction in exactly the same order on all the
replicas. This is because some transactions like <code>INSERT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> that are
executed on the same row will have different outcomes if applied in the wrong
order.</p><p>To summarize, a database needs to be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Write data to the same table using multiple DB Nodes
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-master_replication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-master replication</a>)
or mirror the data to a read-only replicated node with automatic failover</p></li><li><p>Evolve table schemas such that the same table columns can be added
simultaneously from multiple connections</p></li><li><p>Maintain the global order of the writes and schema changes across replica
nodes</p></li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="sync-and-async-replication"></a>Sync and Async replication<a href="#sync-and-async-replication" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Different things can go wrong with databases when a failure happens. For
instance, there can be two reasons why the database <code>Node 1</code> may not reply to
the second insert, <code>insert into A values(2)</code>: it can either be that the node
fails to receive and process the transaction, or that the data is inserted but
the OK reply is not delivered back to the application due to a network
disconnect.</p><p>To avoid losing the second insert after disconnecting from <code>Node 1</code>, the
application has to repeat transaction <code>insert into A values(2)</code> to <code>Node 2</code>. The
application also has to do the repeated <code>insert into A values(2)</code> attempt in
such a way that the database does not create a duplicate row in the case when
the same insert has already been processed by <code>Node 1</code> but an OK reply is not
delivered back to the application. In order to achieve these goals, all data
inserted into <code>Node 1</code> has to be readable from <code>Node 2</code> immediately for the
application to perform the deduplication on failures. Alternatively, there must
be another built-in mechanism to de-duplicate the inserted data in the database.
This leads to the conclusion that at least one of the points below has to exist
for no-gap, no-duplicate write failover:</p><ul><li><p>Data written to one node is immediately selectable through all other replicas
so that the writing application can check for the duplicates</p></li><li><p>There is a de-duplication mechanism built into the insert protocol or table
storage</p></li></ul><p>The first bullet point above is also called Synchronous (Sync) Replication where
<code>Node 1</code> replies <code>OK</code> only after an insert is already replicated to <code>Node 2</code>. In
contrast, Asynchronous (Async) replication allows <code>Node 1</code> to reply <code>OK</code> to the
<code>App</code> before replicating the inserted data to <code>Node 2</code>. This way <code>Node 2</code> may
not receive the first insert before <code>Node 1</code> goes down, so the database will
have to reattempt to replicate the data when <code>Node 1</code> is started or connected
back.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="choice-of-replication-flavor"></a>Choice of replication flavor<a href="#choice-of-replication-flavor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Back to my bike analogy, a databased configured in single primary with a
read-only replica in Sync mode is something akin to riding one bike while
simultaneously trying to roll another alongside you at all times. You can
imagine that it&#39;s pretty hard to ride while simultaneously balancing on two
bikes, and that it&#39;s nearly impossible to actually cycle quickly!</p><figure><img alt="Sync bike riding" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-28/bikes_alongside.jpeg" width="650"/><figcaption>Sync replication bike riding</figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, a database configured in single primary with a read-only
Async replica is similar to me buying a spare bike, storing it at work, and
synchronizing my trip data when the bikes are at the same place. In case of a
breakdown, I&#39;ll lose data from that particular journey but I would still be able
to continue commuting on the spare bike the same day.</p><p>I imagine that multi-master replication is something like riding with a friend
on two tandem bikes, where everyone is riding the tandem on the first seat. If
one of the tandems breaks, the rider can move to the back seat of the other one.
Multi-master Sync replication is riding two tandems next to each other without
the freedom of turning or stopping independently. Async replication would be the
independent rides with occasional location/trip data catch-ups.</p><p>Async replication is the most reasonable choice in the world of bicycles; I do
not see people running bikes in sync on the streets. It is also a default/only
choice for many in the database world. Sync replication can be simple to reason
about, and may look like the best solution overall, but it has a hefty
performance price to pay since each step needs to wait until it is completed on
every node. Counterintuitively, even though synchronous replication makes data
available to multiple nodes at the same time, it also results in lower
availability of the cluster since it dramatically reduces the transactions rate.</p><p>There is no silver bullet for the write failover problem and every database
offers different replication flavors to choose from. To find the best option for
QuestDB, we did serious research on how replication in other time-series
databases handles the write failover and here are some of the results.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="timescaledb"></a>TimescaleDB<a href="#timescaledb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Everyone loves classic relational databases, and nearly every developer is
prepared to answer interview questions about ACID properties and sometimes even
about Transaction Isolation levels of different RDMS systems (and what can go
wrong with each of them!). Building distributed Read / Write applications using
a RDBMS is not easy but it is definitely doable.</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of the leading open source RDBMSes, and many say that it&#39;s
more than just a database. Postgres is also an extensible platform where you
can, for example, add a geographical location column type, a geospatial SQL
Query syntax, and indexes, effectively turning it into GIS system. Similarly,
TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension built to optimize the storage and query
performance of time-series workloads.</p><p>Out of the box, TimescaleDB inherits its replication functionality from
Postgres. PostgreSQL supports multiple read-only replicas with Sync or Async
replication with all the ACID and Transaction Isolation properties,
<a href="https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/replication-and-ha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and so does Timescale</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, automatic failover is solved neither by PostgreSQL nor
TimescaleDB, but there are 3rd-party solutions like
<a href="https://github.com/zalando/patroni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patroni</a> that add support for that
functionality. PostgreSQL describes the process
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/warm-standby-failover.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of failover as STONITH (Shoot The Other Node In The Head)</a>,
meaning that the primary node has to be shot down once it starts to misbehave.</p><p>Running Sync replication can solve the data gaps and duplicate problems after
the failover. If the application detects the failover, it can re-run the last
non-confirmed <code>INSERT</code> as an <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/UPSERT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UPSERT</a>.
With Async replication, a few recent transactions may be missing on the replica
that is promoted to primary. This is because the old primary node had to be shot
down (STONISHed) and there is no trivial way to move the missing data from that
&#34;dead&#34; node to the new primary node post-failover.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="clickhouse"></a>ClickHouse<a href="#clickhouse" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>ClickHouse had been developed open source for many years by Yandex, a search
provider in Russia. ClickHouse&#39;s functionality in open source (Apache 2.0) is
comprehensive and includes high availability and horizontal scaling. There are
also quite a few independent managed cloud offerings that support ClickHouse:</p><ul><li><a href="https://clickhouse.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClickHouse (Yandex spin-off)</a></li><li><a href="https://altinity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altinity</a></li><li><a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/clickhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alibaba</a></li></ul><p>It makes sense to talk about ClickHouse&#39;s replication in the context of its Open
Source product, since cloud features can vary dramatically from provider to
provider.</p><p>The great thing about ClickHouse open source is that it supports multi-master
replication. So if one creates a cluster with 2 nodes (<code>Node 1</code> and <code>Node 2</code>)
and replicated table <code>A</code> (using the ReplicationMergeTree engine):</p><p>When <code>Bob</code> sends to <code>Node 1</code></p><p>And <code>Alice</code> sends to <code>Node 2</code></p><p>Both records will be written to each of the nodes. When the
<code>INSERT INTO A VALUES(1)</code> statement is received on <code>Node 1</code>, ClickHouse writes
it to <code>part 1_1</code>. Next, <code>Node 1</code> registers the data part with the Zookeeper (or
ClickHouse Keeper). Zookeeper notifies each node about the new part, and the
nodes download the data from the source and apply it to the local table replica.
The same process happens simultaneously with <code>INSERT 2</code>.</p><figure><img alt="ClickHouse multi-master replication" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-28/Multi-maser-replication-ClickHouse.png" width="744"/><figcaption>ClickHouse multi-master replication</figcaption></figure><p>In this architecture, inserts can be written to each of the nodes in parallel.</p><p>What about reading the data back? ClickHouse documentation states that the
replication process is Asynchronous and it may take some time for <code>Node 2</code> to
catch up with <code>Node 1</code>. There is however an option to specify <code>insert_quorum</code>
with every insert. If the <code>insert_quorum</code> is set to <code>2</code> then the application
gets confirmation back from the database after both <code>Node 1</code> and <code>Node 2</code> have
inserted the data, effectively turning this into Sync replication. There are a
few more settings to consider like <code>insert_quorum_parallel</code>,
<code>insert_quorum_timeout</code>, and <code>select_sequential_consistency</code> to define how
concurrent parallel inserts work.</p><p>It is also possible to modify the table schema by adding new columns on the
replicated table. An <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement can be sent to any of the nodes in
the cluster, and it will be replicated across the nodes. ClickHouse does not
allow concurrent table schema change execution so if 2 of the nodes receive the
same non-conflicting statement:</p><p>one of the nodes can reply with the failure:</p><p>SQL Update statements are also written in ClickHouse dialect as <code>ALTER TABLE</code>
but fortunately, they can be executed in parallel without the above error.</p><p>ClickHouse also has a useful method to solve lost write confirmations; in cases
where an <code>INSERT</code> (or other) query confirmation is lost because of a network
disconnect or timeout, the client can resend the whole block of data in exactly
the same way to any other available node. The receiving node then calculates the
hash code of the data and not apply it a second time if it is able to recognize
that this data has already been applied via another node.</p><p>There are more options and flavors of how to set up replication in ClickHouse,
the most popular approach being <code>ReplicatedMergeTree</code> storage.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="influxdb"></a>InfluxDB<a href="#influxdb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>InfluxDB has the highest
<a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/time+series+dbms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DB engines time series ranking</a>
at the time of writing, and I feel that it has to be included here even though
InfluxData
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfluxDB#Closed_source_clustering_components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed the clustering product from the open source version in 2016</a>
to sell it as a commercial product, InfluxDB Enterprise. Since then, their focus
has shifted from the enterprise version to the cloud offering in recent years,
where they have built InfluxDB Cloud v2. While this is a closed-source system,
its high-level architecture is deducible from the marketing diagrams InfluxData
officially provides.</p><figure><img alt="InfluxDB cloud architecture" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-28/Influx%20Cloud%20Architecture.png" width="750"/><figcaption>InfluxDB cloud architecture</figcaption></figure><p>InfluxDB Cloud v2 persists incoming writes to the Write Ahead Log (WAL) written
over a Kafka cluster. It is a clean solution that solves the durability and
distribution of the WAL and ensures that the data is already replicated when the
client receives a write confirmation.</p><p>WAL application to &#34;Queriable&#34; table storage runs asynchronously in the Ingester
component, consuming messages from Kafka and writing them to 2 independent TSDB
copies. There is a delay between reading the message confirmed to be written, in
Influx terms this is called
<a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/reference/internals/ttbr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time to Become Readable</a>.</p><p>Influx protocol messages are idempotent in the sense that the same message can
be processed many times without creating duplicates. This is because in
InfluxDB, the same set of tags can have only one row per timestamp value. So if
one sends a line:</p><p>and then sends another line with the same measurement and timestamp:</p><p>the new field value will be added to the same line as if the fields were sent
together, in the same message:</p><p>And if any of the above messages are sent again, Influx will not add a new row.
This approach solves the problem of resending data on timeout or lost replies.
So if the client does not receive a write confirmation from Influx cloud, it can
<a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#how-does-influxdb-handle-duplicate-points" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-send the same data again and again</a>.
When the data is sent with the same timestamp and tag set from different
connections:</p><p>The querying storage nodes can become inconsistent for some time, returning any
row out of the 3:</p><table><thead><tr><th>field1</th><th>field2</th><th>time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>2023-03-03T13:59:50.000Z</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2000</td><td>2023-03-03T13:59:50.000Z</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2000</td><td>2023-03-03T13:59:50.000Z</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It can even be that the first query returns <code>field1=1</code>, a second query returns
<code>field1=2</code> and then a third tries flipping back to <code>field1=1</code>. Eventually, the
query result will become stable and return the same data on each run. This is a
very typical outcome for querying nodes in Round Robin with Async replication.</p><p>The Influx data model also solves the problem of a dynamically evolving schema.
Since there are no traditional columns (since any unknown fields and tags that
are encountered are added automatically by the database engine), there is no
problem writing a different set of fields for the same measurement by design.
Influx also checks for schema conflicts and returns errors to the writing
application if there are any. For example, if the same field is sent as a number
and then as a string:</p><p>The write will fail with the error
<code>column value is type f64 but write has type string</code> or
<code>column value is type string but write has type f64</code>.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="summary"></a>Summary<a href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Here is the summary of the replication features supported by time-series

our replication journey. It uses a multi-master write architecture internally to
make non-locking writes to the same table possible from parallel connections.
Transactions are written in parallel to different WAL segments, and a global
order of commits is maintained in a Sequencer component. The most complicated
bit is automatic schema conflict resolution so that table schema changes can
also be be performed in parallel.</p><figure><img alt="QuestDB WAL writing" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2023-03-28/QuestDB%20sequencer%20WAL%20diagram.png" width="750"/><figcaption>QuestDB WAL writing</figcaption></figure><p>We tried to avoid having a Write Ahead Log for a long time, writing directly
into the table storage. It was not an easy decision to accept WAL write
amplification for the sake of a cleaner path to replication and non-locking
parallel writes. In the end, the additional write operations did not impact
overall throughput. On the contrary, because of better parallelism, we achieved
3x better write performance in
<a href="https://github.com/timescale/tsbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Series Benchmarking Suite</a> compared
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/2021/05/10/questdb-release-6-0-tsbs-benchmark/">to our own (quite extraordinary) performance for non-WAL tables</a>.</p><p>Looking at how other databases solve the replication problem, we chose our goal
to be achieving multi-master replication with Async consistency. We believe that
this approach strikes the best balance of fault tolerance and transaction
throughput. And it is essential to have a built-in write de-duplication
mechanism for automatic write failover cases. The next steps for QuestDB will be
to move the built-in Sequencer component to a distributed environment and solve
WAL sharing between multiple instances.</p><p>Riding tandem bicycles with a friend is the best redundancy solution we see for
QuestDB. And as for my commute problem, well, I still don&#39;t know how to solve
it. You are more than welcome to join
