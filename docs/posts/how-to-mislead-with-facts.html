<p><em>Verified facts can be used to support erroneous conclusions. Here is how we can put an end to that.</em></p><p ;="">Fact-checking has become popularized as the definitive process for certifying truth in the media. This has occurred in response to the proliferation of a wide variety of internet subcultures, often based largely upon misinformation. Propaganda and bad faith communication are all too common, making the checking of facts an important part of sensemaking.</p>
<p>Verified facts are collected as ammunition for culture war, rather than for the sake of gaining a comprehensive understanding.</p>
<p ;="">In today’s so-called “post-truth” digital media landscapes, the practice of weaponizing facts has become widespread, microtargeted, and optimized for psychological impact. The normalization of mishandling facts threatens to undermine people’s sense of living in a shared reality. For some, it goes so far as to undermine the idea that reality can be known at all. </p> <figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Three-Primary-Ways-of-Misleading-with-Facts.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="3789" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Three-Primary-Ways-of-Misleading-with-Facts.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Three-Primary-Ways-of-Misleading-with-Facts.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Three-Primary-Ways-of-Misleading-with-Facts.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Three-Primary-Ways-of-Misleading-with-Facts.jpg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Image created by Adaptive Cultures</figcaption></figure><p ;="">A misleading campaign of facts runs according to some combination of the three primary ways outlined in the box above. Information campaigns that are factually truthful but nevertheless misleading are the stuff of classic propaganda, as we have documented in our recent series on the problem of modern propaganda.<sup id="textref-11"><a href="#fn-11" title="go to footnote">[11]</a></sup> For decades there has been cumulative innovation in the industry of public relations.<sup id="textref-12"><a href="#fn-12" title="go to footnote">[12]</a></sup> Techniques for misleading with facts have been continually and scientifically advanced.</p>
<p>Facts become weapons for use in politically charged discourses in which winning is more important than accurately representing larger and more complex truths.</p>
<p ;="">Today, the strategic misuse of facts is becoming a common practice employed by everyday citizens on social media. Many people post to their social media feeds only those facts they endorse, which support their existing beliefs and ideologies. Verified facts are collected as ammunition for culture war, rather than for the sake of gaining a comprehensive understanding. Microtargeting then caters to these preferences, ensuring that there is a steady supply of cherry-picked facts on offer. The resultant filter bubbles and algorithmic radicalization have been discussed in our related paper on 21st-century information warfare.<sup id="textref-13"><a href="#fn-13" title="go to footnote">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Interpreting a fact involves values and judgments not determined by the fact itself.</p><figure><img src="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Four-Ways-of-Understanding-Facts-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="5204" srcset="https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Four-Ways-of-Understanding-Facts-1.jpg 600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Four-Ways-of-Understanding-Facts-1.jpg 1000w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Four-Ways-of-Understanding-Facts-1.jpg 1600w, https://consilienceproject.org/content/images/2022/01/Mislead-with-Facts_Four-Ways-of-Understanding-Facts-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Image created by Adaptive Cultures</figcaption></figure><p ;="">Beyond simply verifying a fact, it must be placed in context and positioned relative to all other closely relevant facts. This includes gathering facts about the methods used to generate the fact in question. Verifying one fact requires verifying many others, while working towards presenting as comprehensive a network of related truths as possible. The emotional impact of any given fact is always complex. Interpreting a fact involves values and judgments not determined by the fact itself. Verification of factuality is only the beginning of a larger process of meaning-making, which involves considerations that cannot be reduced to specific debates about the “facts.”</p>
<p>Our task is to create new processes for determining what counts as a shared, socially meaningful, mutually understood “truth.”</p>
<p ;="">Misleading with facts can only be done when attention is not paid to all four ways involved in the comprehensive understanding of facts. Fact-checking as currently practiced typically only focuses on one of the four. Educational efforts aimed at improving public discourse must consider more than how to detect deceptions and lies. There is a great deal more to understanding a fact than knowing if it is true. And there is a great deal more to understanding complex realities than agreeing on a set of facts.</p>
