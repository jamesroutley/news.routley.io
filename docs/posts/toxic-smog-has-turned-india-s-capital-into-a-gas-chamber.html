It’s a consistent issue that has far-reaching health implications for the city’s residents.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>

		</div>	<p>Every year at the start of winter, tens of thousands of farmers in northern India set fire to what remains of their fields, in order to clear away crop stubble for the upcoming planting season. That smoke then wafts south to New Delhi, where calmer winter winds allow it to blanket the city.</p><p>Despite the practice being banned by India’s Supreme Court, farmers persist because it is a much cheaper option than collecting and transporting crop stubble for disposal.</p><div data-shortcode="caption">
