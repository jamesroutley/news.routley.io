Reporter Joe Crowley also followed a truck from a Drax mill to verify it was picking up whole logs from an area of precious forest. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ecologist Michelle Connolly told Panorama the company was destroying forests that had taken thousands of years to develop.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane,&#34; she said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Drax power station in Yorkshire is a converted coal plant, which now produces 12% of the UK&#39;s renewable electricity.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It has already received Â£6bn in green energy subsidies. Burning wood is considered green, but it is controversial among environmentalists. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Panorama discovered Drax bought logging licences to cut down two areas of environmentally-important forest in British Columbia.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Panorama team used drones to survey the area</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One of the Drax forests is a square mile, including large areas that have been identified as rare, old-growth forest.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The provincial government of British Columbia says old-growth forests are particularly important and that companies should put off logging them.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Drax&#39;s own responsible sourcing policy says it &#34;will avoid damage or disturbance&#34; to primary and old-growth forest.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, the latest satellite pictures show Drax is now cutting down the forest. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Planet Labs PBC</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Satellite images show forests cut down in British Columbia</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company told Panorama many of the trees there had died, and that logging would reduce the risk of wildfires. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The entire area covered by the second Drax logging licence has already been cut down.  </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="How-green-is-burning-wood-"><span role="text">How green is burning wood? </span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Burning wood produces more greenhouse gases than burning coal. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The electricity is classed as renewable because new trees are planted to replace the old ones and these new trees should recapture the carbon emitted by burning wood pellets. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But recapturing the carbon takes decades and the off-setting can only work if the pellets are made with wood from sustainable sources. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Primary forests, which have never been logged before and store vast quantities of carbon, are not considered a sustainable source. It is highly unlikely that replanted trees will ever hold as much carbon as the old forest. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Drax told the BBC it had not cut down the forests itself and said it transferred the logging licences to other companies. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But Panorama checked and the authorities in British Columbia confirmed that Drax still holds the licences.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Drax said it did not use the logs from the two sites Panorama identified. It said they were sent to timber mills - to make wood products - and that Drax only used the leftover sawdust for its pellets.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company says it does use some logs - in general - to make wood pellets. It claims it only uses ones that are small, twisted, or rotten.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>BBC Panorama visited the British Columbian forests</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But documents on a Canadian forestry database show that only 11% of the logs delivered to the two Drax plants in the past year were classified as the lowest quality, which cannot be used for wood products. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Panorama wanted to see if logs from primary forests cut down by logging companies were being transferred to Drax&#39;s Meadowbank pellet plant. The programme filmed a truck on a 120-mile round trip: leaving the plant, collecting piles of whole logs from a forest that had been cut down by a logging company and then returning to the plant for their delivery.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Drax later admitted that it did use logs from the forest to make wood pellets. The company said they were species the timber industry did not want, and they would often be burned anyway to reduce wildfire risks. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company also said the sites identified by Panorama were not primary forest because they were near roads. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the UN definitions of primary forest do not mention proximity to roads and one of the sites is six miles from the nearest paved road.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Panorama&#39;s findings come at a critical moment for Drax.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The UK government is due to publish a new biomass strategy later this year, which will set out its policy for natural fuels like wood.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A Drax spokesperson said 80% of material in its Canadian pellets is sawmill residuals, which would be disposed of anyway. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They also said that Drax applies stringent sustainability standards to its own pellet production as well as suppliers, with verification from third-party certification schemes. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We are constantly reviewing these policies to ensure we take account of the latest science,&#34; they added.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><i>Panorama&#39;s </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001cw6z">The Green Energy Scandal Exposed</a><i> is on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 3rd October and on iPlayer afterwards</i></p></div></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
