            <p><strong>As more and more people are asking me <a href="https://axbom.com/mastodon-guide/">about Mastodon</a> I felt a need for a picture to point at, showcasing how the software known as Mastodon fits into the much larger concept of the Fediverse. I made this visualisation to help myself and others explain the many different use-cases and benefits of different services that can exchange information.</strong></p><p>I am well aware this still doesn&#39;t cover all available tools. The image is a simplification, as most models are. Given that new tools can be made available regularly it would be an insurmountable task to pursue a complete mapping. Hopefully this visual is enough to illustrate the amazing variety of services within the Fediverse, and will spark curiosity to explore further.</p><p>You can download the diagram in PNG format or as a PDF.</p>

But what does federated really mean in this context? It&#39;s important to remember that the vast majority of applications in my picture can be installed thousands of times over and each of these instances, or servers, be of many different sizes. Each of these have their own rules and ownership, and make up their own corner of the Fediverse. I am fond of <a href="https://bonfirenetworks.org/faq/">these explanations provided by Bonfire</a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>A federated social network is a system that is decentralised, developed and operated by distinct providers (something like email but for social networks). It consists of multiple social apps and websites, where users of each site can communicate with users of any of the other compatible sites.</li>
<li>An application or website participating in a federated social network is interoperable with the other sites (known as instances) and federates (fetching and especially pushing data) with them based on their users interactions. Communication among the social websites is conducted through social networking protocols, like ActivityPub.</li>
<li>Advantages of a federated network:
<ul>
<li>Robust and resilient</li>
<li>Scales horizontally</li>
<li>Private data stays on each user’s home instance</li>
<li>Each instance is responsible for its content (moderation of discussions, etc)</li>
<li>Standards-based but also extensible</li>
<li>Open</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

I get the purpose of the separate video, music and photo ones, but many of these look at first glance like alternatives to mastodon. Is that the case and it’s just user’s choice/where someone feels most comfortable?</h4><p>Yes I would say it&#39;s more often a user preference. They have different interfaces, features and integrations. I understand Friendica for example has a Twitter add-on, and supports the diaspora protocol. Some people may also want several accounts for redundancy, or for talking about completely different topics, e.g. one for golf and one for knitting.</p><h4 id="why-is-nextcloud-in-the-diagram">Why is Nextcloud in the diagram?</h4><p>Nextcloud announced the alpha version of ActivityPub social features <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/activitypub-the-new-standard-for-decentralized-networks/">in</a> <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-introduces-social-features-joins-the-fediverse/">2018</a>. More recently they also announced this: <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/no-need-to-trust-musk-we-go-federated-with-nextcloud-social/">Trust in Musk or go federated with Nextcloud Social!</a></p><h4 id="how-is-wordpress-or-drupal-part-of-the-fediverse">How is Wordpress or Drupal part of the Fediverse?</h4><p>You can use a plugin to implement the ActivityPub protocol for a Wordpress blog. Same with Drupal. Readers will be able to follow blog posts on Mastodon and other federated platforms that support ActivityPub.</p><h4 id="why-is-matrix-shown-in-the-diagram-all-by-itself-is-it-really-part-of-the-fediverse">Why is Matrix shown in the diagram all by itself. Is it really part of the Fediverse?</h4><p>Matrix fits all the characteristics of a Fediverse protocol: &#34;It is decentralised, developed and operated by distinct providers (something like email but for social networks). It consists of multiple social apps and websites, where users of each site can communicate with users of any of the other compatible sites.&#34;</p><p>As Mastodon has grown in popularity and adoptance, many like to think of the Fediverse as only those applications that are based on the ActivityPub protocol. But protocols will come and go, and there are already others (not included in the diagram) that are not questioned as fediverse-included: such as Zot. I would argue that yes, Matrix is most definitely Fediverse software.</p><p>I also included it because it currently is the second-largest protocol (counting the number of instances) which means that it is a significant player when talking about the Fediverse ecosystem.</p><p>One ActivityPub application already working on Matrix protocol support (very early on) is <a href="https://socialhome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html">Socialhome</a>. Socialhome today supports both ActivityPub and diaspora.</p><p><em>As an example of a Matrix address: I am @axbom@xbm.se on Matrix.</em></p><h2 id="links-to-fediverse-software-and-services">Links to Fediverse software and services</h2><p>Here is a complete list of the tools mentioned in the visual. The paid services are <em>micro.blog</em> and <em>write.as</em>, They both federate with the network, but are themselves not offered as open source software (some of the micro.blog mobile apps are). They are mentioned here to indicate that commercial software can also hook up to the Fediverse.</p><ul><li><a href="http://bonfirenetworks.org">Bonfire</a></li><li><a href="https://bookwyrm.social">Bookwyrm</a></li><li><a href="https://castopod.org">Castopod</a></li><li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org">Diaspora</a></li><li><a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal (via plugins)</a></li><li><a href="https://friendi.ca">Friendica</a></li><li><a href="https://funkwhale.audio">Funkwhale</a></li><li><a href="https://gnusocial.network">GnuSocial</a></li><li><a href="https://hubzilla.frama.io/core/">Hubzilla</a></li><li><a href="https://kbin.pub/en">kbin</a></li><li><a href="https://join-lemmy.org">Lemmy</a></li><li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a></li><li><a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a></li><li><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a></li><li><a href="https://join.misskey.page">Misskey</a></li><li><a href="https://mobilizon.org/en/">Mobilizon</a></li><li><a href="https://nextcloud.com">Nextcloud</a></li><li><a href="https://owncast.online">Owncast</a></li><li><a href="https://joinpeertube.org">Peertube</a></li><li><a href="https://pixelfed.org">Pixelfed</a></li><li><a href="https://pleroma.social">Pleroma</a></li><li><a href="https://socialhome.network">SocialHome</a></li><li><a href="https://wordpress.org">Wordpress (via plugins)</a></li><li><a href="https://writefreely.org">Write freely</a></li><li><a href="https://write.as">Write.as</a></li></ul><h3 id="not-in-the-diagram">Not in the diagram</h3><p>As mentioned, the diagram is far from an attempt at being complete.
