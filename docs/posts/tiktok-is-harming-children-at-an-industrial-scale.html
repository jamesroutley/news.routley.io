    <h1>TikTok Is Harming Children at an Industrial Scale</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Tomorrow, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether it should step in to block or delay the implementation of </span><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/tiktok-inc-v-garland/" rel="">a law</a><span> that would </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1246663779/biden-ban-tiktok-us" rel="">ban TikTok from operating</a><span> in the U.S. If not blocked, the law will force TikTok to cease operations in the U.S. on January 19, unless its Chinese corporate owner (Bytedance) sells to a buyer not controlled by a foreign adversary. The case hinges entirely on constitutional arguments pertaining to national security and free speech. The Justices will hear no evidence about addiction, depression, sexual exploitation, or any of the many harms to children that have been alleged, in separate lawsuits filed by </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/08/tech/tiktok-sued-14-states-childrens-mental-health/index.html" rel="">14 state Attorneys General</a><span>, to be widespread on TikTok.</span></p><p>The upcoming ban will also be adjudicated in the court of public opinion as Americans try to decide whether the loss of access to TikTok would be a reason to protest or celebrate. In this post we argue that Americans should welcome the disappearance of TikTok because the company is causing harm to children, adolescents, and young adults at an industrial scale. </p><p>Our evidence comes mostly from research done by those 14 Attorneys General. Some of their briefs have been posted online for the world to see. The briefs include hundreds of quotations from internal reports, memos, Slack conversations, and public statements in which executives and employees of TikTok acknowledge and discuss the harms that their company is causing to children. We organize the evidence into five clusters of harms:</p><ol><li><p>Addictive, compulsive, and problematic use</p></li><li><p>Depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, self-harm, and suicide</p></li><li><p>Porn, violence, and drugs</p></li><li><p>Sextortion, CSAM, and sexual exploitation</p></li><li><p>TikTok knows about underage use and takes little action</p></li></ol><p><span>We show that </span><em>company insiders were aware of multiple widespread and serious harms,</em><span> and that they were often acting under the orders of company leadership to maximize engagement regardless of the harm to children. As one internal report put it:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>“Compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety,”</strong><span> in addition to </span><strong>“interfer[ing] with essential personal responsibilities like sufficient sleep, work/school responsibilities, and connecting with loved ones.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Although these harms are known, the company often chooses not to act. For example, one TikTok employee explained,</p><blockquote><p><strong>“[w]hen we make changes, we make sure core metrics aren’t affected.”</strong><span> This is because </span><strong>“[l]eaders don’t buy into problems” </strong><span>with unhealthy and compulsive usage, and work to address it is</span><strong> “not a priority for any other team.”</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>Although the evidence below is all publicly available, no one we know of has compiled and combined direct quotations from company insiders and internal reports across multiple alleged harms. We think this compilation gives vital information to parents, who might want some insight into the character and business practices of a company that owns much of their children’s attention and influences their social development.</span><span> Parents might want to know that TikTok knows that its parental controls are ineffective and rarely used:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>In another internal document, TikTok admitted that </span><strong>“user research” </strong><span>shows that </span><strong>“[f]amilies do not use Family Pairing”</strong><span> and that</span><strong> “Family Pairing doesn’t address parents’ top concerns,”</strong><span> including </span><strong>“inappropriate content, offensive interactions, and lack of privacy.</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>And even if parental controls worked and parents chose to shield their kids from bad stuff, they can’t because TikTok’s content moderation is poor. An internal study found that the “leakage rate” (of bad stuff getting past moderators) is as follows: 35.71% of</span><strong> “Normalization of Pedophilia”</strong><span> content; 33.33% of </span><strong>“Minor Sexual Solicitation”</strong><span> content; 39.13% of </span><strong>“Minor Physical Abuse”</strong><span> content; 30.36% of </span><strong>“leading minors off platform”</strong><span>; 50% of </span><strong>“Glorification of Minor Sexual Assault”</strong><span>; and 100% of </span><strong>“Fetishizing Minors.”</strong></p><p><span>For those who think that social media is relatively harmless, we urge you to read the quotations and internal studies described below, in which employees of TikTok discuss the vast and varied harms that they are causing to literally millions of American children each year.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg" width="1456" height="969" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:969,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption>Source: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The inspiration for this post was a legal brief filed by the Kentucky Attorney General that was </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/g-s1-27676/tiktok-redacted-documents-in-teen-safety-lawsuit-revealed" rel="">improperly redacted</a><span>.

Many teens experience the harms of TikTok and complain about its addictive nature and its “brain rot” effects, so why don’t they just stop using it?</span></p><p><span>When Jon asks these questions to his students at NYU who are heavy users of TikTok, he commonly gets two related answers: 1) </span><em>I’ve tried to quit but I just can’t do it,</em><span> and 2) </span><em>I can’t quit because then I won’t know what everyone else is talking about</em><span>. In other words, TikTok is both behaviorally addictive and socially addictive, which means that many teens feel </span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/common-sense-media-teenagers-social-media" rel="">trapped</a><span>. As Gen Z poet </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonathanhaidt/reel/DB167XHvRLh/" rel="">Kori James said</a><span>, about social media: “I know it&#39;s poison but I drink anyway.”</span></p><p><span>A </span><a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/when-product-markets-become-collective-traps-the-case-of-social-media/" rel="">recent study</a><span> led by the University of Chicago economist Leonardo Bursztyn captured the dynamics of this trap. The researchers recruited more than 1,000 college students and asked them how much they’d need to be paid to deactivate their accounts on either Instagram or TikTok for four weeks. That’s a standard economist’s question to try to compute the net value of a product to society. On average, students said they’d need to be paid roughly $50 ($59 for TikTok, $47 for Instagram) to deactivate whichever platform they were asked about. Then the experimenters told the students that they were going to try to get most of the others in their school to deactivate that same platform, offering to pay them to do so as well, and asked, Now how much would you have to be paid to deactivate, if most others did so? The answer, on average, was less than zero. In each case, </span><em>most students were willing to pay to have that happen</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>We (Jon and Zach) teamed up with the Harris Poll to confirm this finding and extend it. We </span><a href="https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/gen-z-social-media-smart-phones/" rel="">conducted a nationally representative survey</a><span> of 1,006 Gen Z young adults (ages 18-27). We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, if they wished that it “was never invented.” For Netflix, Youtube, and the internet itself, relatively few said yes to that question (always under 20%). We found much higher levels of regret for the dominant social media platforms: Instagram (34%), Facebook (37%), Snapchat (43%), and the most regretted platforms of all: TikTok (47%) and X/Twitter (50%).</span></p><p>What, then, is the net value of TikTok to society? The harms are vast and varied, and they are hitting children, teens, and young adults the hardest, which means that TikTok may be altering developmental pathways and causing lasting changes. The net value is likely very negative. We believe that America would be much better off if TikTok were to go dark on January 19th.</p><p><span>No consumer product is 100% safe. We don&#39;t remove a product if a child or two dies from it each year in a freak accident. But the harms documented here are not freak accidents. They are the common effects of the normal use of TikTok by children, many of them younger than the legal age of 13. Due to its current design, TikTok is perpetrating harm to millions of children—harm at an industrial scale—in America and around the world. These harms may not be presented tomorrow to the Justices of the Supreme Court, but we think they should be decisive in the court of public opinion. TikTok should be removed from American childhood.</span></p></div></div></div>
