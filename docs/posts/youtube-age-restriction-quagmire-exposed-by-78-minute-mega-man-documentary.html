<p>A YouTube creator has gone on the offensive after facing an increasingly common problem on the platform: moderation and enforcement that leaves creators confused by the logic and short on their videos&#39; revenue potential.</p>
<p>The trouble centers on a longtime YouTube video host whose content is popular among the retro-gaming devotees at Ars Technica&#39;s staff. The creator, who goes by the online handle &#34;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/summoningsalt">Summoning Salt</a>,&#34; chronicles the history of various classic games&#39; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/the-best-game-exploiting-speedruns-of-summer-games-done-quick-2022/">speedrunning</a> world records. His hour-plus analyses demonstrate how different players approach older games and exploit various bugs. The games in question are typically cartoony 2D fare instead of violent or M-rated titles.

<p>On Friday, Summoning Salt took to social media to claim that his latest 78-minute documentary about 1989&#39;s <em>Mega Man 2</em>, which went live in mid-September, has been &#34;age-restricted&#34; by YouTube&#39;s moderation system. Bizarrely, the video had been age-restricted roughly one week ago, only for YouTube to relent to the creator&#39;s appeal and claim that <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1573076054184546304">the restriction had been placed in error</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, Summoning Salt was surprised to learn on Friday that the video had been <em>re</em>-age-restricted—which he claims severely limits a creator&#39;s ability to monetize content on YouTube. An age restriction flag works against content creators in two ways: it limits the advertisement pool that might run in pre-roll and mid-view breaks, and it essentially slams the door on YouTube&#39;s recommendation algorithm, which might otherwise tease Summoning Salt&#39;s content to new viewers.</p>
<h2>Remember, this is <em>Mega Man 2</em> we&#39;re talking about</h2>

<p>YouTube&#39;s initial notice did not clarify what moderation flag Summoning Salt&#39;s latest video—a video that documents the 18-year history of people playing and exploiting the NES game <em>Mega Man 2</em>, embedded above—had triggered. His appeal eventually teased an answer from YouTube&#39;s moderation team: &#34;explicit language in certain parts.&#34; As Summoning Salt explained, the video includes a three-second outburst of six F-words, taken directly from a Twitch streamer&#39;s microphone during a passionate gameplay moment.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Summoning Salt, a speedrunning-fluent creator, took his analysis tools to the microsecond level and looked for other unrestricted YouTube content in the gaming category to see whether his video&#39;s curses-per-capita percentage (0.16 percent) had been exceeded. He immediately found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs_7crdHpbo">an unrestricted example from another popular retro-minded channel</a>, Angry Video Game Nerd, which had nearly double the swears in a video one-twelfth as dense in the script. (It&#39;s unclear how many of AVGN&#39;s videos, famously full of curse words, are flagged with age restrictions.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, Summoning Salt points to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278?hl=en#zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification">YouTube&#39;s unclear recommendations to content creators</a> for content like curse words. According to YouTube&#39;s own rules, the line between &#34;moderate profanity&#34; (allowed in YouTube&#39;s unrestricted videos) and &#34;strong profanity&#34; comes down to not only specific word choice but also frequency, and YouTube merely suggests that the line is crossed when reaching a threshold of &#34;used in every sentence,&#34; or having certain swear words appear in prominent moments like the first 30 seconds of a video or as text in a thumbnail.</p>
<p>Summoning Salt noted that the moderation team initially responded with a &#34;full review&#34; in roughly 40 minutes, less than the length of the whole video. Such a swift review process implied that an auto-moderation system used voice analysis to chronicle the number of swear words, and Summoning Salt told Ars via email that YouTube has tools in place to auto-mute what it detects as offending content—but that YouTube doesn&#39;t automatically apply them in the case of age-restriction disputes, and using built-in auto-mute tools doesn&#39;t necessarily undo the damage done by any moderators&#39; age-gating. This leaves creators out of the revenue circuit once YouTube raises such a flag. He also told Ars that his videos have only been restricted in the past by YouTube due to copyright flags over included music, which he has zero issue with.</p>
