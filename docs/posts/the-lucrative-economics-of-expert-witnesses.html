    <h1>The lucrative economics of expert witnesses</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>In the waning days of the defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, <strong>Dr. Shannon Curry</strong> was called to the stand.</p>



<p>Curry, a California-based psychologist, had been hired by Depp’s legal team to offer her opinion on Heard’s alleged personality disorders.</p>



<p>But during cross-examination, Heard’s attorney, <strong>Elaine Bredehoft</strong>, had a different <a href="https://youtu.be/2Crrs5NqCfA?t=2696">line of questioning</a> for the doctor:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“You are being paid by Mr. Depp’s legal team to be here, correct?”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>The exchange was lost to the more salacious details of the trial — but it provided a rare glimpse into the economic underbelly of the expert witness industry.</p>



<p>Expert witnesses <a href="https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=11195&amp;context=ilj">are</a> <a href="https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=11195&amp;context=ilj">used</a>, to some degree, in ~<strong>8 out of 10 </strong>trials in the US. Over the past 50 years, they’ve become increasingly more prevalent in the courts, and often hold great sway over judges and jurors.</p>



<p>But little is known to the general public about how they’re sourced and how much they’re compensated for their contributions.</p>



<p>To find answers to those questions and more, <em>The Hustle</em> spoke to expert witnesses, legal consulting firms, and attorneys.</p>



<h4 id="h-a-primer-on-witnesses"><strong>A primer on witnesses</strong></h4>



<p>In general, there are <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/discovery">three types</a> of witnesses:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Lay witness</strong>: Someone who witnessed certain events firsthand and can speak to what they saw.</li><li><strong>Character witness</strong>: Someone who knows the victim or defendant and can speak to their personality traits.</li><li><strong>Expert witness</strong>: Someone who is educated on a certain subject (forensics, psychology, surgery, etc.) who offers their professional opinion as it relates to the facts of a case.</li></ol>



<p>Lay and character witnesses are typically not compensated much, if anything, for their time.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title28/part5/chapter119&amp;edition=prelim">federal cases</a>, they receive <strong>$40 per day</strong> + <strong>$0.57 per mile</strong> for travel to the courthouse. For state-level cases, these daily fees range anywhere from <strong>$0</strong> (Kentucky) to <strong>$95</strong> (New Mexico).</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Outside of these small mandated fees, it’s illegal to pay most witnesses for their testimony — an effort to keep the court free of bias.</p>



<p>“It’s kind of like being paid for jury duty,” <strong>John Lewis</strong>, a California attorney, told <em>The Hustle</em>. “There aren’t big bucks in being a subpoenaed witness.”</p>



<p>Expert witnesses, however, are a different story.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-lucrative-business-of-being-an-expert-witness"><strong>The lucrative business of being an expert witness</strong></h4>



<p>With virtually no fee caps, experts are paid what the market demands for their services — and the market for their services is <em>very</em> robust.</p>



<p>In a high-profile case with millions of dollars at stake, it’s not uncommon to have 6-10+ expert witnesses between opposing sides.</p>



<p>The Depp-Heard trial featured nearly a dozen expert witnesses — psychologists, surgeons, entertainment and intellectual property lawyers, forensic accountants — that Lewis estimates collectively charged <strong>$1m+</strong>.</p>



<p>But experts can rack up enormous fees in less glitzy cases, too.</p>



<p>A 2017 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/c2e65f9d62b9460780f6e56f600a15c0">murder trial</a> involving a police officer cost public defenders and prosecutors in the small town of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho <strong>$600k</strong> in expert testimony — <strong>$210k</strong> of which was paid to a single psychologist.</p>



<p>Expert witnesses usually charge hourly rates for trial preparation, depositions, and testimony, which can add up quickly in complex cases.</p>



<p>In a 2021 <a href="https://www.testifyingtraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Fee-Survey-E-Book.pdf">survey</a> of ~1.1k expert witnesses, the average hourly rates for these three services worked out to some pretty princely sums:</p>



<ul><li>Case prep: <strong>$422/hr</strong></li><li>Deposition: <strong>$524/hr</strong></li><li>Trial testimony: <strong>$550/hr</strong></li></ul>



<p>In a typical case, the average witness took home <strong>$13k</strong> for ~25 hours of work. But in one case, a forensic architect — who investigates the causes and origins of construction failures — reported getting paid <strong>$2.4m</strong>.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1507" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avg.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avg-239x300.png 239w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avg-815x1024.png 815w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avg-768x964.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avg-40x50.png 40w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avg.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>Of course, these hourly fees vary widely according to area of expertise.</p>



<p>Medical professionals dominate the highest-paid gigs. Hand surgeons, who are hired to testify in medical negligence cases, average as much as <strong>$1.4k/hr</strong> — ~10x higher than the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291242.htm">national hourly average</a> for their day job.</p>



<p>Horse experts, on the other hand, who might be called upon for equine appraisal in estate disputes, charge an average of just <strong>$225/hr</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Keith Diaz</strong>, an assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University, says his work as an expert witness is “just a little extra pocket change.”</p>



<p>In 2015, Diaz was cold-contacted by a Connecticut prosecutor working on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/nyregion/in-connecticut-murder-case-a-fitbit-is-a-silent-witness.html">murder case</a> involving a FitBit.</p>



<p>He was asked to testify that the device was accurate — and for <strong>$350/hr</strong>, he eventually helped the prosecution win the case. Since then, he’s worked on 3 other cases.</p>



<p>“The amount of work, and what you’re paid, depends on the case,” he says. “Sometimes, you have to conduct simulations in the lab, process a bunch of data, or do forensic analysis. Other times, it might just be 20 hours of research and two days in court.”</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1928" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hourly.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hourly-187x300.png 187w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hourly-637x1024.png 637w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hourly-768x1234.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hourly-956x1536.png 956w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hourly-31x50.png 31w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hourly.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle</em></p>



<p>When it comes to setting fees, expert witnesses can, as one attorney puts it, “pretty much go buck wild” — with one exception.</p>



<p>Let’s say an expert psychologist is hired by the prosecution for $700/hr. If the defense team wants to depose her, it must pay her for the privilege. Under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_26">Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a>, she must charge the opposing side a “reasonable fee.”</p>



<p>“Reasonable” is up to interpretation, and has been contested in court many times:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Cartrette v. T &amp; J Transport, Inc.</strong> (2011): A treating physician’s demand for $1.5k/hr was reduced to $400/hr.</li><li><strong>Maxwell v. Stryker Corp</strong>. (2012): An orthopedic surgeon’s demand for $2k/hr was knocked down to $750/hr.</li><li><strong>American Medical Systems, Inc. Pelvic Repair Systems Products Liability Litigation </strong>(2019): A pelvic surgeon’s request for $18k/day per day was reduced to $750/hr.</li></ul>



<p>But this one restriction doesn’t seem to harm experts’ earnings much.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-expert-witness-training-business"><strong>The expert witness training business</strong></h4>



<p>When attorneys need to find an expert witness in a pinch, they turn to a <strong>$300m+</strong> <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/expert-witness-consulting-services-industry/"><strong>cottage industry</strong></a> of directories, referral services, and journals that compile and dispense professionals in hundreds of trades.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.seakexperts.com/search">SEAK</a>’s expert witness directory, a lawyer can select a specialty and browse through the backgrounds of more than <strong>2.3k</strong> experts in all sorts of hyper-niche fields:</p>



<ul><li>Street sweepers</li><li>Cryptocurrency scholars</li><li>Wine and spirits distributors</li><li>Ski accident reconstructionists</li></ul>



<p>“It’s like the Yellow Pages for expert witnesses,” says <strong>James Mangraviti</strong>, an ex-attorney and SEAK principal.</p>



<p>The company lists experts for free, but makes money by allowing experts to buy promotional placements in the search results.</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="1200" height="1084" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/psych.png 1200w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/psych-300x271.png 300w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/psych-1024x925.png 1024w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/psych-768x694.png 768w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/psych-50x45.png 50w" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/psych.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>A search for ‘psychology’ on SEAK’s expert witness database returned 125 witnesses for hire (SEAK)</em></p>



<p>SEAK also runs a lucrative business selling training courses to experts.</p>



<p>Its most popular Zoom seminar, “<em>How to Start, Build, and Run a Successful Expert Witness Practice</em>” (<strong>$1,295</strong>) claims that experts can “easily double their income by devoting one day a week to expert witnessing.”</p>



<p>“An expert has to walk into a courtroom — a very intimating place — and get cross-examined by an aggressive person who’s getting paid a lot of money to make you look like a fool,” Mangraviti says. “So of course, they need to be prepared for that.”</p>



<p>Being a successful expert witness extends beyond expertise and knowledge.</p>



<p>When selecting an expert, lawyers often look for traits beyond scientific rigor, like confidence, attractiveness, and poise.</p>



<p>“[A] fool with a small flair for acting and mathematics might be a more successful witness than, say, Einstein,” <a href="https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2162&amp;context=lawreview">wrote</a> one scholar. “They’re not chosen for their knowledge but for their ability to persuade.”</p>



<p>There’s a reason for this: Witnesses who are self-assured, make eye contact, and speak calmly are <a href="https://researchgate.net/publication/24211569_Expert_Witness_Confidence_and_Juror_Personality_Their_Impact_on_Credibility_and_Persuasion_in_the_Courtroom">perceived</a> by jurors to be more knowledgeable and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Other services, like The <a href="https://www.tasanet.com/About-Us/gclid/Cj0KCQjwheyUBhD-ARIsAHJNM-NjalB3Eu1yDdANqAv0Ag-Cl3Duu0Q_sTcblREC6pLjQY3rQs-1528aAtfmEALw_wcB">TASA Group</a> and <a href="https://www.roundtablegroup.com/">Round Table Group</a>, field requests from lawyers and hand pick experts that fit the occasion. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.forensisgroup.com/">ForensisGroup</a>, founded in 1991, boasts a rolodex of experts in 10k+ specialties and brings in <strong>$10m+</strong> in revenue in referral fees.</p>



<p>While the majority of expert witnesses on these platforms are gainfully employed and only do witness work as a side gig, several large firms (<a href="https://www.fticonsulting.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/fti-consulting-leads-whos-who-legal-arbitration-expert-witnesses-list-for-11th-consecutive-year">FTI</a>, <a href="https://www.thinkbrg.com/">BRG</a>) retain full-time economic consultants who often earn <strong>$500k+/yr </strong>testifying in court. </p>



<p>“We’ve given economists the chance to earn investment bankers’ incomes,” <strong>David Teece</strong>, the founder of BRG, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117426729190341036">told</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>in 2007.</p>



<p>But these lucrative incentives come with a moral trade-off.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-ethical-quandary-of-the-paid-witness"><strong>The ethical quandary of the paid witness </strong></h4>



<p>Diaz, the FitBit expert, says competing interests can make it challenging at times to “stick to the science” at trial.</p>



<p>“You get on a call with a lawyer who wants you to be a witness, and they give you all these reasons why the defendant is a lowlife and a terrible person,” he says. “They try to convince you. It’s tricky to not let that influence your opinions about what the data show.”</p>



<p>In court, witnesses like Diaz often feel they’re pressured into forming definitive opinions that stretch beyond sound science.</p>



<p>“If a heart rate is elevated at a certain time, a prosecutor wants me to say ‘It’s because she was dying.’ I can explain how the device works, but I can’t tell you exactly what that means,” he told <em>The Hustle</em>. “You have to be really careful and stay out of muddled areas.”</p>



<figure><img alt="" width="600" height="485" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/k.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></figure>



<p><em>Keith Diaz, a professor and expert witness in cases involving fitness trackers (Columbia University)</em></p>



<p>Diaz’s concern cuts to the heart of one of the legal world’s biggest internal debates: Can expert witnesses who are paid exorbitant sums by one side of the courtroom maintain scientific truthfulness?</p>



<p>The harshest critics of expert witnesses <a href="https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2162&amp;context=lawreview">call them</a> “well-paid prostitutes who sell their services to the highest bidder.”</p>



<p>In her 1997 book, “<em>Whores of the Court: The Fraud of Psychiatric Testimony and the Rape of American Justice</em>,” <strong>Dr. Margaret A. Hagen </strong>argues that the legal system has been “bamboozled” by scientific sellouts.</p>



<p>“Experts who help lawyers win cases are often rewarded with more work and more money,” says Lewis, the California attorney. “They have a strong financial incentive to please the person paying their checks.”</p>



<p>There may be some truth to these claims:</p>



<ul><li>A 1994 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/29762334">study</a> of 131 cases across Baltimore, Seattle, and Tucson found that <strong>77%</strong> of expert witnesses thought lawyers manipulated them to weaken unfavorable testimony and strengthen favorable testimony.</li><li>Two separate surveys of judges conducted by the Federal Judicial Center <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/us/12experts.html">concluded</a> that “experts abandon objectivity and become advocates for the side that hires them.”</li></ul>



<p>But others say the notion that money distorts objectivity is a red herring used by opposing lawyers to tear down experts’ credibility.</p>



<p>“Everybody’s getting paid in a courtroom,” says Mangraviti. “Real experts have solid, truthful opinions that don’t waver under pressure.”</p>
