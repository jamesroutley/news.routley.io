    <h1>Databricks counts being laid off as ‚Äúred flag‚Äù</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><li id="28976897"><div> <p><span>You need to lie about your background from the beginning.</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29045160"><div> <p><span>@ipo2moon that‚Äôs tricky. Not all the time the current team members would tell you the whole truth about the culture or way of working. </span></p> <p><span>Yesterday</span> <a>2</a></p></div></li><li id="29045271"><div> <p><span>He probably thought why should he suffer alone? üòÇ</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28976914"><div> <p><span>Asking for references after clearing interview was also Dik move tbh</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29031361"><div> <p><span>References don&#39;t have to be from current company/manager. They can go back to your previous employers.</span></p> </div></li><li id="29037403"><div> <p><span>I asked a friend who works at Databricks about this and he said they never use people still at your current company for back-door references. They only contact someone at your current company if you explicitly give that person as a reference.</span></p> </div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28976927"><div> <p><span>exact thing happened to me. If you are in their interview loop and you were laid off ask explicitly if it is ok to your recruiter and don‚Äôt waste time with them.</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="28995906"><div> <p><span>No, I said it in my intro call with the databricks recruiter. My references were nothing short of great. I know them all personally.</span></p> </div></li><li id="29092159"><div> <p><span>I&#39;d advice remove the rant lines. Someone probably has your name.</span></p> </div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28977114"><div> <p><span>Stripe also does this bullshit</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29037441"><div> <p><span>My friend who works at Databricks said they never use people still at your current company for back-door references. They only contact someone at your current company if you explicitly give that person as a reference.</span></p> </div></li><li id="29097939"><div> <p><span>@6240@ is correct. I&#39;m a hiring manager at Databricks and it&#39;s a strict rule to only call former employers for the back-door references. It would be foolish to jeopardize a strong hire by calling current co-workers and (rightfully so) upsetting them, especially after all the hours invested up until that point. Not to mention, it&#39;s just a dick move.</span></p> <p><span>40m</span> <a>0</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28977716"><div> <p><span>So sorry that this happened to you, it&#39;s definitely not okay. Afaik we actually hired a lot of people who were recently laid off</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="28996641"><div> <p><span>Yeah Im guessing it was just whoever sat in on the packet / leadership for the org i was interviewing for. Unreal though.</span></p> </div></li><li id="29000061"><div> <p><span>Also bummed to hear that. Im a field engineering leader and pride myself on how we treat any candidate. I hope there‚Äôs a good light at the end of that crappy tunnel</span></p> </div></li></ul></div></li></div></div>
