    <h1>Databricks counts being laid off as ‚Äúred flag‚Äù</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><li id="28976897"><div> <p><span>You need to lie about your background from the beginning.</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29045160"><div> <p><span>@ipo2moon that‚Äôs tricky. Not all the time the current team members would tell you the whole truth about the culture or way of working. </span></p> </div></li><li id="29045271"><div> <p><span>He probably thought why should he suffer alone? üòÇ</span></p> </div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28976914"><div> <p><span>Asking for references after clearing interview was also Dik move tbh</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29031361"><div> <p><span>References don&#39;t have to be from current company/manager. They can go back to your previous employers.</span></p> </div></li><li id="29037403"><div> <p><span>I asked a friend who works at Databricks about this and he said they never use people still at your current company for back-door references. They only contact someone at your current company if you explicitly give that person as a reference.</span></p> </div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28976927"><div> <p><span>exact thing happened to me. If you are in their interview loop and you were laid off ask explicitly if it is ok to your recruiter and don‚Äôt waste time with them.</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29092159"><div> <p><span>I&#39;d advice remove the rant lines. Someone probably has your name.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday</span> <a>0</a></p></div></li><li id="29099798"><div> <p><span>I dont give a fuck</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28977114"><div> <p><span>Stripe also does this bullshit</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29037441"><div> <p><span>My friend who works at Databricks said they never use people still at your current company for back-door references. They only contact someone at your current company if you explicitly give that person as a reference.</span></p> </div></li><li id="29097939"><div> <p><span>@6240@ is correct. I&#39;m a hiring manager at Databricks and it&#39;s a strict rule to only call former employers for the back-door references. It would be foolish to jeopardize a strong hire by calling current co-workers and (rightfully so) upsetting them, especially after all the hours invested up until that point. Not to mention, it&#39;s just a dick move.</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="28982633"><div> <p><span>Sorry but your claim sounds sus. We are definitely hiring laid off workers, and even on the off chance that your claim is true, there‚Äôs no way any sane recruiter would openly admit that (at any company).</span></p> </div> <div><ul><li id="29017577"><div> <p><span>OP not good to put your friends as your references</span></p> </div></li><li id="29022786"><div> <p><span>Lol at databricks for assuming friends for knowing colleagues personally.</span></p> </div></li></ul></div></li></div></div>
