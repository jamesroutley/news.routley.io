    <h1>The Email They Shouldn&#39;t Have Read</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div role="main" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Author&#39;s Note:</strong> Before we begin, an important clarification. What follows is a horror story based on real events from my career. However, to protect the privacy of the people and companies involved, I have deliberately mixed things up: technologies, contexts, and specific details have been modified or merged with other experiences. I therefore invite you to read this story not as a strict chronicle of a single event, but as an archetype of a widespread problem in the IT world: vendor lock-in and predatory business practices. Any attempt to identify the specific company or software described would lead to an incorrect conclusion.</p><hr/><p>When the phone rang, I was in a meeting - so I didn’t answer. But I recognized the number and sent a quick message: </p><blockquote><p>&#34;I’m with a client right now. If it’s not urgent, please send me an email - otherwise I’ll call you ASAP&#34;.</p></blockquote><p>The reply, via SMS, left me speechless: </p><blockquote><p>&#34;That’s exactly the problem. I can’t send you an email. Call me as soon as you can&#34;.</p></blockquote><p>From that moment on, my perception of a certain kind of world changed forever.</p><hr/><p>A few years earlier, a major public institution - let’s call it <em>Agency A</em> - was still running an ancient Exchange mail server. It hadn’t received security updates for ages, the anti-spam was completely ineffective, and the new regulations were clear: embrace Open Source solutions whenever possible.</p><p>They had already received a proposal - expensive but seemingly reasonable - for a managed service, hosted by an external provider, built on an open source mail stack. The company offered a managed version with its own proprietary additions and enterprise support. The catch? The price was absurd, and <em>Agency A</em> already had solid infrastructure - reputable IP classes, redundant datacenters, everything working fine. We had built and maintained that environment for years, and it was still running perfectly.</p><p>The request was simple: <em>“Evaluate this solution, and if it’s suitable, we’ll migrate.”</em>. About 500 active mailboxes, roughly the same number of aliases. Manageable, but far from trivial.</p><p>So I started experimenting. I had heard of that stack before but never used it directly. I deployed it in some non-critical environments - ours, and a few test clients who agreed to try it at a discounted rate. Everything worked flawlessly for almost a year. I began to appreciate its design and flexibility. Confident, I told <em>Agency A</em> we could proceed with a pilot migration.</p><p>We built a new server, deployed the stack, and assigned a few secondary domains for early adopters. The feedback was great - so good that users started pushing for a full migration.</p><p>The morning after the MX switch I was tense, waiting for trouble - but it never came. A couple of small questions, nothing serious. The internal team handled everything perfectly. It was a success.</p><hr/><p>Word spread quickly.</p><p><em>Agency B</em> - smaller, but in some ways more influential - contacted me. They were customers of the same managed-service company that had pitched to <em>Agency A</em>. Once they saw the potential savings (at less than a tenth of the annual cost), the stability, and the freedom of keeping their data on their own servers, they became very interested. Their contract, however, was a five-year deal with automatic renewal - two years left. The legal office said the notice period was six months, so there was time.</p><p>They wanted to prepare silently. Their supplier was known for <em>aggressive commercial behavior</em> and often retaliated when customers tried to leave. So we built everything quietly - users, aliases, test setups - and froze the system, waiting for the official termination notice.</p><p>That day finally came. The notice was sent, about eight months before expiration. Migration would begin upon confirmation of receipt - or the following month at the latest.</p><p>Meanwhile, I learned that <em>Agency C</em> - another institution - was also planning to leave the same provider. They wanted to keep the same software stack for consistency, so I told them about our experience. They asked for a quote, which I prepared (without mentioning <em>Agency B</em>, of course). My margin would have been small, but the project made sense: it was about <em>owning your data</em>, not making money.</p><p>Everything seemed to move smoothly - until that SMS.</p><hr/><p>I called back immediately.</p><blockquote><p>&#34;There’s been a problem with the termination&#34; said the IT manager of <em>Agency B</em>.</p></blockquote><p>I was stunned. How could they possibly know?</p><p>Minutes later, my phone rang again - <em>Agency C</em> this time. </p><blockquote><p>&#34;Forget the proposal&#34;, they said. &#34;They called us. Threatened us, actually. They even mentioned your name and said they might take legal action against you for unfair competition - claiming they’re the only <em>‘authorized’</em> installers of that software. Which is absurd, of course. It’s open source. But our director doesn’t want trouble.&#34;.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, when public money is involved, people prefer avoiding troubles over doing what’s right.</p><hr/><p>Something didn’t add up.</p><p>That still didn’t explain how they knew about <em>Agency B</em>’s internal steps. To test a theory, we set a trap: I asked a friend abroad to send <em>Agency B</em> a fake quote, from a company outside the EU.</p><p>That strongly suggested it: <strong>it looked as if they might have been reading the emails.</strong></p><p>The IT manager exploded and confronted them. The response was chilling: </p><blockquote><p>&#34;I’m not saying we do - but we could. It’s in the contract. You should read the fine print, especially the unilateral amendment from two years ago.&#34;.</p></blockquote><p>That amendment, quietly accepted, included horrifying clauses:</p><p>All of this happened before the GDPR era, when certain practices could still slip through.</p><hr/><p>I tried to contact the company’s owner directly - no reply. Calls, emails, nothing. Their support lines were &#34;not authorized to forward requests&#34;. I wanted to confront them about the <em>“not accredited”</em> nonsense and the so-called <em>unfair competition</em>. But bullies never like a fair conversation.</p><p>I urged <em>Agency B</em> and <em>C</em> to investigate - not only legally, but ethically.</p><hr/><p>Years later, those directors were gone. The technical staff remained - older, wiser, and determined not to repeat the mistake. They eventually switched providers, though to something &#34;safer&#34;, not necessarily better.</p><p>I couldn’t solve that problem. The battle had to come from them, and I would have supported them all the way - not for profit, but for principle.</p><p>And that’s the real horror of the story - not the software, but what people do with it.</p></div></div></div>
