    <p>Today was my fourth day at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=24c53dc56ddd7af575ff67d7fa1194c4">Recurse Center</a> as a participant in this year’s Summer 2 batch!</p>

<p>After writing yesterday about how I wasn’t worrying about progress on my main project for this week, I ended up poking through <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> source and docs and starting to look into how to create a new output protocol. I learned a lot, but probably stayed up a bit too late.</p>

<p>So I was a little tired today and had a slower than usual start. I took care of some mundane non-code tasks this morning.</p>

<p>This afternoon I had a really great coffee chat with a batchmate looking to build on her front end experience and learn more about approaches to backend development.</p>

<p>After that I attended a Rust study group meeting that ended up turning into a surprisingly productive pairing session! Working with one of my batchmates, we were able to create a small Rust library that both imported some types from C libraries and exposed its own functions in a shared library that could be consumed by software written in C.</p>

<p>I haven’t finished the glue code needed to test that this works on the consuming side, but in theory this tiny stub of a library should be able to support a new no-op ffmpeg / libavformat output protocol. I plan to build on this and prove out the ingegration bits and then see if I can make it work with an actual Media over QUIC (MoQ) library.</p>

<p>Later, I also had a good conversation with an <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> dev about how to best structure a plugin to add support for MoQ output to OBS.</p>

<p>Feeling really good about how things are going so far.</p>
