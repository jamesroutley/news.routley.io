                <p>
                  Scallop is a declarative language designed to support rich symbolic reasoning in AI applications.
		  It is based on Datalog, a logic rule-based query language for relational databases.

                <p>
                  Scallop is a scalable Datalog solver equipped with support for discrete, probabilistic, and
                  differentiable modes of reasoning.
                  These modes are configurable to suit the needs of different AI applications.

                <p>
                  Scallop provides bindings to support logic reasoning modules within Python programs.
                  As a result, Scallop can be deeply integrated with existing PyTorch machine
                  learning pipelines.

          <h2>Wide Range of Applications</h2>
          <p>
              Scallop can be used to develop a wide variety of applications in vision and NLP that involve symbolic reasoning.
              The reasoning component is specified via logic rules which can then be deeply
              integrated with machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks and transformers.
