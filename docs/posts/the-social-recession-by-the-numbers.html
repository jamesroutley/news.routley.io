Ever since the infamous chart showing </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/" rel="">more people are not having sex than ever before</a><span> first made the rounds, there’s been increased interest in the social state of things. Polling has demonstrated a marked decline in all spheres of social life, including close friends, intimate relationships, trust, labor participation, and community involvement. The trend looks to have worsened since the pandemic, although it will take some years before this is clearly established.</span></p><p><span>The decline comes alongside a documented rise in mental illness, diseases of despair, and poor health more generally. In August 2022, the CDC announced that U.S. life expectancy has </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220831.htm" rel="">fallen further</a><span> and is now where it was in 1996. Contrast this to Western Europe, where it has </span><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/life-expectancy-recovers-in-western-europe-and-continues-to-drop-in-the-us" rel="">largely rebounded</a><span> to pre-pandemic numbers. Still, even before the pandemic, the years 2015-2017 saw the </span><a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/diseases-of-despair-have-soared-over-past-decade-in-us/" rel="">longest sustained decline</a><span> in U.S. life expectancy since 1915-18. While my intended angle here is not health-related, general sociability </span><em>is</em><span> closely linked to health. The ongoing shift has been called the “friendship recession” or the “social recession.” </span></p><p>My intention here is not to present a list of miserable points, but to group them together in a meaningful context whose consequences are far-reaching. While most of what I will outline here focuses on the United States, many of these same trends are present elsewhere because its catalyst is primarily the internet itself. With no signs of abating, a new kind of sociability has only started to affect what people ask of the world through the prism of themselves. </p><p>The topic has directly or indirectly produced a whole genre of commentary from many different perspectives. Many of them touch on the fact that the internet is not being built with pro-social ends in mind. Increasingly monopolized across a few key entities, online life and its data have become the most sought-after commodity. The everyday person’s attention has thus become the scarcest resource to be extracted. Other perspectives, often on the left, also stress precarity and the decline of public spaces as causes. Some of these same criticisms have been adopted by the New Right, who also indict the culture at large for undermining traditions of sociality, be it gender norms or the family. Believing it disproportionately affects men, this position has produced many lifestylist spinoffs: Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), trad-life nostalgia, inceldom, masculinist groups, and hustle culture with a focus on &#39;beating the rat race.’ All of these subcultures are symptoms of the social recession in some way, for better or worse. </p><p><span>Often standing outside this conversation altogether are the self-described ‘adults in the room’ — professional media pundits, politicians, bureaucrats, and the like, disconnected from the problem themselves, but fixated on its potential to incubate political extremism. Entire institutes have been set up to study, monitor, and surveil the internet’s radicalizing tendencies buoyed by anti-social loneliness. The buzzword often used in this sphere is “</span><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stochastic_terrorism" rel="">stochastic terrorism</a><span>” and the need to contain some unknown, dangerous online element taking hold of the dispirited. The goal here is not to solve a pernicious problem, but instead to pacify its most flagrant outbursts. </span></p><p><span>We have no clear, comparative basis on which to judge what will emerge from the growing number of people who feel lost, lonely or invisible. The closest comes from the early 20th century when, for the first time, millions of provincial people came to the major cities to pursue their dreams. Many uprooted themselves only to be poor and unfulfilled, easily excited into a mania later over mass politics and culture. That’s why German novelist Herman Broch in his story </span><em>The Sleepwalkers </em><span>(1930) writes his panorama of WWI as rooted in “the loneliness of I” among three of his characters. Likewise, nobody cares for Gregor Samsa in Franz Kafka’s </span><em>The Metamorphosis</em><span> (1915),</span><em> </em><span>who is compelled to go to work despite not even recognizing himself any longer. The alienated product of mass industrial society is familiarly described in W.H. Auden’s poem </span><em>The Age of the Anxiety</em><span> (1948) — “miserable wicked me / how interesting I am.” </span></p><p>While data and polling have their limits, they are a useful starting point for concretely discussing the social recession and whether it’s here to stay. I’ve collected some numbers on the shift happening across a few key areas: community, friendship, life milestones, relationships, and trust. </p><p><span>In 2000, </span><em>Bowling Alone</em><span> by political scientist Robert D. Putnam was published to much praise for its breadth of research. The book documents the decline of sociability in the United States since the 1950s. It mainly traces the dwindling number of Americans frequenting civic organizations such as religious services, volunteer work, sports clubs, hobbyist groups, and so on. </span></p><p><span>The book was one of the first to quantitatively determine that, yes, the traditional American community was on the decline. It remains a staple within political science courses today. Yet, many of the metrics used in the study are today a bit dated. Even the title does not evoke the relevance it once did (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_league#/media/File:1997-_USBC_membership_and_lanes_and_centers_NORMALIZED.png" rel="">not even bowling</a><span> has been spared the decline of social activities). Moreover, in the year 2000, it was far easier to see the trend as ‘fixable’ because it was not overwhelmingly determined by any one factor. </span></p><p>Putnam’s work is an assessment of social life of a different kind, before the internet&#39;s mass adoption. That world is clearly never coming back. If we take one metric commonly cited in the book, church membership, the decline Putnam describes is exceptionally mild compared to what came after.</p><p><span>Rather than go through them one by one, Putnam’s trends can be assessed more  contemporaneously through a simple metric: screen time, a proxy for time spent not doing community activities in person. Rather than bowling alone, Americans are instead browsing alone </span><a href="https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/screen-time-statistics/" rel="">over 7 hours daily</a><span> on average and increasing every year. As of 2021, some 31% of Americans claim to be online </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/" rel="">“almost constantly.”</a><span> The world Putnam is describing arguably does not register with the same relevancy it once had. </span></p><p><span>If we are browsing alone rather than bowling alone, the real metric to look at is friendships themselves. The past few decades have recorded a steep decline in people’s circle of friends and a growing number of people who don’t have any friends whatsoever. The number of Americans who claim to have “no close friends at all” across all age groups now stands at around 12% as per the </span><a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/07/30/loneliness-friendship-new-friends-poll-survey" rel="">Survey Center on American Life. </a></p><blockquote><p><span>The percentage of people who say they don’t have a single close friend has quadrupled in the past 30 years, according to the Survey Center on American Life.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="">1</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s been known that friendlessness is more common for men, but it is nonetheless affecting everyone. The general change since 1990 is illustrated below. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png" width="368" height="402.8791208791209" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1594,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:368,&#34;bytes&#34;:127829,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42d75c41-8d9c-45fa-b526-b1a6be385b20_1855x2031.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Taken from </span><em>Adrift: America in 100 Charts </em><span>(2022), pg. 223.

Still, it binds our current time to a more familiar past cynicism. Skepticism toward the state has evolved into more generalized distrust toward society at large, amplified by the internet.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://novum.substack.com/p/social-recession-by-the-numbers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://novum.substack.com/p/social-recession-by-the-numbers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The data presented is enough to sketch out an archetype of the new individual, a growing minority: one who is plugged in, dispirited and often feels invisible. Carl Jung wrote that personal meaning comes “when people feel they are living the symbolic life, that they are actors in the divine drama.” In such a frayed sociality, the drama that would give one meaning closes. What often enters instead is nostalgia, exaggerated hatred, and the desire to be saved. </p><p><span>Right now, the dispirited are only beginning to agitate the political center which is led by mostly an older generation socialized in a different way. The current U.S. government has been called the </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gerontocracy-united-states-congress-red-white-and-gray-data-charts-2022-9" rel="">“oldest government in history.”</a><span> It fits the proper definition of a gerontocracy or ‘rule of the old.’ As of 2022, over 23% of Congress is over 70 years old, and the median age is 61.5. American political power has so far only sporadically felt the effects of the new individual at the ballot box, while at the same time chastising the public for it. The politics of the social recession has therefore only really just started. Analyst Martin Gurri touches on this in his book </span><em>The Revolt of The Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium</em><span> (2013). As he argues, the digital public lacks a coherent program and is motivated by negation, and the tearing down of idols and authority. We cannot expect the new individual to simply be contained to just his or her own alienation, pacified and alone. That alienation will inform beliefs on how society itself should be organized and will be the substance of some future worldview, whatever it may be. </span></p><p>As a starting point for remedies, it should be admitted that this process cannot be reverted nor can we expect political management from above to contain these asocial sentiments. The healthier alternative involves rethinking internet infrastructure on pro-social ends: platforms owned by the people using them with community prerogatives in mind. I’m not going to pretend to know what that will look like since much of it has to happen organically. While the trends described here may be a “new normal” in the sense that they cannot be reversed, I still think another healthier kind of online community is imaginable. The internet does not need to be joined at the hip to a permanent social recession like it is now.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
