    <h1>Ask HN: How do you promote your personal project in limited bugget?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I’m the one who posted about my project here yesterday.</p><p>To be honest, I’ve always focused on development, and this is my first time launching something — so I’m really struggling with promotion. How do you get people to notice your product?</p><p>It’s an open-source IntelliJ plugin that automatically generates repetitive Java code.
I believe it could be genuinely useful for many developers, especially those who like to streamline their workflow.</p><p>I’m not looking to make money from it — I just want more people to try it out. (I’m honestly afraid it’ll just disappear unnoticed.)</p><p>Are there any other good places (besides Reddit) where I could talk about my project? Even basic suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
I&#39;m really new to this area — I feel like I know less than an elementary school student.</p></div></div></div>
