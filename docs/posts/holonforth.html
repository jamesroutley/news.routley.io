    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>Handling Source Code in a Browser</p><p>A computer program is an ordered collection of units: Procedures, functions, objects, methods, variables, etc., each identified by a name. 
</p>
<p>Why do programmers still edit source code in linear text files? Why not in a CMS?  The CMS can write source files for the compiler. And it gives you new options to present and handle complete programs in a browser,  clearly structured like a book. 
</p>
<p><img src="http://holonforth.com/images/holonSLhome2.png"/></p><p>I admired the hierarchical presentation of classes in Smalltalk and wondered how the source browser could be applied to procedural source. There were files and programming units; but a middle level was missing. Finally, I noted that groups of units serve related functions. 
</p>
<p>The first Holon system had a structure of modules, groups and (Forth) words. It was functional in 1989 and evolved into <a href="http://holonforth.com/holon86.html">Holon86</a>.
</p>
<p><img src="http://holonforth.com/images/holon86.gif" id="bildholon86"/></p><p>Holon86 is a complete IDE including compiler, assembler and debugger. Source and compiled code are managed in an &#39;image&#39;, similar to Smalltalk. There is no need for external source files. 
</p>
<p>Later Holonforth became a multi-platform IDE for general use. <a href="http://holonforth.com/holonsl.html">HolonSL</a> (image above) creates source files as pipes to the code generator (compiler, interpreter).
