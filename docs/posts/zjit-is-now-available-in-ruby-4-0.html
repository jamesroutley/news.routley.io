    <h1>ZJIT is now available in Ruby 4.0</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><em>Originally published on <a href="https://railsatscale.com/2025-12-24-launch-zjit/">Rails At Scale</a>.</em></p>

<p>ZJIT is a new just-in-time (JIT) Ruby compiler built into the reference Ruby
implementation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YARV">YARV</a>, by the same compiler group that brought you YJIT.
We (Aaron Patterson, Aiden Fox Ivey, Alan Wu, Jacob Denbeaux, Kevin Menard, Max
Bernstein, Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Randy Stauner, Stan Lo, and Takashi
Kokubun) have been working on ZJIT since the beginning of this year.</p>

<p>In case you missed the last post, we’re building a new compiler for Ruby
because we want to both raise the performance ceiling (bigger compilation unit
size and SSA IR) and encourage more outside contribution (by becoming a more
traditional method compiler).</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since we gave an official update on ZJIT. Things are
going well. We’re excited to share our progress with you. We’ve done a lot
<a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/merge-zjit/">since May</a>.</p>

<h2 id="in-brief">In brief</h2>

<p>ZJIT is compiled by default—but not enabled by default—in Ruby 4.0. Enable
it by passing the <code>--zjit</code> flag or the <code>RUBY_ZJIT_ENABLE</code> environment variable
or calling <code>RubyVM::ZJIT.enable</code> after starting your application.</p>

<p>It’s faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT. <strong>Yet.</strong> But we
have a plan, and we have some more specific numbers below. The TL;DR is we have
a great new foundation and now need to pull out all the Ruby-specific stops to
match YJIT.</p>

<p>We encourage you to experiment with ZJIT, but maybe hold off on deploying it in
production for now. This is a very new compiler. You should expect crashes and
wild performance degradations (or, perhaps, improvements). Please test locally,
try to run CI, etc, and let us know what you run into on <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-master/issues?set_filter=1&amp;tracker_id=1">the Ruby issue
tracker</a> (or, if you don’t want to make a Ruby Bugs account, we would
also take reports <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/issues">on GitHub</a>).</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-compiler">State of the compiler</h2>

<p>To underscore how much has happened since the <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/merge-zjit/">announcement of being merged
into CRuby</a>, we present to you a series of comparisons:</p>

<h3 id="side-exits">Side-exits</h3>

<p>Back in May, we could not side-exit from JIT code into the interpreter. This
meant that the code we were running had to continue to have the same
preconditions (expected types, no method redefinitions, etc) or the JIT would
safely abort. <strong>Now,</strong> we can side-exit and use this feature liberally.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, we gracefully handle the phase transition from integer to string;
a guard instruction fails and transfers control to the interpreter.</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>add</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span>
  <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>add</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>
<span>add</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>
<span>add</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>
<span>add</span> <span>&#34;three&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;four&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>This enables running a lot more code!</p>

<h3 id="more-code">More code</h3>

<p>Back in May, we could only run a handful of small benchmarks. <strong>Now,</strong> we can
run all sorts of code, including passing the full Ruby test suite, the test
suite and shadow traffic of a large application at Shopify, and the test suite
of GitHub.com! Also a bank, apparently.</p>

<p>Back in May, we did not optimize much; we only really optimized operations
on fixnums (small integers) and method sends to the <code>main</code> object. <strong>Now,</strong>
we optimize a lot more: all sorts of method sends, instance variable reads
and writes, attribute accessor/reader/writer use, struct reads and writes,
object allocations, certain string operations, optional parameters, and more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, we can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">constant-fold</a> numeric operations. Because we also have a
(small, limited) inliner borrowed from YJIT, we can constant-fold the entirety
of <code>add</code> down to <code>3</code>—and still handle redefinitions of <code>one</code>, <code>two</code>,
<code>Integer#+</code>, …</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>one</span>
  <span>1</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>two</span>
  <span>2</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>add</span>
  <span>one</span> <span>+</span> <span>two</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="register-spilling">Register spilling</h3>

<p>Back in May, we could not compile many large functions due to limitations of
our backend that we borrowed from YJIT. <strong>Now,</strong> we can compile absolutely
enormous functions just fine. And quickly, too. Though we have not been
focusing specifically on compiler performance, we compile even large methods in
under a millisecond.</p>

<h3 id="c-methods">C methods</h3>

<p>Back in May, we could not even optimize calls to built-in C methods. <strong>Now,</strong>
we have a feature similar to JavaScriptCore’s DOMJIT, which allows us to emit
inline HIR versions of certain well-known C methods. This allows the optimizer
to reason about these methods and their effects (more on this in a future post)
much more… er, effectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, <code>Integer#succ</code>, which is defined as adding <code>1</code> to an integer, is a
C method. It’s used in <code>Integer#times</code> to drive the <code>while</code> loop. Instead of
emitting a call to it, our C method “inliner” can emit our existing <code>FixnumAdd</code>
instruction and take advantage of the rest of the type inference and
constant-folding.</p>

<h3 id="fewer-c-calls">Fewer C calls</h3>

<p>Back in May, the machine code ZJIT generated called a lot of C functions from
the CRuby runtime to implement our HIR instructions in LIR. We have pared this
down significantly and now “open code” the implementations in LIR.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, <code>GuardNotFrozen</code> used to call out to <code>rb_obj_frozen_p</code>. Now, it
requires that its input is a heap-allocated object and can instead do a load, a
test, and a conditional jump.</p>

<h3 id="more-teammates">More teammates</h3>

<p>Back in May, we had four people working full-time on the compiler. <strong>Now,</strong> we
have more internally at Shopify—and also more from the community! We have
had several interested people reach out, learn about ZJIT, and successfully
land complex changes. For this reason, we have opened up <a href="https://zjit.zulipchat.com">a chat
room</a> to discuss and improve ZJIT.</p>

<h3 id="a-cool-graph-visualization-tool">A cool graph visualization tool</h3>

<p>You <em>have to</em> check out our intern Aiden’s <a href="https://railsatscale.com/2025-11-19-adding-iongraph-support/">integration of Iongraph into
ZJIT</a>. Now we
have clickable, zoomable, scrollable graphs of all our functions and all our
optimization passes. It’s great!</p>

<p>Try zooming (Ctrl-scroll), clicking the different optimization passes on the

<h3 id="more">More</h3>

<p>…and so, so many garbage collection fixes.</p>

<p>There’s still a lot to do, though.</p>

<h2 id="to-do">To do</h2>

<p>We’re going to optimize <code>invokeblock</code> (<code>yield</code>) and <code>invokesuper</code> (<code>super</code>)
instructions, each of which behaves similarly, but not identically, to a
normal <code>send</code> instruction. These are pretty common.</p>

<p>We’re going to optimize <code>setinstancevariable</code> in the case where we have to
transition the object’s shape. This will help normal <code>@a = b</code> situations. It
will also help <code>@a ||= b</code>, but I think we can even do better with the latter
using some kind of value numbering.</p>

<p>We only optimize monomorphic calls right now—cases where a method send only
sees one class of receiver while being profiled. We’re going to optimize
polymorphic sends, too. Right now we’re laying the groundwork (a new register
allocator; see below) to make this much easier. It’s not as much of an
immediate focus, though, because most (high 80s, low 90s percent) of sends are
monomorphic. <!-- TODO throwback to Smalltalk-80 --></p>

<p>We’re in the middle of re-writing the register allocator after reading the
entire history of linear scan papers and several implementations. That will
unlock performance improvements and also allow us to make the IRs easier to
use.</p>

<p>We don’t handle phase changes particularly well yet; if your method call
patterns change significantly after your code has been compiled, we will
frequently side-exit into the interpreter. Instead, we would like to use these
side-exits as additional profile information and re-compile the function.</p>

<p>Right now we have a lot of traffic to the VM frame. JIT frame pushes are
reasonably fast, but with every effectful operation, we have to flush our local
variable state and stack state to the VM frame. The instances in which code
might want to read this reified frame state are rare: frame unwinding due to
exceptions, <code>Binding#local_variable_get</code>, etc. In the future, we will instead
defer writing this state until it needs to be read.</p>

<p>We only have a limited inliner that inlines constants, <code>self</code>, and parameters.
In the fullness of time, we will add a general-purpose method inlining
facility. This will allow us to reduce the amount of polymorphic sends, do some
branch folding, and reduce the amount of method sends.</p>

<p>We only support optimizing positional parameters, required keyword parameters,
and optional parameters right now but we will work on optimizing optional
keyword arguments as well. Most of this work is in marshaling the complex
Ruby calling convention into one coherent form that the JIT can understand.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>We have public performance numbers for a selection of macro- and
micro-benchmarks on <a href="https://rubybench.github.io/">rubybench</a>. Here is a screenshot of what those
per-benchmark graphs look like. The Y axis is speedup multiplier vs the
interpreter and the X axis is time. Higher is better:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/zjit-benchmark.png"/>
  <figcaption>A line chart of ZJIT performance on railsbench—represented as a
  speedup multiplier when compared to the interpreter—improving over
  time, passing interpreter performance, catching up to YJIT.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see that we are improving performance on nearly all benchmarks over
time. Some of this comes from from optimizing in a similar way as YJIT does
today (e.g. specializing ivar reads and writes), and some of it is optimizing
in a way that takes advantage of ZJIT’s high-level IR (e.g. constant folding,
branch folding, more precise type inference).</p>

<p>We are using both raw time numbers and also our internal performance counters
(e.g. number of calls to C functions from generated code) to drive
optimization.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>

<p>While Ruby now ships with ZJIT compiled into the binary by default, it is not
<em>enabled</em> by default at run-time. Due to performance and stability, YJIT is
still the default compiler choice in Ruby 4.0.</p>

<p>If you want to run your test suite with ZJIT to see what happens, you
absolutely can. Enable it by passing the <code>--zjit</code> flag or the
<code>RUBY_ZJIT_ENABLE</code> environment variable or calling <code>RubyVM::ZJIT.enable</code> after
starting your application.</p>

<h2 id="on-yjit">On YJIT</h2>

<p>We devoted a lot of our resources this year to developing ZJIT. While we did
not spend much time on YJIT (outside of a great <a href="https://railsatscale.com/2025-05-21-fast-allocations-in-ruby-3-5/">allocation speed
up</a>), YJIT isn’t going anywhere soon.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
