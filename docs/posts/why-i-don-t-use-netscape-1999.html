    <h1>Why I Don&#39;t Use Netscape (1999)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

No, not because I use MSIE. I actually use x-mosaic 2.7b5 (ancient) with
delayed image loading and emacs-w3 2.2.26 (text-only, and there
certainly are more recent versions). By default, these browsers don&#39;t
display images, they have problems with tables, cannot do frames or
any other fancy features.

<p>But these browsers have one great feature: They give a very good
indication whether a page is worth reading. If these browsers don&#39;t
display anything, or the display looks shitty, there usually is not
much content, either (In a few cases I looked up the page with
something more advanced (e.g., Arena), and I was always disappointed).

</p><p>In contrast, first-class sites like Altavista are very readable
even with ancient browsers.

</p><p>Why is this? Well, as Bernd Paysan puts it:
</p><blockquote> Die Featuritis ist meist umgekehrt proportional zum Inhalt,
und wer Inhalt hat, legt in der Regel Wert darauf, auch gelesen werden
zu koennen.</blockquote>
(BTW, if you have something worth reading, You may want to process or
check it with one of <a href="http://www.delorie.com/web/">D.J. Delorie&#39;s HTML Authoring
Services</a>; there are also other <a href="http://www.cgu.edu/degrade/evaluators.html">web page
evaluators</a>; looking at the page with an ancient browser on a B/W
screen is also a good check).

<p>Apart from this practical reason, there&#39;s a principal one: The
first time I invoked Netscape, it said that it is obsolete and refuses
to work. I don&#39;t use software that thinks it knows better than I when
I should stop using it. Actually, this is also a practical reason: Who
knows whether a new version will be available and usable when the
current one stops working?
