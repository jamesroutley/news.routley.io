Prior to Dr Strangelove, the only significant movie about world-ending nuclear war was Stanley Kramer&#39;s sombre, elegiac On the Beach, from 1959. Kubrick saw the value in making it funny. &#34;If the modern world could be summed up in a single word it would be absurd,&#34; he wrote in his notes. &#34;The only truly creative response to this is the comic vision of life.&#34; The film is packed with memorable scenes, lines and performances but nothing as unforgettable as the late-arriving Dr Strangelove himself: the sinister, amoral nuclear scientist who devolves into <!-- --><i>sieg heiling<!-- --></i> lunacy.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Goodchild&#39;s biography is excellent but its subtitle owes more to marketing than accuracy, because Teller was not the only &#34;real&#34; Dr Strangelove. Other possibilities mooted over the years are the mathematician John von Neumann, the nuclear strategist Herman Kahn, the German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun and the foreign policy expert Henry Kissinger. Despite all the speculation, Kubrick never clarified the character&#39;s origins. So did he base Strangelove on one of them, all of them, or none of them?

Writing as Peter Bryant, the Welsh former RAF officer Peter George published a novel in 1958 that was called Two Hours to Doom in the UK and Red Alert in the US. It was inspired by a recent media panic about the possibility that an accidental war could be set in motion by &#34;a nervous, psychotic or fanatical launch officer&#34;, as Carl Dreher put it in the Nation.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>In Red Alert, a back-up plan to secure the US&#39;s nuclear deterrent in the event of the president&#39;s death results in a situation where one demented general can order a strike on the USSR that only he can call off.

Kubrick didn&#39;t care – the story confirmed his belief that the logic of nuclear deterrence was insane – so he optioned the novel, and asked George to collaborate on a screenplay. But Kubrick agonised over whether to make a straight adaptation, a more realistic drama or a satirical comedy. In spring 1962 he came up with a new character, a &#34;White House Rasputin&#34; called Dr Otto Strangelove, who became his gateway to a &#34;<!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/stanley-kubrick-realised-dr-strangelove-was-comedy/">nightmare comedy<!-- --></a>&#34;.

Kahn, who was wargaming potential conflicts for the US government&#39;s RAND Corporation, believed that talking about nuclear war in terms of the end of humanity was dangerous, and that it was reckless not to consider a plan for victory and survival. In his mind, he was both a pragmatist and an optimist. But his book managed to offend hawks and doves alike, not to mention his own colleagues.

Kahn approvingly cited Red Alert in On Thermonuclear War. In George&#39;s novel, the Soviets have developed an annihilating superweapon: a cluster of bombs, encased in cobalt, that could produce enough radiation to kill everyone on earth. Although the cobalt bomb never existed, it was an object of horrified fascination from the 1950s through to the early 70s, featuring in movies from On the Beach to Beneath the Planet of the Apes. Kahn argued that such a weapon would be a useless deterrent because nobody would ever use it, but he gave it a name that was too dramatic for its own good: the Doomsday Machine.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Kubrick borrowed Kahn&#39;s coinage for the cobalt bomb in his movie. General Buck Turgidson (George C Scott) quotes the most hair-raising sections from Kahn&#39;s book almost verbatim, Strangelove lifts from the chapter about underground shelters, and President Muffley (Sellers again) references Kahn&#39;s most notorious line: &#34;Will the survivors envy the dead?&#34; The word &#34;megadeath&#34;, meaning one million deaths per nuclear explosion, was Kahn&#39;s invention, too. Strangelove even works at the RAND-like &#34;Bland Corporation&#34; (not all the movie&#39;s jokes are good). In one draft of the screenplay, Strangelove complains about the backlash to his Kahn-like book The Facts on Nuclear War. The numerous debts to On Thermonuclear War were not lost on Kahn, who suggested to an aghast Kubrick that he receive a percentage of the movie&#39;s box office.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0h7d9yq.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The nuclear strategist Herman Kahn makes the most compelling candidate for a real-life Strangelove (Credit: Getty Images)"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></section><section data-component="caption-block"><span>The nuclear strategist Herman Kahn makes the most compelling candidate for a real-life Strangelove (Credit: Getty Images)<!-- --></span></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>It&#39;s no surprise, then, that when the movie came out, both The Daily Mail and The Times claimed that Kahn was the prototype for Strangelove.
