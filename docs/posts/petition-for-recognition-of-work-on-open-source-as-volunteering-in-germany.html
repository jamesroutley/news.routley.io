    <h1>Petition for Recognition of Work on Open-Source as Volunteering in Germany</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div dir="ltr" lang="en">
			<p>
				<strong>Petition richtet sich an:</strong>
									German Bundestag, Petition Committee							</p>

			<!--marker--><p>Open-Source-Software builds the foundations of digital infrastructure in big parts - in administration, economy, science and daily life. Even the current <b>coalition agreement</b> of the <b>Federal Government</b> mentions Open-Source-Software as a fundamental building block for the achievement of <b>digital sovereignty</b>.</p><p>However, the work done by thousands of volunteers for this goal is <b>not recognised as volunteering</b>, neither fiscally nor in terms of funding. This imbalance between societal importance and legal status has to be corrected.</p><p>Therefore, as an active contributor to Open-Source-Projects, I call for work on Open-Source to be recognised as <b>volunteering for the common good</b> – of equal rank as volunteer work for associations, youth work or ambulance service.</p>		</div>

					<h4>Begründung</h4>

			<div dir="ltr" lang="en">
				<!--marker--><p><b>1. Open-Source contributes evidently to the common good</b></p><ul><li>It is creating <b>free, transparent and auditable software</b> that is available for everyone.</li><li>Critical systems like <b>internet protocols, security libraries, health IT, AI frameworks, energy management, education technologies </b>and<b> communication tools</b> are based significantly on volunteer contributions.</li><li>Without this work, Germany would be <b>digitally more dependent, less secure </b>and<b> less inventive.</b></li></ul></div>
