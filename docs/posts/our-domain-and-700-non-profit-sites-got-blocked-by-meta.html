                    <div><p>üì¢</p><p>Update: My message has been heard and our domain has been unblocked. Thank you everyone for sharing. I&#39;m so so happy right now üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è</p></div><p>In my spare time, I maintain an open-source SAAS tool for non-profits that allows you to build an online shop, sell tickets and register members online.</p><p>This week our domain got blocked by Meta/Facebook and I don&#39;t know why. In fact, it still is:</p><ul><li>You cannot post to Facebook/Instagram when you mention our domain.</li><li>All Facebook events from the non-profits that linked to our domain (for their ticket sales) were removed. They lost all their exposure, and probably will sell less tickets as a result.</li><li>Not a single of the 700 non-profits are now able to share their webshop on Facebook or Instagram. </li><li>All existing posts that mentioned our domain are removed from Facebook.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/2022/10/image-2-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1725" srcset="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/image-2-1.png 600w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/image-2-1.png 1000w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/image-2-1.png 1600w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/2022/10/image-2-1.png 2066w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Posting new content is not allowed. Even the photo doesn&#39;t load because it is blocked.</figcaption></figure><p>On Tuesday I started to receive the first emails from customers that complained that they couldn&#39;t share new posts anymore. All their existing posts were taken offline, ticket sales were halted because no one could find a link to their webshops.</p><p>At this point I just feel so powerless that I started to write this post. I&#39;m angry and sad at the same time. <strong>The reputation damage to our service will be enormous.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/2022/10/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/image.png 600w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/2022/10/image.png 680w"/></figure><p>I submitted the complaint form on Tuesday to get the block removed. I never got a response. <strong>In fact, the form even states that they won&#39;t be able to review reports. </strong>How are they going to unblock my site if they don&#39;t read my messages?</p><figure><img src="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/2022/10/image-5-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1403" srcset="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/image-5-1.png 600w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/image-5-1.png 1000w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/image-5-1.png 1600w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/2022/10/image-5-1.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>We had to submit this tiny form to request a removal.</figcaption></figure><p>Why are they blocking us? The content we host is completely harmless. No fake-news, crypto-currencies, violence, porn, or illegal activities, ... Just non profits selling stuff like tickets for an event, T-shirts, or food.</p><p>All the webshops are written in Dutch, because we currently only target non-profits in Belgium and the Netherlands. They look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/2022/10/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1295" srcset="https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/image-7.png 600w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/image-7.png 1000w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/image-7.png 1600w, https://www.simonbackx.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/10/image-7.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>A simple cover picture, a title, a description and the products they sell.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="this-is-already-the-second-time">This is already the second time</h2><p>Last year a local internet provider (Telenet, in Belgium) also blocked our previous domain. At that time we were still using <code>stamhoofd.shop</code> as our domain name for shops. A webshop could be hosted on for example <code>scouting-brussels.stamhoofd.shop</code>. We reached out to this internet provider, multiple times, but they simply didn&#39;t understand because support people were not trained that this was a thing (I don&#39;t blame them, I do blame the company).</p><p>Eventually we had to switch to our current domain name, <code>stamhoofd.be</code>. The one that is now blocked by Meta. Is this a repetitive pattern, the new normal?</p><hr/><blockquote>Why are they blocking us? The content we host is completely harmless.

It should cost them more than it costs them to hire people to review complaints. </p><h3 id="ive-reported-terrible-content-that-was-never-blocked">I&#39;ve reported terrible content that was never blocked.</h3><p>I&#39;ve reported pyramid schemes, fake news, racist messages, and other terrible content. Facebook never acted on any of my reports, even said it didn&#39;t violate their &#39;standards&#39;. But this week they did manage to block my legitimate domain. How is this possible?</p><h3 id="why-block-a-whole-domain">Why block a whole domain?</h3><p>A spammer can buy and switch to a new domain easily.

But it is only a matter of time before this happens again to us, or you.</p>
