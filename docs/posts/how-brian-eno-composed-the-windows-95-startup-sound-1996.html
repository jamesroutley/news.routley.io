    <h1>How Brian Eno composed the Windows 95 startup sound (1996)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=music%2Fpopquiz&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Brian+Eno%22">Brian Eno</a> belongs to rock&#39;s intelligentsia. His work has often been theoretical, yet his hand can be found in the most popular works of such best-selling collaborators as U2, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=music%2Fpopquiz&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22David+Bowie%22">David Bowie</a> and the <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=music%2Fpopquiz&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Talking+Heads%22">Talking Heads</a>.</p><p>On his last visit to San Francisco, in 1988, Eno erected a fascinating soundscape called &#34;Latest Flames&#34; in the bowels of the Palace of Fine Arts, where a series of tape recordings, starting at different times, intersected randomly to create accidental music. His latest project extends that groundbreaking work into a computer program available on Koan software, &#34;Generative Music.&#34;</p><div id="paywall">
            <p>He was commissioned by Microsoft to design the little arpeggio that sounds when Windows 95 is booted up, and he has also recently published his 1995 diary, &#34;A Year With Swollen Appendices.&#34; Eno will appear Saturday at the Imagination Conference (along with film director <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=music%2Fpopquiz&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Spike+Lee%22">Spike Lee</a>, performance artist <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=music%2Fpopquiz&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Laurie+Anderson%22">Laurie Anderson</a> and others) at San Francisco&#39;s Civic Auditorium.</p>

            <p>Q: The producers describe your appearance next weekend as multimedia, which is a great cliche. If you speak and hold up a picture, you&#39;re multimedia, aren&#39;t you?</p>
    
            <p>A: That&#39;s probably not far from what I&#39;ll be doing. I&#39;ll be doing a demonstration and I will also be showing some examples of things, so I guess it is multimedia. My part of it is going to be a speech with a rather dramatic demonstration, which I can&#39;t give details of because it must remain a surprise. But I&#39;m going to be talking about this idea of generative art.</p>

            <p>Q: Is your new computer program similar to your installation at the Palace of Fine Arts?</p>
    
    <!-- Missed: ad -->

            <p>A: It&#39;s very much in the same line of work as that, trying to think of ways of setting up systems that keep generating new music for you. It&#39;s new music in the sense that it isn&#39;t identical to anything in its history, but it does have an identity. It&#39;s new music in the sense that, if you&#39;re sitting by a river, it&#39;s always a new river that you&#39;re looking at.</p>
    
            
    
            <p>Q: How did you come to compose &#34;The Microsoft Sound&#34;?</p>
    
            <p>A: The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I&#39;d been working on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated someone coming along and saying, &#34;Here&#39;s a specific problem -- solve it.&#34;</p>
    
            <p>The thing from the agency said, &#34;We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal, blah- blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional,&#34; this whole list of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said &#34;and it must be 3 1/4 seconds long.&#34;</p>

            <p>I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little piece of music. It&#39;s like making a tiny little jewel.</p>
    
            <p>In fact, I made 84 pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work. Then when I&#39;d finished that and I went back to working with pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.</p>
    
            
    
            <p>Q: Are you working on the new U2 record?</p>
    
            <p>A: I decided not to work on this one. I needed a break from being in the studio and also a break from working with other people. I mean, there&#39;s no bad feeling or anything. They&#39;ve got quite competent people doing it, so I&#39;m sure they&#39;re going to be just fine.</p>
    
            
    
            <p>Q: So you are working on music of your own?</p>
    
            <p>A: Yes, but I&#39;m not getting very far. I suppose the thing I&#39;m working on is this strange kind of music that nobody seems to like very much. But I don&#39;t know whether it will come to anything or not. I&#39;ve got a feeling that music might not be the most interesting place to be in the world of things. And this is rather undermining my commitment to doing it.</p>
    
            <p>This self-generating music is so exciting to me. I think that&#39;s really something. I think talking is really something, thinking, having ideas and all that sort of thing. I&#39;m fascinated by all those things. Teaching, as well, I do a lot of. But adding to the obscene pile of CDs in the world doesn&#39;t thrill me that much at the moment.</p>
    
            
    
            <p>Q: When you invented ambient music did you envision the New Age onslaught that followed?</p>
    
            <p>A: In England and Europe, we have this huge music called ambient -- ambient techno, ambient house, ambient hip-hop, ambient this, ambient that. We&#39;ve done New Age here. That&#39;s finished.</p>
    
            <p>For eight years there&#39;s been a whole new movement which actually called itself ambient. And it&#39;s been a huge thing here. It doesn&#39;t sound much like what I was calling ambient music, but that&#39;s good, isn&#39;t it? Would we want our children to grow up like us? You want them to be different. You hope to God that they can be different.</p>
    
            
    
            <p>Q: How do you explain the proliferation of &#34;unplugged&#34; performances by rock stars lately?</p>
    
            <p>A: I think I can sympathize with what it is reacting against. Because a lot of music in the last 10 or 15 years has been made on computer-driven sequencers, it has a certain flavor to it. Sometimes that flavor&#39;s all right. But I&#39;ll tell you what the main effect of sequencers has been: Everybody thinks that when new technologies come along that they&#39;re transparent and you can just do your job well on it. But technologies always import a whole new set of values with them. And one of the values that sequencers imported was everything&#39;s got to be exactly right.</p>
    
            <p>It&#39;s so easy because a computer is basically a nerd-designed, screwdriver addict&#39;s machine. It&#39;s a machine that&#39;s perfect for making small adjustments and not very good for making bold strokes. I think people just got sick of sitting in studios for hours while some bloke in front of a screen kind of tightened everything up, so that every kick drum beat fell exactly on the one.</p>
    
            <p>If you&#39;ve been around that way of composing and you pick up an acoustic instrument and hit it, you think, &#34;Jesus, it&#39;s so full of life. There&#39;s so much going on in here.&#34; So I think people are really reacting to what has been rather an unimaginative use of computer technology so far. What I think is, of course, that there&#39;ll be a new generation of people who&#39;ll use computers with the same freedom that <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=music%2Fpopquiz&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Pete+Townshend%22">Pete Townshend</a> uses an acoustic guitar. But those people are just starting to emerge, I think. The computer brings out the worst in some people.</p>
