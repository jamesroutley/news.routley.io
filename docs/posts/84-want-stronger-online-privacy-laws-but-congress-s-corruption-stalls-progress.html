<h3>from the <i>this-is-why-we-can&#39;t-have-nice-things</i> dept</h3>

<p>Americans are, apparently, tired of having every last shred of personal data over-collected, hyper monetized, then improperly secured by a rotating crop of ethics-optional corporations and lazy executives.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/privacy/digital-privacy-concerns-habits-survey">new survey from U.S. News and World Report</a> took a look at prevailing U.S. consumer privacy beliefs, and found, among other things, that 84% of the public wants Congress to pass tougher privacy laws:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In our survey, 84% of respondents said the federal government should implement stricter data privacy laws, and just 16% said it should not. Congress has been deadlocked for years on this question, although a bipartisan effort appeared to be making some headway in 2024.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As is the norm for U.S. journalism, the outlet frames our failure to pass an internet privacy law over the last 30 years as something that <em>just kind of happened</em> without meaningful cause. The “question” of whether to have even baseline public privacy protections has been left unanswered due to some sort of <em>ambiguous externality</em>. Just blame that pesky, <em>ambiguous gridlock</em>. </p>
<p>In reality, Congress hasn’t passed a privacy law because it’s blisteringly, grotesquely corrupt. U.S. policymakers have decided, time and time and time again, that making gobs of money is more important than consumer welfare, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/">public safety</a>, market health, or even <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/11/once-more-with-feeling-banning-tiktok-doesnt-do-much-if-we-dont-regulate-data-brokers-and-pass-a-privacy-law/">national security</a> (see: our obsession with TikTok, while <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/11/once-more-with-feeling-banning-tiktok-doesnt-do-much-if-we-dont-regulate-data-brokers-and-pass-a-privacy-law/">ignoring the national security risks of unregulated data brokers</a>).</p>
<p>The federal government is also disincentivized from passing a nationwide privacy law for the internet era because they’ve found that buying consumer data from data brokers is a wonderful way to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/16/fbi-latest-to-admit-to-bypassing-warrant-requirements-by-purchasing-location-info-from-data-brokers/">avoid having to get a traditional warrant</a>. </p>
<p>You could, on any random day, pluck any of a million mainstream news reports on consumer privacy from the newswire and not find a single one willing to make either of these causes clear to readers. Yes, getting everybody aligned on quality privacy legislation is difficult, but it’s not <em>30 straight years of inaction</em> difficult. At some point, this reckless disregard for public welfare is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>All of that said, it’s evident that the public isn’t great when it comes to personal responsibility. Most of the users surveyed didn’t engage in basic protective measures like two-factor authentication or reliable, encrypted password managers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“42% use multi-factor authentication, seen by experts as a good way to protect online accounts, and just over half (53%) use security questions to verify their identity. Only one in six (17%) said they use a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/privacy/password-managers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">password manager</a> app or software that creates hard-to-break passwords, and 27% said they used biometric authentication such as facial recognition or fingerprint.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of federal and state protection from reckless data monetization, consumers have to have their own backs, and it’s clear we’re not particularly good at that, either. </p>
