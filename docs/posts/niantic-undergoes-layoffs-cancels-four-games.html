    <h1>Niantic undergoes layoffs, cancels four games</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h2>Can anything ever be as big as Pokémon Go&#39;s first summer?</h2></p></div><div><div><div><section><section><p>It appears that Niantic is materially reckoning with the fact that nothing will ever be quite as big Pokémon Go once was. Unfortunately, that means a number of canceled projects and, much worse, layoffs.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-29/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-cancels-four-projects-cuts-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Bloomberg report</a>, Niantic CEO John Hanke informed the company that 8% of the staff was being laid off — so around 85-90 people — as the company faces &#34;a time of economic turmoil&#34; during which it has been &#34;reducing costs in a variety of areas.&#34;</p><output></output><p>In addition, four projects have been canceled. One is the mobile AR partnership with Hasbro and TOMY it announced last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-partners-with-hasbro-transformers-ar-mobile-game">called Transformers: Heavy Metal</a>. Another was announced a year prior, as a collaboration between Niantic and the New York-based immersive theatre company behind promenade theatre production Sleep No More, Punchdrunk. Two additional projects canceled were reportedly codenamed Blue Sky and Snowball.</p><p>Niantic has existed since 2010, and was initially known for its location-based community game Ingress. But it gained fame when it took the same location-based mechanics it had developed for Ingress and partnered with The Pokémon Company for Pokémon Go, which has proven a consistent revenue driver for the company since its 2016 launch. At last estimate from mobile analytics group Sensor Tower, it has brought in $6 billion in lifetime revenue, averaging $1 billion in revenue per year and maintaining consistent popularity over that time.</p><p>But its other games haven&#39;t managed the same level of success. Despite <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/harry-potter-wizards-first-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a solid enough launch month with over $12 million in global player spending</a>, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite lagged far behind Pokémon Go&#39;s $300 million launch and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shuts-down-niantic">never came close to catching up, shutting down earlier this year</a>. Pikmin Bloom has done even worse, only reaching over $5 million in global revenue since its launch last year, though it remains live.</p><p>The lack of traction for either game might sound shocking given the IP involved and Pokémon Go&#39;s own success, but the truth is that no other location-based game has managed to capture the same level of attention, Niantic or no. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-earth-shuts-down-ar-mobile">Minecraft Earth, for instance, shut down last year</a> following struggles with maintaining a location-based game amid COVID-19. And Pokémon Go&#39;s closest recent competitors, Dragon Quest Walk and Jurassic World Alive, combined <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-6-billion-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couldn&#39;t even bring in half of what Pokemon Go did in the first quarter of this year</a>.</p><output><div><p>Peridot - Announcement Screenshots Gallery</p></div></output><p>With all these struggles, it&#39;s easy enough to see the trajectory of Niantic&#39;s significant scaling up following Pokémon Go&#39;s unexpected explosive success, and the subsequent decision to scale down when no other licensed game could touch that level of popularity. Unfortunately, it&#39;s a decision that impacted human beings.</p><p>&#34;We recently decided to stop production on some projects and reduce our workforce by about 8% to focus on our key priorities,&#34; said a Niantic spokesperson to Bloomberg. &#34;We are grateful for the contributions of those leaving Niantic and we are supporting them through this difficult transition.&#34;</p><p>With Pokémon Go remaining steady, it seems unlikely Niantic as a whole is in danger. And it still has multiple new projects in the works, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/niantic-announces-peridot-ios-android">Tamagotchi-like game Peridot announced in April</a> and NBA All-World, an NBA licensed game published by Niantic and developed by HypGames, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-niantic-announces-nba-all-world">announced yesterday</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a news reporter for IGN.
