<p><small><em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stockhausen_1994_WDR.jpg">Pho­to of Karl­heinz Stock­hausen by Kathin­ka Pasveer via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons</a></em></small></p>
<p>You may hear the phrase “elec­tron­ic music” and think of super­star dub­step DJs in fun­ny hel­mets at beach­side celebri­ty par­ties. Alter­na­tive­ly, you may think of the mer­cu­r­ial com­po­si­tions of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/may/07/contemporary-music-guide-karlheinz-stockhausen">Karl­heinz Stock­hausen</a>, the musique con­crete of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Henry">Pierre Hen­ry</a>, or the oth­er­world­ly exper­i­men­tal­ism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/François_Bayle">François Bayle</a>. If you’re in that lat­ter camp of music nerd, then this post may bring you very glad tid­ings indeed. Ubuweb—that stal­wart repos­i­to­ry of all things 20th-cen­tu­ry avant-garde—now hosts an <a href="https://ubu.com/sound/electronic.html">extra­or­di­nary com­pi­la­tion: the 476-song <em>His­to­ry of Electronic/Electroacoustic Music</em></a>, orig­i­nal­ly a 62 CD set. (Hear below Stockhausen’s “Kon­tact,” Henry’s “Astrolo­gie,” and Bayle’s spare “The­atre d’Ombres” fur­ther down.)</p>

<p>Span­ning the years 1937–2001, the col­lec­tion should espe­cial­ly appeal to those with an avant-garde or musi­co­log­i­cal bent. In fact, the orig­i­nal uploader of this archive of exper­i­men­tal sound, Caio Bar­ros, put these tracks online in 2009 while a stu­dent of com­po­si­tion at Brazil’s State Uni­ver­si­ty of São Paulo. Bar­ros’ “ini­tia­tive,” as he writes at Ubuweb, “became some sort of leg­end” among musi­cophiles in the know.</p>

<p>And yet, Ubuweb reposts this phe­nom­e­nal col­lec­tion with a dis­claimer: “It’s a clear­ly flawed selec­tion,” they write:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s few women and almost no one work­ing out­side of the West­ern tra­di­tion (where are the Japan­ese? Chi­nese? etc.). How­ev­er, as an effort, it’s admirable and con­tains a ton of great stuff.</p>
<p>Take it with a grain of salt, or per­haps use it as a provo­ca­tion to curate a more intel­li­gent, inclu­sive, and com­pre­hen­sive selec­tion</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a fair cri­tique, though Bar­ros points out that the exclu­sions most­ly have to do with “the way our soci­ety and the tra­di­tion this music rep­re­sent works” (sic). And yet, as dis­ci­pli­nary bound­aries expand all the time, and his­to­ries broad­en along with them, that descrip­tion no longer holds. It would be a fas­ci­nat­ing exer­cise, for exam­ple, to lis­ten to these tracks along­side the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2015/06/hear-seven-hours-of-women-making-electronic-music-1938-2014.html">his­to­ry of women in elec­tron­ic music, 1938–2014 </a>that we post­ed recent­ly.</p>

<p>Also, there’s clear­ly much more to elec­tron­ic music than either celebri­ty DJs or obscure avant-garde com­posers. Many hun­dreds of pop­u­lar elec­tron­ic com­posers and musicians—like <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2015/10/50-tracks-highlighting-brian-enos-career-as-a-musician-composer-producer.html">Bri­an Eno</a>, Kraftwerk, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Haack">Bruce Haack</a>, or <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2017/07/meet-clara-rockmore-the-pioneering-electronic-musician-who-first-rocked-the-theremin-in-the-early-1920s.html">Clara Rock­more</a>—fall some­where in-between the worlds of pop/dance/performance and seri­ous com­po­si­tion, and their con­tri­bu­tions deserve rep­re­sen­ta­tion along­side more exper­i­men­tal or clas­si­cal artists.</p>
<p>All that said, how­ev­er, there’s no rea­son you can’t curate your own playlist of the his­to­ry of elec­tron­ic music as you see it—drawing from the astound­ing wealth of music avail­able free at <em><a href="https://ubu.com/sound/electronic.html">The His­to­ry of Elec­troa­coustic Music</a></em>. Or con­sid­er this col­lec­tion a ful­ly immer­sive course in “tra­di­tion­al, west­ern avant-garde elec­tron­ic music” from “the area of Europe-Amer­i­ca,” as Bar­ros puts it. As that, it suc­ceeds admirably.</p>
