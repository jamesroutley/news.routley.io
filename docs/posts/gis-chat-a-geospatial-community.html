						<p>A geospatial chat in both senses: a platform <b>about</b> geospatial topics and a geospatial <b>platform</b> itself, referencing the location of our communities.
						Communicate your next meetups or simply get to know the spatial folks in your area! You can also use gis.chat as a normal forum about interesting topics, events or Q&amp;A tool.</p>
						<a href="https://zulip.gis.chat"><img src="https://gis.chat/images/gischatoverview.png" alt="GIS Chat Overview"/></a>
						<p>It&#39;s free, open source and you can even peak at some channels without account!</p>

						<blockquote>The geospatial community is missing the <b>geospatial</b>!</blockquote>
						
						The platforms we use, may it be Messengers like WhatsApp/Signal/Telegram, social media networks like Twitter / Mastodon / Instagram / TikTok / LinkedIn etc. are great for building online communities, but they simply neglect our spatial nature.

						Sometimes it&#39;s nice to have someone <b>physically</b> around to show something locally, to ask for guidance or just have a coffee with.</section>

					<section id="four">
						<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>
						
						This platform is still under development and sees itself as a community-driven effort. Some things are still to discuss, e.g. which streams should be publicly visible and which ones only accessible with an account.
