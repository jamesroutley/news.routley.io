            <span>Abstract:</span>In this paper, I present ZjsComponent, a lightweight and framework-agnostic web component designed for creating modular, reusable UI elements with minimal developer overhead. ZjsComponent is an example implementation of an approach to creating components and object instances that can be used purely from HTML. Unlike traditional approaches to components, the approach implemented by ZjsComponent does not require build-steps, transpiling, pre-compilation, any specific ecosystem or any other dependency. All that is required is that the browser can load and execute Javascript as needed by Web Components. ZjsComponent allows dynamic loading and isolation of HTML+JS fragments, offering developers a simple way to build reusable interfaces with ease. This approach is dependency-free, provides significant DOM and code isolation, and supports simple lifecycle hooks as well as traditional methods expected of an instance of a class.
