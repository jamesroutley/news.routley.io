<p>More ranting and frothing at the mouth from me, I’m afraid.</p>



<p>Well, maybe a bit more positive this time.</p>



<p>As you may have noticed, I’m one of a small, but growing, crowd who believe that People Who Make Software Happen (you may know them as “programmers”) should have the option to progress their careers without leaving the code face.</p>



<p>There are a couple of very good reasons for this:</p>



<ol>
<li>If they love to do it (and that’s usually what distinguishes the average from the best programmers), then wrenching them away from doing what they love can take a huge toll on their motivation and morale. I’m, sure we’ve all worked with <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/test-code-is-production-code-and-test-coders-are-developers/">development managers who just can’t help sticking their noses into the code</a>. It’s not because they’re interfering <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/productive-teams-are-business-assets/">busy</a> bodies (well, not usually).</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s because, really, deep down, they’d like to be writing the <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/code-aging-the-grand-canyon-effect/">code</a> themselves. They’re probably writing it in their heads as we discuss it – like a retired chess champion shouting at the TV because they would have played a different move. It’s actually a bit cruel to take that away from them. Admiral Kirk needs his starship.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>If they’re good at it, then surely better to let them continue? Especially if less experienced programmers would benefit from their considerable experience. The lack of older faces on <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/agile-software-process-improvement-part-1/">software</a> teams is a problem, in my experience. We may be up on all the latest buzzwords like “test-driven behavior” and “domain-oriented backlogs”, but these old hands can still teach us a thing or two about delivering working <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/are-you-agile-wheres-your-customer-then/">software</a>. Indeed, they did.</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s worth remembering in this shiny nuclear-powered Agile era that Tom Gilb wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Software-Engineering-Management-Gilb/dp/0201192462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Principles of Software Engineering Management</a> over 900 years ago. Or thereabouts. What’s new is us young upstarts hearing about it for the first time and thinking we’ve discovered something new. And I can’t help feeling that’s partly because we’re not exposed to folk who’ve been around long enough to remember. Teams burn a lot of time relearning the same lessons people were learning decades ago.</p>



<p>I also feel that, even though they may still be at the <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/detecting-code-smells/">code</a> face, it’s purely prejudice that suggests that they therefore can’t be involved in strategic or executive decision-making. It’s perfectly possible for someone who still performs surgery to play a decisive role in how a hospital is run. Or for someone who still represents clients in court to be a big cheese in a law practice.</p>



<p>So why couldn’t a Person Who Still Makes <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/software-development-the-economy/">Software</a> Happen sit on the board of a company and have an equal say in how it’s run? Because they’re not qualified? Is the Director of HR better qualified? Or the VP of Marketing?</p>



<p>Other, more mature professions have demonstrated that it’s quite possible – even desirable – to encourage the best do-ers to carry on doing and reward them for getting better at doing it. They encourage the best do-ers to help less experienced do-ers do it better, too. And they understand that doing is the best qualification for making decisions about how it should be done.</p>



<p>Some enlightened companies have this. They offer unfettered career progression in the technical disciplines and highly value the knowledge, creativity and decision-making ability of their most experienced and capable do-ers.</p>



<p>If attitudes can change, and the prejudice that if someone wants to carry on writing <a href="https://levelup-edu.com/software-development-meta-model/">software</a> then they are not strategic thinkers and not capable of making rational business decisions can be debunked, then maybe we can look forward to a time when people who love to make</p>



<p><a href="https://levelup-edu.com/i-care-about-software/">Software</a> Happen have sufficient control over how they get to Make Software Happen, and then, I suspect, better software will happen.</p>
