<p>Some film­mak­ers start in com­mer­cials, hon­ing their chops in antic­i­pa­tion of mak­ing per­son­al projects lat­er. A select few go in the oth­er direc­tion, real­iz­ing their dis­tinc­tive vision before field­ing offers from com­pa­nies who want a piece of that vision’s cul­tur­al cur­ren­cy. Any­one who’s seen David Lynch’s most acclaimed work will sus­pect, cor­rect­ly, that Lynch belongs in the lat­ter group. With 1977’s cult hit <em>Eraser­head</em>, he showed cin­e­ma what it means to be <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/11/what-makes-a-david-lynch-film-lynchian-a-video-essay.html">Lynchi­an</a>. This brought him the atten­tion of Hol­ly­wood, lead­ing to the respectable suc­cess of <em>The Ele­phant Man </em>and the dis­as­ter that was <em>Dune</em>. Only in 1986, with <em>Blue Vel­vet</em>, could Lynch make a tru­ly, even trou­bling­ly per­son­al film that hit the zeit­geist at just the right moment.</p>
<p>Nat­u­ral­ly, Madi­son Avenue came call­ing soon there­after. “With the smash <em>Blue Vel­vet</em>, a Palme d’or at Cannes for <em>Wild at Heart</em>, and then the nation­al phe­nom­e­non of <em>Twin Peaks</em>’ first sea­son, David Lynch clear­ly estab­lished him­self as the U.S.A.‘s fore­most com­mer­cial­ly viable avant-garde-‘offbeat’ direc­tor,” wrote David Fos­ter Wal­lace in <a href="http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html">a 1997 piece on the film­mak­er</a>.</p>

<p>“For a while there it looked like he might be able to sin­gle-hand­ed­ly bro­ker a new mar­riage between art and com­merce in U.S. movies, open­ing for­mu­la-frozen Hol­ly­wood to some of the eccen­tric­i­ty and vig­or of art film.” <span>Lynch’s fans in tele­vi­sion adver­tis­ing must have imag­ined that he could do the same for their indus­try, and you can watch the fruits of that hunch in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoCYbQBTmlY">half-hour com­pi­la­tion of Lynch-direct­ed com­mer­cials</a><span> above.</span></p>
<p>Lynch has worked for some star­tling­ly big brands, begin­ning with Calvin Klein: his <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/01/david-lynchs-literary-perfume-ads.html">trio of spots for the fra­grance Obses­sion</a> take as their basis the writ­ing of F. Scott Fitzger­ald, Ernest Hem­ing­way, and D.H. Lawrence. A few years lat­er he direct­ed a humor­ous <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2015/11/david-lynch-directs-a-mini-season-of-twin-peaks-in-the-form-of-japanese-coffee-commercials.html">mini-sea­son of <em>Twin Peaks</em> to pro­mote Geor­gia Cof­fee</a>, one of the top brands of canned cof­fee in the Lynch-lov­ing coun­try of Japan. The New York Depart­ment of San­i­ta­tion engaged Lynch’s ser­vices to imbue their anti-lit­ter­ing cam­paign with his sig­na­ture high-con­trast omi­nous­ness, a mood also sought by fash­ion-indus­try titans like Armani, Yves Saint Lau­rent, Guc­ci, and Dior. The mar­keters of hum­bler goods like Alka-Seltzer, Bar­il­la Pas­ta (a seem­ing­ly auteur-aware brand that <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/07/wim_wenders_sells_beer_stella_artois_pasta_barilla_and_more_beer_carling.html">has also hired Wim Wen­ders</a> and <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/01/fellinis_fantastic_tv_commercials.html">Felli­ni</a>), and Clear Blue Easy home preg­nan­cy tests have also gone in for a touch of the Lynchi­an.</p>
<p>Quite a few of these com­mer­cials orig­i­nal­ly aired only out­side Amer­i­ca, which may reflect the sup­pos­ed­ly more endur­ing appre­ci­a­tion of Lynch’s work that exists in Europe and Asia. But for all Lynch’s artis­tic dar­ing, the man him­self has always come off as an enthu­si­ast of unre­con­struct­ed Amer­i­can plea­sures. To this day he remains a stead­fast smok­er, and in 1998 brought that per­son­al cred­i­bil­i­ty to the Swiss cig­a­rette brand Parisi­enne. The result­ing spot fea­tures men in ties, show­ers of sparks, dead fish, back­wards talk­ing, a for­bid­ding­ly illu­mi­nat­ed shack, and apoc­a­lyp­tic flames: Parisi­enne, in oth­er words, must have got exact­ly what they paid for.</p>
