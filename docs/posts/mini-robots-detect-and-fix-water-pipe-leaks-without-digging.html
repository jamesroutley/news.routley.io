  </p></div><p>Fixing underground water pipes usually means digging up roads and sidewalks — a process that&#39;s disruptive and expensive. However, researchers at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. are working on a different approach. They&#39;ve developed small robots called &#34;Pipebots&#34; that can travel inside water pipes to find and potentially repair leaks, all without any excavation.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong></p><div><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/343/192/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/686/384/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" height="192" width="343"/><source media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/672/378/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1344/756/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" height="378" width="672"/><source media="(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1279px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/931/523/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1862/1046/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" height="523" width="931"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/720/405/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1440/810/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x" height="405" width="720"/> <img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/1200/675/1-mini-robots-detect-and-fix-water-pipe-leaks-without-digging.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="Pipebot in various environments." width="1200" height="675"/></picture></div> <div><p><span>Pipebot in various environments.</span> <span>(University of Sheffield)</span></p></div></div><h2><strong>Old leaky underground pipes are causing a crisis</strong></h2><p>The U.K. has some of the oldest water systems in the world, with parts of the network still dating back to the Victorian era.

They have the potential to make maintenance cleaner, more affordable, and way more efficient. That&#39;s especially important for developing countries where budgets are tight and infrastructure is aging or incomplete. As the pressure to conserve water grows, tools like Pipebots could make a real difference in helping us manage this vital resource more wisely.</p><p>What water infrastructure challenges exist in your area, and do you think robots like these could help?
