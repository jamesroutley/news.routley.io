      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When I read Richard Hanania‚Äôs <a href="https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/reflections-on-2022">Reflections on 2022</a> in which he listed a bunch of major topics he changed his mind about, I realized that I really admired him for doing this. Then, immediately afterwards, I thought ‚ÄúWait, am I worse than <em>Hanania</em>? The person who made the entire twitter angry at him more times than everyone else dead &amp; alive combined? If he can call himself out on his bullshit, so can I.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus, this post. Briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Meditation is terrible -&gt; meditation is amazing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sleep minimum sustainable amount -&gt; sleep enough to have maximum energy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The more the bigger monitors the better -&gt; one 16&#34; monitor is perfect.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that a lot of what I previously believed is stupid, wrong or just doesn‚Äôt make sense. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm proud of any of that stuff, but, also, what else did you expect from a person whose claim to fame is being prolific in hot takes on twitter?</p>
<h2 id="meditation-is-terrible---meditation-is-amazing">Meditation is terrible -&gt; meditation is amazing</h2>
<p>I was <em>very</em> vocal about this. <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1504477406710620160">March 2022</a>: ‚Äúin 2050 it will be an accepted fact that focus on psychological health (including meditation) was one of the biggest biggest disasters for the advancement of humanity ever‚Äù. <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1372970197984948224">March 2021</a>: ‚ÄúWhat should one do to get the effect on one‚Äôs mind the opposite of that one would get pursuing meditation?‚Äù. <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1451960464653553664">Three</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1497298774460411904">more</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/1227334240095760384">tweets</a>. Even in October 2022, I spent hours arguing with Evan Conrad telling him that meditation is <em>obviously</em> bad.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-changed-my-mind-about">What I changed my mind about</h3>
<p><strong>1. Meditation was invented to make people get rid of all desires and self-mummify.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I have no clue why meditation was invented. I think I just saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokushinbutsu">a picture</a> of a monk who meditated himself into a mummy once and the image got stuck in my head.</p>
<p><strong>2. Successful people only talk about how good meditation, balance, sleep, etc. are <em>after</em> they become successful.</strong></p>
<p>What about Evan Conrad &amp; Sam Altman?</p>
<p>Evan used to have regular panic attacks and be a big ‚Äúmental health‚Äù person. Today, <a href="https://evanjconrad.com/posts/how-to-feel-good">after meditating a lot</a>, he is extremely intentional, um, bubbly, and frighteningly benevolent.</p>
<p>Sam <a href="https://artofaccomplishment.com/podcast/episode-39-sam-altman-leading-with-crippling-anxiety-discovering-meditation-and-building-intelligence-with-self-awareness/">used</a> to be ‚Äúa very anxious, high-strung person ‚Ä¶ just generally unhappy and somewhat miserable and also just work-wise, tremendously less effective and a much worse leader‚Äù. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had been negotiating this deal. It was not going that well. It was pretty important, and it was under extreme time pressure and down to the wire. I remember at one point just like feeling like I was going to explode from the stress about it. ‚Ä¶ I was so stressed I was laying on the ground with my arms out to the side and trying to breathe and feeling like I was just like going to explode. ‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He used to share my view on meditation (‚ÄúIf someone was like you just need to go meditate more, I would basically be like fuck you, I‚Äôm really busy. That‚Äôs a dumb thing. You don‚Äôt get it.&#34;) but eventually decided to try it hoping it would make him more productive. It did. And it also turned him from a very anxious, high-strung, and unhappy person into an extremely calm and joyous person.</p>
<p>So, meditation helped Evan and Sam to become vastly more functional while keeping all the things they liked about themselves, rather than turning them into pot-smoking hippies.</p>
<p><strong>3. I‚Äôm very happy with how my mind works. I don‚Äôt want to mess with it and risk losing my edge.</strong></p>
<p>2022 was my first real year of running a company. I spent a ton of time being extremely stressed (very fun) and anxious/worried/scared (not fun at all). Sometimes I would see a difficult email and spend days being anxious about it. Or I would be scared to take the responsibility for a decision I had to make and would have someone else make it. Or I would be scared of having a difficult conversation and just keep delaying it for weeks and months.</p>
<p>I gradually realized that whatever edge I might have, I don‚Äôt want to get stuck here.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-do-now">What I do now</h3>
<p>As of writing this, I‚Äôve been meditating &gt;=1h/day for 48 days in a row. On my very first day, I felt like I haven‚Äôt <em>really</em> thought in like 5 years.</p>
<p>By ‚Äúmeditating‚Äù I mostly mean sitting around with my eyes closed. I haven‚Äôt done any research at all on what meditation is supposed to be. Apparently there‚Äôs a million different styles of it, so I‚Äôm just going to go ahead and call what I do meditation too, fight me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have specific prompts to think about (from me/from my friends/from LLMs) that I try to keep my focus on. Usually these prompts are about my feelings or problems or questions I‚Äôm facing. Sometimes I let things bubble up and my mind wander from one thing to another.</p>
<p>Sometimes I focus on my breath and just let the thoughts pass through me. Sometimes I lie on the floor and try to feel what‚Äôs happening in my body (it turns out it has a lot of feelings too‚Ä¶). This seems very difficult to do properly without having a fully private space where you can lie on a floor talking to yourself and making weird sounds for hours without any disturbances.</p>
<p>Sometimes I sit at my computer and write thoughts down as I meditate. Sometimes I write them down afterwards. Sometimes I take a big piece of paper and draw diagrams of what I think or feel and ask myself ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù endlessly.</p>
<p>Some of the things that have improved so far (some by a lot, some marginally):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attention &amp; meta-attention:</strong> I realized that I can consciously direct my attention. Therefore, I can <em>decide</em> e.g.:
<ol>
<li>To remember the current page number in the book, map directions, wifi passwords, etc.</li>
<li>To notice how I feel and what I want to do with the feeling, instead of executing a cached for it routine.</li>
<li>Whether to fall into an obsession when tempted.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Mental health:</strong> I processed a lot of my feelings, beliefs, and frames, many of which I‚Äôve been repressing or unconsciously living under for years (fuck you, Dostroyevsky, in particular). I now feel a lot less social anxiety, shame, and fear. A lot of what Sasha Chapin <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love">describes</a> as ‚Äúdeep okayness‚Äù resonates.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> I worry about and delay tasks/emails/messages a lot less. I take more ownership for what I do. Sometimes I spend an hour sitting around with my eyes closed and make a decision that would‚Äôve otherwise taken days and a big google doc to make.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the changes feel transformative, they aren‚Äôt stable. In another post, Sasha Chapin <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/one-year-of-okayness">noted</a> how difficult life situations force the old stuff to come back &amp; how thinking that you‚Äôre ‚Äúdone‚Äù means you don‚Äôt notice this happening and get fucked. There‚Äôs always something to improve and life is always trying to fuck you up.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a bit worried about potentially losing my capacity for being obsessed with things and for losing my full range of feelings that I <em>do</em> want to feel but this hasn‚Äôt happened just yet ü•≤.</p>
<p>I think meditation has been very good for me and that it would be very good for a lot of other people too.</p>
<h2 id="get-minimum-possible-sustainable-amount-of-sleep---get-enough-sleep-to-have-maximum-energy-during-the-day">Get minimum possible sustainable amount of sleep -&gt; get enough sleep to have maximum energy during the day</h2>
<p>Sleep makes me angry. I mean, why on Earth do I have to spend hours every day lying around unconscious?????????</p>
<p>In 2019, trying to learn about the science behind sleep I read <em>Why We Sleep</em> and got so angry at it for being essentially pseudoscience that I <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">spent &gt;100 hours debunking it</a>. In 2020, I slept 4 h/day for 2 weeks and shown that this didn‚Äôt make me dumber (not recommended, it was terrible). In 2022, I published <em>Theses on Sleep</em>, with points like ‚ÄúExperiencing sleepiness is normal and does not necessarily imply that you are undersleeping. Never being sleepy means you are probably sleeping too much.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="what-i-changed-my-mind-about-1">What I changed my mind about</h3>
<p><strong>1. There‚Äôs no good medical reason to sleep more than the minimum you can sustain.</strong></p>
<p>Not this one! Fight me.</p>
<p><strong>2. I can sleep 4h/day, so 6h/day must be easy.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that sleeping 6h/day is hard‚Ä¶ I have to track sleep &amp; adjust for every party I go to, deadline, travel; worry about sleepiness during boring meetings/tasks; etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. It‚Äôs fine to sometimes be sleepy.</strong></p>
<p>I tried Adderall and it made me more <em>awake</em> than ever before. I noticed that this made me want to do stuff more, pay more attention, be more intentional, think quicker, have more ideas, and remember more. Conversely, I started to notice that being sleepy has the exact opposite effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, I realized that it‚Äôs very important to be as awake as possible and that my model of sleepiness where you can be ‚Äúawake‚Äù, ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù and ‚Äúasleep‚Äù is dumb.</p>
<p><strong>4. I don‚Äôt have another 10h/week to spend being dead.</strong></p>
<p>Come on 2022 Alexey, you definitely lose &gt;10h/week to just random bullshit. Ahem, CS:GO.</p>
<p><strong>5. Many impressive people sleep 5-6h (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/elon-musk-ceo-of-tesla-spacex-on-getting-six-hours-of-sleep.html">Elon</a>, Napoleon, Thatcher), so I can too.</strong></p>
<p>Sure. And many others (Bezos, Zuck, Isaak Freeman) sleep 7-8h.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-do-now-1">What I do now</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>I default to sleeping 2300-0600.</strong> I do my best to always wake up at the same time because I wake up 10-15m before the alarm if I do this for several days in a row.</li>
<li><strong>I don‚Äôt worry about sleeping 3-4h occasionally.</strong> I‚Äôm actually writing this at 4am after &lt;3 hours of sleep. But I avoid doing this often because it messes up my schedule.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-more-the-bigger-monitors-the-better---a-single-16-laptop-monitor-is-perfect">The more the bigger monitors the better -&gt; a single 16‚Äù laptop monitor is perfect.</h2>
<p><img width="400px" src="https://guzey.com/files/2022-lessons/4-monitors.jpg"/></p>
<p>I was so proud of my old 4-monitor setup (49&#34; + 34&#34; + 24&#34; + 16&#34;) that I recorded an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDzb20mBL5Y">entire fucking YouTube video</a> about it and I spent many years telling <em>everyone</em> to get huge monitors &amp; low-key concluded that they were maybe just not very bright if they disagreed. ü•≤</p>
<h3 id="what-i-changed-my-mind-about-2">What I changed my mind about</h3>
<p><strong>1. More &amp; bigger monitors make me more productive.</strong></p>
<p>One 16&#34; monitor is perfect for reading and writing. Coding is the only task that really benefits from having more monitors and I barely code.</p>
<p><strong>2. There‚Äôs no cost to more &amp; bigger monitors.</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôm actually distracted by my task list, calendar, notes, etc. always visible. Also, I get attached to all of my neat context windows, become worried about working from a laptop, and end up <a href="https://guzey.com/productivity/#every-productivity-system-stops-working-eventually-and-theres-nothing-you-can-do-about-it">not moving around enough</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-do-now-2">What I do now</h3>
<ol>
<li>I work on my 16&#34; MacBook and do one thing at a time.</li>
<li>My task list is in Asana, two clicks away.</li>
<li>I reorient every hour checking that I‚Äôm following Asana &amp; know what the next step is (often it‚Äôs ‚Äú3m reorient‚Äù).
<ol>
<li>‚Äú3m‚Äù refers to me setting a 3 minute timer with the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smart-countdown-timer/id1410709951?mt=12">Smarter Countdown Timer</a> which I always have opened on top of everything.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xBNn93YTmsc">‚ÄúNothing ever goes according to plan‚Äù</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>My phone is in ‚ÄúDo not disturb‚Äù mode and I check messages on schedule ever 3 hours.</li>
<li>If I want to check messages off-schedule, I can do it after a 3m timer.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> shows when the next meeting is.</li>
<li>I move around if I lose my ‚Äúdefault productive‚Äù mood where I work.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="synthesis-attention-is-really-important">Synthesis: attention is <em>really</em> important</h2>
<p>I first drafted this post 6 weeks ago. Since then, I‚Äôve become even more bullish on the takes discussed here. I can‚Äôt promise I won‚Äôt do yet another 180 by the end of 2023 though.</p>
<p>Yes, it would be a bit embarrassing, but‚Ä¶ writing this post kinda sucked. I had to think super hard, then spend days writing everything up, then endure all my friends telling me ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been telling you this for years you dumbass‚Äù‚Ä¶ If next year I could just ask an intern to add ‚Äúnot‚Äù in front of every sentence, that‚Äôd be fucking awesome. I bet that post would get more views as well.</p>
<p>I dunk on EAs a lot, so, in case they win the struggle for power when the singularity hits &amp; in hopes of indulgence from the eternal Dyson sphere-powered torture for me and my loved ones, here are my <del>credences for holding these beliefs in 2023</del> numbers with ‚Äú%‚Äù I pulled out of my ass:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>80-90%</strong> Meditation is amazing.</li>
<li><strong>76%</strong> Sleep enough to have maximum energy.</li>
<li><strong>69.14159365359%</strong> One 16&#34; laptop monitor is perfect.</li>
<li><del><strong>50/50</strong> The simulation doesn‚Äôt get shut down in 2023.</del></li>
</ol>
<p>What‚Äôs a more general lesson here? I feel like I‚Äôm writing a 2015 New Yorker thoughtpiece now, but‚Ä¶ attention is <em>really</em> important &amp; we only have so much of it.</p>
<ol>
<li>What does meditation do? It teaches to maintain attention on one thing &amp; to redirect it upon slipping.</li>
<li>What does being more awake do? It makes maintaining attention easier.</li>
<li>What does a single 16&#34; monitor do? It prevents attention from being split.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, a bit of advice for myself: be <em>just</em> a bit less confident in your beliefs &amp; remember Joel Becker‚Äôs minute-long ‚Äúhmmmmmmmmmmmm‚Äù whenever he hears you be 100% confident and <em>just maybe</em> stop at 95%.</p>

<ol>
<li>Asana
<ol>
<li>I have Asana open in Firefox, which I don‚Äôt use for anything else. ‚Äúctrl 1 command 1‚Äù always shows me my task list for today.</li>
<li>‚Äúctrl 1‚Äù opens Firefox via a Raycast shortcut.</li>
<li>‚Äúctrl 2‚Äù opens Asana Mac app which I use to move around Asana without messing up my firefox tabs.</li>
<li>‚Äúshift ctrl +‚Äù opens Asana‚Äôs quick add window. I have 1m to add a task/thought if I‚Äôm doing something else.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Fuck Covid. I couldn‚Äôt go to the office for months in 2020 &amp; comletely forgot that always staying at once place kills me.</li>
<li>Why are my tasks not very stimulating? Take writing this post as an example: no hard external deadlines, face-to-face competition, intense visual stimulus or risk.</li>
<li>More re: previous beliefs about meditation.
<ol>
<li>I tried meditating a few years back and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey/status/741529859818725380">learned</a> to direct my attention to my breath for 5-10 minutes. It was easy and boring and I didn‚Äôt notice any positive lasting changes.</li>
<li>Meditation <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremierykner/status/1201384139548696578?s=61&amp;t=ulKYfyWeyYQ-E0OBPHEX8w">comes</a> from Asia, where the culture is that of escape from the world versus the Western culture of embracing the world head on.
<ol>
<li>e.g. China &amp; Japan literally tried to close themselves completely to external world, no Asian countries really went to explore the world the way Europe did.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>More re: sleepiness</li>
<li>I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall">learned</a> that Adderall is used for ADHD and one other condition: <em>narcolepsy</em>. This further implies the connection between attention/executive control and sleepiness. Like, does having ADHD basically mean that parts of the brain are shut off and the reason Adderall helps is because it turns the brain on just like it does for narcoleptics?
<ol>
<li>Similarly, maybe the reason we don‚Äôt remember waking up in the middle of the night or turning off alarms is because the brain is mostly asleep &amp; therefore memory formation is shut down? This implies further connection between memory and wakefulness.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Current hot take: best time to go to bed is being 5/10 awake rather than 1-2/10 awake. This ensures completion of the evening routine (planning in the evening is just better) &amp; proper planning of waking up vs unconsciously falling into bed right after doing something or finishing the last 1-2 hours of the day being kinda sleepy and not wanting to do anything.</li>
