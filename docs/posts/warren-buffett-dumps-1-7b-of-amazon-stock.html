    <h1>Warren Buffett dumps $1.7B of Amazon stock</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://finbold.com/guide/who-is-warren-buffett/">Warren Buffett’s</a> Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/berkshire-hathaway-inc-stockbrk-a/">BRK.A</a>, <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/berkshire-hathaway-class-b-brk-b/">BRK.B</a>) submitted its latest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000119312526054580/0001193125-26-054580-index.html">13-F filing</a> on February 17, 2026, revealing some interesting <a href="https://finbold.com/warren-buffett-just-updated-his-stock-portfolio-3/">changes in the portfolio</a>. </p>



<p>The most newsworthy one was undoubtedly the staggering 77% reduction in the <a href="https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-amazon-stock/">Amazon</a> (NASDAQ: <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/amazon-amzn/">AMZN</a>) stake, as the company has sold 7.7 million shares in the e-commerce leader, reportedly valued at nearly $1.7 billion.</p>



<p>Berkshire first entered Amazon in 2019, and after seven years, the paradigm appears to be shifting again, with ‘The Oracle of Omaha’ apparently returning to long-favored sectors, such as media.</p>



<p>Notably, the filing revealed the former Berkshire CEO had opened a new position in the New York Times (NYSE: <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/nyt-new-york-times/">NYT</a>) with a purchase of 5 million shares, estimated at about $352 million. The purchase sent the publisher’s shares up around 10% as investors reacted to Buffett’s disclosure.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-is-warren-buffett-dumping-amazon">Why is Warren Buffett dumping Amazon?</h2>



<p>While the Amazon trimming was the most eye-catching, it was not an isolated case. For instance, the now Chairman of Berkshire reduced his Apple (NASDAQ: <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/apple-aapl/">AAPL</a>) holdings to a 1.5% position, which further underscores the retreat from large technology names.</p>








<p>As mentioned, the shift suggests a return to classic Buffett investments, that is, businesses built to withstand economic turbulence. This is suggested by the fact that Berkshire expanded its stake in <a href="https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-chubb-stock/">Chubb</a> (NYSE: <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/chubb-stock-cb/">CB</a>), a steady insurance company, and <a href="https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-chevron-stock/">Chevron</a> (NYSE: <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/chevron-stock-cvx/">CVX</a>), which suggests confidence in energy solutions.</p>



<p>Similarly, Berkshire has agreed to acquire the petrochemical business of Occidental Petroleum Corp. for $9.7 billion and built a $5.6 billion position in <a href="https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-google-stock/">Google</a> (NASDAQ: <a href="https://finbold.com/stock/alphabet-inc-class-c-capital-stock-goog/">GOOGL</a>). Accordingly, it can be argued that the conglomerate is simply adjusting its strategy as it attempts to dig in ahead of a <a href="https://finbold.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-the-us-dollar-is-about-to-die/">potential economic downturn</a>.</p>
