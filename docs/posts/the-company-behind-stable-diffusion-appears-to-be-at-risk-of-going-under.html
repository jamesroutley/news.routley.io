    <h1>The company behind Stable Diffusion appears to be at risk of going under</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The company is burning through cash at an alarming rate.</h2><h2>Burning Cash</h2><p>Stability AI, a startup that&#39;s made a huge name for itself by helping develop the incredibly popular open-source image generator called <a href="https://futurism.com/tags/stable-diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a>, is in serious trouble, <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/07/2023/stability-ai-is-on-shaky-ground-as-it-burns-through-cash"><em>Semafor</em> reports</a>, burning through cash at an alarming rate without a clear path to profitability.</p><p>The company is now looking to hire new executives who will help sales and generate some much-needed revenue.</p><p>Given the sheer amount of competition the company is facing, Stability AI&#39;s woes are a worrying sign that clear winners in the AI race are already emerging.</p><h2>Unstable Diffusion</h2><p>Stability AI raised $100 million last year and has already spent a significant portion of those funds, according to the report. That means the startup&#39;s upcoming fundraising round, which would balloon the company&#39;s valuation to a lofty $4 billion, is on shaky grounds, with investors having second thoughts.</p><p>Sources familiar with the matter told <em>Semafor</em> that CEO Emad Mostaque&#39;s leadership style has been unpredictable, swinging from micromanaging to letting researchers do what they want without oversight.</p><p>But there are deeper, structural issues the company is also grappling with. Stability AI wasn&#39;t actually the sole inventor of Stable Diffusion, which was originally created by an international team of researchers from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich, Germany, and New York-based company RunwayML.</p><p>Mostaque swooped in to help turn the AI model into an open-source image generator. The CEO even bet his own personal wealth to guarantee the company was able to pay for Amazon web hosting, according to <em>Semafor</em>&#39;s sources.</p><h2>Stiff Competition</h2><p>Then there&#39;s the fact that Stability AI is facing a <em>lot</em> of competition, with rival <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/midjourney-excommunicates-freeloaders-after-pope-images">Midjourney</a> making major headwinds in becoming the de-facto image generator on the internet, even beating out <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-sell-images-dall-e">OpenAI&#39;s DALL-E</a> in terms of numbers, the report notes.</p><p>Whether Stability AI will be able to turn things around and raise enough funds to keep things going remains to be seen. The company still doesn&#39;t have an AI model that it&#39;s created by itself from the ground up, something that will likely make staying competitive in a rapidly changing landscape even more difficult.</p><p><strong>More on Stable Diffusion:</strong> <em><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/horrific-ai-generated-video-shows-will-smith-eating-spaghetti">Horrific AI-Generated Video Shows Will Smith Eating Spaghetti</a></em></p></div></div>
