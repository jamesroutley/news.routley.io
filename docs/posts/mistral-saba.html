    <h1>Mistral Saba</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Making AI ubiquitous requires addressing every culture and language. As AI proliferates globally, many of our customers worldwide have expressed a strong desire for models that are not just fluent but native to regional parlance. While larger, general-purpose models are often proficient in several languages, they lack linguistic nuances, cultural background, and in-depth regional knowledge required to serve use cases with strong regional context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In such scenarios, custom-trained models tailored to regional languages can grasp the unique intricacies and insights for delivering precision and authenticity. To that end, we are proud to introduce <strong>Mistral Saba</strong>, the first of our specialized regional language models. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Mistral Saba is a 24B parameter model trained on meticulously curated datasets from across the Middle East and South Asia. The model provides more accurate and relevant responses than models that are over 5 times its size, while being significantly faster and lower cost. The model can also serve as a strong base to train highly specific regional adaptations. Mistral Saba is available as an <a href="http://console.mistral.ai">API</a>, but importantly, it is also available to deploy locally within the security premises of customers. Like the recently released <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3">Mistral Small 3,</a> the model is lightweight and can be deployed on single-GPU systems, responding at speeds of over 150 tokens per second. </p>
<p dir="ltr">In keeping with the rich cultural cross-pollination between the Middle East and South Asia, Mistral Saba supports Arabic and many Indian-origin languages, and is particularly strong in South Indian-origin languages such as Tamil and Malayalam. This capability enhances its versatility in multinational use across these interconnected regions.</p>
