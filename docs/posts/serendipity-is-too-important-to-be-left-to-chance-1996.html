<h2>Augmented Memory </h2>

<p>Computers are very good at storing data and performing repetitive
functions very quickly.  Humans, on the other hand, can be very good
at intuitive leaps and recognizing patterns and structure, even when
not actively attending to an event.  Thus, an interface where a
wearable computer helps the user remember and access information seems
profitable.  In general, 95\% of computer time is dedicated to word
processing.  Since wearable computing allows such ease of access to a
keyboard, this percentage may be even higher for such machines.  However,
word processing requires about 1\% of the cpu power of the
system.  Instead of wasting the remaining 99\%, an information agent
can search the user&#39;s personal text database for
information relevant to the current context.  The names and short
excerpts of the closest matching files could then be displayed.  If
the search engine is fast enough, a continuously changing list of
matches could be maintained, which would increase the probability that
a useful piece of information will be recovered.  Thus, the agent can
act as a memory aid.  Even if the user mostly ignores the agent, he
will still tend to glance at it whenever there is a short break in his
work.  In order to explore such a work environment, the Remembrance
Agent was created. </p>


<h3> The Remembrance Agent </h3>

<p>The benefits of the Remembrance Agent (RA) are many.  First, the RA
provides timely information.  If writing a paper, the RA might suggest
relevant references.  If reading email and scheduling
an appointment, the RA may happen to suggest relevant constraints.  If
holding a conversation with a colleague at a conference, the RA might
bring up relevant work based on the notes taken.  Since the RA
``thinks&#39;&#39; differently that its user, it often suggests combinations
that the user would never put together.  Thus, the RA can act as a
constant ``brain-storming&#39;&#39; system.</p>

<p>The Remembrance Agent can help with personal organization.  As new
information arrives, the RA, by its nature, suggests files with
similar information.  Thus, the user gets suggestions on where to
store the new information, avoiding the common phenomenon of multiple
files with similar notes (e.g. archives-linux and linux-archives).
The first trial of the prototype RA revealed many such inconsistencies
on the sample database and suggested a new research
project by its groupings.</p>

<p>As a user collects a large database of private knowledge, his RA
becomes an expert on that knowledge base through constant re-training.
A goal of the RA is to allow co-workers to access the ``public&#39;&#39;
portions of this database conveniently without interrupting the user.
Thus, if a colleague wants to know about augmented reality, he simply
sends a message to the user&#39;s Remembrance Agent (e.g.
thad-ra@media.mit.edu).  The RA can then return its best guess at an
appropriate file.  Thus, the user is never bothered by the query,
never has to format his knowledge, and
the colleague feels free to use the resource (as opposed to knocking on
an office door).  Knowledge transfer may occur in a similar fashion.
When an engineer trains his replacement, he can also transfer his RA
database of knowledge on the subject so that his replacement may
continually receive the benefit of his experience even after he has left. </p>

<h3> Intellectual Collectives </h3>

<p> Possibly the most striking use of the Remembrance Agent is its
ability to seemlessly share knowledge in a work group.  Instead of
simply using one member&#39;s notes, the database is expanded to include
the members of a small work group.  This allows personal experience to
be shared quickly and conveniently.  For example, such an interface
is useful if one member of the workgroup is in charge of repairing the
team&#39;s computers.  When the team member receives new information about
an obscure bug in the operating system, he puts it in his personal
information files which can then is available to the rest of the team.
If other members then experience this bug, the appropriate file might
be suggested to the member.  This helps identify the problem quickly
and greatly reduces the overhead involved in diagnosing and assembling
a well-formed question to the rest of the team, whose appropriate
member may be unavailable. </p>

<p> To experiment with this idea, three volunteers have been assembled.
These volunteers have pooled their knowledge into one RA database which
runs continuously in their text processor (emacs19).  Originally, logs
were to be kept on which of the RA recommended files was accessed, but
due to problems with the software, a successfully running team system
was not available in time for the week long study planned. </p>

<h3> Implementation </h3>

<p> The current Remembrance Agent uses the Savant information retrieval
system developed in-house by the Jan Nelson and Bradley Rhodes.  
The Remembrance Agent runs through
emacs, a popular text editor.  The user interface is programmed in
elisp, and the results are presented as a three line buffer at the
bottom of the window.  Several considerations have gone into the
design of the RA.  First, the RA should not be distracting unless
unusual circumstances arise.  To that end, the RA does not use
boldface or highlighting and is run at a low priority.  Secondly, if
the RA recovers something of interest to the user, the full text is
accessible with a quick key combination (e.g. C-c 2 to get the file
associated with the second line).  The RA is configureable to search
in any size of context.  In this case, the highest ranked result from a search
on the last 10 words (first line) and the highest 2 on the last 100
(second and third line) are displayed.  The local context search is
done ever 10 seconds while the larger context is searched out of phase
every 30 seconds </p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the output of the Remembrance Agent.  The reference
database for this screen shot was Brad Rhodes&#39;s e-mail archives.  The
first number on each line of the RA output is simply a file label for
convenience.  For example, to view message 2, the user would simply
press ``Control-2&#39;&#39;  The second number on each line refers to the
``relevance measure&#39;&#39; of the message.</p> 

<h2> Preliminary Results </h2>

<p> A significant artifact of this test is that each participant does not
have an equal sized database to share with the others.  Thus, it can
be expected that the one with the largest database would be sited most
by the Remembrance Agent, and such is the case so far.  However, the
usefulness of the system in everyday e-mail was immediately shown.
Upon receiving an e-mail request for help on file io under UNIX, the
RA immediately suggested a recent serendipitous message from a
different newsgroup.  Another point of interest was that it was often
not clear whose memories were being recalled at any given point.  This
may be due to working relationships of the test subjects but brings up
a point of view issue.  What happens when your RA brings up other&#39;s
impressions of the same event?  Does this allow for easier
collaboration?  Will other&#39;s viewpoints be accidentally accepted as
one&#39;s own? </p>

<p> Using this system on a multiple person database has revealed
several areas of improvement for the system.  Frist, the server nature
of savant must be improved to allow faster update speeds.  Better
descriptor lines should be included to indicate out of whose memories
a given recall comes.  Finally, several improvements in the emacs user
interface have been identified.  Once these are fixed, a larger test
may be attempted with detailed logging on what information is
referenced and when this information is provided across different
users. </p>
