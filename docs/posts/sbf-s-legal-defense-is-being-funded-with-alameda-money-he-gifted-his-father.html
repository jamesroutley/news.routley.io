<hr/>
<p><abbr>S</abbr><strong>am Bankman-Fried,</strong> founder of fallen cryptocurrency exchange FTX who claimed to have just $100,000 in his bank account last November, is preparing for trial in October backed by a roster of powerful attorneys. But it has remained unclear, until now, how the former billionaire would afford his pricey defense.</p>

<p><em>Forbes</em> has learned that Bankman-Fried has been paying legal fees from a multi-million dollar gift he gave his father with money borrowed from FTX’s sister company.</p>

<p>In 2021, while CEO of FTX, Bankman-Fried made a large monetary gift to his father, Stanford Law professor Joseph Bankman, two sources with operational knowledge of both companies told <em>Forbes</em>. It was funded by a loan from the exchange’s trading firm, Alameda Research, they said.</p>
<fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>Bankman-Fried — who has pleaded not guilty to 12 criminal charges including wire fraud, money laundering and securities fraud, and faces an additional bribery charge — is accused of misappropriating FTX customer funds through Alameda dating back to the exchange’s founding in 2019.</p>

<p>A source close to Bankman-Fried told <em>Forbes</em> that his defense costs are likely in the single-digit-millions range. “I didn’t steal funds, and I certainly didn’t stash billions away,” <a href="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview" target="_blank" title="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview" aria-label="he wrote">he wrote</a> on Substack earlier this year. Two additional sources familiar with the family told <em>Forbes</em> that Bankman once begged his son to put away savings, but Bankman-Fried reportedly declined.</p>

<h2><strong>After receiving at least $10 million from Alameda, Bankman-Fried sent the funds to Bankman using his lifetime estate and gift tax exemption — essentially a tax-free gift</strong></h2>
<p>It’s been alleged that some $10 billion in customer deposits were secretly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/exclusive-least-1-billion-client-funds-missing-failed-crypto-firm-ftx-sources-2022-11-12/" target="_blank" title="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/exclusive-least-1-billion-client-funds-missing-failed-crypto-firm-ftx-sources-2022-11-12/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/exclusive-least-1-billion-client-funds-missing-failed-crypto-firm-ftx-sources-2022-11-12/" aria-label="diverted to Alameda">diverted to Alameda</a> by the former CEO. These funds were “intended to be used for trading or custodied on FTX” between 2019 and 2022, according to a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23" target="_blank" title="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23" aria-label="complaint">complaint</a> against Nishad Singh, the company’s former engineering head, who <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/02/28/ftx-executive-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty-in-fraud-probe/?sh=452f5ca460a3" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/02/28/ftx-executive-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty-in-fraud-probe/?sh=452f5ca460a3" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/02/28/ftx-executive-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty-in-fraud-probe/?sh=452f5ca460a3" aria-label="pleaded guilty">pleaded guilty</a> to fraud and conspiracy charges last month. FTX debtors claim that Bankman-Fried improperly received $2.2 billion in company loans, and alleged this month that $8.9 billion in customer deposits are still missing.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried declined to comment.</p>
<p>The gift and loan are reported here for the first time, and occurred in 2021 when Bankman-Fried arranged to give money to his father, according to the two sources with knowledge of company operations. After receiving at least $10 million from Alameda, Bankman-Fried sent the funds to Bankman using his lifetime estate and gift tax exemption — essentially a tax-free gift. He contributed the maximum amount someone is allowed to give in their lifetime, which would have been $11.7 million that year, these sources told <em>Forbes</em>.</p>
<p>Lawyers for FTX did not respond to a request for comment.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"></fbs-ad>
<p>Bankman-Fried is currently represented by Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell of Cohen &amp; Gresser, both former federal prosecutors who were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-defense-team-led-by-battle-tested-lawyers-11673217199" target="_blank" title="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-defense-team-led-by-battle-tested-lawyers-11673217199" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-defense-team-led-by-battle-tested-lawyers-11673217199" aria-label="part of a defense team">part of a defense team</a> that advised Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking a minor. He is also being advised pro bono by criminal defense attorney David W. Mills, a close family friend and colleague of Bankman’s at Stanford, a source familiar with the matter told <em>Forbes</em>. Cohen and Everdell did not respond to a request for comment. Mills declined to comment.</p>
<p>Bankman, a clinical psychologist and prominent attorney who specializes in the field of tax law, but not specifically wealth preservation, did not respond to a list of questions from <em>Forbes</em>. The gift required Bankman-Fried to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-709" target="_blank" title="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-709" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-709" aria-label="file a return">file a return</a> with the IRS, which is not a public document. Last month, Bankman and his wife Barbara Fried, a retired Stanford Law professor, received subpoenas from FTX attorneys seeking personal finance statements and records of any assets transferred to them by FTX companies or employees.</p>
<p>Amid growing scrutiny, Bankman-Fried’s parents have rallied in support of their 31-year-old son. “I’ll be spending substantially all of my resources on Sam’s defense,” Bankman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/technology/sbf-parents-ftx-collapse.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/technology/sbf-parents-ftx-collapse.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/technology/sbf-parents-ftx-collapse.html" aria-label="reportedly">reportedly</a> told a nonprofit whose donation from FTX was interrupted by the bankruptcy.</p>
<p><em>Forbes</em> was unable to confirm how much Bankman-Fried presently owes in legal fees, but his parents have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-parents-were-there-for-ftxs-rise-and-now-its-fall-11670841001" target="_blank" title="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-parents-were-there-for-ftxs-rise-and-now-its-fall-11670841001" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-parents-were-there-for-ftxs-rise-and-now-its-fall-11670841001" aria-label="reportedly">reportedly</a> leveraged their own assets to financially support their son; in December, their $1.8 million Palo Alto home was used to secure a $250 million bail package after Bankman-Fried was released on a personal recognizance bond.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-2"></fbs-ad>
<p>His lawyers have also argued that federal prosecutors give Bankman-Fried access to 56 million Robinhood shares he bought in 2022 with money lent by Alameda. The shares, worth $485 million at today’s prices, were seized in January based on allegations that they were purchased with allegedly stolen customer funds. His attorneys have also petitioned the Delaware bankruptcy court for financial assistance. In a motion filed this month, they asked that he be allowed to use millions of dollars in coverage provided by FTX’s insurance policies to help pay for some of his legal costs.</p>
<p>FTX is now led by new CEO John J. Ray III, a veteran corporate restructuring expert who reportedly charged the company $690,000 in fees for two months of work. Hundreds of lawyers and advisors working on the bankruptcy proceedings have reportedly billed FTX a combined <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/07/ftx-bankruptcy-special-counsel-and-advisers-bill-38-million-for-january/" target="_blank" title="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/07/ftx-bankruptcy-special-counsel-and-advisers-bill-38-million-for-january/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/07/ftx-bankruptcy-special-counsel-and-advisers-bill-38-million-for-january/" aria-label="$38 million in expenses">$38 million in expenses</a>.</p>
<p>Since his arrest in the Bahamas last December, Bankman-Fried’s estimated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-bankman-fried/?sh=5faf339b4449" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-bankman-fried/?sh=5faf339b4449" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-bankman-fried/?sh=5faf339b4449" aria-label="$26.5 billion net worth">$26.5 billion net worth</a> has all but evaporated, as much of his wealth was tied up in FTX and its FTT tokens. Last month, the U.S Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/21/2023/doj-ftx-contributions-letter" target="_blank" title="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/21/2023/doj-ftx-contributions-letter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.semafor.com/article/03/21/2023/doj-ftx-contributions-letter" aria-label="reportedly demanded">reportedly demanded</a> that lawmakers who received donations from Bankman-Fried return them to the U.S. Marshals service.</p>
<p>According to a new indictment unsealed by federal prosecutors on Tuesday, he is expected to face new charges at a pretrial conference scheduled for Thursday, including allegations that he conspired to bribe Chinese government officials in 2021 with $40 million in cryptocurrency. It is unclear how Bankman-Fried intends to respond.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"></fbs-ad>
