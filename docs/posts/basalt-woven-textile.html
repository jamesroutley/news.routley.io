<p>Textile made of natural stone? Yes, it is possible!</p>
<p>First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.</p>
<p>Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.</p>
<p>Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.</p>
