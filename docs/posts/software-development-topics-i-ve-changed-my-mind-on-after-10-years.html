It takes constant work</li><li>There is no pride in managing or understanding complexity</li><li>Typed languages are essential on teams with mixed experience levels</li><li>Java is a great language <em>because</em> it&#39;s boring</li><li>REPLs are not useful design tools (though, they <em>are</em> useful exploratory tools)</li><li>Most programming should be done long before a single line of code is written</li><li>Frontend development is a nightmare world of Kafkaesque awfulness I no longer enjoy</li><li>Elegance is not a real metric</li><li>Good management is <em>invaluable</em>. (I went most of my career before seeing it done well)</li><li>DynamoDB is a good database (<strong>IFF</strong> your workload lines up with what it&#39;s offering)</li><li>Objects are extremely good at what they&#39;re good at. Blind devotion to functional is dumb.</li></ul><h3>Opinions I&#39;ve picked up along the way</h3><ul><li>Engineering is mostly about communication</li><li>Never go full monad in Java.</li><li>The query planner is a <a href="https://chriskiehl.com/article/query-plan-management">cruel mistress</a></li><li>If I think something is easy, that&#39;s a sure sign I don&#39;t understand it.</li><li>You have to give younger devs room to explore and make mistakes</li><li>You have to actively invest in improving your soft skills (and investments pay back immediately)</li><li>Very few abstractions exist in general application development. Just write the code you need</li><li>Contrarily, library development is <em>about</em> abstractions. Spend time hunting for an algebra</li><li>ORMs are the devil in all languages and all implementations. Just write the damn SQL</li><li>The trouble with functional programming is functional programmers</li><li>Given a long enough time horizon, you&#39;ll deeply regret building on Serverless Functions</li><li>Types are assertions we make about the world</li><li>Distributed locking is still really hard for some reason</li><li>Formal modeling and analysis is an essential skill set</li><li>Isolation is the most important property of a good integration suite.</li><li>DynamoDB is the <em>worst possible choice</em> for general application development</li><li>Most won&#39;t care about the craft. Cherish the ones that do, meet the rest where they are</li><li>Gradual, dependently typed languages are the future</li><li>You literally cannot add too many comments to test code (I challenge anyone to try)</li></ul><h3>Things I have <i>not</i> changed my opinion on:</h3><ul><li>People who stress over code style, linting rules, or other minutia remain insane weirdos to me. Focus on more important things.</li><li>Code coverage has absolutely nothing to do with code quality (in many cases, it&#39;s inversely proportional)</li><li>Monoliths remain pretty good</li><li>It&#39;s very hard to beat decades of RDBMS research and improvements</li><li>Micro-services require justification (they&#39;ve increasingly just become <i>assumed</i>)</li><li>Most projects (even inside of AWS!) don&#39;t need to &#34;scale&#34; and are damaged by pretending so</li><li>93%, <i>maybe</i> 95.2%, of project managers, could disappear tomorrow to either no effect or a net gain in efficiency. (this estimate is up from 4 years ago)</li></ul><p>We&#39;ll see which of these have flipped at year 15. </p></article></div></div></div></div>
