here’s a collection of numbers worth knowing if you’re working in neurotechnology.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/325249141"><strong>download this list as Anki flashcards</strong></a>.
Having them memorized and at your fingertips is great for sanity checking ideas.</p>
<p>I plan to keep growing this list and Anki deck in perpetuity, so if it’s missing your
