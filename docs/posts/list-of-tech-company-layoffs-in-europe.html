            <p>The tech company layoffs have hit Europe. Several of Europe’s best-known startups have made drastic cuts to their teams in order to cut costs and preserve their cash runway as the global economy takes a downturn.</p><p>Tech stocks have crashed on public markets, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/startup-valuations-european-tech/">private company valuations</a> have taken a hit as a result. Investors are writing <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/vc-caution-valuation-survey/">cheques more cautiously</a>, while urging their portfolio companies to<a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/tech-stock-crash-europe-startups/"> preserve cash. </a>Consumers are also beginning to watch their pennies, putting B2C startups in an especially tight position.</p><p>That means it’s an unfortunate time to be out raising funding — and particularly bad timing if you’re a scaleup with a big monthly burn rate.</p>

<p>So far, fintech giant Klarna, speedy grocery poster child Gorillas, online events platform Hopin and digital health company Kry have announced sizeable layoffs.</p><p>Here, we list the layoffs that we know of — and hope that this helps hiring managers at other startups know where to look for new talent.</p><h3>Tech company layoffs: European startups letting employees go</h3>

The company told Sifted that 45 employees will be affected — that’s 20% of its workforce.
