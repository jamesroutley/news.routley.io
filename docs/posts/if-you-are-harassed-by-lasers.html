She shines her laser lights in other neighbors faces, heads, at children, family pets, windows of houses, plants and trees (which are singed from being over exposed/burned by laser lights), aircraft, on our parked vehicles, &amp; vehicles driving down the street. When I have been in the front yard my eyes and face start burning from the lasering. The police have been called several times, but state that they cannot do anything.</code></p></div></div></dd>

<dd><div id="stacks_out_403"><div id="stacks_in_403"><p>In late 2020, a woman called saying that an unfriendly neighbor may be aiming a blue laser at persons in her driveway. The people did not see any blue light or blue flash, but a <a href="https://blinkforhome.com/products/">Blink security camera</a> had blue images when the persons were in the driveway.</p></div></div><div id="stacks_out_409"><div id="stacks_in_409"><p>The photos clearly show it was <strong><em>not</em></strong> a laser. The tint is uniform, whereas a laser hitting the camera would cause a bright spot or complete whiteout or blueout of the camera image. Also, the tint is steady. A handheld laser from across the street would flash in the camera, since the neighbor could not hold the laser completely steady. (Even most tripods would not be 100% steady from such a distance — there would be some brightness fluctuation.)</p></div></div></dd>
