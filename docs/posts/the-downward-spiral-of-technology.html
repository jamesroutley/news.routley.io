I’ve been buying new computers for decades, and always assumed that newer is better.</p><p>And until recently it was.</p><p>But here’s the new reality: Upgrades are now actually downgrades. At first it was just software—those dreaded updates!—but increasingly it’s hardware too.</p><p>For a while, I resisted returning to my old desktop model. I assumed the problem had to be with me, not the hardware. Surely computers had gotten better over the last several years?</p><p>Tech always get better, doesn’t it?</p><p>No, it doesn’t. Not anymore.

Perhaps it’s because the tech elite has broken the social contract: </p><blockquote><p>“For years the Valley has had an elevated status, forgiven for burning billions of dollars on speculative moonshot ideas because they were, theoretically, striving to improve society. […]</p><p>[This has now changed!] </p><p><span>Seemingly every major tech story of the past five or six years has been about</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html" rel=""> the tech industry getting filthy rich</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/big-tech-pandemic.html" rel=""> while others suffered</a><span> or</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/25/techs-reality-check-how-the-industry-lost-7point4-trillion-in-one-year.html" rel=""> losing unthinkable sums of money</a><span>, with no counterbalance of “but at least we got </span><em>this</em><span>” to go with it. </span></p><p><span>Tech’s heroes aren’t guys in turtlenecks who reveal the future in a cinematic presentation - they’re billionaire whiners crowing about “</span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/fighting-woke-ai-musk-recruits-team-to-develop-openai-rival" rel="">woke AI</a><span>,” or</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/28/mark-zuckerberg-110-acres-hawaii" rel=""> buying up hundreds of acres of land in Hawaii</a><span>, or</span><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/97232-salesforce-ceo-points-finger-new-remote-younger-workers.html" rel=""> claiming that remote work is bad after laying off thousands of people</a><a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-ceo-says-took-10-181554669.html" rel=""> before taking a 10-day “digital detox” in French Polynesia</a><span>.” </span></p><p><a href="https://wheresyoured.at/p/the-uncanny-valley" rel="">The Uncanny Valley</a><span> by</span></p><span> </span></blockquote><p>So what remains now when we look at the tech sector and its heroes is an image of an entrepreneur that has been completely stripped of things like social purpose, advancing well-being for all, and creating a more joyful future. </p><p>The entrepreneurial dream seems to now be about nothing more than becoming rich and influential. So, technology becomes nothing more than a vehicle for wealth and power.</p><p><span>Philosopher </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich" rel="">Ivan Illich</a><span> described this phenomenon as </span><em>overgrowth of tools</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>“Illich coined the term to describe the situation where we created and came to rely on various tools to solve problems, but then we became overly dependent on these tools and those who wield control over them. </p><p>This dependency reaches the point where the tools, rather than serving us, start dictating and molding our lives until we’ve lost sight of their original purpose.” </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP2rObVK1zg" rel="">We need better tools by andreism</a></p></blockquote><p><span>, who writes a lot about Illich’s philosophy, further notes that: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Illich understood that if we proceed on the assumption that we need better tools to work </span><em>for</em><span> us, we will eventually end up ‘degraded to the status of mere consumers.’</span></p><p>A condition aptly summed up by Illich when he feared that we were traveling along a path that would lead to ‘a further increase of useful things for useless people.’”</p></blockquote><p><span>Those words – “</span><em>useful things for useless people”</em><span> – resonated with me when I read Cal Newport’s recent </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/solving-the-productivity-paradox#:~:text=During%20the%20past%20two%20decades,not%20getting%20much%20more%20done." rel="">article</a><span> in the New York Times that looks at the paradox of workplace productivity growth </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2021/article/the-us-productivity-slowdown-the-economy-wide-and-industry-level-analysis.htm" rel="">slowing down</a><span> during the past two decades despite us getting so many new, shiny productivity tools:</span></p><blockquote><p>“[…] The existing strategy of making applications increasingly powerful has stopped making us better at our jobs. </p><p>During the past two decades or so—a period of rapid technology innovation, which produced laptops, smartphones, ubiquitous cloud computing, and Google—American productivity growth has suffered a sustained slowdown. We gained access to an armada of supercharged workplace tools, and yet we’re not getting much more done.</p><p>There are many explanations for this paradox, including, notably, the theory that these tools counterbalanced new capabilities with new distractions.” </p></blockquote><p><span>But Cal goes on to explain that this is not the entire story here as he reminds us that Henry Ford’s famous productivity innovation, for instance, wasn’t really a technical one but a new way of thinking about the production process, inspired by looking outside his industry (in this case </span><a href="https://51154787.weebly.com/the-swift-meatpacking-plant.html" rel="">the meat-packing industry</a><span>) or what Cal Newport also calls “smarter ways of arranging what you’re already doing”:</span></p><blockquote><p>“The assembly line was a productivity miracle, decreasing the worker hours required to produce a Model T by nearly a factor of ten. Its effectiveness, however, had less to do with ingenious new inventions than it did with an ingenious new insight about how to rearrange the manufacturing process: bringing the car to the worker instead of the worker to the car.”</p></blockquote><p><span>And while Cal Newport focuses specifically on workplace productivity, I think that this concept links very well with the bigger point I made in last week’s </span><a href="https://www.creativedestruction.club/p/a-frictionless-world-is-boring-as" rel="">piece</a><span>. Namely, that one of the key problems of our current age is that we’ve focused too much on the ideas of “the engineer” – I mean this in the broadest sense – and their mechanistic perspective rather than looking at non-technological or non-mechanistic solutions and innovations to our problems.</span></p><p>Said differently, maybe we don’t need better, more humane, more useful technology, but rather better non-technological process and system innovations triggered by out-of-the-box perspectives and new ways of looking at the world – “smarter ways of arranging what you’re already doing”. Hey and if, through this approach, we end up arriving at a solution that includes some type of technology, then why not. </p><p>The crucial thing however, is the approach! Solving climate change requires system change, solving inequality requires system change, solving racism requires system change, solving the mental health crisis requires system change…</p><p>The problem is not that the “machine” of humanity, of earth is broken and therefore needs an upgrade. The problem is that we think of it as a “machine”. </p><div id="youtube2-7apLcaSvZlw" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;7apLcaSvZlw&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7apLcaSvZlw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>That’s it for this Friday edition!
