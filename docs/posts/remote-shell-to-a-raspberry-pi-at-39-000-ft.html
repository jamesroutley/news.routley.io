    <h1>Remote shell to a Raspberry Pi at 39,000 ft</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few weeks I&#39;ve been beta testing remote shell, the latest addition to Raspberry Pi Connect. Just a couple hours ago I was on a flight home from the new Micro Center in Charlotte.</p>

<p>One huge problem with VNC or remote desktop is how flaky it is if you have limited bandwidth or an unstable connection, like on an airplane.</p>

<p>It takes forever to start a screen sharing session, and the airplane&#39;s flaky WiFi usually causes the session to lock up, meaning you can&#39;t do much at all.</p>

<p>Remote <em>terminal</em> access, just relaying text commands, is the best solution for that problem. And sure, I have a VPN I could use with SSH to get to my Pi, but <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect-remote-shell-access-and-support-for-older-devices/">Raspberry Pi Connect just added support for remote shell access</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to SSH works, but with SSH you&#39;d need your Pi exposed to the Internet. Not good. That&#39;s why I have a VPN, but a private VPN isn&#39;t something most people want to set up and maintain.</p>

<p>So for any situation where you <em>don&#39;t</em> need the whole graphical environment, or where you have limited bandwidth, you can use the new remote shell feature.</p>

<p>From my Southwest flight, I could connect straight from my laptop to the Pi in my rack at my studio, and terminal commands ran without a hitch.</p>

<p>The initial connection was quick, and I could even watch a <em>movie</em> through it! Well... at least if that movie is <a href="https://www.asciimation.co.nz">Star Wars ASCIIMATION</a> playing through telnet!</p>

<p>But it was way more stable, and I could get actual work done. My lone attempt at screen sharing froze the first time I tried launching an app.</p>

<p>I have a brief video covering my testing on my 2nd YouTube channel:</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad Raspberry Pi&#39;s adding this functionality to Pi Connect (the community has been asking for this feature since day one!). It&#39;s not quite the same thing as Tailscale, Cloudflare Tunnel, or Twingate, but it&#39;s useful if you have a Raspberry Pi you want to remote into without any VPN.</p>

<p>I have more about Raspberry Pi Connect, including how to get started in <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-getting-services-game">my earlier blog post</a>. You can also read more on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect-remote-shell-access-and-support-for-older-devices/">Raspberry Pi&#39;s announcement blog post</a>, including how they&#39;re supporting <em>every Pi device</em> now, at least for remote shell access.</p></div></div>
