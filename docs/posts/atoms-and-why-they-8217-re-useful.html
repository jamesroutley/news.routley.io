    <h1>Atoms, And Why They&amp;#8217;re Useful</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Today I want to talk about a programming language feature that goes by many different names. Elixir, Erlang, and <a href="http://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto">zepto</a> call them atoms. Common Lisp and Clojure call them keywords. Smalltalk and Ruby call them symbols. But all of those stand for basically the same thing: a thing that evaluates to itself. The implementation details differ a little bit from language to language, with some languages having a registry—basically a giant table—that stores the terms to guarantee uniqueness and others translating them to some kind of unique identifier at compile time.</p>
<p>When you first encounter this construct, you might not immediately recognize its value. After all, most languages have a concept that seems to fit the bill anyway; don’t strings provide the same basic functionality?</p>
<p>Let’s look at a couple of different use cases for atoms—which is what I will call them in this blog post—, and explore why I think they are extremely useful, especially for languages that have a less expressive or dynamic type system.</p>
<h2 id="the-semantic-argument">The semantic argument</h2>
<p>I will try to make a case for atoms on a language semantic basis by comparing them to what we might already find in a language: strings and identifiers (in Lisp we call them symbols).</p>
<p>From a semantic perspective, strings are meant to represent text. While we use them for flags and signalling between functions in many applications written in languages that do not have atoms, this is not what they were made for<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. A string should be used either for interfacing with the user of our system or as a piece of data that you want to apply some transformation on—say a compiler, linter, or even an HTTP request handler.</p>
<p>One perfectly valid usecase of symbols is to use them to signal between functions. This makes for a cleaner interface: I can make sure everyone knows that this information is not intended to be processed or handed to the user: it only changes the behavior of the function.</p>
<p>Some languages have identifiers that can be used as values—think of Lisp’s quoted values. There the distinction is not quite so clear. In Smalltalk and Ruby, in fact, a keyword—their notion of an atom, remember?–can be used in such a way that functions can be called, through a system those langauges call message-passing<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I would argue that it makes sense to have separate constructs for the two, however. Some of it boils down to the performance argument that I will present in the next section, but semantically, too, it often makes sense to clear up whether a value is just itself or an identifier for a value stored in the environment. This is similar to my case on strings presented above: if you pass in a quoted variable instead, how will you be sure the function will not try to reach in and evaluate the symbol? I embrace semantic clarity, and this double-usage of a symbol as an alias and as itself feels quite dirty to me.</p>
<p>Some of the Lisp people in the room might accuse me of not embracing the Lisp way right around now. But believe you me, I do. I love the fact that I can treat data as code and vice versa. But I wish for the bulk of this to happen at the time of macro expansion, not evaluation. If it does have to happen—for instance when evaluating lazy expressions, a perfect example of this weird dichotomy—it should happen without the user knowing it through the interface<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-performance-argument">The performance argument</h2>
<p>If you settle on providing atoms as a fundamental type in your programming language, a whole world of possibilities opens up to you as an implementer. In most languages comparing atoms is much faster than comparing, say, strings or symbols<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This is because we know that the only meaning they have is themselves, and as such they only need to be IDs. In some languages, we can compile them to integers. If we want to be able to stringify them or get our original value back, we can keep track of them in a giant non-garbage-collected table, as for instance Erlang chooses to do, and have atoms themselves be just indices into that table. This makes them remarkably fast.</p>
<p>Why can we do this? It turns out that if we have a data type that is expressly designed as a signal value, the most-frequently used operation will be comparing it to other such values.</p>
<p>Thus, the performance argument ties back into the semantic argument, and becomes a more general one: the more we know about what our data types will be used for, and the more narrow our scope of operations on it, the better we can optimize our type to support just those operations. This is especially true for collection types—think bags versus lists versus sets versus trees—, but it generally applies to all kinds of types, even the most basic ones.</p>
<p>As a corollary we can also conclude that they are useful as keys in hashmaps, and are in fact often used as such. This is because they do not need to be hashed—they are “hashed” at compile time.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I talked about how atoms, or whatever you call them, are an interesting, if often glossed-over data type for many languages. They are useful for a wide range of applications while having fairly limited functionality.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this blog post! See you soon!</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> Admittedly, in many languages you would have some kind of enum type for that. I will leave out this detail for the purposes of this blog post, because admittedly I don’t have as strong a case for the fundamental difference of the two.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> Sending messages is quite fundamental for both of these languages, and it’s what happens when you call a function on an object. This goes deep into the fundamentals of those languages, but it’s quite interesting, if not quite instrumental for this blog post.</p>
<p><span id="3">3.</span> Let me illustrate this point a little more:</p>
<pre><code>; this is too simple to be sensible.
; For a more complete definition of lazy follow
; the link below

; lazy as a macro
(define-syntax lazy-macro
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ expr)
      (quote expr))))

; lazy as a regular function
(define (lazy-fun expr) expr)

; force
(define (force obj) (eval obj))

(def thunk1 (lazy-macro (+ 1 2)))
(def thunk2 (lazy-fun &#39;(+ 1 2)))</code></pre>

<p>Which of these interfaces is cleaner? Both of these are functionally equivalent, but creating a macro makes for a prettier API, as so very often for metaprogramming work.</p>
<p><span id="4">4.</span> Regrettably, my own little concoction zepto is not one of them, at least in interpreted mode.</p>
