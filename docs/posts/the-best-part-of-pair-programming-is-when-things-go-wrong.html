    <h1>The best part of pair-programming is when things go wrong</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I’ve pair-programmed in a lot of different situations. I’ve been the junior developer who needed to be unblocked. I’ve been the new team member, being onboarded to a new codebase. I’ve paired with peers for knowledge-sharing and productivity. And I’ve been the senior dev.</p>
<p>When you’re about to pair-program, there’s a temptation to plan it around a simple, self-contained task… one that’s unlikely to have any surprises or unknowns.
Nobody wants to feel embarrassed getting stuck on an unexpected problem when your peers are watching.</p>
<p>Taken to an extreme, your pair-programming sessions can start to look like a perfectly planned cooking show with pre-measured ingredients, lined up in the correct order. You get a flawless cake every time but you don’t learn anything useful about baking.</p>
<p>When I think back, my favorite pair-programming sessions were the one where things went wrong. These were the moments that taught me what being a programmer is all about. What do you do when you don’t know what to do? How do you break down a new problem? What tools do you reach for? When do you abandon your current approach? These are things you can’t learn from a blog post.</p>
<p>Even just the idea that senior devs have knowledge gaps, google things, and make mistakes was a revelation to me. I started to see that senior devs are a lot like junior devs, but with more confidence, better instincts, and a well-rounded perspective. These were valuable lessons for me as I transitioned into a senior dev myself.</p>
<p>It takes some courage to jump into an unknown pair-programming situation but don’t be afraid! A lot of good can come from working through a messy problem together.</p>
