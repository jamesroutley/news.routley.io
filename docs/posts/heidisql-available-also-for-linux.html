<p>I&#39;m still scratching my head how to create an .rpm package for RedHat based Linuxes. However, looking at the variety of Linux flavours, I should probably just pack a simple .tgz file.</p>

<p>Do I understand right a Flatpak (for flathub.org) needs to be built using org.flatpak.Builder, creating a manifest, the a Github pull request? Sounds all like some effort...</p>

                            <div id="msg44073"><p>Yes, but by doing it once you can install it on any distro. Many Linux app developers nowadays prefer approaches like Flatpak because it&#39;s actually less effort in the end.
This way you don&#39;t need to support every distro and therefore don&#39;t complaints like xy doesn&#39;t work on Distro z.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t post links but see the &#34;Building your first Flatpak&#34; page to get started. I don&#39;t have experience with Pascal but if you look around Flathub there might already apps made with it to help you getting started with the manifest. And as a last resort I think there will definitely be people in the Flatpak and/or HeidiSQL community willing to help.</p>

<p>Initially, I had problems with imported configurations until I tried the alternative non-daemon libraries.  /usr/lib/libmariadb.so works fine when set. The daemon libmariadbd.so would probably have to be setup as a service for it to be accessible. Some install notes will probably follow? </p>

<p>@CxOrg I think you found a bug. <code>libmariadbd.so</code> is not a client library, and it should not appear in the dropd-down. I did not see that in my tests, I guess because it did not exist on my system. These libraries are detected through a <code>/sbin/ldconfig -p</code> command, plus an expression which I need to fix:</p>
<pre><code>rx.Expression := &#39;<span>^\s*<span>lib</span>(mysqlclient|mariadb)[^=]+=&gt;\s*(\S+)$</span>&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Will fix that for the next release.</p>

Ran into the same libmariadbd.so issue, but other than that, seems to work mostly fine. Had one random crash when I clicked the disconnect button that I could not reproduce. Guess if I run into similar things I&#39;ll report back.</p>
<p>With the previous non-native build I had trouble getting ssh tunneling to work, and eventually gave up and just manually opened an ssh tunnel myself every time I need to connect to one of my servers, but now it works perfectly again within heidisql itself, I am very happy! Thank you!</p>
