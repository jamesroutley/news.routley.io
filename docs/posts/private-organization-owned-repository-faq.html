    <h1>Private, organization-owned repository FAQ</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><div data-v-6ef9db6a=""><div data-v-6ef9db6a=""><div data-v-31093bba=""><div data-v-31093bba=""><h2 data-v-31093bba="">What is changing?</h2><p data-v-31093bba="">The ability to connect to a private, organization-owned GitHub repository for continuous deployment is now a part of Netlify’s Pro plan. Connecting to a personal project or an open source public repository remains free as part of our Starter plan.</p><p data-v-31093bba="">Any Starter team wishing to connect a private, organization-owned GitHub repository will be prompted to upgrade to a Pro plan or above. Teams with existing repository connections are not yet required to make changes, but if you upgrade now, we’re offering the first month of Pro free.</p><h2 data-v-31093bba="">Why is Netlify doing this?</h2><p data-v-31093bba="">So much of our success as a platform comes from the students, hobbyists, weekend side-project developers, and open source maintainers who have shared the joy of Netlify with their friends, followers, colleagues, and managers, and we’re committed to maintaining our free Starter plan for these use cases.</p><p data-v-31093bba="">At the same time, we’re also investing more heavily in providing the productivity and control features that businesses need as they scale, and we’re working to identify the teams that would benefit from such an investment. Our research has shown that private repositories under organizational accounts are nearly always owned by teams using the repository for work.</p><h2 data-v-31093bba="">What is a private, organization-owned GitHub repository?</h2><p data-v-31093bba="">A private, organization-owned repository is a repository that meets all three of the following criteria:</p><ul data-v-31093bba=""><li data-v-31093bba="">It is stored on GitHub.</li><li data-v-31093bba="">It is owned by a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations" data-v-31093bba="">GitHub organization account</a>.</li><li data-v-31093bba="">It is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility" data-v-31093bba="">private repository</a>.</li></ul><p data-v-31093bba="">This does not include public GitHub repositories or repositories owned by personal GitHub accounts (public or private). Though this policy may expand to other Git providers in the future, repositories hosted by other Git providers are not affected at this time.</p><h2 data-v-31093bba="">I’m not ready for Pro. How can I stay on Starter?</h2><p data-v-31093bba="">If you have a site connected to a private, organization-owned GitHub repository, you can stay in compliance on the Starter plan by taking any of the following actions:</p><ul data-v-31093bba=""><li data-v-31093bba=""><a href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/repo-permissions-linking/#unlink-a-git-repository" data-v-31093bba="">Unlink the repository</a> from your site. To continue deploying the site, you could build locally and deploy manually using Netlify’s CLI, API, or Drop.</li><li data-v-31093bba="">Remove the site from your team.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility" data-v-31093bba="">Change the repository visibility</a> to public.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-organization" data-v-31093bba="">Transfer the repository</a> to a GitHub personal account.</li></ul><h2 data-v-31093bba="">What does an upgrade to Pro mean for me?</h2><p data-v-31093bba="">Netlify’s Pro plan is designed to help your team ship even faster. You’ll have access to new benefits and features, including:</p><ul data-v-31093bba=""><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">1TB of bandwidth per month</strong> – 10x more than Starter.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">25k build minutes per month</strong> – over 80x more than Starter.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">Email technical support</strong> – private 1:1 email help directly from the Netlify team.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">Background functions</strong> – execute long-running asynchronous functions for up to 15 minutes.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">3 concurrent builds</strong> – run more than one build at the same time.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">Audit logs with 7-day history</strong> – track changes to your team and site settings.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">Private sites</strong> – lock sites behind a password or basic authentication header.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">Slack &amp; email deploy notifications</strong> – notify a Slack channel or send an email when a deploy succeeds, fails, or hits other milestones.</li><li data-v-31093bba=""><strong data-v-31093bba="">Shared environment variables</strong> – set team-wide defaults for all your sites.</li></ul><p data-v-31093bba="">The Pro plan subscription starts at $19 per month for one team member, plus $19 per month for each additional team member, including Git Contributors (explained below). If you upgrade now, we’ll waive the subscription fees for the first month. Usage charges and additional features for purchase are listed on our <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/" data-v-31093bba="">pricing page</a>.</p><h2 data-v-31093bba="">What is a Git Contributor?</h2><p data-v-31093bba="">On the Pro plan and above, only your Netlify team members and approved <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/accounts-and-billing/team-management/manage-team-members/#git-contributors" data-v-31093bba="">Git Contributors</a> can trigger deploys to your sites from private repositories. You have the option to approve deploys individually and add Git Contributors to your team as you go, or set your deploys to auto-approve and have the Git Contributors added to your team automatically.</p><p data-v-31093bba="">At the end of your billing cycle, all approved Git Contributors for the month are added to your member count and charged at the normal Pro plan rate of $19 per member. As the next billing cycle starts, Git Contributor counts reset and we only add them back if they again deploy during the current billing cycle.</p><h2 data-v-31093bba="">Where can I get help?</h2><p data-v-31093bba="">If you have a question that isn’t answered here, you can post it in our <a href="https://answers.netlify.com/t/questions-about-connecting-private-organization-owned-repositories/72151" data-v-31093bba="">dedicated forum topic</a> where our Support team can help you.</p><p data-v-31093bba="">If you have feedback, you can share it with our Product team using this <a href="https://netlify.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bKHnFXtUYIoopPE" data-v-31093bba="">feedback form</a>. You have the option to leave your email address if you’re open to receiving follow-up questions from the team.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
