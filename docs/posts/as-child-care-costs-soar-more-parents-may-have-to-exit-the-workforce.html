              </figcaption></figure><section><p>The cost of child care has risen so high in recent years that some parents can&#39;t afford to work.</p><p>As of September, the average household spent more than $700 a month on child care, up 32% from 2019, according to a recent <a href="https://business.bofa.com/content/dam/flagship/bank-of-america-institute/economic-insights/rising-childcare-costs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> from the Bank of America Institute. The sharply higher costs are driving some parents to leave the workforce in order to look after their children. </p><p>At the same time, many families laying out for child care are having to tap their savings while down on spending, potentially weighing on economic growth, BofA noted.</p>    
  <p>&#34;While our data only captures payrolls deposited into Bank of America accounts and might not paint the full picture, we think the [spending] decline still points to the possibility of some working parents leaving the workforce as child care prices rise rapidly,&#34; the report states.</p><p>Child care costs refer to the out-of-pocket expenses parents pay for their child to attend daycare or to hire a babysitter or nanny. The costs typically fall or disappear once a child enters preschool or kindergarten around ages 3 or 5. </p>

    

<p>The U.S. economy <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lack-of-child-care-costs-economy-122-billion-dollars-parents-businesses-taxpayers-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">loses an estimated $122 billion a year</a></span> when parents leave work or reduce their hours in order to stay home with young children, a February study from <a href="https://strongnation.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/1598/05d917e2-9618-4648-a0ee-1b35d17e2a4d.pdf?1674854626&amp;inline;%20filename=%22%24122%20Billion:%20The%20Growing,%20Annual%20Cost%20of%20the%20Infant-Toddler%20Child%20Care%20Crisis.pdf%22" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ReadyNation</a> found. </p><p>Inflation has driven up child care costs, while a loss in federal funding last month is also taking a toll. The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) directed nearly $40 billion to child care centers nationwide to help them stabilize their business during the pandemic while keeping prices lower for parents. But <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/child-care-cliff-federal-funding-arpa-expiration-impact/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">those funds expired on September 30</a></span>. </p><figure><div>

              </figcaption></figure><p>As a result, the cost of child care services are set to rise even higher, experts say, leading the country toward what they call a <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/child-care-cliff-federal-funding-arpa-expiration-impact/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">&#34;child care cliff.&#34;</a></span>  Meanwhile, the roughly two-thirds of families who need child care already dedicate more than 20% of their annual household income toward paying for it, according to a Care.com.</p><p>&#34;With child care costs set to rise substantially with government funding disappearing, a lot of people are having to look and say &#39;Can we afford this higher cost of child care,&#39;&#34; Betsey Stevenson, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/how-child-care-disruptions-threaten-economy-women/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">told</a> CBS News last month. &#34;Child care centers are wondering if they can get in enough revenue to keep their doors open when they&#39;re losing access to federal funds.&#34;</p>

    
    

<p>Democratic lawmakers in Washington are hoping to restore some of the lost ARPA funds under new legislation <a href="https://www.murray.senate.gov/murray-sanders-clark-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-extend-vital-child-care-funding-and-save-millions-of-families-child-care-spots-as-funding-cliff-looms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">introduced</a> last month called the Child Care Stabilization Act (CCSA). The measure would allocate $16 billion in mandatory funding to child care centers each year for the next five years, among other things. </p><p>Democrats behind the bill point to a June <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a> from The Century Foundation, a progressive public policy group, that estimated households could lose $9 billion every year in earnings because they would have to leave work or reduce their hours in order to look after their children. </p><p>Still, the bill faces a tough road in Congress, with Republicans opposing the legislation. </p>
