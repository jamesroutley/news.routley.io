                                                    No. Apple Vision Pro was specifically designed to be used without glasses. If you wear glasses for vision correction, you may need to purchase ZEISS Optical Inserts. They magnetically attach to Apple Vision Pro to provide precise viewing for those who need glasses or certain contacts.

                                                    When you order Apple Vision Pro, we’ll ask you a series of vision questions. Your answers will determine whether or not you need optical inserts. Generally speaking, if you don’t wear any vision correction options, you likely won’t need ZEISS Optical Inserts. The same is true if you wear soft contact lenses to correct your distance vision since Apple Vision Pro works well with most soft contact lenses.

                                                    Once we determine that you need ZEISS Optical Inserts, you can complete your purchase and upload your prescription to ZEISS. If you need more time, we’ll also send you an email so you can upload your prescription later.

                                                    Yes. That person may need a different head band or Light Seal size for the best experience with Apple Vision Pro.

                                                    <p>Apple Vision Pro is great for travel and when U.S. customers travel abroad, the experience will remain consistent. That means all of their apps and content will remain accessible while traveling, so they can use apps and enjoy music, TV, and movies.</p>
<p>On the airplane, customers can turn on Travel Mode which adapts Apple Vision Pro to the unique motion of commercial air travel to give you the best experience. They can dial in an Environment, wear AirPods Pro (2nd generation), and sit back to enjoy a movie while seats and sounds around them disappear.</p>
