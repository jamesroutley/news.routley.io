  <h4>Pricing</h4>

  

  <p>
    This model is priced by how many images are generated.

    <p><strong>FLUX1.1 [pro]</strong> provides six times faster generation than its predecessor <a href="https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-pro" rel="nofollow">FLUX.1 [pro]</a> while also improving image quality, prompt adherence, and diversity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Superior Speed and Efficiency: Faster generation times and reduced latency, enabling more efficient workflows. FLUX1.1 [pro] provides an ideal tradeoff between image quality and inference speed.</li>
<li>Improved Performance: FLUX1.1 [pro] has been introduced and tested under the codename “blueberry” into the <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-image/arena" rel="nofollow">Artificial Analysis image arena</a>, a popular benchmark for text-to-image models. It surpasses all other models on the leaderboard, achieving the highest overall Elo score.</li>
</ul>
<p>All public FLUX.1 models are based on a hybrid architecture of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206" rel="nofollow">multimodal</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442" rel="nofollow">parallel diffusion transformer</a> blocks and scaled to 12B parameters. We improve over previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by building on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747" rel="nofollow">flow matching</a>, a general and conceptually simple method for training generative models, which includes diffusion as a special case. In addition, we increase model performance and improve hardware efficiency by incorporating <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864" rel="nofollow">rotary positional embeddings</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442" rel="nofollow">parallel attention layers</a>.</p>

<p>By using FLUX.1 [pro] through Replicate you agree to the <a href="https://docs.bfl.ml/agreement/" rel="nofollow">Black Forest Labs API agreement</a> and the <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/terms-of-service/" rel="nofollow">Black Forest Labs Terms of Service</a>.</p>
