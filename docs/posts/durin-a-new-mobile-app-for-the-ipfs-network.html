It also serves as a sandbox for the Browsers &amp; Platforms team to experiment with IPFS in a mobile environment.</p> <h2 id="background"><a href="#background">#</a> Background</h2> <p>To date, it&#39;s been difficult to access, upload, and share IPFS content using a mobile device. This is for a number of reasons, one of which is that <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/kubo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubo<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>(the initial implementation of the protocol) was simply not built with mobile in mind. The IPFS approach to P2P for many years was about running servers, but <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-03-implementation-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that is changing<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>. In the meantime, we wanted to provide a quick and easy way for users to access basic IPFS features on mobile and set up a testing ground for future explorations.</p> <h2 id="accessing-ipfs-content"><a href="#accessing-ipfs-content">#</a> Accessing IPFS Content</h2> <p>The transport-agnostic nature of IPFS content addresses means there are many ways to find and retrieve content on the IPFS public network. On a mobile device, the best balance of decentralization and device performance is to align with the network model of the device OS - transient connectivity.</p> <p>We do this in Durin by connecting to the IPFS network via multiple HTTP gateways. On app launch, Durin pings a list of public gateways, and determines which route is the most reliable and fastest way to access the network. This approach is functional but not optimal. We&#39;re working on specifications for multi-gateway connectivity patterns which balance a number of factors - such as verifiability guarantees, reader privacy, and not overloading gateways.</p> </div> <!----></div></div>
