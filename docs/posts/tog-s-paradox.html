	<p><em>Tog’s Paradox</em> (also known as <em>The Complexity Paradox</em> or <em>Tog’s Complexity
Paradox</em>) is an observation that products aiming to simplify a task for users tend to
inspire new, more complex tasks. It’s one of the key reasons for the
symptom of requirements changing after delivery in enterprise software
products, and for feature creep in consumer products. Tog’s Paradox also
explains why it’s futile to try to completely nail down requirements for a
software product, as the product itself will have an impact on the users,
causing them to demand new functions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[when] we reduce the complexity people experience in a given task, people will take on a more challenging task.</p>

<h2 id="loophole-in-teslers-law">Loophole in Tesler’s law</h2>

<p>Bruce Tognazzini formulated the paradox as a loophole in Tesler’s Law, which
states that inherent complexity in a user task does not change (but it can be
shifted from a user to an application or the other way around). Tognazzini
suggested instead that the task complexity does not stay the same, but increases.</p>

<p>The argument follows Tognazzini’s previous observation, called <em>Tog’s Law of
Commuting</em> (published in the 1995 book <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://amzn.to/3YzNnjT">Tog on Software Design</a>),
which suggests that users have a specific amount of time to complete a task,
and if they can finish the work sooner, they will take on more work to fill the
available time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People will strive to experience an equal or increasing level of complexity in their lives no matter what is done to reduce it.</p>

  <p>– Bruce Tognazzini, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.asktog.com/columns/011complexity.html">The Complexity Paradox</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In spirit, Tog’s Paradox is similar to Jevon’s Paradox (which loosely states
that technological advances which improve the efficiency of using a resource
tend to lead to increased demand) and Parkinson’s law (which states that work
expands so to fill the time available for its completion).</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-togs-paradox">Examples of Tog’s Paradox</h2>

<p>Tog’s Paradox is highly visible in enterprise software development, where
attempts to streamline workflows often lead to more complex requirements over
time. For instance, a CRM system designed to automate customer interactions
might initially focus on basic functions like managing contacts and tracking
communication history. Once users experience the efficiency gains from these
core features, they begin requesting more sophisticated tools—such as
integrations with other software, advanced reporting, or analytics to
further optimize their work. Each new feature brings added complexity to the
system, requiring not only more robust infrastructure but also additional
training and support. This mirrors Tognazzini’s idea that making tasks more
efficient encourages the demand for additional use cases, driving the
complexity of the software.</p>

<p>Tog’s observation is also evident when software increases user productivity but
leads to expanded scope in responsibilities. Consider an HR platform that
automates payroll and performance management, freeing up HR staff from routine
tasks. HR teams will need to justify what they do the rest of the time, and may
use this newfound capacity to take on more strategic roles—such as employee
engagement or talent development initiatives—which eventually demands
additional software functionalities. The software that initially saved time
ends up accommodating these new, more complex tasks, reinforcing the idea that
saved time often gets filled with more work, creating an ongoing cycle of
increasing complexity. This phenomenon is common in enterprise software, where
solving one problem often leads to the creation of new, more intricate
challenges.</p>

<p>The law also plays out in consumer applications. Social media platforms like
Instagram or Twitter/X are another clear example. Initially designed to provide
simple ways to share photos or short messages, these platforms quickly expanded
as users sought additional capabilities, such as live streaming, integrated
shopping, or augmented reality filters. Each of these features added new layers
of complexity to the app, requiring more sophisticated algorithms, larger
databases, and increased development efforts. What began as a relatively
straightforward tool for sharing personal content has transformed into a
multi-faceted platform requiring constant updates to handle new features and
growing user expectations. Tog’s Paradox is evident here, as simplifying one
aspect of the communication and sharing often drives demand for other, more
complex ways of sharing content.</p>

<h2 id="togs-paradox-explains-why-requirements-always-change">Tog’s paradox explains why requirements always change</h2>

<p>Tog’s Paradox reveals why attempts to finalize design requirements are often doomed to fail. The moment a product begins to
solve its users’ core problems efficiently, it sparks a natural progression of
second-order effects. As users save time and effort, they inevitably find new,
more complex tasks to address, leading to feature requests that expand the
scope far beyond what was initially anticipated. This cycle shows that the
product itself actively influences users’ expectations and demands, making it
nearly impossible to fully define design requirements upfront.</p>

<p>This evolving complexity highlights the futility of attempting to lock down
requirements before the product is deployed. No matter how thorough the initial
planning, the reality is that users’ experiences with the product will inspire
new use cases and deeper needs. The product’s initial efficiency gains create a
feedback loop, where users seek more capabilities and push for new features and
workflows. These second-order effects suggest that software development must
embrace flexibility and continuous iteration.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Tog’s Paradox underscores that requirements gathering and user
research are not one-time events, but part of an ongoing process. Attempting to
fully specify requirements beforehand fails to account for how the product
itself will influence user behavior and expectations. To truly meet users’
needs, products must be built with the understanding that the needs will change
due to user interactions with those same products, the complexity will grow, and user
demands will evolve, often in unpredictable ways. Recognizing this dynamic is
key to building successful products that remain responsive and relevant over
time.</p>

<p>Tog’s Paradox has significant implications for user experience design,
particularly in how complexity impacts usability and user satisfaction over
time. As products evolve and add features in response to user demands, the
original simplicity and ease of use can degrade, leading to a more complex and
sometimes overwhelming interface. This presents a core UX challenge: balancing
the need for added functionality with maintaining an intuitive and accessible
user experience.</p>
