                <p>The Perl and Raku Foundation (TPRF) is delighted to announce a generous €10,000
donation from <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH</a>, supporting the critical Perl 5
Core Maintenance Fund. Corporate partnerships play a critical role in
enabling TPRF to fulfill its mission.</p>
<h2 id="a-partner-in-open-source">A Partner in Open Source</h2>
<p>Proxmox Virtual Environment is a complete, open-source server management
platform for enterprise virtualization. It tightly integrates the KVM
hypervisor and Linux Containers (LXC), software-defined storage and networking
functionality, on a single platform.</p>
<p>Proxmox is an example of an open source company that has built enterprise-grade
virtualization technology while maintaining transparency, community engagement,
and accessibility as core principles.</p>
<h2 id="sustaining-a-foundation-of-modern-computing">Sustaining a Foundation of Modern Computing</h2>
<p>The Perl programming language remains a cornerstone of system administration,
bioinformatics, web development, and countless other critical applications
across industries. However, the ongoing maintenance and development of Perl’s
core requires dedicated funding to ensure continued stability, security updates,
and feature enhancements.</p>
<p>TPRF is dedicated to the advancement of the Perl and Raku programming
languages, through open discussion, collaboration, design, and code. This
mission extends beyond language development to encompass community building,
educational initiatives, and the crucial task of maintaining the robust
infrastructure that millions of applications depend upon.</p>
<h2 id="the-critical-nature-of-core-maintenance">The Critical Nature of Core Maintenance</h2>
<p>Without sustained funding for core maintenance work, even the most established
programming languages risk stagnation or security vulnerabilities. The Perl 5
Core Maintenance Fund specifically addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Updates</strong>: Ensuring timely patches for discovered vulnerabilities</li>
<li><strong>Performance Optimizations</strong>: Maintaining competitive execution speeds</li>
<li><strong>Platform Compatibility</strong>: Supporting new operating systems and architectures</li>
<li><strong>Bug Resolution</strong>: Addressing issues reported by the global Perl community</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Maintenance</strong>: Keeping comprehensive guides current and
accessible</li>
</ul>
<p>Proxmox’s contribution directly enables this essential work to continue
uninterrupted, demonstrating a forward-thinking approach to technology
stewardship.</p>

<p>This donation reflects a broader understanding within the technology industry
that sustainable open source ecosystems require active investment from
organizations that benefit from these tools. As companies increasingly seek
cost-effective alternatives to proprietary solutions, the importance of
maintaining robust open source alternatives becomes paramount.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>By investing in Perl’s continued development, Proxmox contributes to a
programming language ecosystem that serves developers, system administrators,
and organizations worldwide.</p>
<p>This partnership comes at a crucial time for TPRF. Community support from
sponsors like Proxmox enables the foundation to maintain its diverse portfolio
of community-serving initiatives.</p>
