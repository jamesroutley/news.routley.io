LONDON: Eleven members of the US Congress have written to PayPal telling the digital payment platform to end its ban on Palestinians using its services in the Occupied Territories. </p>
<p>
PayPal, the letter said, is denying “equal access to the digital economy” by doing so, while placing no restrictions on its use by Israeli settlers.</p>
<p>
The letter, addressed to CEO Dan Schulman ahead PayPal’s annual shareholder meeting on May 24, said: “We have significant concerns that, because PayPal does provide services to Israeli citizens in illegal settlements across the West Bank, but does not provide services to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, PayPal’s current operating status may be infringing upon the rights of Palestinians.</p>
<p>
“As one of the world’s most recognized payment platforms, PayPal has a responsibility to ensure its services and operations are provided in a non-discriminatory manner.”</p>
<p>
The letter is signed by Mark Pocan, Earl Blumenauer, Betty McCollum, Rashida Tlaib and Greg Casar, among others.</p>
<p>
PayPal has previously said its ban is due to the Occupied Territories being a “high risk” environment.</p>
<p>
But as well as extending services to Israeli settlers in the Occupied Territories, PayPal currently operates in war zones including Somalia and Yemen. </p>
<p>
Harrington Investments, an investment firm that previously pushed divestment from apartheid South Africa, proposed a motion at the meeting for PayPal to “establish a policy that ensures that people in conflict zones, such as in Palestine, do not suffer discriminatory exclusion from the company’s financial services,” or “provide an evaluation of the economic impact the policy of exclusion has on the affected populations as well as the company’s finances, operations and reputation.”</p>
<p>
Sam Bahour, a Palestinian-American businessman, told shareholders that his companies cannot use PayPal despite having worked with the US and UK governments, as well as across Europe.</p>
<p>
“Palestine has a thriving banking sector and all Palestinian banks have corresponding US banks that make money transfers daily. The US Treasury Department is also active in Palestine and has praised the level of Palestinian banking compliance,” a transcript of his planned remarks seen by The Guardian said.</p>
<p>
PayPal partnered with the pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League in 2021 to investigate “hate group funding.”</p>
<p>
The ADL has been criticized by human rights groups for conflating support for Palestinian human rights with antisemitism.</p>

RIYADH: Oil prices fell on Thursday after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak played down the prospect of further production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, at its meeting next week.</p>
<p>
Brent crude futures were down $1.07, or 1.37 percent, to $77.29 a barrel at 01:30 p.m., while US West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.14, or 0.7 percent, to $73.20.</p>
<p>
On Thursday, Novak said he expected no new steps from the OPEC+ oil producers at its meeting in Vienna on June 4, Russian media reported.</p>
<p>
Novak also said that high US interest rates and a slower-than-expected Chinese economic recovery kept oil prices from rising further.</p>
<p>
Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced cuts of more than 1 million barrels per day in April after crude prices in March fell toward $70 a barrel, the lowest in 15 months.</p>
<p>
Novak said he expected Brent LCOc1 price to be above $80 a barrel by the end of the year, the state-owned news agency RIA reported. He said current prices between $75 and $76 reflected the market’s assessment of the global macroeconomic situation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kashagan oilfield output falls </strong></p>
<p>
Oil output at Kazakhstan’s giant Kashagan oilfield fell this month after its operator shut two offshore injection wells on May 20 following the detection of sour gas during routine sampling, the company said on Thursday.</p>
<p>
The North Caspian Operating Co. closed the wells to conduct an integrity test and further the survey program.</p>
<p>
“Oil production (was) reduced during this testing period,” NCOC told Reuters.</p>
<p>
Kashagan typically produces about 300,000 bpd.</p>
<p>
Kazakhstan’s total daily oil and gas condensate output between May 21 and 24 averaged 240,525 tons per day, down from 252,133 tons per day between May 15 and 20, the country’s Oil and Gas Information and Analysis Service said.</p>
<p>
NCOC is a consortium that includes Shell, Eni, TotalEnergies and Exxon Mobil Corp. as well as companies from Kazakhstan, China and Japan.</p>
<p>
<strong>Norway oil companies raise investment forecast</strong></p>
<p>
Norwegian oil and gas companies have increased their investment forecasts for 2023, partly due to cost inflation, data from the country’s national statistics office showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>
The country’s biggest business sector now expects to invest 197.8 billion Norwegian crowns in 2023, up from a forecast of 187.8 billion Norwegian crowns made in February, said the agency.</p>

RIYADH: The Saudi capital is set to witness a flurry of investments in the second quarter of 2023 as Riyadh municipality has launched more than 40 initiatives for investors, the Saudi Press Agency reported.</p>
<p>
The municipality is offering new investment opportunities in different sectors such as industries and sports.</p>
<p>
Its secretariat stated the opportunities are aimed at attracting investors, companies, entrepreneurs, and owners of innovative projects.</p>
<p>
These initiatives are part of the municipality’s efforts to encourage the private sector to contribute to the city’s development and improve the quality of services provided to the citizens, it added.</p>
<p>
These opportunities will enable the private sector to participate in the economic development of Riyadh, by improving urban living and contributing to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030.</p>
<p>
Three of these investment opportunities cover Mahdia, Al-Munsiyah, and Al-Rabie districts.</p>
<p>
Additionally, there are three additional opportunities in the residential and commercial sectors. The projects, which have durations of 15 to 25 years, cover Riyadh’s Cordoba, Casablanca, and Deira neighborhoods.</p>
<p>
In April 2023, Remat Al-Riyadh Development Co., the development arm of the municipality, announced the launch of investment opportunities in outdoor advertising in the city.</p>
<p>
These opportunities include new advertising formats such as ads on building fronts, white lands, and public taxis and buses.</p>
<p>
The development company, which was launched last year, aims to enhance the municipality’s operational tasks in the region, allowing the private sector to undertake and develop initiatives.</p>

RIYADH: A new wave of health projects in Saudi Arabia is on track after 200 local and international firms raced to submit their expressions of interest.</p>
<p>
The developments include medical rehabilitation, long-stay and home-care projects in Riyadh and the Eastern Province, which were announced by the Ministry of Health in cooperation with the National Center for Privatization in March.</p>
<p>
The three projects received a combined 424 expressions of interest, the Saudi Press Agency reported.</p>
<p>
The first included the establishment of 200 long-stay hospital beds and nursing care centers with 100 beds.</p>
<p>
As many as 139 firms from 16 countries submitted expressions of interest for handling the project, including companies from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, the US, Canada and the UK.</p>
<p>
Firms from Portugal, Italy and Turkey also sent in applications, as did companies from India, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Australia.</p>
<p>
The second project involves 150 medical rehabilitation hospital beds and 120,000 treatment sessions for outpatients.</p>
<p>
A total of 131 companies from 17 countries expressed a desire to obtain this project.</p>
<p>
The firms awarded the first two projects will be responsible for their design, development, financing, maintenance and operation.</p>
<p>
The third project revolves around home healthcare and received applications from 154 companies across 14 countries. </p>
<p>
The firm awarded this project will be held accountable for providing medical services to an estimated 5,000 active patients.</p>
<p>
The projects align with the partnership model between the public and private sectors to improve and further elevate the quality of service provided to beneficiaries.</p>
<p>
The large turnout of local and international investment for these projects affirms the Kingdom’s attractive environment.</p>
<p>
It also cements the role played by the NCP in supporting partnerships between the public and private sectors to create fitting opportunities for local and global investment.</p>

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s total merchandise exports rose 4.4 percent in March to SR106.1 billion ($28.29 billion), compared to SR101.1 billion in the previous month, according to the latest report released by the Kingdom’s General Authority for Statistics.</p>
<p>
The authority, however, noted that the Kingdom’s overall merchandise exports fell 25.3 percent year-on-year in March, as the value of exports amounted to SR142 million in the same month of 2022.</p>
<p>
GASTAT also pointed out that this year-on-year fall in exports was primarily driven by a decrease in oil shipments which fell 26.5 percent in March to SR83.1 billion.</p>
<p>
According to the report, the share of oil in total exports decreased from 79.6 percent in March 2022 to 78.3 percent in March 2023.</p>
<p>
Earlier in May, a report released by the Joint Organizations Data Initiative suggested that Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports increased by 68,000 barrels per day to 7.52 million bpd in March from 7.45 mbpd in February.</p>
<p>
It further noted that Saudi Arabia’s non-oil exports, including re-exports, fell by 21 percent year-on-year in March to SR23 billion, while on a month-on-month basis, it rose by SR1.5 billion or 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>
Saudi Arabia’s merchandise imports rose by 9.8 percent in March 2023 to SR61.8 billion, compared to SR56.3 billion in the same month of the previous year. On a month-on-month basis, the Kingdom’s imports rose by SR4.9 billion, or 8.5 percent.</p>
<p>
The GASTAT report revealed that the most imported merchandise in March 2023 was chemical and allied products, accounting for 32.3 percent of total non-oil imports.</p>
<p>
China was the major merchandise trading partner of Saudi Arabia in March, as exports to the Asian giant amounted to SR18.2 billion or 17.1 percent of the total.</p>
<p>
China was closely followed by Japan and India with SR10 billion and SR9.2 billion of the total exports, respectively.</p>
<p>
As for Saudi imports, China also took the lead and was responsible for 19 percent of the total during that period, reaching SR11.7 billion in March, followed by the US and the UAE, with imports valued at SR5.4 billion and SR3.8 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>
The report added that the Jeddah Islamic Port topped the list of ports through which goods reached the Kingdom in March at a value of SR16.4 billion, accounting for 26.5 percent of the total imports.</p>
