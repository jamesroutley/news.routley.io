<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a> is the best and most balanced series to have ever aired on television. Ok, so some of you who have followed me for a very long time are thinking, “He’s making the same mistake he did on <a href="https://macmanx.com/2016/12/29/reviving-splash-panel-reviews/">Splash Panel</a>, reviewing the best too early on!” and you’re right. I guess I just find it hard to move forward with my mind constantly drafting the review of my favorite, so it’s time to get this out there.</p>



<p>Beginning in 1997, Stargate SG-1 was more or less a sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(film)">1994’s original Stargate film</a> (<a href="https://macmanx.com/2020/05/07/rewatch-stargate/">read the Rewatch review here</a>). There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(film)#Differences_from_the_series">some notable small differences</a> for whatever reason, but the point is, if you’re a fan of the original movie, there’s no reason you wouldn’t be a fan of this series too. It expanded the mythos, characters, and the overall Stargate universe for 10 whole seasons, 2 straight-to-DVD films, and 2 successful spin-offs. If you were sad that there was never a film sequel to Stargate, this is far better than you could have ever hoped for.</p>



<p>The series follows <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_J._O%27Neill">Colonel Jack O’Neill</a> and <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Daniel_Jackson">Doctor Daniel Jackson</a> from the original film, joined by new characters <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Samantha_Carter">Captain Samantha Carter</a> and <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Teal%27c_of_Chulak">Teal’c</a>. The series kicks off quickly when we learn that <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Ra">Ra</a> of the original film was not the only alien posing as a god in our galaxy. In fact, his entire race, the <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Goa%27uld">Goa’uld</a>, make quite the habit of it. <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Stargate_Command">Stargate Command</a> quickly assembles several <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/SG_team">SG teams</a> to both explore our galaxy’s vast <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Stargate_Network">Stargate network</a>, and to take down these <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/System_Lord">false gods</a> whenever they can. Our main cast makes up SG-1, in particular Teal’c joins during <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Children_of_the_Gods">the first episode</a>. Cementing the show’s premise, he’s a former <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Jaffa">Jaffa</a> <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/First_Prime">First Prime </a>of <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Apophis">Apophis</a> (like a second-in-command), who turns on his master when he realizes that SG-1 may be the first who can convince everyone that the Goa’uld who have dominated the galaxy are nothing more than false gods.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The cast takes about a season to really mesh together, but that may very well be a story element too, as Carter and Teal’c really haven’t worked with O’Neill and Jackson before, and O’Neill and Jackson weren’t exactly the best of friends either. There really isn’t one stand-out actor here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dean_Anderson">Richard Dean Anderson</a> as O’Neill, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shanks">Michael Shanks</a> as Jackson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Tapping">Amanda Tapping</a> as Carter, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Judge">Christopher Judge</a> as Teal’c are all outstanding and bring constantly believable depth and emotion to their characters.</p>



<p>Where Stargate SG-1 shines for all 10 seasons is its balance, and I really have never seen a show balanced this well since. It manages to maintain long over-arching plots with constantly returning enemies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Simon">Cliff Simon</a> as <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Ba%27al">Ba’al</a> is a personal favorite) alongside fun stand-alone episodes with relative ease, and much of that is due to the engaging characters. Like a good book series, you aren’t watching the next episode based on its synopsis, you’re watching to see what these characters do next. The world that the Stargate film crafted seemingly never stops growing, and you will easily find yourself watching all of it. There is no “best episode” in this case, it’s simply a wonderfully engaging experience.</p>



<p>As with any long-running series, there are cast changes, but surprisingly not many for a series of this length. Shanks left the show after season 5, replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corin_Nemec">Corin Nemic</a> as <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Jonas_Quinn">Jonas Quinn</a>, who was then replaced by Shanks when he returned in season 7.</p>

<p>Anderson retired after season 9, replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Browder">Ben Browder</a> as <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Cameron_Mitchell">Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell</a> for the final season. And if you thought Browder wasn’t enough to bring back the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farscape">Farscape</a> nostalgia, don’t worry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Black">Claudia Black</a> also joins the team in the final season as maybe-reformed and possibly ex-thief <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Vala_Mal_Doran">Vala Mal Doran</a>. The incredibly low cast turnover really helps you engage with the characters for the entire length of the series.</p>

<p>Besides running for 10 seasons, Stargate SG-1 was followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate:_The_Ark_of_Truth">Stargate: The Ark of Truth</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate:_Continuum">Stargate: Continuum</a>, both straight-to-DVD films which wrapped up the show’s remaining plots. Two successful spin-offs followed the show, which I’ll get around to reviewing eventually. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a> (<a href="https://macmanx.com/2019/08/06/rewatch-stargate-atlantis/">read the Rewatch review here</a>) began in 2004 during Stargate SG-1’s 8th season, running for 5 seasons, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Universe">Stargate Universe</a> (<a href="https://macmanx.com/2019/10/29/rewatch-stargate-universe/">read the Rewatch review here</a>) followed in 2009 for 2 seasons. 2002’s animated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Infinity">Stargate Infinity</a> is loosely considered a spin-off and fun if you have kids to watch it with. 2018’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Origins">Stargate Origins</a> completely ignores any continuity established by any of the television shows and is actually pretty terrible.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07KLG1WZ6/">stream Stargate SG-1 for free on Amazon Video</a> if you’re an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Amazon Prime</a> subscriber or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/stargate-sg-1-the-complete-series/id1341967870">buy the complete series on iTunes</a> for just $99.99. If you love military science fiction, if you love long-running and engaging characters, or even if you just love the original Stargate film, watch at least two episodes of Stargate SG-1, and I guarantee you’ll be sufficiently locked in for the rest of it.</p>
