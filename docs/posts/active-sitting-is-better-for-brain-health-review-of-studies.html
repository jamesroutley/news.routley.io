(<a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGiNppUFiI/">Drs Producoes/Getty Images/Canva</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Across numerous studies, Gardiner and colleagues found that active sitting activities, like reading, playing card games, and using a computer, showed &#34;overwhelmingly positive associations with cognitive health, enhancing cognitive functions such as executive function, situational memory, and working memory.&#34;</p><p>Meanwhile, passive sitting was most consistently associated with negative cognitive outcomes, including increased <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk">risk of dementia</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert&#39;s Casting Call" width="642" height="272" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"/></a></p><p>The effect sizes were small but significant. The study authors hope their results will help inform future health research and more nuanced health guidance.</p><p>For example, the researchers suggest guidelines should recognize the difference between passively watching TV and actively using a computer, and encourage people to take <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-snacks-throughout-your-day-have-real-health-benefits-study-finds">short breaks</a> to stimulate their brains and move.</p><p>Their review focused on studies of typical sedentary activities in natural settings, rather than structured programs designed to boost brain function, making it relevant to people&#39;s everyday lives.</p><p>&#34;Health advice could shift from simply saying &#39;sit less&#39; to encouraging more mentally engaging activities while sitting,&#34; <a href="https://news.uq.edu.au/2026-01-not-all-sitting-same-when-it-comes-brain-health">argues</a> Gardiner.</p><p>&#34;This could help people make easy, realistic changes that support long‑term brain health and potentially reduce dementia risk.&#34;</p><p>The study was published in the <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251394751">Journal of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease</a></em>.</p>
