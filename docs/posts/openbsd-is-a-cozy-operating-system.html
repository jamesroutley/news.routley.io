<p>With the recent release of OpenBSD 7.5, I decided to run through my <a href="https://git.btxx.org/open-suck/about/">personal OpenBSD &#34;installer&#34;</a> for laptop/desktop devices. The project is built off of the <code>dwm</code> tiling window manager and only installs a few basic packages. The last time I updated it was with the release of 7.3, so it&#39;s been due for an minor rework.</p>

<p>While making these minor changes, I remembered how incredibly easy the entire install process for OpenBSD is and how <em>cozy</em> the entire operating system feels. All the core systems just work out the box. Yes, you need to &#34;patch&#34; in WiFi with a firmware update, so you&#39;ll need an Ethernet connection during the initial setup. Yes, the default desktop environment is not intuitive or ideal for newcomers.</p>

<p>But the positives heavily outweigh the negatives (in my opinion):</p>

<ul>
<li>Incredibly secure operating system (No <code>xz</code> drama here...)</li>
<li>Detailed documentation. Probably one of the best of any OS</li>
<li>Much smaller codebase and small core team</li>
<li><em>Complete</em> operating system (kernel, userland utilities, libraries, applications combined)</li>
</ul>

<p>These points might not seem important to others, but they are to me. Maybe you&#39;re possibly interested in checking it out yourself? If you are, then read on...</p>

<h2 id="tryityourself">Try it Yourself!</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve tried my best to write up a simplified, noob-friendly guide on both setting up the core OpenBSD system, along with installing a simple <code>dwm</code> based desktop environment. These are both focused on personal devices (laptops/computers), so if you&#39;re looking for server-specific setups you won&#39;t find that here!</p>

<p>You can find both of those wiki-pages below:</p>
