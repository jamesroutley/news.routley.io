      <p>I recently moved to NYC since I was accepted by the <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, and today was my first day at their hub.</p>

<p>The day started by nerding out on the retro computers, hardware labs, and 3d printers they have; followed by the first breakfast bagel of my life. I feel incredibly fortunate to be surrounded out by so many talented programmers and am looking forward to the next three months with my new friends!</p>

<p>As part of our first day, we had a workshop about pair programming. For those who don’t know, pair programming involves two people working together on one computer, helping accomplish a specified programming goal and sharing ideas and approaches with each other. It’s one of the best ways to connect with fellow programmers, you learn a lot about each other.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/durumu">Presley</a> and I were paired together and tasked to build a “Mastermind” game in an hour using Python. Mastermind is basically Wordle’s predecessor but uses colors instead of letters. I don’t know idomatic Python, but fortunately Presley is extremely knowledgeable so we were a quite capable team.</p>

<p>We built out a basic TUI Mastermind implementation in around 45 minutes. We originally planned to convert it to a full GUI at the end, but we were pragmatic and realized that we weren’t going to be able to do that in the remaining time.</p>

<p>Instead, we decided to go in a slightly different direction: <strong>why not emojis?</strong></p>

<p>We finalized our entire theme around the concept of emojis, making the final version called “Emoji Mastermind”. Instead of colors, you use emojis. Instead of ‘pegs’, you get hearts. A fun twist on the classic game. We demonstrated to our peers to much applause!</p>
