        <p>I learned this the hard way with non-stick pans: they&#39;re a rip off.  Every year
or two I would have to throw away my non-stick pans and buy new ones.  They
can&#39;t get too hot because it&#39;ll melt the coating, you have to use soft plastic
utensils or else it&#39;ll scratch the coating, and Teflon in particular is
terrible for the environment.</p>
<p>At one point I thought it was just because I was buying cheap Teflon pans, but
even after spending $150+ on a all-clad non-stick pan, which died after a year
or so of heavy use, I realized this was not the way.</p>
<p>Then I bought two cast iron skillets (10in, 12in).  What can I say other than
it&#39;s a game changer and I&#39;m never going back to non-stick.  We haven&#39;t owned a
non-stick pan in 2+ years.</p>
<p>Here are some features:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can scrape it -- hard -- with metal utensils</li>
<li>They are easy to clean (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cleaner-Stainless-Chainmail-Scrubber-Pre-Seasoned/dp/B07QGC4X4Y/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3UMSG67KJVB07&amp;keywords=cast+iron+skillet+cleaner&amp;qid=1660250199&amp;sprefix=cast+iron+skillet+cleaner%2Caps%2C104&amp;sr=8-7" rel="nofollow">with one of
these</a>)</li>
<li>They will outlive us</li>
<li>Once seasoned they can cook delicate items like eggs and fish</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to use metal utensils on a skillet is so nice.  I can really scrape
food off the pan without worrying about chipping the paint.</p>
<p>The litmus test for skillets is: can I make an egg over-easy with it?  Now that
my cast iron skillet is properly seasoned, cooking eggs, fish, anything
delicate is painless.  We&#39;ve been told a lie our entire lives and I&#39;m here to
set the record straight.  Cast iron is the way.</p>
<p>It&#39;s wild to me that I never had a cast iron skillet growing up.  I blame my
parents for not realizing how perfect cast iron is for the home cook.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a list of myths about cast iron skillets:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can&#39;t use dish soap on them because it&#39;ll destroy the seasoning</li>
<li>You can&#39;t cook with acidic foods (e.g. tomatoes) because it&#39;ll destroy the
seasoning</li>
<li>Seasoning a pan is just wiping the pan with oil</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all demonstrably false.  Once a pan is seasoned, there&#39;s not much you
can do to mess up the seasoning -- in my experience.  Furthermore, seasoning a
pan essentially is a polymerization process that bakes the oil into the pan.
So all you have to do is cook oil with it at  high enough temperatures to cause
that reaction.</p>

Amazon</a></p>
<p>For $30 you can have a pan that will never go bad, you can scratch it with
metal utensils, and it will outlive you.</p>
