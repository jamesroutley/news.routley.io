    <h1>Integrating with Fastmail</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
	
	
<p>Welcome, developers! Interested in getting started writing integrations for
your Fastmail account? You&#39;ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Fastmail currently offers a JMAP (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8620.html">RFC8620</a>) API for <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8621.html">accessing, managing and sending mail</a>, and for <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/developer/maskedemail/">managing your masked email addresses</a>. We hope to expand our API access to scopes over time.</p>
<a href="https://jmap.io/crash-course.html">
    <p><b>JMAP Crash Course</b></p>
    <p>Want to learn more about JMAP, the modern standard powering Fastmail?
    Check out our quick guide to how it works.</p>
</a>
<p>You need two things to get started with our API:</p>
<ol>
<li>The JMAP Session Resource, which can be found at can be found at <code>https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/session</code>. This will give you all the other endpoints you need; for example, to make API requests or to upload files. For more information, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8620.html#section-2">see the specification</a>. We also support DNS autodiscovery as defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8620.html">the JMAP standard.</a></li>
<li>A way to authenticate your requests.</li>
</ol>
<p>All Fastmail API requests must be authenticated with a bearer token. This is a shared secret that provides access to a limited set of data within a particular user&#39;s account. Bearer tokens should be treated as a type of password and stored accordingly. These should be created with as little access to an account possible: only create a token with the scopes you need for your application. If you do not need to modify data, you can create a read-only token.</p>
<p>To authenticate an HTTP request, you add an <code>Authorization</code> header set to <code>Bearer {value}</code>, where <code>{value}</code> is the value of the token. Our APIs are CORS enabled so you can create integrations directly from a web app, as well as from a server or native code.</p>
<p>To get started, you can create a token for your own user in <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/settings/security/tokens">Settings → Password &amp; Security → API tokens</a>. If you would like to share your app more widely, we encourage you to <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/developer/oauth/">implement OAuth</a> to allow your users to easily log in and get a token for your app.</p>
<p>Check out the
<a href="https://github.com/fastmail/JMAP-Samples">JMAP-Samples repository</a> for
illustrative examples of bearer tokens in action in a fair sample of programming
languages.</p>
