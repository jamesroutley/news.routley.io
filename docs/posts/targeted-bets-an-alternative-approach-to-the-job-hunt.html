    <h1>Targeted Bets: An alternative approach to the job hunt</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p><span>January 18, 2026</span></p><p>The tech job market has been tough, leaving many applicants feeling hopeless. I&#39;ve seen this first hand in my conversations with dozens of friends and across more than 100 job interviews. Here is my response to these people: you can drastically increase your odds of getting a job by making targeted bets rather than broadly applying and hoping something sticks.</p><h2>How do I make a targeted bet?</h2><p>A targeted bet begins with focus. Instead of applying broadly, identify 5-10 specific opportunities you genuinely want. In the context of job searching, these are roles where at least one of the following is true:</p><ul><li>You are specifically interested in the job for reasons other than the money. It is unlikely that other applicants want the job as badly as you do.</li><li>You have a unique connection to the company. This usually comes in the form of either knowing, going to the same school as, or even growing up in the same hometown as a current employee.</li></ul><p>Once the list has been narrowed, your goal is to stand out. Here are a few ways to do that:</p><ul><li>Get in contact with current employees at the company. It is important that you send more than one email. I&#39;ve gotten dozens of emails asking for meetings and referrals. The only time I actually respond to these is after the second email.</li><li>Do not ask employees for a referral! Most companies offer referral bonuses, so employees are incentivized to give you one if you can convince them that you will do well in the role.</li><li>If the company is &lt;30 people, reach out to the CEO directly. A candidate who is particularly interested in the mission and bold enough to reach out to the CEO is a signal for a strong employee. Again, send more than one email.</li></ul><h2>Why does this work?</h2><p>By narrowing your opportunities, you end up being able to spend more time on each one. Let&#39;s assume that a targeted bet increases your chances of getting a job from 1% to 10%. The average number of jobs you&#39;d need to apply to before getting one thus jumps from 100 to just 10! Competitive systems reward effort per attempt, not volume.</p><h2>Targeted bets beyond job searches</h2><p>Targeted bets apply to more than just the job search. I recently scored the first apartment I applied to in a highly-competitive San Francisco neighborhood. I was specific in where and what I was looking for, so when the opportunity came up, I was able to devote lots of time and energy into getting it. I applied just 6 hours after the place came on the market. Seeing that there were lots of people at the tour, I sent a follow up email to the leasing agent explaining how I&#39;d always wanted to live in the neighborhood. If I had been worried about the status of my other applications, I may not have had the time to write that follow up email and secure my apartment.</p><h2>The Real Upside</h2><p>The glory in making targeted bets is that you get to spend more time on the things that you really care about. I would advise against mass-applying to those entry-level jobs you don&#39;t really care about and instead start getting in contact with people at your dream job.</p></div></article></div>
