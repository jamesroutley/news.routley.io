<p>Beekeepers say New Zealand needs a new approach to a hive-destroying disease that is leaving those affected out of pocket, uncompensated and devastated.</p>
<p>Honey producer Springbank Honey of North Canterbury was ordered to burn more than 10,000 of its beehives and beekeeping equipment after American Foulbrood (AFB) was identified through spore testing.</p>
<p>AFB is a bacterial disease spread by spores that could be viable for up to 40 years. It is considered one of the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/country/483881/increase-in-disease-for-beehives-concerning-as-more-than-3000-destroyed-in-one-year">most widespread and destructive honey bee brood diseases</a> in the world.</p>
<p>The family-owned honey business, operating near Rangiora in North Canterbury, runs 3000 organic beehives and processes honey too.</p>
<p>Co-owner Steven Brown said burning thousands of beehives over Mother&#39;s Day weekend had left the family &#34;devastated&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;By next year, when we don&#39;t have boxes for our honey crop, we&#39;re probably going to be losing over $5-6 million,&#34; Brown said.</p>
<p>&#34;The loss of the boxes is one thing, but without the boxes for the hives we won&#39;t have a honey crop.&#34;</p>


<p>Brown said it would cost around $2 million to replace it all, made more difficult by the fact that there was no compensation or insurance available for beekeepers.</p>
<p>Burning the hives was more painful when other countries used tools like vaccines, antibiotics and sterilisation - measures prohibited in New Zealand and in some export markets.</p>
<p>&#34;Most farmers vaccinate their cows for diseases every single year, but it&#39;s illegal to vaccinate the hive,&#34; Brown said.</p>
<p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand why we have our heads in the sand and live like it&#39;s 200 years ago without these amazing abilities of giving a vaccine and stopping disease; instead we burn things.&#34;</p>

</div>
<p>The order to destroy the hives by fire came from the levy-run management agency that enforces the national pest management plan rules, including auditing beekeepers, monitoring for the disease and eliminating it.</p>
<p>Brown said the new government needed to &#34;shut down immediately&#34; the outdated pest management plan and the agency.</p>
<p>&#34;The plan was supposed to reduce AFB by 5 percent per year, they haven&#39;t complied with that. It&#39;s gone rampant throughout New Zealand,&#34; he said.</p>
<p>&#34;I want the Biosecurity Act changed, but the one we&#39;re operating under, the pest management plan, the [Biosecurity] Minister needs to stop that immediately.&#34;</p>

<h3>Agency aims for support</h3>
<p>But the management agency&#39;s general manager, Niha Long said it aimed to support beekeepers impacted by the disease.</p>
<p>She acknowledged how &#34;upsetting&#34; it would be for social media users to view the burning beehives - but burning was the only method at hand.</p>
<p>&#34;The only way to destroy the spores is through burning, so we cannot use antibiotics unlike other countries in the world due to market access,&#34; Long said.</p>
<p>She said the agency was not there to make beekeepers&#39; operations harder.</p>
<p>&#34;We acknowledge that it is a significant impact on the beekeeper, but we&#39;re not here - contrary to popular belief - to make a beekeeper&#39;s life difficult,&#34; she said.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re here to work with the beekeeper and that is the nature of the relationship we&#39;ve attempted to have with this beekeeper [Springbank Honey].</p>
<p>&#34;AFB will happen if you&#39;re a beekeeper, at some point in your journey, and getting AFB is not the problem - what can be a problem for us is the beekeepers&#39;s action or inaction after you&#39;ve found it.&#34;</p>

<p>She said the law and the pest management plan put legal obligations on its registered, levy-paying beekeepers.</p>
<p>&#34;It dictates each beekeeper&#39;s responsibility for eliminating AFB, so I&#39;d like to emphasise that that is each beekeeper&#39;s responsibility through a set of legal obligations.&#34;</p>
<p>Long said fewer than eight percent of the country&#39;s 8000 beekeepers were currently affected - and there were 2900 reports of AFB made in the past year to May, down 15 percent on the 3449 reports the year before.</p>


<h3>NZ &#39;pretty much alone&#39;</h3>
<p>NZ Beekeeping Incorporated president Jane Lorimer said New Zealand was &#34;pretty much alone&#34; in the response to burn hives and equipment on positive spore tests.</p>
<p>But she said beekeepers generally still followed the rules.</p>
<p>&#34;Beekeepers have to notify and then destroy hives within seven days after finding the disease - and most beekeepers, including Steve, usually comply with that regulation.</p>
<p>&#34;We&#39;re going to seek some clarification around the Biosecurity Act and the Pest Management plan and how the two legal aspects integrate.&#34;</p>
<p>It was seeking clarification around how the Biosecurity Act and the pest management plans&#39; legal aspects integrated.</p>
<p>She said the government review into the legislation was an opportunity to improve transparency for the sector.</p>
<p>&#34;We hope that the Minister will take into consideration our suggestions [in the review] and make changes accordingly. Part of that is an appeal process as well, there&#39;s nothing within the order in council about appealing what&#39;s happening when a beekeeper&#39;s asked to destroy equipment they&#39;ve found spores in.</p>
<p>&#34;This isn&#39;t the first case where beekeepers had been told to destroy beekeeping equipment that they&#39;d found spores in.&#34;</p>
<p>Lorimer said it was <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/country/509715/beekeepers-deliver-stinging-response-to-apiculture-nz-plan">a difficult time for the industry</a>, and the number of commercial beehives had halved in the past two years.</p>
