    <h1>The benefits of everything being a buffer in Emacs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For today I only have a <em>very</em> short tip – or maybe let’s call it an anecdote. (This is not because I didn’t have time for writing last week. Quite the opposite – I’ve been working very hard on one of the projects I mentioned in my <a href="https://mbork.pl/2023-01-14_My_plans_for_2023">2023 planning post</a>. I think I’ll be able to share some details next week.)</p><p>Anyway, back onto the topic. As all Emacs users probably know, one of the very basic Emacs concepts is the <em>buffer</em>. A few days ago I encountered an (admittedly, not very common) situation when this came in <em>very</em> handy.</p><p>I had a file whose name contained a few words. However, one of these words was notoriously difficult to spell correctly, and I was fairly sure I misspelled it. (Spoiler: I was right.) In any “traditional” file manager I would check the spelling <em>somewhere</em>, invoke the “file rename” feature and correct the word manually (maybe pasting the correct spelling from the spell checking application). But this is Emacs, the file manager (Dired) is just a buffer, so why not run the spell-checker directly there? I pressed <code>C-x C-q</code> to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html">activate Wdired</a>, then <code>M-$</code> to spell-check at point, I chose the correct spelling and pressed <code>C-c C-c</code> to “commit” the filename change to the filesystem.</p><p>I admit that this is not something you’d use very often. But it’s <em>so</em> cool, and if you need it, it’s there. The very tight integration between Emacs subsystems (here, (W)dired and spell-check) is unparalleled – I haven’t heard of any other OS allowing this. Have you got any other examples of unexpected synergies between various Emacs “apps”?</p><p><a href="https://mbork.pl/CategoryEnglish">CategoryEnglish</a>, <a href="https://mbork.pl/CategoryBlog">CategoryBlog</a>, <a href="https://mbork.pl/CategoryEmacs">CategoryEmacs</a> </p></div></div></div>
