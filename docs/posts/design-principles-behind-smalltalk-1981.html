  The purpose of 
the Smalltalk project is to provide computer support for the creative spirit in 
everyone. Our work flows from a vision that includes a creative individual and 
the best computing hardware available. We have chosen to concentrate on two 
principle areas of research: a language of description (programming language) 
that serves as an interface between the models in the human mind and those in 
computing hardware, and a language of interaction (user interface) that matches 
the human communication system to that of the computer. Our work has followed a 
two- to four-year cycle that can be seen to parallel the scientific method: 
</p><ul>
  <li>Build an application program within the current system (make an 
  observation) 
  </li><li>Based on that experience, redesign the language (formulate a theory) 
  </li><li>Build a new system based on the new design (make a prediction that can be 
  tested) </li></ul>The Smalltalk-80 system marks our fifth time through this 
cycle. In this article, I present some of the general principles we have 
observed in the course of our work. While the presentation frequently touches on 
Smalltalk &#34;motherhood&#34;, the principles themselves are more general and should 
prove useful in evaluating other systems and in guiding future work.
