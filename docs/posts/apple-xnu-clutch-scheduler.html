        <p><time>February 8, 2026</time>
            </p>
    </header><p>On January 6, 2026, the US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency expanded “Operation Metro Surge” in Minneapolis into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-ice-noem-minnesota-somali-db661df6de1131a034da2bda4bb3d817">“the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out”</a> by sending over 2,000 agents to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Though ICE is <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2582/text">required by law</a> to publish weekly detention statistics, after publishing data on January 7th, no data was released again until <a href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management">February 2nd</a>. This data provides the first look at changes in ICE detention patterns since the scaled up operation in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obtusatum.bsky.social/post/3me2i2zbjk22q">wrote on Bluesky</a>, during January the largest increase in ICE detainees was at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, now the only facility where ICE detains minors. There is currently <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2026/02/02/measles-dilley-immigrant-detention-facility-liam-ramos-texas/">a measles outbreak</a> at this detention center, operated by the for-profit private prison company <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CXW:NYSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh4Pyzz8qSAxWlg4kEHXjFKVUQ3ecFKAR6BAgqEAU&amp;window=5Y">CoreCivic</a>.</p>
<p>To better understand this data, I made a data exploration tool for comparing the February release (actually data from January 22, 2026) to the January release (actually data from December 26, 2025). While most data below is directly from ICE, facility locations, facility type definitions, and facility operators are collected from other sources.</p>

<h2 id="national-data-local-issues-human-stories">National data, local issues, human stories</h2>
<p>While working with ICE data, I often searched Google for the name of a facility to verify its location or operator. I found it remarkable, though not surprising, how these searches also immediately brought news about poor prison conditions, inhumane treatment, difficulty accessing attorneys, and use-of-force incidents. What would stand out if these articles were gathered together into the same place? Below, I’ve included links to several recent articles about each of the detention centers with more than 100 daily detainees, as well as all privately operated facilities.</p>
<p>It’s clear that some of these detention centers are worse than others, or at least have more reporting about their conditions than others. The ERO El Paso Camp East Montana (privately operated by Acquisition Logistics, which has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/mystery-surrounds-1-2-billion-army-contract-to-build-huge-detention-tent-camp-in-texas-desert">no experience running prisons</a>) in Texas, the Richwood Correctional Center (privately operated by LaSalle Corrections) in Louisiana, the California City Immigration Processing Center (privately operated by CoreCivic), the Krome North Service Processing Center (privately operated by Akima Global Services) in Florida and the South Texas ICE Processing Center (privately operated by The GEO Group) are all among the detention centers with more reporting than I can list below.</p>
<p>In addition to these large private prisons, ICE also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-09-26/faster-more-frequent-transfers-of-immigrant-ice-detainees-sow-fear-and-cut-off-resources">scatters detainees</a> across an archipelago of smaller facilities, many operated by rural counties. The reporting on these smaller facilities is almost all the work of local outlets, often at the town or county scale. I am deeply concerned about the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/how-jeff-bezos-brought-down-the-washington-post">health of national media</a> in the US, but reading these articles was a good reminder that there is so much local journalism that needs attention and support. The national-scale patterns of ICE detention are important but each facility is a local issue too.</p>
<p>I was also struck by just recent this is. Controversies over conversions of local lockups to ICE-contracted immigrant detention centers and heated community meetings just <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/08/13/west-tenn-town-approves-corecivic-to-run-immigration-detention-facility-after-chaotic-meeting/">a few months ago</a>. Following the news day-to-day, I sometimes lose the forest for the trees and feel as though this has always been happening. Certainly the private prison industry, and its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-addicted-to-ice-immigrant-detention-centers/">deep tentacles into rural economies</a>, is nothing new. But so many of these facilities in America’s detention network are genuinely new. For example, Delaney Hall Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey, now one of the largest ICE detention centers in the country, <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/02/27/ice-plans-massive-new-immigrant-detention-center-in-newark/">opened just last year</a>. In Oklahoma, a new detention center <a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/ice-operations-resume-at-diamondback-facility-in-watonga/">opened last month</a>, planned to hold over 2,000 people. To say nothing of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-29/us-spends-hundreds-of-millions-on-warehouses-for-ice-detention-centers">the warehouses</a> that are currently being planned. This is now.</p>
