The UI components weren’t very hard to write, integrations with other services were straightforward, and I found good techniques for handling component updates in real-time.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>There were a number of useful NPM packages I found, so I wondered if I could use them with Go.

This module allows us to generate a JavaScript file that can be included in a Go application. This means that we can work primarily in Go and then, if needed, we have a way to load helpers that are implemented in native JavaScript.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not a React professional so with that in mind...it seemed to me that React had a very rigid way of implementing components, while Go-app was much more flexible. In Go-app, you can have any component update whenever you like, which gives you many more degrees of freedom for optimization. For example, I needed to optimize a component rendering 150,000+ lines of output. Just having the ability to try different approaches and then pick the one that worked best, made the entire exercise much easier!</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Even though Go-app doesn&#39;t have React-like developer tools built into the browser, I was able to use Go&#39;s own tools (pprof) plus the default profiler built into the browser for profiling and debugging. This was very useful to inspect functions calls, track CPU and memory usage, and evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches for optimizing memory usage.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>I discovered a side benefit of using Go-app: since Dagger Cloud is built as a PWA, it can be installed as a desktop or a mobile application. This makes it possible to launch Dagger Cloud like a native application and get a full-screen experience without needing to open a browser first, or just have a dedicated icon in your desktop taskbar/dock.</p></li></ul><p>We soft-launched Dagger Cloud v3 to our <!--$--><a href="https://dagger.io/commanders" rel="noopener">Dagger Commanders</a><!--/$--> a few weeks ago to collect feedback and made it available to everyone shortly thereafter.</p><h4>Benefits</h4><p>Our switch from React to WASM has resulted in a more consistent user experience across all Dagger interfaces, and better overall performance and lower memory usage, especially when rendering large and complex traces.</p><p>From an engineering perspective too, the benefits to our team are significant. Optimizations very often involve just as much, if not more, work than actually implementing features. So it&#39;s great to not have to spend time optimizing the Web UI, and then more time optimizing the TUI, and instead actually focus on delivering new features.</p><h4>Should You Do This?</h4><p>Dagger Cloud v3 has the Dagger community buzzing and one of the more common questions we&#39;ve been fielding recently is: who should consider doing this and who shouldn&#39;t?</p><p>We want to be clear that we&#39;re not generally recommending making front-ends in Go. We had some very good reasons to do it: a team of strong Go engineers; a complex UI that TypeScript/React didn&#39;t scale well for; a requirement for standardization and reuse between two codebases; and a company-wide mandate to increase our velocity. That&#39;s a fairly specific set of circumstances. If you&#39;re in similar circumstances, this is certainly an option worth evaluating; if not, there are other tools and standards that you should consider first.</p><p>Dagger Cloud v3 is still in beta and we&#39;re excited for you to <!--$--><a href="https://v3.dagger.cloud/" rel="noopener">try it out</a><!--/$-->.
