            <span>Abstract:</span>Airships, best recognized for their unique quality of payload/energy ratio, present a fascinating challenge for the field of engineering. Their construction and operation require a delicate balance of materials and rules, making them a compelling object of study. They embody a distinct intersection of physics, design, and innovation, offering a wide array of possibilities for future transportation and exploration. Thanks to their long-flight endurance, they are suited for long-term missions. To operate in complex environments such as indoor cluttered spaces, their membrane and mechatronics need to be protected from impacts. This paper presents a new indoor airship design inspired by origami and the Kresling pattern. The airship structure combines a carbon fiber exoskeleton and UV resin micro-lattices for shock absorption. Our design strengthens the robot while granting the ability to access narrow spaces by folding the structure - up to a volume expansion ratio of 19.8. To optimize the numerous parameters of the airship, we present a pipeline for design, manufacture, and assembly. It takes into account manufacturing constraints, dimensions of the target deployment area, and aerostatics, allowing for easy and quick testing of new configurations. We also present unique features made possible by combining origami with airship design, which reduces the chances of mission-compromising failures. We demonstrate the potential of the design with a complete simulation including an effective control strategy leveraging lightweight mechatronics to optimize flight autonomy in exploration missions of unstructured environments.
