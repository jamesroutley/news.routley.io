    <h1>Software update bricks some Jeep 4xe hybrids over the weekend</h1>

          <p>Owners of some Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids have been left stranded after installing an over-the-air software update this weekend. The automaker pushed out a telematics update for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/hands-on-with-stellantis-new-android-based-uconnect-5-infotainment/">Uconnect</a> infotainment system that evidently wasn&#39;t ready, resulting in cars losing power while driving and then becoming stranded.</p>
<p>Stranded Jeep owners have been detailing their experiences in forum and Reddit posts, as well as on YouTube. The buggy update doesn&#39;t appear to brick the car immediately. Instead, the failure appears to occur while driving—a far more serious problem. For some, this happened close to home and at low speed, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/1o47064/jeep_4xe_shut_off_mid_highway/">others claim</a> to have experienced a powertrain failure at highway speeds.</p>
<p>Jeep pulled the update after reports of problems, but the software had already downloaded to many owners&#39; cars by then. A member of Stellantis&#39; social engagement team told 4xe owners <a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/threads/wrangler-4xe-ota-update-10-10-2025.8078/?nested_view=1&amp;post_id=103140&amp;ref=thestack.technology#post-103140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a Jeep forum</a> to ignore the update pop-up if they haven&#39;t installed it yet.</p>
<p>Owners were also advised to avoid using either hybrid or electric modes if they had updated their 4xe and not already suffered a powertrain failure. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/posts/103207/">Jeep pushed out a fix</a>.</p>
<p>As Crowdstrike <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">showed last year</a>, Friday afternoons are a bad time to push out a software update. Now Stellantis has learned that lesson, too. Ars has reached out to Stellantis, and we&#39;ll update this post if we get a reply.</p>
