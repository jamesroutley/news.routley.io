      <h3>Adoption and Growth</h3>

      <p>
        In spring 2020, we embarked on a journey to help developers create amazing user interfaces with modern paradigms. In April this year, we reached a major milestone with the release of <a href="https://slint.dev/blog/announcing-slint-1.0" target="_blank">Slint 1.0</a>. As the only Rust based GUI toolkit with stable APIs, we&#39;re grateful to receive attention from leading technical media and publications, such as <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schlankes-UI-Toolkit-fast-aus-Berlin-Slint-benoetigt-weniger-als-300-KByte-RAM-8516264.html" target="_blank">Heise</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Slint-1.0-Released" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/dev-news-rust-based-slint-matures-and-shopify-cleans-up/" target="_blank">The New Stack</a>, <a href="https://devclass.com/2023/04/06/interview-the-story-behind-slint-1-0-a-new-cross-platform-gui-toolkit-coded-in-rust">DevClass</a>, <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/slint-1-0-release/" target="_blank">It&#39;s FOSS</a>, and more. We also made it to the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36388821" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> üéâ.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our 1.0 release spiked interest in Slint; the <a href="https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/discussions" target="_blank">GitHub discussions forum</a> started warming up and we&#39;ve had a steady stream of newcomers to our <a href="https://chat.slint.dev" target="_blank">Mattermost chat</a>. In response to sheer number of applications for the Slint Ambassador license, we created the <a href="https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/master/LICENSES/LicenseRef-Slint-Royalty-free-1.1.md" target="_blank">Royalty-free license</a>, so you can develop proprietary desktop and web applications with Slint for free. Folks started building apps, and we saw our <a href="https://star-history.com/#slint-ui/slint" target="_blank">GitHub stars</a> skyrocket with more than 11K star gazers!
      </p>

      <h3>Success Stories</h3>

        <p>Today, several commercial products are shipping with Slint. Among them are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>SK Signet built a <a href="https://slint.dev/success/sksignet-evcharger">scalable HMI for Electric Vehicle chargers</a> on an embedded device.</li>
          <li>WesAudio built a <a href="https://slint.dev/success/wesaudio-daw">stunning, futuristic looking UI</a> for their high-performance Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) plugin on the desktop.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          In the Open Source community, Slint is popular for its first-class Rust support. Of the ~380 projects using Slint, some of our favorite <a href="https://madewithslint.com/" target="_blank">#MadeWithSlint</a> projects are:

        <h4>Polished Embedded Linux Experience</h4>
        <div>
          <!-- .col-2 -->
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Easily get started with Slint on Torizon: We partnered with Toradex to create the <a href="https://github.com/toradex/vscode-torizon-templates#partner-templates" target="_blank">Slint VS Code Torizon Templates</a>.</li>

        <h4>Tooling</h4>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>
            We have three types of tools:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://slintpad.com/">Slintpad</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint">Slint VS Code extension</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/releases">Slint language server</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Under the hood, we did some refactoring to maximize code sharing. This makes it easier for us to
              add new features for all tools simultaneously. Recently we added:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>New resize handles to live-preview your design in different sizes.</li>
              <li>A new style selector to preview widgets in different styles on the fly.</li>
            </ul>            
          </div><!-- .col-2 -->

      <h3>What&#39;s next?</h3>
      <h4>Roadmap for 2024</h4>
      <p>We&#39;ve got a few high-level items on our roadmap for next year. We&#39;re also making sure to leave room to implement
        specific functionality that our customers need to succeed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ready for Mobile: We&#39;ll release the initial Android port; we plan to support iOS in future.</li>
        <li>Improved Language Support: We&#39;re looking forward to bringing Slint to the Python community during the first half of 2024. We&#39;ll also boost our Node.js integration and will graduate it out of beta status.</li>
        <li>Design tool: We&#39;re going to further develop <a href="https://slintpad.com" target="_blank">SlintPad</a> into a tool to design user interface screens, both simple and complex, without the need to write code.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Events</h4>
      <p>
        We&#39;re looking forward to meeting some of you in person at various events next year. Some plans are still being finalized, but we&#39;re definitely going to be at
        <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/en" target="_blank">Embedded World</a> in April, with a stand in hall 4, booth 300.
      </p>
      <h4>Accelerate Growth</h4>
      <p>While we&#39;ve been growing the team organically, next year we&#39;d like to speed up growth to accelerate product development and to support customer and user requests. We hope to hire next year.</p>
      <p>Growth also means investment: If you know anyone who might be interested in investing into Slint, kindly recommend us.
