		<p>More Than Meets the Eye</p>
		<p>Although inevitable, had man never encountered a single dodo bird, the tropical island of Mauritius may still have a few. How they arrived in such secluded paradise is unclear. Regardless, this endemic species thrived without a care or natural predator until the arrival of settlers in the late 1500s.</p>
		<p>Prior to mankind’s intrusion, the flightless dodo was able to maintain a steady population, even though it laid no more than one egg per year. But, with the introduction of one species came several more—including rats, goats, pigs, deer and macaque—all of which played a hand in decimating dodo numbers to zero. All of which were brought to Mauritius by humans, and all of which happened to have a taste for dodo bird eggs. There are varying accounts of the last official sighting, but in 2003, David Roberts and Andrew Solow used a formula to place the dodo bird’s final date of extinction sometime around 1690.</p>

					<p>Gone but Not Forgotten</p>
					<p>Before their population numbers began a rapid descent to zero, the dodo bird lived a simple life. But these flightless islanders were simple in neither body nor mind, contrary to popular belief. In reality, they were merely unaware of the dangers posed by predatory animals, because for the majority of their existence, dodo birds hadn’t encountered any.</p>
				</div> <!--col-->
				<div>
					<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/circles-white-horizontal.webp" alt=""/></p>
					<p> Unfortunately, the absence of natural predators meant that the dodo’s resulting temperament, traits and behavior made it an easy target for the invasive species that accompanied equally-invasive human settlers. Accounts tell of the birds approaching humans without fear, again, because they had never been hunted or preyed upon.</p>

				<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/geotag.jpg" alt=""/></p><p>ORIGIN:</p>
				<h2>26 MILLION </h2>

				

				<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/slashes-grey.png" alt=""/></p>

				<p>Native Habitat: Paradise.</p>
				<p>It’s unclear when or how the dodo bird came to live on the mystifying island of Mauritius, but they certainly never left. This small volcanic island was the dodo bird’s only home, likely due to its safety and plentiful resources. In fact, evolutionary traits indicate that living conditions were so ideal, the dodo bird ultimately became flightless—and therefore, unable to leave. But, although these endemic birds have long been absent from the subtropical jungles of Mauritius, the island remains a lush and vibrant paradise today.</p>

				
				<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/dodo-parts.jpg" alt=""/></p><p>figure 2  -   Oxford Dodo</p>

				

				<p>Simple Life. Complex Bird.</p>

				<p>With its muted gray feathers and stark white tail plume, the dodo was, in many ways, a minimalist. Nature, having seemingly forgotten to provide the bird an enemy, removed its necessity to fly or seek shelter in the branches of Mauritius’ lofty trees. Over time, heads shrank in size and beaks became longer, more curved, allowing access to the low-lying food, fallen fruit and roots the dodo is suspected to have eaten. The birds’ unused wings slowed in development and retained their juvenile appearance, while their bodies grew larger in contrast.</p>

			</div>

			<div>		
						
				<p>Of course, a heavier frame didn’t just eliminate the dodo’s ability to fly. It required additional support and increased mobility, too—silent demands, answered by the development of thick leg bones, large kneecaps and a broad pelvis. The development of these features ensured that flightlessness would never hinder the dodo bird, even on Mauritius’ rocky terrain. In fact, their physique and lack of predators allowed the dodo to truly thrive at ground-level. Which is precisely where they built nests, foraged for food and ran about on two short legs.</p>
				<p>Overall, dodo birds were a paradox in both behavior and design—a stout, muscular breed whose attributes translated into an almost comedic appearance. A species with no natural predators, given superior strength and features that could inflict damage on foreign enemies, if only it was able to recognize them as such. Still, their evolution was biologically complex, its success evidenced by the species’ carefree lifestyle, prior to the arrival of settlers at Mauritius. While circumstance eventually left the dodo vulnerable to extinction, evolution is not to blame for the shortsightedness of man.</p>

	<div>
		
		<p>Reproduction</p>
		<p>Female dodo birds laid just one egg per year, likely because it was under no stress to produce more. Bone structure suggests that chicks hatched sometime in or around August at an average height of 8 inches, growing very quickly into adulthood to prepare for the cyclones that battered Mauritius between November and March.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		
		<p>Dietary Habits</p>
		<p>That the dodo bird’s appetizer of choice were literal rocks probably didn’t help dissolve their reputation of being stupid. In reality, rocks were a wise choice and an essential part of the bird’s diet.  When swallowed first, these gizzard stones or gastroliths, ground up whatever followed, assisting the digestion of fibrous fruit, nuts, seeds, bulbs, shellfish and the occasional crab.</p>
	</div>


	<div>
		
		<p>Closest Relatives</p>
		<p>Doves, vultures and pigeons are all purported to be relatives of the dodo bird. But one species shares ties in more ways than one. The bright and colorful Nicobar pigeon can be found on the islands after which it’s named. Similarly-isolated and tropical, it’s also the dodo’s closest living relative. Unfortunately, the Nicobar pigeon is currently an endangered species, and if we don’t act now, it could meet the same fate.</p>

			<p>A glimpse into present-day Mauritius Island</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Jewel of the Indian Ocean</p>
			<p>Deep in the heart of the Indian Ocean, a mere 500 miles off the Eastern coast of Madagascar, lies a subtropical jungle—the island of Mauritius. It’s a sparkling paradise, adorned with white sand beaches, roaring waterfalls, placid lagoons and enormous mountains, their cliffs as black as the night. Mauritius is a 24 karat emerald atop a prismatic band of coral reefs. But its most remarkable feature is the hand upon which it lays–an illusory underwater waterfall beckons only to those who view Mauritius’ Le Morne Peninsula from above.</p>
			
			<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/lemorne.jpg" alt=""/></p>
			
			<p>Endemic Flora &amp; Fauna</p>
			<p>While it’s arguably the most famous, the dodo bird is only one of over 600 indigenous species to call Mauritius home. Due to its isolation, Mauritius has a considerably low diversity of wildlife. In fact, a large proportion of Mauritian species are endemic, meaning they don’t occur anywhere else on the planet. The native mammalian fauna is limited to bats and marine animals—among them, the endearingly wide-eyed Mauritius flying fox.</p>
			
			<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/settlers.png" alt=""/>
		</p></div>


		<div>
			<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/aus.png" alt=""/>Like all things beautiful, Mauritius had a unique magnetism that called to settlers from all corners of the world. The rising presence of man caused many plants and animals to seemingly fade into the mist. Even today, many species are still threatened and endangered due to human activity, particularly habitat destruction and the introduction of non-native species.</p>
			<p>At one point, several native birds neared an end similar to that of the dodo, including the Mauritius kestrel, the Mauritius parakeet and the pink pigeon. Fortunately, the winds of change have given conservation a well-deserved spotlight. And although these species were faced with the threat of extinction not long ago, intensive conservation efforts have played a key role in their increasing population numbers.</p>

		<div>
			<p>Dutch Settlers</p>
			<p>It’s the ultimate question asked of any centuries-old crisis: who started this? Who is to blame? Which nation was the first to set foot on Mauritius? If there’s one thing we know about history, it’s that nations were forever enamored with “firsts.”</p>
			<p>According to historical documents, the Dutch were first to land on the shores of Mauritius in 1598, forced to do so by one of the violent storms that battered the island and surrounding waters. With them, the Dutch and following settlers brought invasive species such as pigs, rats, goats, macaques and deer. Sailors found an easy meal in adult dodo birds, as their docile nature and lack of fear made them approachable. And of all the species introduced by man, the black rat posed the biggest threat to dodo eggs.</p>
			<p>Eventually, the same storms that trapped settlers here drove them away. Sailors grew sick and weary in their perpetually-drenched condition, leaving behind their animals upon exit.</p>

				<p>Victim of Circumstance</p>
				<p>Much of what we know about the dodo bird is still up for debate. Speculation colors the precise details of everything from diet to body mass index to closest relatives. Even paleontologists and historians, plagued by unconfirmed accounts that dispute the validity of recorded sightings, acknowledge that the date of the dodo bird’s discovery is as ambiguous as the date of its extinction.</p>
				<p>However, what we do know about the dodo paints a picture of a species that’s been critically misunderstood—a bird widely considered to be so unintelligent, it’s satirically deemed responsible for its own demise. In reality, the dodo bird is a victim of circumstance, as multiple factors played a unique part in culling its numbers.</p>
			</div>


			<div>
				<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/dodo-skull.jpg" alt=""/></p>
				<p>Fall of the Flightless</p>
				<p>Contrary to popular belief, the dodo bird was intelligent, as evidenced by its behaviors, physical attributes and diet. All of the behaviors that earned the bird its clueless and clumsy reputation were surprisingly intentional—eating rocks to aid digestion, developing knees to help traverse uneven and rocky terrain, becoming flightless, nesting on the ground and having no biological reason to fear the humans and animals that eventually eradicated the species.</p>

				

				<p>Evidence in Evolution</p>
				<p>Their evolution is a prime example of just how vulnerable and ill-equipped the species had become. Dodos, growing larger in body and smaller in wingspan, built their nests on the ground. And in these low-lying nests, couples laid only one egg per year. Without the threat of predation, there’s no biological reason for any animal to expend energy to protect itself from predators. Plus, the dodo was anything but small—plump and clocking an impressive average height of three feet. Ultimately, the bird’s trusting nature and hearty size made the dodo—and its egg—an easy and filling meal for hungry newcomers.</p>

			<div>
				<h3>Additional Stressors</h3>
				<p><img src="https://colossal.com/wp-content/themes/colossal/img/dodo/slashes-green.png" alt=""/></p><p>The dodo’s situation was a complicated one, with no single cause for its extinction. However, some external conditions contributed to the worsening situation on Mauritius, indirectly affecting the struggling dodo population.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Rising Sea Levels.</p>
			<p>Climate shift lead to monsoonal collapse and drought.</p>

				<p>01</p>
				<p>GENOMICS</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It is important to have near error free reference genomes that can be used to address some of the fundamental questions in biology and speciation. We will create high quality avian genomes which can be used for multi-genome alignments, comparative analyses, and phenotype predictions that will guide our genome editing.</li>
					<li>Genotype to Phenotype predictions are at the heart of genome editing back the hands of time. Predictions will be informed by comparative analyses, computational biology, machine learning, and empirical methods. Ultimately, new insights will improve our understanding of how mutations affect adaptation and speciation, informing the de-extinction of our next avian species.</li>

				<p>02</p>
				<p>TISSUE CULTURE</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Growing wild bird primordial germ cells (PGCs) may pose an obstacle to progress and we intend to overcome this via a broad screening approach. A variety of conditions will be tested to optimize the growth parameters of our Nicobar pigeon PGCs.</li>					
					<li>This broad screening strategy will enable us to culture many other bird species’ PGCs in preparation for future conservation and de-extinction efforts.</li>
				</ul>

			<div>
				<p>03</p>
				<p>Interspecies Surrogacy</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To speed up production of the Dodo, we will work to advance the state of the art in avian reproduction by demonstrating interspecies germline transfer of pigeon PGCs into a surrogate chicken host. This technology could have an immediate impact on avian research and conservation of threatened pigeon species across the globe.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>Dodo - Our target species for genetic restoration, and the future symbol of species de-extinction.</li>
					<li>Nicobar Pigeon - The Dodo’s closest living relative will provide the host cells/genome for engineering.</li>
					<li>Rodrigues Solitaire - The Dodo’s closest genetic relative will provide genomic insights into what makes the Dodo so fabulous.</li>

				<p>05</p>
				<p>Editing Tools</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In our attempt to de-extinct creatures by using proximal genomes, our timelines are at the mercy of the number of edits that can be done efficiently with the tools that exist. Though the technology is rapidly developing, the ability to make multiple edits simultaneously remains quite low. We will work to improve the state of the art in multiplex genome editing to enable higher throughput engineering, as well as the pursuit of more distantly related species de-extinctions.</li>
					<li>By combining our many strengths at Colossal, we will employ a machine learning approach for the directed evolution of more efficient editing tools that can shorten our timelines for success.</li>

			<h2><small>A SYMBOL OF HOPE</small>Modern Dodo </h2>
			
			<p>The dodo bird is a symbol of man-made extinction. A glaring example of the price of carelessness. Colossal is committed to reviving species lost to extinction in an effort to build a better world. Therefore, it is our intention to partner with the government of Mauritius to establish a foundation for the de-extinction and rewilding of the beloved bird we all dearly miss. And finally, the people of Mauritius have been patiently waiting for the dodo&#39;s return, doing their part to care for their habitat and keeping the land in a natural, healthy state.</p>
