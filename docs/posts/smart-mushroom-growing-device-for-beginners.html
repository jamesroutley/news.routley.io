<p>When you feel guilt, you reframe it to gratefulness.</p>

#</a>The story</h2>
<p>The month of F was a stressful month. I was applying to Recurse, trying to negotiate leave, getting and recovering from COVID, traveling to my brother&#39;s wedding and back...</p>
<p>I also privately got some genuine but harsh feedback on my blog that I wasn&#39;t prepared for (it had to do with what a hypothetical potential employer would think about it, sex tech and candor.) I started to overthink things -- what I should post, what I should take down, what would shock people in the industry, what would annoy them, and ultimately, whether, or to what degree, I care.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting tense just thinking about it.</p>
<p>So honestly, although I kept telling myself that I&#39;d get around to putting up another scheme, I didn&#39;t feel like it. </p>
<p>But now, I&#39;m at Recurse, and I&#39;m in a supportive environment, and people seem to appreciate me and my blog and my vibrators and my excitement to share what I find out, so I feel like writing again!</p>
<p>It&#39;s like that thing people say -- when you feel guilty, instead of saying sorry, say thanks. Like, not &#34;sorry I&#39;m late,&#34; rather, &#34;thanks for waiting.&#34;</p>
<p>So thanks for waiting, thanks for being here, and thanks for treating me with kindness. I really appreciate you.</p>

<p>Reframing guilt to gratefulness is what allows me to power through the ups and downs of life and the unpredictability of ADHD. I&#39;m going to keep writing this series, on my own terms! Maybe there&#39;s stuff you&#39;ll notice I took down from this site -- it may come back. </p>

<p>This is my home, and I&#39;m happy to have you in it.</p>
