<h4> John Baez </h4>
<h4> February 17, 2020 </h4>

<p>
Noether&#39;s theorem is an amazing result which lets physicists get
conserved quantities from symmetries of the laws of nature.  Time
translation symmetry gives conservation of energy; space translation
symmetry gives conservation of momentum; rotation symmetry gives
conservation of angular momentum, and so on.
</p><p>

This result, proved in 1915 by <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Noether_Emmy.html">Emmy
Noether</a> shortly after she first arrived in Göttingen, was praised
by Einstein as a piece of &#34;penetrating mathematical
thinking&#34;.  It&#39;s now a standard workhorse in theoretical physics.

</p><p>
These days, students often first meet this theorem in a course on
quantum field theory.  That can make it seem more complicated than it
really is.  It works for classical field theory, not just quantum field
theory.  And it also works for the classical mechanics of a point
particle!  The proof looks a lot easier in this context — but it
contains all the basic ideas which show up in the more fancy versions.
</p><p>

Of course the proof uses Lagrangians, but a proof can&#39;t help using the
concepts which the theorem is about.  In other words: if someone
claims Noether&#39;s theorem says &#34;every symmetry gives a conserved
quantity&#34;, they are telling a half-truth.  The theorem only applies to
certain classes of theories.  In its original version it applies to
theories described by a Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian formalism does
most of the work in proving the theorem.  There is also a version
which applies to theories described by a Hamiltonian.  Luckily, almost
all the theories studied in physics are described by both a
Lagrangian <em>and</em> a Hamiltonian.  But let&#39;s just do the
following simple special case:

</p><p>
Suppose we have a particle moving on a line with Lagrangian \(L(q,\dot{q})\),
where \(q\) is its position and \(\dot{q} = dq/dt\) is its velocity.  (I&#39;ll 
always use a dot to stand for time derivative.)  

</p><p>
The momentum of our particle is defined to be

$$ p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} $$

The force on it is defined to be

$$ F = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The equations of motion — the so-called Euler-Lagrange equations —
say that the rate of change of momentum equals the force:

$$ \dot{p} = F $$

That&#39;s how Lagrangians work!  

Next, suppose the Lagrangian \(L\) has a symmetry, meaning that it doesn&#39;t
change when you apply some one-parameter family of transformations
sending \(q\) to some new position \(q(s)\).  This means that

$$ 
\frac{d}{ds} L(q(s), \dot{q}(s)) = 0 
$$

Then I claim that

$$ C = p \frac{d q(s)}{ds} $$

is a conserved quantity: that is,

$$ \dot C = 0 $$

<strong>Proof.</strong> Take the time derivative of our supposed conserved
quantity using the product rule:

$$ \dot{C} = \dot{p} \frac{d q(s)}{ds} + p \frac{d \dot{q}(s)}{ds} $$

Next, use the equation of motion of our particle and the definition
of momentum to rewrite the \(\dot{p}\) and \(p\) terms in this equation:

$$ \dot{C} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} \frac{d q(s)}{ds} +
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q} \frac{d \dot{q}(s)}{ds} $$

Finally, use the chain rule to recognize that the right side of this
equation is 

$$ \frac{d}{ds} L(q(s), \dot{q}(s)) = 0 $$

<strong>QED.</strong>
</p><p>
Of course there&#39;s nothing special about the particle being on a <em>line</em>.
It&#39;s easy to generalize to a particle or bunch of particles in
higher-dimensional Euclidean space or even a manifold.  It&#39;s also
easy to generalize to field theories.  The idea is always the same.

</p><p>
Experts will note that the above simplified version assumes our
symmetry is time-independent: that&#39;s how I could slip the time derivative
past the derivative with respect to \(s\), when going from 

$$ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{dq(s)}{ds} $$

to 

$$ \frac{d\dot q(s)}{ds} $$

Of course, like any good magician, I did this step so quickly that
you might not have noticed it!  However, it&#39;s an important step, and
to handle time-dependent symmetries, we need a somewhat fancier
version of Noether&#39;s theorem.  A simple example comes when you consider
the conserved quantities associated to Lorentz transformations!  But
that&#39;s <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/boosts.html">another story</a>.

For more on Emmy Noether and her theorem, try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether&#39;s_theorem">this Wikipedia
article</a>.  You can also see slides of a more advanced talk where
I try to unify the classical and quantum versions of Noether&#39;s theorem:

theorem</a>.

By the way, Emmy Noether proved a lot of other cool theorems and
introduced a lot of important ideas into mathematics, especially group
theory and ring theory.  A lot mathematicians use her work all the
time and don&#39;t even know the theorem I just explained.
