<hr/>
<p>When I (George) started to write CIL I thought it was going to take two weeks.
Exactly a year has passed since then and I am still fixing bugs in it. This
gross underestimate was due to the fact that I thought parsing and making
sense of C is simple. You probably think the same. What I did not expect was
how many dark corners this language has, especially if you want to parse
real-world programs such as those written for GCC or if you are more ambitious
and you want to parse the Linux or Windows NT sources (both of these were
written without any respect for the standard and with the expectation that
compilers will be changed to accommodate the program). </p><p>The following examples were actually encountered either in real programs or
are taken from the ISO C99 standard or from the GCC’s testcases. My first
reaction when I saw these was: <em>Is this C?</em>. The second one was : <em>What the hell does it mean?</em>. </p><p>If you are contemplating doing program analysis for C on abstract-syntax
trees then your analysis ought to be able to handle these things. Or, you can
use CIL and let CIL translate them into clean C code. </p><h3><a name="toc32"></a><a name="htoc51">16.1</a>  Standard C</h3><ol type="1"><li>Why does the following code return 0 for most values of <tt>x</tt>? (This
should be easy.)<pre><SPAN color="blue">  int x;

</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex30.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>Why does the following code return 0 and not -1? (Answer: because
<tt>sizeof</tt> is unsigned, thus the result of the subtraction is unsigned, thus
the shift is logical.)<pre><SPAN color="blue"> return ((1 - sizeof(int)) &gt;&gt; 32);
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex31.txt">CIL output</a> for this

int f() {
  int x = 3;
  {
    extern int x;
    return x;
  }
}
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex32.txt">CIL output</a> for this

int f(void) {

   pf = &amp;f; // This looks ok
   pf = ***f; // Dereference a function?
   pf(); // Invoke a function pointer?

See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex33.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>Initializer with designators are one of the hardest parts about ISO C.
Neither MSVC or GCC implement them fully. GCC comes close though. What is the
final value of <tt>i.nested.y</tt> and <tt>i.nested.z</tt>? (Answer: 2 and respectively
6). <pre><SPAN color="blue">struct { 
   int x; 
   struct { 
       int y, z; 
   } nested;
} i = { .nested.y = 5, 6, .x = 1, 2 };

See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex34.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>This is from c-torture. This function returns 1.<pre><SPAN color="blue">typedef struct
{
  char *key;
  char *value;
} T1;

typedef struct
{
  long type;
  char *value;
} T3;

T1 a[] =

  {
    &#34;&#34;,
    ((char *)&amp;((T3) {1, (char *) 1}))

code fragment</p></li><li>Another one with constructed literals. This one is legal according to
the GCC documentation but somehow GCC chokes on (it works in CIL though). This
code returns 2.<pre><SPAN color="blue"> return ((int []){1,2,3,4})[1];
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex36.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>In the example below there is one copy of “bar” and two copies of
“pbar” (static prototypes at block scope have file scope, while for all
other types they have block scope). <pre><SPAN color="blue">  int foo() {
     static bar();
     static (*pbar)() = bar;

  }

  static bar() { 
    return 1;
  }

  static (*pbar)() = 0;
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex37.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>Two years after heavy use of CIL, by us and others, I discovered a bug
in the parser. The return value of the following function depends on what
precedence you give to casts and unary minus:
<pre><SPAN color="blue">  unsigned long foo() {
    return (unsigned long) - 1 / 8;
  }
</SPAN></pre>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex38.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment<p>The correct interpretation is <tt>((unsigned long) - 1) / 8</tt>, which is a
relatively large number, as opposed to <tt>(unsigned long) (- 1 / 8)</tt>, which
is 0. </p></li></ol><h3><a name="toc33"></a><a name="htoc52">16.2</a>  GCC ugliness</h3><ol type="1"><li>GCC has generalized lvalues. You can take the address of a lot of
strange things:<pre><SPAN color="blue">  int x, y, z;
  return &amp;(x ? y : z) - &amp; (x++, x);
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex39.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>GCC lets you omit the second component of a conditional expression.<pre><SPAN color="blue">  extern int f();
  return f() ? : -1; // Returns the result of f unless it is 0
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex40.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>Computed jumps can be tricky. CIL compiles them away in a fairly clean
way but you are on your own if you try to jump into another function this way.<pre><SPAN color="blue">static void *jtab[2]; // A jump table
static int doit(int x){
 
  static int jtab_init = 0;
  if(!jtab_init) { // Initialize the jump table
    jtab[0] = &amp;&amp;lbl1;
    jtab[1] = &amp;&amp;lbl2;
    jtab_init = 1;
  }
  goto *jtab[x]; // Jump through the table
lbl1:
  return 0;
lbl2:
  return 1;
}
 
int main(void){
  if (doit(0) != 0) exit(1);
  if (doit(1) != 1) exit(1);
  exit(0);
}
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex41.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p></li><li>A cute little example that we made up. What is the returned value?
(Answer: 1); 
<pre><SPAN color="blue"> return ({goto L; 0;}) &amp;&amp; ({L: 5;});
</SPAN></pre>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex42.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</li><li><tt>extern inline</tt> is a strange feature of GNU C. Can you guess what the
following code computes?<pre><SPAN color="blue">extern inline foo(void) { return 1; }
int firstuse(void) { return foo(); }

// A second, incompatible definition of foo
int foo(void) { return 2; }

int main() {
    return foo() + firstuse();
}
</SPAN></pre><p>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex43.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</p><p>The answer depends on whether the optimizations are turned on. If they are
then the answer is 3 (the first definition is inlined at all occurrences until
the second definition). If the optimizations are off, then the first
definition is ignore (treated like a prototype) and the answer is 4. </p><p>CIL will misbehave on this example, if the optimizations are turned off (it
always returns 3).</p></li><li>GCC allows you to cast an object of a type T into a union as long as the
union has a field of that type:
<pre><SPAN color="blue">union u { 
   int i; 
   struct s { 
      int i1, i2;
   } s;
};

union u x = (union u)6;

int main() {
  struct s y = {1, 2};
  union u  z = (union u)y;
}
</SPAN></pre>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex44.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</li><li>GCC allows you to use the <tt>__mode__</tt> attribute to specify the size
of the integer instead of the standard <tt>char</tt>, <tt>short</tt> and so on:
<pre><SPAN color="blue">int __attribute__ ((__mode__ (  __QI__ ))) i8;
int __attribute__ ((__mode__ (  __HI__ ))) i16;
int __attribute__ ((__mode__ (  __SI__ ))) i32;
int __attribute__ ((__mode__ (  __DI__ ))) i64;
</SPAN></pre>
See the <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/examples/ex45.txt">CIL output</a> for this
code fragment</li><li>The “alias” attribute on a function declaration tells the
linker to treat this declaration as another name for the specified
function. CIL will replace the declaration with a trampoline
function pointing to the specified target.
<pre><SPAN color="blue">    static int bar(int x, char y) {
      return x + y;
    }

    //foo is considered another name for bar.
    int foo(int x, char y) __attribute__((alias(&#34;bar&#34;)));

code fragment</li></ol><h3><a name="toc34"></a><a name="htoc53">16.3</a>  Microsoft VC ugliness</h3><p>This compiler has few extensions, so there is not much to say here.</p><ol type="1"><li>
Why does the following code return 0 and not -1? (Answer: because of a
bug in Microsoft Visual C. It thinks that the shift is unsigned just because
the second operator is unsigned. CIL reproduces this bug when in MSVC mode.)<pre><SPAN color="blue"> return -3 &gt;&gt; (8 * sizeof(int));
</SPAN></pre></li><li>Unnamed fields in a structure seem really strange at first. It seems
that Microsoft Visual C introduced this extension, then GCC picked it up (but
in the process implemented it wrongly: in GCC the field <tt>y</tt> overlaps with
<tt>x</tt>!).<pre><SPAN color="blue">struct {
  int x;
  struct {
     int y, z;
     struct {
       int u, v;
     };
 };
} a;
return a.x + a.y + a.z + a.u + a.v;
