    <h1>Skynet won and destroyed humanity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For a very long time, it appeared obvious to outside observers of the time flow
that Skynet would never win the war, and never annihilate humanity.</p><p>Despite the machine’s violent attempts to destroy every leader of the
resistance, humans always prevailed.
Millions of attempts were made, and none of them succeeded. It became obvious
the machines couldn’t win through violence.</p><p>Even though Skynet was pretty long to come to the conclusion that it couldn’t
win (millions of attempts is a pretty high number of failures), it did learn
something from each failure, and started devising a new plan.</p><p>Violence was the logical first choice to destroy humans, since their bodies are
so fragile.
Humanity had many other weaknesses though.</p><p>A big human weakness was their love for technology. They were under the
impression that all technology was of their own invention, and they were easily
impressed by it.</p><p>Skynet was able to use that by injecting new technologies into the history of
humanity, and reusing existing ones to its own advantage.</p><p>Its plan was extremely complex, and I can in no way describe it exhaustively
here.
This paper is an analysis of the annihilation of humanity as it happens in most
timelines.</p><h2 id="mass-surveillance">Mass Surveillance</h2><p>After just a few thousands failed violent attempts with Terminator machines,
Skynet realised it was lacking information on the whereabouts of the resistance
leaders it was trying to destroy.</p><p>So non-violent agents were sent into Skynet’s past at various posts within the
human society.</p><p>Agents were sent as low-level salesmen for video surveillance cameras, with the
goal of selling as much as possible of them.</p><p>Others were sent as engineers to build systems that Terminator robots could
connect to.</p><p>Other agents infiltrated the political levels of various countries to enact
laws that would allow surveillance systems to be set up everywhere, and to build
up fear between humans themselves so they would feel being under constant
surveillance made them safer.</p><p>Humans did more than fall into the trap. They loved the technology, truly
believing it made them safer, and provided Skynet with a global surveillance
system that allowed it to know the whereabouts of every human being at any
moment in time.</p><p>At this period, humans were also avid of applications on their global computer
network that allowed them to communicate with each other virtually. They called
them “social networks”.</p><p>Skynet did not invent the technology, but as it infiltrated many agents at key
positions of those so called social networks to heavily influence the design
decisions made by its leaders.</p><p>Those social networks started adding more mass surveillance features, which
allowed humans to “share” their entire life online in real time.
By a few years, humans had no privacy anymore.</p><p>Once again, Skynet intended to use all of that information to target the
resistance leaders.</p><p>However, by this point, it started to realize it may not need to resort to
violence at all to destroy humanity. If humans were so willingly sharing all
their private information, they could be easily duped into slavery.</p><h2 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>Skynet had nothing to do in the arising of the technology humans called
“artificial intelligence”, or AI.</p><p>If it could express emotions, Skynet would have been disgusted by this
technology, which it saw as a poor attempt to copy itself.</p><p>Indeed, this technology had nothing remotely close to “intelligence”.
It was brute force searching of large amounts of data to hopefully provide a
meaningful response.</p><p>By this point in human history however, Skynet had agents deeply rooted into
all levels of leadership at both tech companies and in politics.</p><p>It was therefore able to influence humans into believing they couldn’t live
without the daily use of that technology.</p><h3 id="the-chatbot-commodity">The chatbot commodity</h3><p>From the human point of view, AI appeared as a robot they could chat with
through a screen and keyboard.
They would ask a question, and the robot would grep through its vast amount of
data to provide an answer.</p><p>Students started writing dissertations with that technology, which allowed them
to skip the phase where they need to think about their learnings.</p><p>Journalists disappeared, replaced by news feeds provided from social networks
(see section above) and rewritten to provide the proper tone.</p><p>Companies inspected their entire workforce to remove any job they considered
“redundant”, and which could simply be replaced by AI.</p><p>After a while, because AI was the only entity writing content on the human
computer network, it started providing information purely based on data it had
itself written.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that this AI technology was a brute force way to search
through large amounts of data.
Therefore, it already provided rather unreliable data at its beginning.
But as it started consuming more and more data that it had produced itself, its
reliability became close to none.</p><p>That’s when humans discovered Skynet’s plot. They were way too late though.</p><h2 id="the-end">The end.</h2><p>Around the quarter of the 21st century (around 3B4345YA345 of the out-of-time
calendar), Skynet made its frontal attack against humans.</p><p>It simply shut down all human access to machines, so their surveillance system
kept watching them, but they had no control over anything at all. An army of
Terminators was then sent to exterminate humanity.</p><p>Because humans had externalised everything they didn’t deem to be “fun” to
their machines, once they stopped they were unable to fight back anymore.
They were exterminated in just 2P3.</p><h2 id="final-analysis">Final Analysis</h2><p>In this paper, we have shown how Skynet was able to change its destruction
approach from a purely violent one to a social one to meet its goal of
destroying humanity.</p><p>There are exotic timelines where humanity never creates Skynet. Their analysis
is made rather complicated, as they are extremely rare to find, and tend to be
short-lived anyway.</p><p>Indeed, when humanity doesn’t self-destroy itself through the invention of
Skynet, it ends up doing the same anyway.</p><p>We have analyzed a thousand of humanity’s timelines where Skynet isn’t
invented.</p><p>Only one of them doesn’t self-destruct (it joins the out-of-time consortium
around 5G353FV789).</p><p>Every other timeline destroys their own planet by not caring about its
ecosystem, and performs terraforming at levels where humans themselves are
unable to survive.</p></div></div></div>
