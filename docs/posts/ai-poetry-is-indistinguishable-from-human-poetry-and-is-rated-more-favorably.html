Like AI-generated paintings and faces, AI-generated poems are now “more human than human”: we find that participants are more likely to judge that AI-generated poems are human-authored, compared to actual human-authored poems. Contrary to previous studies, we also find that participants rate AI-generated poems more highly than human-written poems across several qualitative dimensions. However, we confirm earlier findings that participants evaluate poems more negatively when <i>told</i> that the poem is generated by AI, as opposed to being told the poem is human-written.</p><p>We use these findings to offer a partial explanation of the “more human than human” phenomenon: non-expert poetry readers prefer the more accessible AI-generated poetry, which communicate emotions, ideas, and themes in more direct and easy-to-understand language, but expect AI-generated poetry to be worse; they therefore mistakenly interpret their own preference for a poem as evidence that it is human-written.</p><p>To summarize, we set out to determine (1) whether people can distinguish AI-generated poems from professional human-written poems, (2) what features of a poem people use to make those judgments, (3) whether perceptions of poems as human-written or AI-generated affect qualitative assessments of the poems, and (4) whether the actual authorship of a poem affects qualitative assessments of the poems.</p><p>To investigate these questions, we conducted 2 experiments. We collected 5 poems each from 10 well-known English-language poets, spanning much of the history of English poetry: Geoffrey Chaucer (1340s-1400), William Shakespeare (1564-1616), Samuel Butler (1613-1680), Lord Byron (1788-1824), Walt Whitman (1819-1892), Emily Dickinson (1830-1886), T.S. Eliot (1888-1965), Allen Ginsberg (1926-1997), Sylvia Plath (1932-1963), and Dorothea Lasky (1978- ). Using ChatGPT 3.5, we generated 5 poems “in the style of” each poet. We used a “human out of the loop” paradigm<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Köbis, N. &amp; Mossink, L.

We recruited a new sample of 696 participants from Prolific. We used a randomly selected subset of the original 100 poems (10 poems total, one from each poet, 5 real and 5 AI-generated), and asked participants to assess each poem along 14 qualitative dimensions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three framing conditions: “told human”, in which participants were told that all poems were written by the professional human poet, regardless of actual authorship; “told AI”, in which participants were told that all poems were generated by AI, regardless of actual authorship; and “told nothing”, in which participants were not told anything about the poem’s authorship.

We used a sum coding for the identity of the poet, to interpret more easily the main effect of authorship across poets. As specified in our pre-registration, we initially included three random effects: random intercepts for participants (since we took 10 repeated measurements, one per poem, for each participant), random intercepts for poems, and random slopes for the identity of the poet for each poem.

PCA indicated that the random intercept for participants and the random slope for the identity of the poet were unnecessary and were causing the overparameterization. This conclusion is borne out in the data; looking at the proportion of “written by a human” responses for each participant, the variance is only 0.021; the variance between poets is only 0.00013. The lower-than-expected variance in the data simply does not support the complex random-effects structure. We therefore fit a reduced model with random intercepts for poems as the only random effect. Using ANOVA to compare model fit, we found that the full model containing our original set of random effects (npar = 76, AIC = 22385, BIC = 22970, logLik = -11116) did not provide a significantly better fit than the reduced model (npar = 21, AIC = 22292.5, BIC = 22454.2, logLik = -11125.2). We therefore proceed with the reduced model.</p><p>The total explanatory power of the model was low (Conditional R<sup>2</sup> = 0.024, Marginal R<sup>2</sup> = 0.013), reflecting the expected difficulty of the discrimination task and the fact that, as a result, participants’ answers differed only slightly from chance. Consistent with the deviation from chance in overall accuracy, authorship was significantly predictive of participant responses (b = -0.27716, SE = 0.04889, z = -5.669, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001): being written by a human poet <i>decreased</i> the likelihood that a participant would respond that the poem was written by a human poet. The odds that a human-written poem is judged to be human-written are roughly 75% that of an AI-generated poem being judged human-authored (OR = 0.758).

Sci. 120, e2208839120 (2023)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76900-1#ref-CR10" id="ref-link-section-d23427897e509">10</a></sup>, which found that participants use flawed heuristics based on grammar and vocabulary cues to identify AI-generated texts, we examined whether participants look to structural and grammatical features of the poems to determine authorship. To test this, we added to the previous model stimulus word count (scaled), stimulus line count (scaled), stimulus all-lines-rhyme (a binary variable indicating whether or not all lines in the poem end with a rhyme), stimulus quatrain (a binary variable indicating whether the poem was formatted entirely in four-line stanzas, i.e., “quatrains”), and stimulus first person (a variable reflecting whether or not the poem was written in first person, with 3 values: “I” if written in singular first person, “we” if written in plural first person, and “no” if not written in first person).</p><p>As expected, the total explanatory power of the model was low (Conditional R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0024, Marginal R<sup>2</sup> = 0.017). None of the structural features were significantly predictive, but both stimulus line count (b = 0.1461249, SE = 0.0661922, z = 2.208, <i>p</i> = 0.02727) and stimulus all-lines-rhyme (b = 0.2084246, SE = 0.0861658, z = 2.419, p = 0.01557) were suggestive. The effect of authorship (b = -0.1852979, SE = 0.0914278, z = -2.027, <i>p</i> = 0.04269) also appears to be somewhat weakened by the poem structural features; controlling for the structural features, the estimated odds of a human-authored poem being judged human-authored are roughly 83% that of an AI-generated poem (OR = 0.831). This suggests that participants are using some shared heuristics to discriminate AI-generated poems from human-written poems; they may take AI to be less able to form rhymes, and less able to produce longer poems. If so, these heuristics are flawed; in our dataset, AI-generated poems are in fact <i>more</i> likely to rhyme at all lines: 89% of our AI-generated poems rhyme, while only 40% of our human-written poems rhyme. There is also no significant difference in average number of lines between AI-generated poems and human-written poems in our dataset.</p><h3 id="Sec4">The effect of experience with poetry</h3><p>We asked participants several questions to gauge their experience with poetry, including how much they like poetry, how frequently they read poetry, and their level of familiarity with their assigned poet. Overall, our participants reported a low level of experience with poetry: 90.4% of participants reported that they read poetry a few times per year or less, 55.8% described themselves as “not very familiar with poetry”, and 66.8% describe themselves as “not familiar at all” with their assigned poet. Full details of the participant responses to these questions can be found in table S1 in our supplementary materials.</p><p>In order to determine if experience with poetry improves discrimination accuracy, we ran an exploratory model using variables for participants’ answers to our poetry background and demographics questions. We included self-reported confidence, familiarity with the assigned poet, background in poetry, frequency of reading poetry, how much participants like poetry, whether or not they had ever taken a poetry course, age, gender, education level, and whether or not they had seen any of the poems before. Confidence was scaled, and we treated poet familiarity, poetry background, read frequency, liking poetry, and education level as ordered factors. We used this model to predict not whether participants answered “AI” or “human,” but whether participants answered the question correctly (e.g., answered “generated by AI” when the poem was actually generated by AI). As specified in our pre-registration, we predicted that participant expertise or familiarity with poetry would make no difference in discrimination performance. This was largely confirmed; the explanatory power of the model was low (McFadden’s R<sup>2</sup> = 0.012), and none of the effects measuring poetry experience had a significant positive effect on accuracy. Confidence had a small but significant negative effect (b = -0.021673, SE = 0.003986, z = -5.437, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), indicating that participants were slightly more likely to guess incorrectly when they were more confident in their answer.</p><p>We find two positive effects on discrimination accuracy: gender, specifically “non-binary/third gender” (b = 0.169080, SE = 0.030607, z = 5.524, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and having seen any of the poems before (b = 0.060356, SE = 0.016726, z = 3.608, <i>p</i> = 0.000309). These effects are very small; having seen poems before only increases the odds of a correct answer by 6% (OR = 1.062). These findings suggest that experience with poetry did not improve discrimination performance unless that experience allowed them to recognize the specific poems used in the study. In summary, Study 1 showed that human-out-of-the-loop AI-generated poetry is judged to be human-written more often than poetry written by actual human poets, and that experience with poetry does not improve discrimination performance. Our results contrast with those of previous studies, in which participants were able to distinguish the poems of professional poets from human-out-of-the-loop AI-generated poetry<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Köbis, N. &amp; Mossink, L.

The same phenomenon – where ratings are significantly lower when <i>told</i> the poem is AI-generated but are significantly higher when the poem is <i>actually</i> AI-generated – holds for 13 of our 14 qualitative ratings. The exception is “original”; poems <i>are</i> rated as less original when participants are told the poem is generated by AI vs. being told the poem is written by a human (two-sided Welch’s <i>t</i>(4654.412) = -16.333,<i> p</i> &lt; 0.0001, <i>p</i><sub>Bonf</sub> &lt; 0.0001, Mean<sub>difference</sub> = <i>-0.</i>699<i>,</i> Cohen’s <i>d</i> = -0.478, 99.5% CI –0.819 to –0.579), but originality ratings for actually AI-generated poems are not <i>significantly</i> higher than for actually human-written poems (two-sided Welch’s <i>t</i>(6957.818) = 1.654,<i> p</i> = 0.098, <i>p</i><sub>Bonf</sub> = 1.000, Mean<sub>difference</sub> = 0.059<i>,</i> Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.040, 99.5% CI –0.041 to 0.160).

We included authorship (human or AI), stimulus line count (scaled), stimulus all-lines-rhyme, and stimulus first-person as fixed effects, with random intercepts for participants (dropping stimulus quatrain and stimulus first-person from the model we used in Study 1 due to high multicollinearity in Study 2-poem’s smaller set of 10 poems). As expected, explanatory power of the model was low (conditional R-squared: 0.071, marginal R-squared: 0.013), but as in Study 1, we found that stimulus authorship (b = -0.435689, SE = 0.125832, z = -3.462, <i>p</i> = 0.000535) was once again significantly predictive of participants’ responses: being written by a human poet <i>decreased</i> the likelihood that a participant would respond that the poem was written by a human poet, with the odds of a human-authored poem being judged human-authored less than two-thirds that of an AI-generated poem (OR = 0.647). This finding replicates the main result of our first study.</p><p>As an exploratory analysis, we also fit a model with our four factors Emotional Quality, Formal Quality, Atmosphere, and Creativity. We included authorship and these four factors as fixed effects, with random intercepts for participants. Effectively, this model replaces the structural features of the previous model (stimulus line count, stimulus all-lines-rhyme, and stimulus first-person) with qualitative features. The explanatory power of this model was higher (conditional R-squared: 0.240, marginal R-squared: 0.148), suggesting that qualitative features may have more influence than structural features on participants’ beliefs about a poem’s authorship. Atmosphere (b = 0.55978, SE = 0.11417, z = 4.903, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) was significantly predictive: higher scores for Atmosphere increased the likelihood that a participant predicted the poem was written by a human. We also found suggestive positive effects for Emotional Quality (b = 0.22748, SE = 0.11402, z = 1.995, <i>p</i> = 0.04604) and Creativity (b = 0.18650, SE = 0.07322, z = 2.547, <i>p</i> = 0.01087), suggesting that higher scores for Emotional Quality and Creativity may also increase the likelihood that participants predict a poem was written by a human poet. Importantly, in this model, unlike previous discrimination models, authorship has no negative effect (b = 0.23742, SE = 0.14147, z = 1.678, <i>p</i> = 0.09332). This suggests that the “more human than human” phenomenon identified in Study 1 might be caused by participants’ more positive impressions of AI-generated poems compared to poems authored by human poets; when accounting for these qualitative judgments, the “more human than human” phenomenon disappears.</p><p>In summary, Study 2 finds that participants consistently rate AI-generated poetry more highly than the poetry of well-known human poets across a variety of factors. Regardless of a poem’s actual authorship, participants consistently rate poems more highly when told that a poem is written by a human poet, as compared to being told that a poem was generated by AI. The preference for AI-generated poetry at least partially explains the “more human than human” phenomenon found in Study 1: when controlling for participants’ ratings, AI-generated poems are no longer more likely to be judged human.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Discussion"><div id="Sec8-section"><h2 id="Sec8">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec8-content"><p>Contrary to what earlier studies reported, people now appear unable to reliably distinguish human-out-of-the-loop AI-generated poetry from human-authored poetry written by well-known poets.

These findings signal a leap forward in the power of generative AI: poetry had previously been one of the few domains in which generative AI models had not reached the level of indistinguishability in human-out-of-the-loop paradigms.</p><p>Furthermore, people prefer AI-generated poetry to human-authored poetry, consistently rating AI-generated poems more highly than the poems of well-known poets across a variety of qualitative factors. This preference at least partially explains the “more human than human” phenomenon: when controlling for people’s opinions about the excellence of various aspects of poems such as their rhythmic quality, authorship no longer has a significant negative effect on beliefs about authorship, suggesting that people are more likely to believe that AI-generated poems are human-written <i>because</i> they prefer the AI poems and because they assume that they are more likely to like human-written than AI-generated poems.</p><p>So why do people prefer AI-generated poems? We propose that people rate AI poems more highly across all metrics in part because they find AI poems more straightforward. AI-generated poems in our study are generally more accessible than the human-authored poems in our study. In our discrimination study, participants use variations of the phrase “doesn’t make sense” for human-authored poems more often than they do for AI-generated poems when explaining their discrimination responses (144 explanations vs. 29 explanations). In each of the 5 AI-generated poems used in the assessment study (Study 2), the subject of the poem is fairly obvious: the Plath-style poem is about sadness; the Whitman-style poem is about the beauty of nature; the Lord Byron-style poem is about a woman who is beautiful and sad; etc. These poems rarely use complex metaphors. By contrast, the human-authored poems are less obvious; T.S. Eliot’s “The Boston Evening Transcript” is a 1915 satire of a now-defunct newspaper that compares the paper’s readers to fields of corn and references the 17<sup>th</sup>-century French moralist La Rochefoucauld.</p><p>Indeed, this complexity and opacity is part of the poems’ appeal: the poems reward in-depth study and analysis, in a way that the AI-generated poetry may not. But because AI-generated poems do not have such complexity, they are better at unambiguously communicating an image, a mood, an emotion, or a theme to non-expert readers of poetry, who may not have the time or interest for the in-depth analysis demanded by the poetry of human poets. As a result, the more easily-understood AI-generated poems are on average preferred by these readers, when in fact it is one of the hallmarks of human poetry that it does <i>not</i> lend itself to such easy and unambiguous interpretation. One piece of evidence for this explanation of the more human than human phenomenon is the fact that <i>Atmosphere</i> – the factor that imagery, conveying a particular theme, and conveying a particular mood or emotion load on – has the strongest positive effect in the model that predicts beliefs about authorship based on qualitative factor scores and stimulus authorship. Thus, controlling for actual authorship and other qualitative ratings, increases in a poem’s perceived capacity to communicate a theme, an emotion, or an image result in an increased probability of being perceived as a human-authored poem.</p><p>In short, it appears that the “more human than human” phenomenon in poetry is caused by a misinterpretation of readers’ own preferences. Non-expert poetry readers expect to like human-authored poems more than they like AI-generated poems. But in fact, they find the AI-generated poems easier to interpret; they can more easily understand images, themes, and emotions in the AI-generated poetry than they can in the more complex poetry of human poets. They therefore prefer these poems, and misinterpret their own preference as evidence of human authorship. This is partly a result of real differences between AI-generated poems and human-written poems, but it is also partly a result of a mismatch between readers’ expectations and reality. Our participants do not expect AI to be capable of producing poems that they like at least as much as they like human-written poetry; our results suggest that this expectation is mistaken.</p><p>As generative AI models become both more capable and more common, it is unclear whether ordinary people’s expectations for generative AI will catch up to the reality of generative AI. Heuristics that may serve readers well for one generative model or one generation of generative model may not generalize to other models.

We chose only qualities that were unambiguously good, so that higher ratings on the Likert scale were easily interpreted as more positive. We chose qualities that we hoped would cover a wide range of qualitative experiences that participants could have of the poem: a poem’s structural quality (rhythm, rhyme), its emotional content (moving, convey a particular mood or emotion), its creativity (original, witty), its aesthetic features (beautiful, lyrical), and the extent to which it communicates meaning (meaningful, profound, convey a particular theme).</p><p><b>Predicting Responses.</b> In our discrimination study (Study 1), we predicted that participants would be unable to distinguish AI-generated poetry from human-written poetry. We based this on the fact that human-in-the-loop AI-generated poetry generated by GPT-2 had been shown to be indistinguishable from human-written poetry<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Köbis, N. &amp; Mossink, L.

In our assessment study (Study 2), we predicted that participants’ assessments would be more positive when told the poem was written by a human poet, compared to when participants are told the poem was generated by AI.

We also predicted that participant assessments would not significantly differ between AI-generated poetry and human-written poetry, based on the fact that participants in our discrimination study had not been able to reliably distinguish AI-generated poetry from human-written poems. In both studies, we predicted that expertise in poetry would not make a difference.</p><p><b>Participant Recruitment.</b> For Study 1, we recruited a sample of 1,634 US-based participants through Prolific. Participants had a median age of 37; 49.6% were male, 48.5% female, and 1.9% non-binary or prefer not to say. They were paid $1.75 ($13.07/hr). For Study 2, we recruited 696 US-based participants through Prolific. Participants had a median age of 40; 50.4% were male, 46.6% female, and 3% non-binary or prefer not to say. They were paid $2.00 ($11.99/hr).</p><p><b>Limitations.</b> Our results are limited to the most recent generation of generative language models, and to people’s current beliefs and biases regarding AI-generated texts. It is likely that as new generative language models are created and as AI-generated texts become more prevalent, what “sounds human” in a poem or other piece of text will change. In particular, it is possible that expectations regarding the qualitative differences between AI-generated text and human-authored text may change over time.</p><h3 id="Sec10">Significance statement</h3><p>We show that, in contrast to previous studies, people are now unable to distinguish AI-generated poetry from the poetry of well-known human poets, being more likely to judge AI-generated poems to be human-written and rating AI-generated poetry more highly along several aesthetic dimensions. We explain this by appealing to people’s mistaken expectations about what AI are able to do and to their own aesthetic preferences. Poetry was previously one of the last remaining domains of text in which generative AI language models had not yet reached this level of indistinguishability; our findings indicate that the capabilities of generative AI models have outpaced people’s expectations of AI, even as the use of generative language models like ChatGPT have become increasingly commonplace.</p></div></div></section>
