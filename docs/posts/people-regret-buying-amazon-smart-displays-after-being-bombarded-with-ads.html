    <h1>People regret buying Amazon smart displays after being bombarded with ads</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <p>Amazon Echo Show owners are reporting an uptick in advertisements on their smart displays.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s Echo Show smart displays have <a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q0000DYDLBvSQP/why-is-my-echo-show-suddenly-showing-ads-and-how-do-i-turn-them-off">previously shown</a> ads through the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21213736011">Shopping Lists</a> feature, as well as advertising for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/get-ready-for-alexa-skills-pop-up-ads-on-your-amazon-echo-show/">Alexa skills</a>. Additionally, Echo Shows may play audio ads when users listen to Amazon Music on Alexa.</p>
<p>However, reports on Reddit (examples <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0y0rw/ads_this_will_cause_me_to_unplug_all_show_devices/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nku3j6/ads_after_alarm/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nj0kxc/echo_show_wont_stop_advertising_amazon_plus/">here</a>) and from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/797672/amazon-echo-show-ads-alexa-plus">The Verge’s</a> Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, who owns more than one Echo Show, suggest that Amazon has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nuucj0/how_are_we_still_getting_ads_on_alexa/">increased the amount of ads</a> it shows on its smart displays&#39; home screens. The Echo Show’s apparent increase in ads is pushing people to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0y0rw/ads_this_will_cause_me_to_unplug_all_show_devices/">stop</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nlzdbg/comment/nf92nhm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">using</a> or even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0o3an/question_im_returning_my_echo_show_because_it_has/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">return</a> their Echo Shows.</p>
<p>The smart displays have also started showing ads for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/">Alexa+</a>, the new generative AI version of Amazon&#39;s Alexa voice assistant. Ads for the subscription-based Alexa+ are reportedly taking over Echo Show screens, even though the service is still in Early Access.</p>
<p>“This is getting ridiculous and I&#39;m about to just toss the whole thing and move back to Google,” one Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nj0kxc/echo_show_wont_stop_advertising_amazon_plus/">said</a> of the “full-volume” ads for Alexa+ on their Echo Show.</p>
<p>The Verge’s Tuohy reported seeing ads on one (but not all) of her Echo Shows for the first time this week and said ads sometimes show when the display is set to show personal photos. She reported seeing ads for “elderberry herbal supplements, Quest sports chips, and tabletop picture frames.&#34;</p>
<p>Users are unable to disable the home screen ads. When reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson told Ars Technica:</p>
