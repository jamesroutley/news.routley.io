If you get a message that states, “This link will no longer work in the near future”, the link won&#39;t work after August 25 and we recommend transitioning to another URL shortener if you haven’t already.</p><p data-block-key="a7vup">All other goo.gl links will be preserved and will continue to function as normal. To check if your link will be retained, visit the link today. If your link redirects you without a message, it will continue to work.</p></div>
