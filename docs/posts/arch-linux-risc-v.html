    <h1>Arch Linux RISC-V</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>This is an Arch Linux port to the RISC-V architecture.</p>

<h3>Hardware Support</h3>
<p>The hardware baseline is RV64GC and the ABI is lp64d.</p>
<p>Currently QEMU, HiFive Unmatched, HiFive Unleashed and PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit are officially supported.</p>
<p>The [unsupported] repository has a linux-sophgo package for experimental Milk-V Pioneer (SG2042) support.
</p><p>Other boards (except those with AX45MP) may work with a BSP or custom kernel.</p>

<h3>Porting Goal</h3>
<p>This port applies patches on top of Arch Linux&#39;s source packages. All our patches are maintained in the patch
repository below.</p>
<p>The long term goal is to upstream our patches as much as possible, so that riscv64
(riscv64gc) could be added to Arch Linux itself as an alternative architecture.</p>
