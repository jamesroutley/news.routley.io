    <h1>Should We Celebrate Acquisitions?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>One of my favourite companies <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/blog/postmark-and-dmarc-digests-acquired-by-activecampaign">got acquired</a>. I’m always trying to figure out if I want to be happy when a company gets acquired.</p>
<p>It’s usually acquired by a much bigger company. Founders and investors make a lot of money. Everyone looks ecstatic and everyone congratulates everyone else. But why?</p>
<p>Why should we be happy they got acquired? Presumably, because of the money they made.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley’s imaginary is based on that we improve the world with software and technology. Money is irrelevant. What matters is to advance as society.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I started viewing the process of building a company as providing a service. Not as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(systems_architecture)">system service</a> but as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service">community service</a>. Someone who creates a company is someone going out of their way to help people. In return for the product/service provided, these people pay money. Both to keep providing it and as a thank you.</p>
<p>So, when this model ends, I think it’s a sad day. People who really cared about something and dedicated themselves to it, stopped. Maybe they got tired. It’s ok to get tired. But probably not a cause for celebration.</p>
