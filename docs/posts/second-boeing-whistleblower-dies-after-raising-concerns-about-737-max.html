Spirit AeroSystems is a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/boeing-alaska-airlines-everything-b2491091.html">Boeing</a> supplier, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/whistleblower-josh-dean-of-boeing-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-has-died/"><em>The Seattle Times</em></a> reports. </p><p>Dean, 45, had an active lifestyle and was believed to be in good health prior to his “sudden” death on Tuesday, following the onset of a sudden, fast-moving <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/infection">infection</a>. He was stricken with Influenza B and MRSA, and developed pneumonia, according to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fox59.com/news/national-world/boeing-supplier-whistleblower-joshua-dean-dead-at-45/"><em>Fox59</em></a>. </p><p>He spent two weeks in critical condition before he died on Tuesday. </p><p>“Our thoughts are with Josh Dean’s family. This sudden loss is stunning news here and for his loved ones,” Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino said. </p><p>Dean’s death is the latest point on a the timeline of strange mishaps that have plagued Boeing for more than a year. </p><p>On 5 January, a door plug panel on a new Alaska Airlines’ Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/americas/boeing-alaska-airline-faa-investigation-b2477359.html">tore off</a> while it was cruising at 16,000 feet.</p><p>The FAA subsequently grounded 171 of the company’s MAX 9 aircrafts for review. It has also prohibited the company from increasing production of the MAX series aircraft, and has ordered it to develop a comprehensive plan to address “systemic quality-control issues”.</p><p>The Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the Alaska Airlines incident. The investigation will centre on whether Boeing complied with a 2021 settlement it agreed to after a pair of deadly crashes that were attributed to faults in its 737 MAX Maneuvering Characterists Augmentation System, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/03/10/doj-opens-new-criminal-investigation-of-boeing-737-max-incident/?sh=2cbfe964a2b2"><em>Forbes</em></a> reports.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Joshua Dean, 45, was a whislteblower who raised concerns over a Boeing supplier, Spirit AeroSystems.

He insisted that the company needed a more “transparent” approach going forward.</p><p>“We must continue to respond to this accident with humility and complete transparency. We also must inculcate a total commitment to safety and quality at every level of our company,” Mr Calhoun wrote.</p><p>Dean’s actions suggest he agreed that more transparency was needed in the industry; he was fired from Spirit Aerosystems in April 2023, and he complained later that his termination was in retaliation for raising issues with the company over aircraft safety. </p><p>He said that “serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line” had taken place at Spirit, in a complaint to the Federal Aviation Administration. </p><div><figure><div><div id="video_holder"><div></div></div></div><figcaption>Second Boeing Whistleblower Dies Following Sudden Illness</figcaption></figure></div><p>He is the second whistleblower to die this year after coming forward about safety issues in the aviation manufacturing industry. </p><p>Boeing whistleblower John Barnett, 62, was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/boeing-ap-pete-buttigieg-alaska-airlines-national-transportation-safety-board-b2511004.html">found dead in his truck</a> in a hotel parking lot in South Carolina in March. </p><p>Barnett spoke out about alleged safety problems at the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/boeing-latam-airlines-stock-price-b2510919.html">aircraft manufacturing giant </a>and had been giving evidence in a lawsuit against the company prior to his death.</p><p>He had voiced safety concerns about the airline’s manufacturing facilities and gave his initial testimony just days before he was found dead. His death appeared to be from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Charleston County coroner told <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703">BBC News</a>.</p><p>Barnett alleged that in 2019, Boeing intentionally used defective parts in its planes and warned that passengers on its 787 Dreamliner might face a lack of oxygen if a sudden decompression occurred.</p><p>At that time, Boeing refuted his assertions, stating that the company follows the strictest safety protocols.</p><p>According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2024/03/09/justice-department-investigation-boeing-max-accident/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been conducting interviews with witnesses, including the crew on the Alaska Air flight, as part of its investigation. </p><div><figure><figcaption>John Barnett was found dead in his truck in a hotel parking lot in South Carolina in March<span> <!-- -->(<!-- -->@Megatron_ron/Twitter<!-- -->)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Mr Barnett had been staying at a hotel while in town to provide a deposition in the case.</p><p>His attorney, Brian Knowles, told <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/03/12/boeing-whistleblower-attorney-john-barnett-not-suicidal-investigation-lawsuit/"><em>TMZ</em></a> that he had doubts about the circumstances of his death.</p><p>“Today is a tragic day,” Mr Knowles wrote in an email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/boeing-whistleblower-found-dead-in-charleston-after-break-in-depositions/"><em>Corporate Crime Reporter</em></a>. “John had been back and forth for quite some time getting prepared. The defence examined him for their allowed seven hours under the rules on Thursday.”</p><p>Mr Knowles also represented Dean. He told <em>The Seattle Times</em> he did not want to speculate on the nature of his clients’ deaths, but stressed the importance of whistleblowers. </p><p>“Whistleblowers are needed. They bring to light wrongdoing and corruption in the interests of society. It takes a lot of courage to stand up,” the attorney said. “It’s a difficult set of circumstances. Our thoughts now are with John’s family and Josh’s family.”</p></div></div>
