      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Slipped and tucked stitches introduce small areas of deformation that
        compound and result in emergent textures on knitted fabrics. When used
        together with color changes and ladders, these can also produce dramatic
        colorwork and openwork effects. However, designing slip and tuck
        colorwork patterns is challenging due to the complex interactions
        between operations, yarns, and deformations. We present KnitScape, a
        browser-based tool for design and simulation of stitch patterns for
        knitting. KnitScape provides a design interface to specify 1) operation
        repeats, 2) color changes, and 3) needle positions. These inputs are
        used to build a graph of yarn topology and run a yarn-level spring
        simulation. This enables visualization of the deformation that arises
        from slip and tuck operations. Through its design tool and simulation,
        KnitScape enables rapid exploration of a complex colorwork design space.
        We demonstrate KnitScape with a series of example swatches.
