        <p>Ok, clickbait title out of the way. Lets talk about blockchains.</p>

        <p>
          A blockchain, put simply, is a way of building distributed consensus
          in a trustless system. It allows multiple entities (i.e. computers) to
          collaborate and do computations without needing to trust in either a
          central authority or in each other, as every computation must be
          verified before it is accepted. There are many ways of building this
          consensus (e.g. proof of work, proof of stake, etc) but ultimately
          blockchains are all about collaboration without trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          This can be incredibly useful, and is necessary for some applications.
          For example, building a banking system typically requires trust, but
          with blockchains it is possible for many entities to collaborate on
          how much currency is in which account without needing to trust each
          other. Smart contracts generalize this further and allow entities to
          collaborate on any arbitrary computation.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, not all applications require a blockchain, and in my opinion,
          most of them do not. Most applications simply do not require global
          consensus in order to operate. Take identity, for example. The only
          entities that need to collaborate are the user and the site the user
          is logging into. The user can easily create a single, decentralized
          identity with decades old technology: public keys. The user&#39;s public
          key uniquely identifies them, and only the user can authenticate with
          it because they are the only one with their private key. A blockchain
          simply does not need to be part of this transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach can be extended massively by allowing other entities to
          sign off on that public key. Services such as social networks could
          link the user&#39;s account to their global identity by providing a signed
          document proving the user&#39;s public key is tied to a certain account,
          or users can do this on their own by providing a
          <a href="https://keybase.io/">public cryptographic proof on their account</a>. Users can link other public keys, such as blockchain credentials,
          to their global identity in such a way as well. For almost every use
          case, global, trustless consensus is not needed, and thus a blockchain
          is not needed. Hell, even Ethereum now allows you to log in using
          <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">only your public/private keys</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well then, you might ask, why are we running around logging in with
          email+password, or god forbid, Login with Facebook? Why aren&#39;t we
          logging into everywhere with public keys, if the technology is so old?
          Well, it&#39;s not because we didn&#39;t have blockchain technology before,
          but because
          <strong>decentralized identity was not the goal before</strong>. One
          of the most promising and new developments in recent years has been a
          renewed interest in building decentralized systems of all types. Many
          people are looking into building a system of decentralized identity
          and giving that control back to the users.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are entering a new world with a new focus on giving users control
          over their data, their identity, and their systems. We are building
          <a href="https://www.ipfs.io/">distributed filesystems</a>,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">distributed identity</a>,
          and yes, blockchains. I think oftentimes we end up seeing only the
          blockchain technology due to the headlines and the financial
          investment, but distributed systems as a whole are taking off in a
          big, big way.
