    <h1>A Bayesian View of Amazon Resellers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I was buying a used book through Amazon this evening. Three resellers offered the book at essentially the same price. Here were their ratings:</p>
<ul>
<li>94% positive out of 85,193 reviews</li>
<li>98% positive out of 20,785 reviews</li>
<li>99% positive out of 840 reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Which reseller is likely to give the best service? Before you assume it’s the seller with the highest percentage of positive reviews, consider the following simpler scenario.</p>
<p>Suppose one reseller has 90 positive reviews out of 100. The other reseller has two reviews, both positive. You could say one has 90% approval and the other has 100% approval, so the one with 100% approval is better. But this doesn’t take into consideration that there’s much more data on one than the other. You can have some confidence that 90% of the first reseller’s customers are satisfied. You don’t really know about the other because you have only two data points.</p>

<p>A Bayesian view of the problem naturally incorporates the amount of data as well as its average. Let θ<em><sub>A</sub></em> be the probability of a customer being satisfied with company <em>A</em>‘s service. Let θ<em><sub>B</sub></em> be the corresponding probability for company <em>B</em>. Suppose before we see any reviews we think all ratings are equally likely. That is, we start with a uniform prior distribution θ<em><sub>A</sub></em> and θ<em><sub>B</sub></em>. A uniform distribution is the same as a beta(1, 1) distribution.</p>
<p>After observing 90 positive reviews and 10 negative reviews, our posterior estimate on θ<em><sub>A</sub></em> has a beta(91, 11) distribution. After observing 2 positive reviews, our posterior estimate on θ<em><sub>B</sub></em> has a beta(3, 1) distribution. The probability that a sample from θ<em><sub>A</sub></em> is bigger than a sample from θ<em><sub>B</sub></em> is 0.713. That is, there’s a good chance you’d get better service from the reseller with the lower average approval rating.</p>

<p>Now back to our original question. Which of the three resellers is most likely to satisfy a customer?</p>
<p>Assume a uniform prior on θ<em><sub>X</sub></em>, θ<em><sub>Y</sub></em>, and θ<em><sub>Z</sub></em>, the probabilities of good service for each reseller. The posterior distributions on these variables have distributions beta(80082, 5113), beta(20370, 417), and beta(833, 9).</p>
<p>These beta distributions have such large parameters that we can approximate them by normal distributions with the same mean and variance. (A beta(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) random variable has mean <em>a</em>/(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>) and variance <em>ab</em>/((<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)<sup>2</sup>(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>+1)).) The variable with the most variance, θ<em><sub>Z</sub></em>, has standard deviation 0.003. The other variables have even smaller standard deviation. So the three distributions are highly concentrated at their mean values with practically non-overlapping support. And so a sample from θ<em><sub>X</sub></em> or θ<em><sub>Y</sub></em> is unlikely to be higher than a sample from θ<em><sub>Z</sub></em>.</p>
<p>In general, going by averages alone works when you have a lot of customer reviews. But when you have a small number of reviews, going by averages alone could be misleading.</p>
