							<h2>About This Game</h2>
							<p>Replicube is an open-ended programming puzzle game/toy about writing code to replicate 3D voxel-based objects.</p><h2>SOLVE PUZZLES</h2><p><img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3401490/extras/rc-steam-gif-camera-smaller.gif.gif?t=1746989726"/></p><p>The main content of the game involves trying to match a reference object by working out code that will replicate it.  There is no &#34;right answer&#34;, if your code produces the same object, it&#39;s correct!</p><h2>PLAY AROUND</h2><p><img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3401490/extras/rc-steam-gif-tv-smaller.gif.gif?t=1746989726"/></p><p>You can always open the voxel tool in &#34;free edit&#34; mode and just play around, making whatever you want.  In addition to the main 3D voxel editor, there is also a bonus 2D image editor for writing code to generate 2D images and GIF animations.  You can even save your image creation as the background image in the &#34;OS&#34; interface of the game!</p><h2>JOIN THE COMMUNITY</h2><p><img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3401490/extras/rc-steam-gif-histogram.gif?t=1746989726"/></p><p>Every puzzle has 2 leaderboards, measuring source code size, and execution efficiency.  Often optimizing for one will be at the expense of the other.  If you enjoy trying to squeeze a<i> bit more</i> out of your code, the leaderboards are waiting!</p><p><img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3401490/extras/replicube-steam-community.gif.gif?t=1746989726"/></p><p>There is also an in-game online forum where players can share their own voxel creations, and even challenge other players to try to recreate them, all presented in an old-school online forum wrapper.</p><h2>EXPORT YOUR CREATIONS</h2><p>Generated 3D voxel objects can be exported into common formats to bringing into other 3D creation tools.</p><p>Generated 2D images and animations can also be exported as png or gif for sharing online.</p>						</div>
