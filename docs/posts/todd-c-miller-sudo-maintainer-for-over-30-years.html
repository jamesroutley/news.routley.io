    <p>Note: this page tends be neglected and is only updated occasionally.
The links to the left are where the useful bits are hiding.</p>
<p>For the past 30+ years I’ve been the maintainer of
<a href="https://www.sudo.ws">sudo</a>.  I’m currently in search of a sponsor
to fund continued sudo maintenance and development.  If you or
your organization is interested in sponsoring sudo, please let me
know.</p>
<p>I also work on <a href="https://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, though my I’m
not as active there as I once was.</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve made large contributions to
<a href="https://github.com/vixie/cron">ISC cron</a>, among other projects.</p>
