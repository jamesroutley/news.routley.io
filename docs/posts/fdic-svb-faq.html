                        On Friday, March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation and the FDIC was named Receiver. No advance notice is given to the public when a financial institution is closed. The FDIC has
                        created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB) to facilitate the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank. </p>

                            <p>All depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023. The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week. Uninsured depositors will receive
                                a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds. As the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors.</p>

            <p><strong>About Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB)</strong> <br/>
              <p>To protect the depositors, the FDIC created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB), which will remain open until <%AcctDate%> to allow depositors access to their insured deposits and time to open accounts at other insured institutions.</p>
  		
<p>Checks for insured balances of CDs and IRAs will be sent to your United States address of record with <%FailedBank%>. These will be mailed no later than <%MailDate%>.  If your address of record with <%FailedBank%> is NOT within the US, an outbound wire transfer can be setup to transfer your insured deposit balance to another financial institution.</p> 
  		
<p>Principal and interest on insured accounts, through <%DayClosingDate%>, are fully insured by the FDIC, up to the insurance limit of [$XXX.XX]. You will receive full payment for your insured account. Certain entitlements and different types of accounts can be insured for more than the [$XXX.XX] limit. IRA funds are insured separately from other types of accounts, up to a [$XXX.XX] limit.</p>
  		
<p>All accounts that exceed the [$XXX.XX] insurance limit and/or all accounts that appear to be related and exceed this limit are reviewed by the FDIC to determine their ownership and insurance coverage. If you think you might have uninsured deposits, you should call the FDIC Call Center to arrange for a telephone interview with a Claims Agent at <%CallCenter%>. The Claim Agent may direct you to download and submit a particular form that will assist in expediting the processing of your claim.</p>
