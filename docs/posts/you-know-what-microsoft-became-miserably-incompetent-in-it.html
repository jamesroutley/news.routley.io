<p>You know what: Microsoft became miserably incompetent in IT.</p>



<p>I develop open-source code. But that never made me one of the “I hate proprietary software or IT giant corporations” types. I always saw the nice things that Microsoft offered to its users; I saw not only downsides in its products. And I also used (and continue to use) things created by it: Windows to start with (and I develop there, being able to debug and address issues specific to the platform that most of our users use); but also its email service for personal mail.</p>



<p>This Monday, I decided to send something to LibreOffice dev mailing list. Something I do from time to time, you know. Not too fascinating, right?</p>



<p>Well, this time, it turned out, Microsoft decided to teach me to fear them. Thunderbird shown me a message, that the mail couldn’t be sent (well, not a problem: will re-try again…), but then I found myself logged off, with “Your account has been blocked” message. They decided, that I violated <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/default.aspx">their service agreement</a>!</p>

<p>FTR: <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2025-July/093574.html">here is the mail</a>. I was able to send it using another tech giant’s mail service. You may see that it’s full of links. Yes, that’s true; I prefer to provide references to my words. But tell me where was it violating anything in MS agreement?</p>



<p>OK, they have a stupid AI that is worse than good old filters. OK, they made it react immediately, as an undoubted authority. But that’s not a big problem, right? They provide a way to appeal! Let me do that.</p>



<p>And of course, they ask for the phone, and I provide it, just to get a nice reply:</p>

<p>And guess what: there is <em>no other method</em>!</p>



<p>OK! Let’s ask their support. (I am approaching to the point that fascinated me most.) I found a link to “Contact Microsoft Support” on the “Troubleshooting verification code issues” page; and after some automatic answers there, which didn’t answer my problem, I finally got a button telling me … tada …</p>

<p>Yes, you got it right. “Here is a page where we discuss problems signing in. You attempted our FAQ suggestions? You still can’t sign in? No problem! Contact our Support team, and we will solve your problem is a minute! But first, please sign in to continue.”</p>



<p>Heh. I used my wife’s account to contact support. And then I was given a very secret link to an appeal form, where I could file a support ticket. And the next morning, I got a message! Yay! It told me to do something! Let me try! What is that they tell me to do? Reading… hmm… go to sign-in page, and when they tell me that my account is blocked, provide a phone number? Wasn’t it exactly the thing I attempted and failed, and told them about that? But hey, they obviously fixed that problem overnight, they couldn’t just send me the useless instructions, right? Or could they?</p>



<p>They could.</p>



<p>They just ignored my description. They repeated the useless instructions, without taking care to check what the problem was. And they closed the ticket automatically. It has been resolved, you know.</p>



<p>I still am in the process. I filed another ticket, which they didn’t care to answer. I am still hopeful.</p>



<p>But this, once an IT tech leader, became utterly incompetent in IT. And for me, it’s a pity.</p>
