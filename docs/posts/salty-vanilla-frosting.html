    <h1>Salty Vanilla Frosting</h1>
    
    <h5 id="makes-about-4-cups865genough-for-1-large-sheet-cake-2-smaller-sheet-cakes-or-one-9-inch-layer-cake">Makes about 4 cups/865g/enough for 1 large sheet cake, 2 smaller sheet cakes, or one 9-inch layer cake</h5><img src="https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/2026/01/1763-CB-133A-ALISON-ROMAN-SWEET-ENOUGH-084-COCONUT_CAKE_135.jpg" alt="Salty Vanilla Frosting"><p>This is a sort of hybrid basic-buttercream/cream cheese frosting, combining the best of both worlds. It&#x2019;s salty, it&#x2019;s rich, it goes with everything, and if I&#x2019;m forced to choose between this and chocolate, it&#x2019;s this every time. No questions asked. Great for any cake in <u>Sweet Enough</u>, even the ice cream cakes&#x2014;the texture is perfection even when frozen. What more could you ask for?</p><h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2 sticks/8 ounces/225g <strong>unsalted butter</strong>, at room temperature</li><li>2 (8-ounce/225g) packages <strong>cream cheese</strong>, at room temperature</li><li>2 &#xBD; cups/300g <strong>powdered sugar</strong></li><li>&#xBD; teaspoon/2g <strong>kosher salt</strong>, plus more to taste</li><li><strong>Vanilla bean</strong>, halved lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li></ul><h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2><ol><li>In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle (or in a bowl using an electric hand mixer), beat the butter on medium-high speed until light, fluffy, and very spreadable, 5&#x2013;7 minutes.</li><li>Add the cream cheese, a little knob at a time, and continue to beat until well blended, another 2&#x2013;3 minutes.</li><li>Add the powdered sugar and beat until combined. Add the salt and scrape in the vanilla seeds (or add the extract) and continue to beat, scraping down the sides occasionally, until extremely smooth, fluffy, and spreadable, 3&#x2013;4 minutes. Give it a taste and season with more salt, if needed.</li></ol><p><strong>DO AHEAD: </strong>The frosting is really best used right after it&#x2019;s made for optimal spreadability, but it can be made 1 week ahead and kept refrigerated. Bring to room temperature and give it another spin in the mixer to properly soften before using.</p>
