  <section><p>Over the past two months I have been sharing work here and on
<a href="https://github.com/dmoerner/etracker">Github</a> on a new BitTorrent tracker
<code>etracker</code>. I’m happy to share that a public demo is now available:
<a href="https://etracker.moerner.com/">https://etracker.moerner.com/</a>. The public demo is deployed with a small
infohash allowlist consisting of recent Linux ISOs. An expanded frontend with
support for suggesting allowed infohashes is under development.</p>
<p>To briefly summarize: <code>etracker</code> is a tracker designed to contribute to solving
free-riding problems in the BitTorrent protocol at the tracker level. Clients
which behave poorly (failing to seed snatches; failing to upload more than they
download) receive proportionately less peers from the tracker than clients
which are well-behaved. New BitTorrent clients to the tracker receive a full
complement of peers, so there is no startup penalty when initially joining the
tracker.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on Github, and in this <a href="https://moerner.com/static/presentation-etracker.pdf">set of
slides</a> from a
presentation at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>.</p>
