<p>Presenting a product or app demo is almost synonymous to “showing” something on the UI — a user journey, page navigation, slick modals, responsive layouts, and so on. However, the demos need not contain a visual aspect (e.g., API development, data engineering, CI/CD). In such cases, there’s no “UI” to show which makes it tricky to convey the message to the audience.</p>
<p>I have been a reviewer of numerous such “Backend demos” where the presentation was often underwhelming, not because of the content itself, but a lack of presentation medium.</p>
<p>&lt;aside&gt;
💡 Presenting a Backend demo to a non-technical audience becomes especially challenging as you have finite amount of time to hold their attention and deliver the message without losing them in technical jargon.</p>
<p>&lt;/aside&gt;</p>
<h3>Here are my top 5 tips to level up your next Backend demo.</h3>
<h2>1. Start with a diagram</h2>
<p>Any kind of Backend demo (API server, data pipeline, CI/CD)  should start with an overall architecture diagram. This helps the audience to,</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand how different components work together</li>
<li>Identify the component being demo’d currently</li>
<li>Provide context and facilitate effective discussions</li>
</ol>
<p>There are tons of tools available in the market to create diagrams depending on the use case (e.g., ER diagrams, Flowcharts, Cloud diagrams). My favorites include <a href="http://Draw.io">Draw.io</a> (low-fidelity) and Figma (high-fidelity).</p>
