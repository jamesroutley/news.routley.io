    <h1>Oral microbiome sequencing after taking probiotics</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Recently, a friend recommended <a href="https://www.biogaia.com/products/biogaia-prodentis/">BioGaia Prodentis</a> to me.
It is a DTC oral probiotic you can buy online that is supposedly good for oral health.
I thought it would be interesting to do some sequencing to see what, if anything, it did to my oral microbiome.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.booleanbiotech.com/images/oral_biogaia.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
<p><em>BioGaia Prodentis is <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/BioGaia-Prodentis-Clinically-Proven-Dental-Probiotics-Teeth-Gums-Promotes-Good-Oral-Health-Gut-Too-30-Mint-Flavored-Lozenges-1-Pack/175541687">available online</a> for $20 or less for a month&#39;s supply</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.biogaia.com/collections/all">BioGaia</a> has a fascinating story.
They are a Swedish company, founded over 30 years ago, that exclusively sells probiotics DTC. 
They have developed multiple strains of <em>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</em>, mainly for gut and oral health.
They apparently sell well! Their <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/european-market-activity/shares/biog-b?id=TX184">market cap</a> is around $1B—impressive for a consumer biotech.</p>
<p>Going in, I expected scant evidence for any real benefits to their probiotics, but the data (<a href="https://www.biogaia.com/pages/probiotic-innovation">over 250 clinical studies</a>) is much more complete than I expected.</p>
<!--
They have been involved in .
I asked [Edison](https://platform.edisonscientific.com/) to assess the BioGaia literature.
Edison said the results were "reasonable, legitimate, and generally trustworthy".
-->

<p>Most notably, their gut probiotic, <a href="https://www.biogaia.com/products/protectis-baby-drops">Protectis</a>,
seems to have a significant effect on preventing
<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10026-necrotizing-enterocolitis">Necrotizing Enterocolitis</a> (NEC) in premature babies.
According to their <a href="https://ibtherapeutics.com/ibt-is-addressing-urgent-medical-needs-in-the-premature-infant/">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5-10% of the smallest premature infants develop NEC, a potentially lethal disorder in which portions of the bowel undergo tissue death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In March 2025, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to <a href="https://ibtherapeutics.com/press-releases/ibt-is-granted-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-its-drug-candidate/">IBP-9414</a>,
an <em>L. reuteri</em> probiotic developed by BioGaia spinout <a href="https://ibtherapeutics.com">IBT</a>.</p>
<!--
From a recent [review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8306447/):
>Conclusion: Currently, probiotics are widely used to prevent and treat numerous gastrointestinal disorders. In our opinion, L. reuteri meets all the requirements to be considered a safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious probiotic that is able to contribute to the beneficial effects on gut-human health, preventing and treating many gastrointestinal symptoms, and speeding up the recovery and discharge of patients accessing the emergency department.

<p>This is not specifically for the oral health product, but it&#39;s for sure more science than I expected to see going in.</p>
<h3>Prodentis</h3>
<p>BioGaia Prodentis contains two strains of <em>L. reuteri</em>: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/43393324">DSM 17938</a>
and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/?term=ATCC%20PTA%205289">ATCC PTA 5289</a>.
The claimed benefits include fresher breath, healthier gums, and outcompeting harmful bacteria.</p>

<p>Many readers will be familiar with <a href="https://plasmidsaurus.com/">Plasmidsaurus</a>.
Founded in 2021, the team took a relatively simple idea:
use massively multiplexed Oxford Nanopore (ONT) to offer complete plasmid sequencing with one day turnaround for $15,
and scaled it.
Plasmidsaurus quickly became part of biotech&#39;s core infrastructure, and spread like wildfire.
It also inspired multiple copycats.</p>
<p>Compared to Illumina, ONT is faster and has much longer reads, but lower throughput and lower accuracy.
This profile is a great fit to many sequencing problems like plasmid QC, where you only need megabases of sequences, but want an answer within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Over time, Plasmidsaurus has been adding services, including genome sequencing, RNA-Seq, and microbiome sequencing,
all based on ONT sequencing.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.booleanbiotech.com/images/oral_plasmidsaurus_list.png" width="100%"/></p>
<p><em>Plasmidsaurus accepts many kinds of sample for microbiome sequencing</em></p>
<p>I used their <a href="https://plasmidsaurus.com/microbiome">16S sequencing product</a>, which costs $45 for ~5000 reads, plus $15 for DNA extraction.
16S sequencing is an efficient way to amplify and sequence a small amount of DNA (the ubiquitous 16S region)
and be able to assign reads to specific species or even strains.</p>
<p>This experiment cost me $240 for four samples, and I got data back in around a week.
It&#39;s very convenient that I no longer have to do my <a href="https://blog.booleanbiotech.com/human-genome-at-home">own</a> <a href="https://blog.booleanbiotech.com/sequencing-at-home-with-flongle">sequencing</a>.
As a side note, you can pay more for more than 5000 reads, but unless you want information on very rare strains (&lt;&lt;1% frequency),
this is a waste of money.</p>
<p>Sample collection is simple: take 100-250 µL of saliva and mix with 500 µL of <a href="https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/dna-rna-shield">Zymo DNA/RNA Shield</a>
(which I also had to buy for around $70.) You also need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DYWX8Q2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title">2 mL screwtop tubes</a> to ship in.</p>
<p>The reads are high quality for nanopore sequencing, with a median Q score of 23 (99%+ accuracy).
This is more than sufficient accuracy for this experiment.
The read length is very tightly distributed around 1500 nt (the length of a typical 16S region).</p>
<p>The results provided by Plasmidsaurus include taxonomy tables, per-read assignments, and some basic plots.
I include a download of the results at the end of this article, as well as the FASTQ files.</p>

<p>The main idea of the experiment was to see if any <em>L. reuteri</em> would colonize by the end of 30 days of probiotic use,
and if so, whether it would persist beyond that.
I collected four saliva samples:</p>

<p><em>Heatmap of the top 20 species. All species assignments were done by <a href="https://plasmidsaurus.com/technical-documentation/microbiome">Plasmidsaurus</a></em></p>
<h2>Did <em>L. reuteri</em> colonize?</h2>
<p>There was no <em>L. reuteri</em> found in any of the samples.
I did a manual analysis to check for any possible misassignments,
but the closest read was only 91% identical to either <em>L. reuteri</em> strain.</p>
<p>The probiotic either (a) didn&#39;t colonize the oral cavity;
(b) was present only transiently while actively taking the lozenges;
(c) was below the detection threshold.</p>
<p>Probiotics are generally bad at colonizing, which is why you have to keep taking them.
Still, I was surprised not to see a single <em>L. reuteri</em> read in there.</p>
<h2>What actually changed?</h2>
<p>Even though the probiotic itself didn&#39;t show up,
the oral microbiome did change quite a lot.</p>
<p>The most striking change was a massive increase in <em>S. salivarius</em>.
<em>S. salivarius</em> went from essentially absent to ~20% of my oral microbiome on the last day.
However, this happened <em>one week after</em> I stopped taking the probiotic,
so it&#39;s very unclear if it is related.</p>

<p>We see <em>S. mitis</em> decreasing as <em>S. salivarius</em> increases, 
while the total Streptococcus fraction stayed roughly stable.
It&#39;s possible one species replaced the other within the same ecological niche.</p>
<p><em>S. salivarius</em> is itself a probiotic species.
The strain <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1449041/">BLIS K12</a>
was isolated from a healthy New Zealand child and is sold commercially for oral health.
It produces bacteriocins that kill <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (strep throat bacteria).</p>
<p>At the same time, <em>V. tobetsuensis</em> increased in abundance from 2.1% to 5.7%.
Veillonella bacteria can&#39;t eat sugar directly—they survive by consuming lactate that Streptococcus produces.
The <em>S. salivarius</em> bloom is plausibly feeding them.</p>

## A bacterial friendship dissolved

*Haemophilus parainfluenzae* and *Streptococcus mitis* are known to
[live adjacent to each other](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-021-01141-3)
in oral biofilms — they're positively correlated in healthy mouths.

Both decreased together in my samples.
The Haemophilus species (*H. parainfluenzae*, *H. parahaemolyticus*, *H. haemolyticus*)
collectively dropped from ~14% to ~7%, with some species disappearing entirely.

Interestingly, *H. parainfluenzae* is
[associated with good oral health](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11406952/),
not bad — so losing it isn't necessarily a win.
The oral microbiome shifted from Proteobacteria (Haemophilus) toward Firmicutes (Streptococcus).
-->

<h2>Are these changes real or intra-day variation?</h2>
<p>There was a lot more variation in species than I expected, especially comparing the two baseline samples. 
In retrospect, I should have taken multiple samples on the same day, and mixed them to smooth it out.</p>
<p>However, there is some light evidence that the variation I see is not just intra-day variation.
Specifically, there are several species that stay consistent in frequency across all samples:
e.g., <em>Neisseria subflava</em>, <em>Streptococcus viridans</em>, <em>Streptococcus oralis</em>.</p>
<!--
The *S. salivarius* increase shows variability **6x beyond baseline noise**,
strongly suggesting this is a real biological change, not random fluctuation.

**Caveat:** *S. mitis* was already highly variable at baseline (2% vs 16%),
so some species are naturally dynamic in the oral microbiome.
But the *S. salivarius* signal (0% → 19%) is unambiguous.

<ul>
<li><em>L. reuteri</em> didn&#39;t detectably colonize my mouth. Oral probiotics are surprisingly difficult to detect, even if you sample the same day as dosing.</li>
<li><em>S. salivarius</em> increased massively in abundance, but this increase happened after I stopped taking BioGaia</li>
<li>Microbiome sequencing can be used to assess oral health. None of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_complex">&#34;red complex&#34;</a> bacteria (<em>P. gingivalis</em>, <em>T. forsythia</em>, <em>T. denticola</em>) associated with gum disease were found in any sample.</li>
<li>The oral microbiome is dynamic, with huge swings in species abundance over a timeframe of just weeks</li>
<li>Microbiome sequencing is very easy and convenient these days thanks to Plasmidsaurus</li>
<li>Prodentis tastes good, may help with oral health, and I&#39;d consider taking it again</li>
