<p>In 2009, mechanical engineer Donald Scruggs received a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7631404B2/">patent</a> for a hermetically sealed coffin that can be screwed into the ground. David Friedman made <a href="https://ironicsans.substack.com/p/55-should-we-bury-you-head-first">a short documentary about Scruggs and his screw-in coffin</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I was with some friends having a couple of drinks and one of them mentioned he had to go talk to some people about an automatic grave digger, which meant a huge amount of dirt removal. And I said, “Why don’t we just make a big large carrot shaped thing with threads around it and screw it into the ground?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Scruggs says that burying someone in his coffin is “no more trouble than putting a fencepost in”.</p>
