<p>CityEngine is a stand-alone desktop application by Esri that allows users to <strong>create 3D data models</strong> for urban design and city planning.</p>
<p>Traditionally, whenever there was a large planned development in a city, there would be open houses with physical models.</p>
<p>But because of advancements in technology and 3D data models, CityEngine can help <strong>visualize proposed projects</strong> and streamline its review process.</p>
<p>Not only for cities of the present time, but it also could be for cities of the past and future as well. Let’s take a closer look at some of the capabilities and use cases of this urban planning software package.</p>
<h3>3D Buildings and Landscapes</h3>

<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to start from scratch because CityEngine comes equipped with the “Get Map Data Function”. This tool helps build usable 3D data like building footprints and streets from existing sources.</p>
<p>First, you pick an area of interest. Then, it automatically downloads an elevation surface, basemap, and <a href="https://gisgeography.com/openstreetmap-download-osm-data/">OpenStreetMap</a> street network. The tool has a set of procedural rules to quickly get you started and create a 3D representation from 2D GIS data.</p>
<p>From here, you can sketch proposed projects and buildings into your 3D city model. Additionally, you can <strong>apply textures</strong> and architectural details such as solar panels to buildings.</p>
<h3>CityEngine Capabilities and Use Cases</h3>
<p>CityEngine provides you with all the <strong>3D modeling tools</strong> to help you build interactive and immersive urban environments. For example, here are some of its capabilities and use cases:</p>

<h3>Computer-generated Architecture (CGA)</h3>

<p>The reason you may want to use CGA is to apply rules to alter designs based on the instructions set in the properties.</p>
<p>This will update how the <strong>output 3D models</strong> are generated from input shapes in CityEngine, which is a big time-saver for users. Then, if you want to compress compiled a CGA rule file (*.CGB), then you can use rule packages (*.RPK).</p>
<h3>What is CityEngine?</h3>
<p>CityEngine is an ideal desktop solution to <strong>build 3D models</strong> of any city, and evaluate scenarios side-by-side to know which one is best.</p>
<p>You can publish and share any feasibility study to integrate with ArcGIS Urban. Then, you can share for public feedback on what they want and improve.</p>
<p>It’s great for planning teams and working with citizens and developers to evaluate proposals and <strong>offer digital engagement</strong>. You can define thematic representations such as if it’s residential or commercial, and set rules for geometry, green spaces, and streets.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can import GIS information in CityEngine, use measuring tools, and get a framework that encourages feedback and supports collaboration.</p>
