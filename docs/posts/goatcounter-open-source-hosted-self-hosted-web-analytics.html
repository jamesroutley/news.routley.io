		identifiers and doesn&#39;t need a GDPR notice. Fine-grained <strong>control over
			which data is collected</strong>. Also see the <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy">privacy
			policy</a> and <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/gdpr">GDPR consent notices</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Lightweight</strong> and <strong>fast</strong>; adds just
			~3.5KB of extra data to your site. Also has JavaScript-free
			&#34;tracking pixel&#34; option, or you can use it from your application&#39;s
			middleware or <strong>import from logfiles</strong>.

			<strong>location</strong>, and <strong>screen size</strong>. Keep
			track of <strong>referring sites</strong> and

		<p><strong>Easy</strong>; if you&#39;ve been confused by the myriad of
			options and flexibility of Google Analytics and Matomo that you
			don&#39;t need then GoatCounter will be a breath of fresh air.</p>
		<p><strong>Accessibility</strong> is a high-priority feature, and the
			interface works well with assistive technology such as screen
			readers.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>100% committed to <strong>open source</strong>; you can see exactly
			what the code does and make improvements, or <strong>self-host</strong>
			it for any purpose. See <a href="https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter">the GitHub page</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Own your data</strong>; you can always export all data and
			<strong>cancel at any time</strong>.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
			<p>Integrate on your site with just <strong>a single script tag</strong>:</p>

		<p>The JavaScript integration is a good option for most, but you can
			also use a <strong>no-JavaScript image-based tracker</strong>,
			integrate in your <strong>backend middleware</strong>, or
			<strong>parse log files</strong>.</p>
