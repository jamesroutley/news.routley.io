    <h1>Tailwind CSS v4.0 Beta 1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>About eight months ago we <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha">open-sourced our progress</a> on Tailwind CSS v4.0. Hundreds of hours of fixing bugs, soul-crushing backward compatibility work, and troubleshooting Windows CI failures later, I’m excited to finally tag the first public beta release.</p>
<p>As I talked about when we published the first alpha, Tailwind CSS v4.0 is an all-new engine built for performance, and designed for the modern web.</p>
<ul role="list">
<li><strong>Built for performance</strong> — full builds in the new engine are up to 5x faster, and incremental builds are over 100x faster — and measured in microseconds.</li>
<li><strong>Unified toolchain</strong> — built-in import handling, vendor prefixing, and syntax transforms, with no additional tooling required.</li>
<li><strong>CSS-first configuration</strong> — a reimagined developer experience where you customize and extend the framework directly in CSS instead of a JavaScript configuration file.</li>
<li><strong>Designed for the modern web</strong> — built on native cascade layers, wide-gamut colors, and including first-class support for modern CSS features like container queries, <code>@starting-style</code>, popovers, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s so much more to say, but everything you need to get started is in the new beta documentation we published today:</p>
<p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta">Get started with Tailwind CSS v4.0 Beta 1 →</a></p>
<p>Start building and help us bullet-proof this thing for the stable release early in the new year.</p></div></div>
