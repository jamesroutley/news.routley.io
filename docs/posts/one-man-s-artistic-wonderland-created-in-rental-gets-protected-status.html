            A rental property secretly transformed by the eccentric <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/04/01/style/janet-sobel-abstract-surrealist-untold-art-history/index.html">artist </a>who lived there for three decades has been officially <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/03/21/asia/philippines-chocolate-hills-bohol-resort-controversy-intl-hnk/index.html">protected</a> by the British government, five years after his death.

            Shortly after Ron Gittins died in September 2019 at age 79, his family visited the apartment where he had lived since the mid-1980s in Birkenhead, just outside of Liverpool in northwest England. <strong> </strong>
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clumrih9j000a356hgxdx3982@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            What they found inside left them totally awestruck. Gittins had decorated almost every available surface in his home and painted numerous murals depicting historical scenes. Among the artworks were paintings set in Ancient Egypt and Georgian England, as well as fireplaces in the shape of a roaring lion’s head and a giant minotaur head, and there was even a Roman bread oven.
    </p>

            The discovery was particularly surprising as Gittins, who had limited formal artistic training, largely discouraged people from visiting his home, an apartment on the first floor of a Victorian duplex comprising three main rooms, a hallway, kitchen and bathroom.

            Williams said her uncle was “flamboyant” and “really outlandish” and was often seen around the town in costume, foraging for things that he would load into a shopping cart—such as bags of cement.

            Every room of the apartment was piled high with bags, boxes, books, art materials, food packaging and much more, as well as many hand-written notes, some of them in code.

            Soon afterward, Williams and her partner Chris Teasdale, who are themselves both artists and run a mobile exhibition space, started a campaign to save “Ron’s Place,” supported by friends, relatives, artists and others working within the world of culture and heritage.

            Together they established the Wirral Arts and Culture Community Land Trust (WACCLT), which launched a crowdfunding campaign through the website <a href="https://ronsplace.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ron’s Place</a>, applied for listed status and eventually bought the building last year.

            A spokesperson for Historic England explained the significance of the listing in an email to CNN, saying: “Including Ron’s Place on the National Heritage List for England allows us to highlight and celebrate what is significant about this extraordinary place, and helps us to make sure that any future changes to it do not result in the loss of its significance.”

            The property is currently undergoing work to “stabilize and preserve” the artwork for a “micro-museum,” while the trust is also hoping to convert the other apartments in the building to create a “holistic house of art and creativity,” according to Williams.

            An internationally recognized creative phenomenon, Outsider Art is described by Tate as “art that has a naïve quality, often produced by people who have not trained as artists or worked within the conventional structures of art production.” It is created without an audience in mind, usually by and for the artist themselves.

            In a press release, Historic England said: “The listing recognises Ron’s creation as an exemplar of large-scale Outsider Art in England, a creative phenomenon by artists motivated by their personal visions and often working in a compulsive way, usually with no formal training and outside the influence of the mainstream art world.”
