<strong> What were they thinking?: </strong>
   The story of the demo is as fascinating as the demo itself. Why did they do it, how did they do it, what was it like behind the scenes, who was in the audience, how was it received?

<p><a name="3a"></a>Most of what Doug and his team presented in 1968  was developed literally &#34;from scratch&#34; by a handful of researchers in the space of roughly  2 years. The system, called NLS, was used day in and day out by the research team for almost every aspect of their work – they were living and breathing the organization of the future and the future of work as an advanced pilot expedition, pushing the envelope of intelligence augmentation and collective IQ with transformative practices and paradigms alongside the rapidly evolving technology, using a special evolutionary bootstrap approach (<a data-fancybox="" href="https://youtu.be/agdPQuFr0yg?start=3">watch Doug describe the approach during the demo</a>). He reasoned that organizations would have to get alot more effective at tackling wicked problems, especially as we moved into a future of accelerated change and disruption at a scale never before experienced by business or society (yes, he predicted this in 1960 and adapted his strategic vision accordingly). The demo was essentially a snapshot in time on a continuum of cross-cutting breakthrough innovation in which they were rigorously prototyping the fast, fluid organization of the future, while co-evolving the technology in the service of that.

   Anniversary Events</strong></p>
 <p>Some fabulous anniversary events were later held  to commemorate the demo, with panel discussions by  Doug, members of his research team who participated in the 1968 demo, and invited guests discussing what it took to put on the demo that day, what it was like behind the scenes, and the significance of the work they were doing then and now. <br/>
