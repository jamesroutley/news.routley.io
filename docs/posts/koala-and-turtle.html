    <h1>Koala and Turtle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>If you’re a regular to my blog, you might have stumbled over my small stories of a turtle and a koala. In an effort to make this blog a bit more topical, I decided to give them their own cozy corner <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/koala-and-turtle">here</a>. They are protected from the weather there, not to worry!</p>
<p>I will still link to the posts in my feed and on the front page, but if you are just coming to maybe smile a little about shelled and furry shenanigans, then the link above is what you’re looking for!</p>
<p>I hope you stay dry and warm until my next blog post, unless that’s not your thing, then nevermind.</p>
