                <p>Tell us about the generative AI project you want to develop and how you’ll develop it responsibly. You don’t have to

                <h4>Become a finalist</h4>
                <p>10 teams will become finalists and be invited to an in-person event in San Francisco with some of the brightest
                thinkers, technologists, ethicists and business leaders to help you get your idea off the ground and unlock a variety of
                technology resources.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Win big</h4>
                <p>Attend workshops and talks about algorithmic bias, evaluation and transparency. Refine your pitch and get an opportunity
                to win a cash prize. Plus, get access to mentorship from leaders in the industry and meet like-minded innovators.</p>
