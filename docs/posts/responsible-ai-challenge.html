<p>The last few months it has become clear that AI is no longer our future, but our present. Some of the most exciting ideas for the future of both the internet and the world involve AI solutions. This didn’t happen overnight, decades of work have gone into this moment. Mozilla has been working to make sure that the future of AI benefits humanity in the right ways by investing in the <a href="https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/documents/Mozilla-Trustworthy_AI.pdf#page=64&amp;zoom=100,96,96">creation of trustworthy AI</a>.</p>



<p>We want entrepreneurs and builders to join us in creating a future where AI is developed through this responsible lens. That’s why we are relaunching our Mozilla Builders program with the Responsible AI Challenge.</p>



<p>At Mozilla, we believe in AI: in its power, its commercial opportunity, and its potential to solve the world’s most challenging problems. But now is the moment to make sure that it is developed responsibly to serve society. </p>



<p>If you want to build (or are already building) AI solutions that are ambitious but also ethical and holistic, the Mozilla Builder’s Responsible AI Challenge is for you. We will be inviting the top nominees to join a gathering of the brightest technologists, business leaders and ethicists working on trustworthy AI to help get your ideas off the ground. Participants will also have access to mentorship from some of the best minds in the industry, the ability to meet key contributors in this community, and an opportunity to win some funding for their project.</p>



<p>Mozilla will be investing $50,000 into the top applications and projects, with a grand prize of $25,000 for the first place winner. </p>



<p>For more information, please visit <a href="https://future.mozilla.org/builders-challenge">here</a>. Applications open up March 30, 2023. </p>
