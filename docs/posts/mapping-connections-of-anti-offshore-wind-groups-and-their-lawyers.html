But in addition to the looming risk of the federal government withdrawing funds, this endeavor towards non-reliance on fossil fuels is being continually threatened by private lawsuits. To better understand the legal challenges facing offshore wind, students at Brown University’s Climate and Development Lab compiled lawsuits and legal comments submitted to federal agencies about Northeast wind projects between January 2020 and May 2025. The research shows legal networks driving this opposition—revealing a </span><strong><span>coordinated effort to delay offshore wind projects and undermine public support.</span></strong></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-rerkn956"><span><span>Five major networks emerged, including private law firms and organizations with a track record of </span><strong><span>anti-environmental litigation</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>and</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>lobbying</span></strong><span>, and </span><strong><span>deep ties to fossil fuel interests</span></strong><span>. Though many of these lawsuits have been dismissed, they succeed in creating costly delays, and casting doubt for the public and policy-makers.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-dtxdi1021"><span><span>With new federal rollbacks on the horizon, understanding this legal resistance is more important than ever for this infant industry, and for climate action.
