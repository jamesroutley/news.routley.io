<p>Facing cross-examination at his criminal fraud trial yesterday, Sam Bankman-Fried repeatedly testified that he doesn&#39;t remember details about what he did and said while running cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried responded &#34;I&#39;m not sure&#34; or &#34;I can&#39;t recall&#34; to many questions from US prosecutor Danielle Sassoon, according to news reports from the trial.</p>
<p>Sassoon &#34;grilled Mr. Bankman-Fried about the inconsistencies between his public statements and how he ran his crypto empire before it collapsed spectacularly in November,&#34; a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/technology/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-trial-cross-examination.html">New York Times article</a> said. Bankman-Fried &#34;insisted that he couldn&#39;t remember much of what he had said publicly&#34; and &#34;added that he wasn&#39;t significantly involved in the hedge fund he founded, Alameda Research.&#34;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/30/news/sbf-claims-i-dont-recall-100-times-in-court-then-admits-his-hedge-fund-had-special-access-to-investor-money/">New York Post wrote</a> that Bankman-Fried answered with some variation of &#34;I can&#39;t recall&#34; over 100 times on Monday. But Sassoon &#34;presented jurors with a mountain of tweets, emails, and podcast clips revealing that the MIT grad did in fact say dozens of things he claimed not to have recalled,&#34; the article said.</p>
<p>&#34;After much pressing, Bankman-Fried eventually confirmed one aspect of prosecutors&#39; sprawling fraud and conspiracy case—that his hedge fund Alameda, in an unheard-of arrangement, could pull out billions of dollars it did not own from FTX using a near-unlimited line of credit,&#34; the New York Post wrote. &#34;I don&#39;t deny it,&#34; Bankman-Fried reportedly said. But he seemed to backtrack on that admission hours later, saying, &#34;I&#39;m not sure&#34; when asked if Alameda was allowed to exceed normal borrowing limits, the article said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Bankman-Fried reportedly drew a rebuke from Judge Lewis Kaplan when the defendant asked Sassoon to &#34;rephrase&#34; certain questions. &#34;Could you just answer the question instead of trying to ask the questioner what she is referring to?&#34; Kaplan told Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>&#34;When asked whether he was &#39;involved&#39; in trading at Alameda—a hedge fund he owned 90 percent of—Bankman-Fried replied, &#39;Depends what you mean by trading,&#39;&#34; the New York Post article said. &#34;Sassoon then showed jurors several instances of Bankman-Fried ordering lieutenants to make trades on Alameda.&#34;</p>
<h2>FTX/Alameda relationship probed</h2>
<p>In this trial, Bankman-Fried <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.202.0_2.pdf">faces</a> six charges for defrauding FTX&#39;s and Alameda&#39;s customers and investors and one charge for conspiracy to commit money laundering. The seven charges&#39; maximum sentences add up to 110 years. He faces five additional criminal charges in a separate trial scheduled for April 2024.</p>
<p>Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda Research CEO who dated Bankman-Fried, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/sbfs-ex-girlfriend-ellison-testifies-he-directed-me-to-commit-these-crimes/">testified earlier</a> that Bankman-Fried directed her to commit crimes and that &#34;I would always ultimately defer to Sam.&#34; She <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/sbfs-dream-of-being-us-president-and-other-weird-anecdotes-from-ftx-trial/">said</a> that Bankman-Fried had a &#34;utilitarian&#34; philosophy in which rules like &#34;don&#39;t lie&#34; and &#34;don&#39;t steal&#34; did not fit into his moral framework.</p>
<p>Ellison told the jury about Alameda using FTX customer money, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-10/caroline-ellison-appears-in-court-ahead-of-testimony-in-sbf-case">testifying</a> that Bankman-Fried &#34;said FTX would be a good source of capital, and he set up a system that allowed Alameda to borrow from FTX.&#34; She also said Bankman-Fried directed her to create a misleading balance sheet so the firm could get more loans.</p>
<p>Under cross-examination yesterday, Bankman-Fried said he didn&#39;t remember statements he made publicly about the ties between FTX and Alameda, a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-grilled-in-crucial-day-on-witness-stand-29d4e248">Wall Street Journal article</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sassoon pressed Bankman-Fried on the relationship between the two entities, including what prosecutors allege were Alameda&#39;s secret and unique privileges to borrow virtually unlimited sums from FTX.</p>
<p>&#34;Sitting here today, you don&#39;t recall assuring customers that Alameda generally played by the same rules as other customers on FTX?&#34; Sassoon asked. &#34;I&#39;m not sure,&#34; Bankman-Fried said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial is in US District Court in New York City.</p>
