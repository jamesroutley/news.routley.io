It immediately attracted controversy. Initially, this controversy stemmed from the displacement of another much-loved children’s show from the airwaves, but as the show gained in popularity, the media started paying attention. By August it had a regular audience of two million – a viewership that was unheard of for a programme aimed at toddlers.</p><p>In fact, one of the show’s co-creators, Ian Davenport, had a background in speech therapy, and his partner Anne Wood had a long history and a string of hits in children’s TV. Their intention was to create a world that was both warm and welcoming to two-to-four year olds, and which prepared them for interactions with high technology: hence the televisions. The characters were deliberately unthreatening as well as slightly slower than actual toddlers, who in turn felt empathy and a desire to join in and help. Likewise, the constant repetition which infuriated adults instead delighted children, who felt security and confidence in their ability to predict what was going to happen next: a critical component of early learning.<strong>[3]</strong> The surreal, even psychedelic aspects of the programme also helped build a dedicated following among students and other stoners – a significant proportion of that two million-strong audience, and another stick used by the media to bash it.)</p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="62.45353159851301" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602792801467_106173"><div>

Placed in the glow of its primary-coloured Eden they would become utterly transfixed, as to no show before. Almost immediately they would fall into sync with its rhythms, pick up its catchphrases, join in its dances, and most disconcertingly of all, demand in unison with the four protagonists at each show’s end: “Again!

By the time they got to broadcast, the show’s attention rating averaged around 85 to 90 percent, and some reached 100 percent, as the crew learned to trust the distractor and absorbed its lessons. For Palmer, the distractor enabled the team to hone Sesame Street into a finely tuned educational instrument: “After the third or fourth season, I’d say it was rare that we ever had a segment below eighty five percent. We would almost never see something in the fifty to sixty percent range, and if we did, we’d fix it. You know Darwin’s terms about the survival of the fittest? We had a mechanism to identify the fittest and decide what should survive.”</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602792801467_135055"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602792801467_128717"><div><p>Teletubbies was technological – and even uncanny - from the outset, as producer Anne Wood recalled of its inception: “We were trying to reflect children’s experience back to them. It was a world in which technology was developing at an extraordinary rate: children were growing up in an environment where objects spoke from the walls or moved about.” In the revival of the series in 2015, Teletubbies introduced the Tubby Phone, a nod to post-television technologies. The arrival of the Tubby Phone hints at the vast shift taking place in media technologies off-screen in the late nineties and early noughties: the explosive growth of the internet and its various subsumed devices. The Tubby Phone could be used to make calls and take photos, just like a contemporary smartphone, although its primary use was to trigger the Tubby Phone Dance, a cavort around the Tubbytronic Superdome to the refrain of “Ring, ring, ring.”</p><blockquote><pre><code>The advent of digital technologies democratised access to attention, and provided amateurs, upstarts, and established companies with ways to profit from its successful </code></pre></blockquote><p>Fogg also sounded a note of caution. Captology research would require a strong ethical component, because persuasive techniques could easily be employed by those without the best interests of their users at heart. He was concerned, for example, by the possibility of casinos using captology to make their slot machines more seductive, or corporations deploying captology to track and manipulate employee behaviour. Education was the best defence against such abuses, he believed. “First, increased knowledge about persuasive computers allows people more opportunity to adopt such technologies to enhance their own lives, if they choose,” he wrote. “Second, knowledge about persuasive computers helps people recognize when technologies are using tactics to persuade them.”</p><blockquote><pre><code>[P]ersuasive technologies made Facebook what it was: an intricately-tooled machine for the capture and retention of attention</code></pre></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602792801467_139859"><div>

KissMe was simple but effective: it invited users to send another user a kiss, and the kiss acted as an invitation to the app, growing its install base. Another app, Send Hotness, was close behind: it enabled users to rank their friends’ attractiveness, and the top ten were sent invitations. Flattery, it seems, will get you everywhere.<strong>[19] </strong>By the end of the term, the class’s apps had a total of more than sixteen million users. And more consequentially, they’d generated more than a million dollars in actual revenue, through the accompanying, also-novel medium of digital advertising.<strong>[20] </strong>Attention itself could be monetised, and captology provided the toolkit for its acquisition.</p><blockquote><pre><code>To be clear: YouTube decides what most people watch.</code></pre></blockquote><p>Moreover, Google’s tweaks left most of their most powerful techniques untouched. In his original presentation, Harris gave a number of examples of irresponsible design, subtly altering screenshots of Google and other companies’ products to show what was really happening. One example was the notification which Facebook users receive when they’re tagged in a photo: an email telling them they’ve been tagged, and two buttons with the words “See photo” and “Go to notifications”. He suggested the first one should be rewritten as “Spend next 20 minutes on FB” to acknowledge that the designers weren’t really doing the user a useful service, but were attempting to hijack their attention. Another example was YouTube’s “Up Next” sidebar of recommended videos. Harris replaced the titles of these with the real effects of being caught in the endless slipstream of suggestions: “Don’t sleep til 2am”, “Don’t sleep til 3am”, “Feel sick tomorrow morning”, “Wake up feeling exhausted”, and “Regret staying up all night watching YouTube”.</p><blockquote><pre><code>The great distractor uses its power not merely to suck you in and keep you watching, but to shape new content, which in turn shapes us</code></pre></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602792801467_88059"><div>

It knows what you watch, how long you watch it for, what you watched before and what you watched after and – given the pervasiveness of tracking tools across the wider internet – where you arrived from, who you are, and where you live. It knows this for billions of people, allowing it to sift out the slightest differences in tone and subject, differences which lose our attention or keep us locked in. YouTube is the perfection of a system of techniques held in common by Sesame Street, Teletubbies, and captology for the acquisition and retention of attention, stripped of all desire to do anything with that attention beyond profit from it. And this would be sad enough, were it not for the fact that such a system cannot be neutral. The great distractor uses its power not merely to suck you in and keep you watching, but to shape new content, which in turn shapes us.</p><blockquote><pre><code>[T]o actually interfere with the money-making algorithm at the level required to actually protect children, democracy, and our sanity would mean reducing the scale of their business</code></pre></blockquote></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="55.81395348837209" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602792801467_74156"><div>
