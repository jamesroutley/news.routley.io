    <h1>Leaking URLs to the clown</h1>
    
    
<p>
With all of this feed reader stuff going on, I&#39;ve learned a few more 
things about goings-on in this space.  Some of it is just strange.
</p>
<p>
During the early development stage of this project, I installed a 
couple of apps from the Mac app store on my machine to do some testing.  
Each one of them was given a unique URL so I could tell them apart.  
This meant I started seeing traffic from my laptop to the test server, 
which is exactly how it was supposed to work.
</p>
<p>
But, one of those unique URLs started getting requests from some random 
&#34;cloud&#34; service.  There was no indication this would happen when I 
plugged it into the app.  It just appeared, and it was running in 
parallel with the requests from my actual laptop.  In fact, I&#39;ve since 
stopped running all of those programs, and they&#39;re *still* polling it - 
just under every three hours, and always unconditionally.  Great.  I bet 
it&#39;ll keep going approximately forever.
</p>
<p>
Nothing on the app&#39;s web page suggests this will happen.  It just does.
If anything, the &#34;all articles are available offline and without an 
internet connection&#34; blurb on their web page suggests the opposite: the 
laptop does a fetch and keeps it locally.  What a concept!
</p>
<p>
So, if you were thinking about using that particular app to read some 
feed containing something relatively private, guess what, they&#39;re 
reading it too.
