    <h1>Expanding the Tau VM family with Arm-based processors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><!----><div><div><div><!----><!----><paragraph-block _nghost-c60=""><div _ngcontent-c60="" innerhtml="&lt;p&gt;Organizations that are developing ever larger, scale-out applications will leave no stone unturned in their search for a compute platform that meets their needs. For some, that means looking to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arm.com/architecture/cpu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arm&amp;#174; architecture&lt;/a&gt;. Known for delivering excellent performance per watt&amp;#160;efficiency, Arm-based chips are already ubiquitous in mobile devices, and have proven themselves for supercomputing workloads. At Google Cloud, we&amp;#8217;re also excited about using Arm chips for the next generation of scale-out, cloud-native workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, we added &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/tau-vm&#34;&gt;Tau VMs&lt;/a&gt; to Compute Engine, offering a new family of VMs optimized for cost-effective performance for scale-out workloads. Today we are thrilled to announce the Preview release of our first VM family based on the Arm architecture, Tau T2A. Powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://amperecomputing.com/blogs/2022-07-13/ampere-altra-based-t2a-vms-now-in-preview-on-google-cloud.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ampere&amp;#174; Altra&amp;#174;&lt;/a&gt; Arm-based processors, T2A VMs deliver exceptional single-threaded performance at a compelling price. Tau T2A VMs come in multiple predefined VM shapes, with up to 48 vCPUs per VM, and 4GB of memory per vCPU. They offer up to 32 Gbps networking bandwidth and a wide range of network attached storage options, making Tau T2A VMs suitable for scale-out workloads including web servers, containerized microservices, data-logging processing, media transcoding, and Java applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud customers and developers now have the option of choosing an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arm.com/company/news/2022/07/arm-neoverse-adopted-by-google-cloud&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arm-based Google Cloud VM&lt;/a&gt; to test, develop and run their workloads on the optimal architecture for their workload. Several of our customers have had private preview access to T2A VMs for the last few months and have had a great experience with these new VMs. Below is what few of them have to say about T2A VMs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Our drug discovery research at Harvard includes several compute-intensive workloads that run on SLURM using VirtualFlow&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The ability to run our workloads on tens of thousands of VMs in parallel is critical to optimize compute time. We ported our workload to the new T2A VM family from Google and were up and running with minimal effort. The improved price-performance of the T2A will help us screen more compounds and therefore discover more promising drug candidates.&amp;#8221; - Christoph Gorgulla, Research Associate, Harvard University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In recent years, we have come to rely on Arm-based servers to power our engineering&amp;#160;activity at lower cost and higher performance compared to legacy environments. The&amp;#160;introduction of the Arm Neoverse N1-based T2A instance allows us to diversify our use&amp;#160;of cloud compute on Arm-based hardware and leverage the Google Compute Engine to&amp;#160;build the exact virtual machine types we need, with the convenience of Google&amp;#160;Kubernetes Engine for containerized workloads.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Mark Galbraith, Vice President,&amp;#160;Productivity Engineering, Arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ampere Computing has been a key partner for Google Cloud and delivering this VM.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ampere&amp;#174; Altra&amp;#174; Cloud Native Processors were designed from the ground up to meet the demands of modern cloud applications,&amp;#8221; said Jeff Wittich, Chief Product Officer, Ampere Computing. &amp;#8220;Our close collaboration with Google Cloud has resulted in the launch of the new price-performance optimized Tau T2A instances, which enable demanding scale-out applications to be deployed rapidly and efficiently.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Integration with Google Cloud services&amp;#160;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud is ramping up its support for Arm. T2A VMs support most popular Linux operating systems such as RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, and Rocky Linux. In addition, T2A VMs also support &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/concepts/features-and-benefits&#34;&gt;Container-optimized OS&lt;/a&gt; to bring up Docker containers quickly, efficiently and securely. Further, developers building applications on Google Cloud can already use several Google Cloud services with T2A VMs &amp;#8212; with more coming later this year:&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE) is the leading platform for organizations looking for advanced container orchestration. Starting today, GKE customers can run their containerized workloads using the Arm architecture on T2A. Arm nodes come packed with key GKE features, including the ability to run in GKE Autopilot mode for a hands-off experience. Read more about running your Arm workloads with GKE &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-supports-new-arm-based-tau-t2a-vms&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Batch&lt;/b&gt; - Our newly launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/batch&#34;&gt;Batch service&lt;/a&gt; supports T2A. As of today users will be able to run batch jobs on T2A instances to optimize their cost of running workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dataflow&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/dataflow&#34;&gt;Dataflow&lt;/a&gt; is a fully managed streaming analytics service that minimizes latency, processing time, and cost through autoscaling and batch processing. You can now use T2A VMs with your Dataflow workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extensive ISV partner ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Arm chips are relative newcomers to data center workloads, there&amp;#8217;s already a robust ecosystem of ISV support for Tau T2A VMs. In fact, Ampere lists more than 100 applications, databases, cloud-native software and programming languages that are already running on Ampere-based T2A VMs, with more being added all the time. Further, ISV partners that have validated their solutions on T2A VMs have been impressed by the ease with which they were able to port their software to Tau T2A VMs.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Momento&amp;#8217;s serverless cache enables developers to accelerate database and application performance at scale. Over the past few months, we have become intimately familiar with Google Cloud&amp;#8217;s new T2A VMs. We were pleasantly surprised with the ease of portability to Arm instance from day one. The maturity of the T2A platform gives us the confidence to start using these VMs in production. Innovations like T2A VMs in Google Cloud help us continuously innovate on behalf of our customers.&amp;#8221; - Khawaja Shams, CEO, Momento. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gomomento.com/blog/turbocharging-pelikan-cache-on-google-cloud-arm-based-t2a-vms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt; about Momento&amp;#8217;s T2A experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;SchedMD&amp;#8217;s Slurm open-source workload manager is designed specifically to satisfy the demanding needs of compute-intensive workloads.
