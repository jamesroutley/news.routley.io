So I thought to myself:</p><blockquote><p>When Everybody Is Digging for Gold, It’s Good To Be in the Pick and Shovel Business</p></blockquote><p>I had experience with designing and building different web apps so I know exactly what I wanted to do full time - <b>make Shopify apps</b>. ✨ </p><p>✍️ I drew the following plan:</p><ol start="1"><li>Create a small Shopify app and get some customers to get a feel for the market</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Create a bigger Shopify app that’s successful and generates enough money so I don’t have to be worried about working for a living</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Create a business that changes the game</li></ol><p><em>( Future me is so proud to see points 1 and 2 completed ✅ </em>🙏<em> )</em></p><p>So I got thinking.
