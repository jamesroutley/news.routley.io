    <h1>I&#39;ve had a change of heart regarding employee metrics</h1>
    
    
<p>
I know that if you go back far enough in these posts of mine, you will 
find some real crap in there.  Sometimes that&#39;s because I had a 
position on something that turned out to not be very useful, or in some 
cases, actively harmful.  This sucks, but that&#39;s life: you encounter 
new information and you are given the opportunity to change your mind, 
and then sometimes you actually do exactly that.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I realized that my position on something else has changed 
over time.  It started when someone reached out to me a few weeks 
ago because they wanted me to get involved with them on some &#34;employee 
metrics&#34; product.  It&#39;s some bullshit thing that has stuff like &#34;work 
output&#34; listing how many commits they&#39;ve done, or comments, or whatever 
else.  I guess they wanted me to shill for something of theirs, because 
from my posts, clearly I was such a fan of making that kind of tool, 
right?
</p>
<p>
I mean, sure, way back in 2004-2006, I was making all kinds of 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/11/16/onfire/">tools</a>
to show who was actually doing work and who was just sitting there 
doing nothing.  I&#39;ve written about a number of those tools, with their 
goofy names and the &#34;hard truths&#34; they would expose, showing who&#39;s a 
&#34;slacker&#34; and all of this.
</p>
<p>
When this company reached out, I did some introspection and decided that 
what I had done previously was the wrong thing to do, and I should not 
recommend it any more.
</p>
<p>
Why?  It&#39;s surprisingly simple.  It&#39;s the job of a manager to know what 
their reports are up to, and whether they&#39;re doing a good job of it, and 
are generally effective.  If they can&#39;t do that, then they themselves 
are ineffective, and *that* is the sort of thing that is the 
responsibility of THEIR manager, and so on up the line.  They shouldn&#39;t 
need me (or anyone else) to tell them about what&#39;s going on with their 
damn direct reports!
</p>
<p>
In theory, at least, that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to work.  That&#39;s their 
job: actually managing people!
</p>
<p>
So, my new position on that sort of thing is: fuck them.  Don&#39;t help 
them.  Don&#39;t write tools like that, don&#39;t
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/01/09/rigor/">run tests</a>
to see if your teammates will take care of basic &#34;service hygiene&#34; 
issues, and definitely don&#39;t say anything
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/02/19/perf/">substantive</a>
in a performance review.  None of it will &#34;move the needle&#34; in the way 
you think it will, and it will only make life worse for you overall.  
&#34;Peer reviews actually improve things&#34; is about the biggest crock of 
shit that people in tech still believe in.
</p>
<p>
Once again, if management is too stupid to notice what&#39;s going on, they 
deserve every single thing that will happen when it finally &#34;hits the 
fan&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Make them do their own damn jobs.  You have enough stuff to do as it is.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
I feel like giving this a second spin right here in case I failed to 
reach some of the audience with the first approach.  Here&#39;s a purely 
selfish way of looking at things, for those who are so inclined.
</p>
<p>
Those tools I wrote 20 years ago didn&#39;t really indicate who was slacking 
at working tickets or whatever.  What they *actually indicated* was that 
the management at Rackspace, by and large, had no clue what was going 
on right under their noses.  And, hey, while that was true, that can be 
a dangerous thing to say!  You want enemies?  That&#39;s a great way to get 
them.
</p>
<p>
So, why expose yourself?  Suppress the urge to point out who&#39;s slacking.
It will only come back on you.
