<h2 id="progress-update">Progress update</h2>
<p>The last two weeks, I built a test-taking interface, an automated
grader, a hinting system, image support in questions/answers/solutions,
and finally figured out my test-scraping workflow. The test-scraping
workflow still requires me to manually screenshot/crop images from the
source PDFs, as well as to Q/C the scraping to double-check that there
are no transcription errors. Luckily, I’ve clocked that this should only
take ~15 minutes per exam, so I just need to sit down for a day or two
and transcribe + Q/C every single past USNCO exam.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from trying to automate the test-scraping workflow,
even though I probably “wasted” two weeks on it, from the perspective of
just accomplishing my goal. The lessons I learned are documented in <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/claude_pipeline/">Claude as Pipeline Orchestrator</a> and
<a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/blind_llms/">Multimodal LLMs are Blind</a>.</p>
<p>The site updates will probably go live mid next week, after I’ve
gotten back from my vacation this week!</p>
<p>No miscellaneous thoughts this week! I tried to write a section and
then realized I’d written a full length essay. After polishing “Claude
as Pipeline Orchestrator”, I returned to this update post and tried to
write a second supplemental section, and then realized I’d written
another full length essay. Oops 😅 That’s partly why this update got so
delayed, even while I was on vacation.</p>
