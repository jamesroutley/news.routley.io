    <h1>How to Stop Ruminating</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>It’s no fun laying in bed unable to sleep because your mind is chewing on… whatever.</p><p><span>Is it something you said or didn&#39;t say earlier that day? Or maybe it’s the feedback you received? Or perhaps you’re suffering from </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria" rel="">Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria</a><span> (RSD), which often accompanies ADHD, and literally, anything sets you off?</span></p><p>Our minds latch onto a story and just won&#39;t let go, going on and on about it. It’s exhausting!</p><p>Rumination comes up a lot in my coaching practice. Distracting yourself is fairly common advice, and was something I&#39;d recommend to my clients in the past. Like going for a walk, calling a friend, reading a book, listening to a podcast, and so on.</p><p>Distractions work to a point. But it&#39;s a bit like trying to ignore a splinter. Maybe it&#39;ll get dislodged from your body and get washed down the drain when you&#39;re showering. But until that happens, it keeps reminding you about itself. Worse yet, it might get inflamed and cause more problems down the line.</p><p>Here’s a more productive approach that allowed so many of my clients to get lasting relief from rumination, that it&#39;s now my standard advice:</p><p><span>1. </span><strong>Pay attention to the triggers.</strong><span> What&#39;s setting off rumination? The more of your triggers you can identify and name in your environment, the easier it&#39;ll be to spot them when they happen. You might even be able to prepare ahead of time if you know one is coming (like a performance conversation with your manager).</span></p><p><span>2. Examine the stories you&#39;re telling yourself, and </span><strong>identify the cognitive distortions</strong><span> your mind might be employing. Like fortune-telling, catastrophizing, or mind-reading. (I recommend </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-recognize-and-tame-your-cognitive-distortions-202205042738" rel="">reading up</a><span> on “cognitive distortions”. It helps a lot to just know what they are.)</span></p><p><span>3. </span><strong>Don&#39;t believe everything you think.</strong><span> Just because a thought came to mind, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the truth. Generate an alternative, more helpful story that&#39;s equally plausible. (Didn&#39;t receive that email a recruiter promised in a day or two? Maybe they&#39;ve been stupid-busy and haven&#39;t gotten to it yet. Or perhaps they have ADHD and could appreciate a reminder.)</span></p><p><span>4. </span><strong>Practice self-compassion.</strong><span> Talk to yourself like you&#39;d talk to your child. If you don&#39;t have a child, imagine yourself when you were little and talk to yourself like that kid. (You wouldn&#39;t tell a child they are a screw-up, would you? You&#39;d probably encourage them to try again, tell them it happens to the best of us. Show the same grace to yourself.)</span></p><p><span>5. </span><strong>Realize that it&#39;s a practice.</strong><span> Like brushing teeth or going to the gym. You might not see the results right away, but it gets easier and more impactful over time.</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
