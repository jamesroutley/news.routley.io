    <h1>Cheat Engine contains GPL-licensed code but disallows commercial use</h1>

          <p dir="auto"><a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/ThisGitHubUsernameWasAvailable/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/ThisGitHubUsernameWasAvailable">@ThisGitHubUsernameWasAvailable</a> - misapplying a license does <em>not</em> change the license of the whole project, it just means the project is violating the license. Licenses are not &#34;viral&#34; in that sense.</p>
<p dir="auto">If someone accidentally includes GPL in their code they have two options-</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Update their project to a compatible license. This doesn&#39;t have to be GPL (it could be MIT for instance), but it has to be a compatible license.</li>
<li>Remove the GPL code.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Most companies opt for the second option.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this case it looks like the issue is in TCCLib, not Cheat Engine specifically. It also looks like it may just be a mislabeled file. Either way this issue should be mentioned to the upstream library, and once they fixed the issue the downstream programs should update. If TCCLib doesn&#39;t fix the problem then exploring replacements is also a good idea.</p>
