Harman had a 60 percent market share in portable audio devices last year, and the company is looking to maintain that position with this purchase. &#34;By combining the audio business of Masimo, which is being acquired this time, with Harmanâ€™s lifestyle business division, the company plans to solidify its global No. 1 position in the consumer audio market,&#34; Samsung said. Samsung also plans to apply the new brands&#39; audio technologies to its smartphones, TVs, wireless earphones, soundbars and other devices in the future.</p></div></div>
