<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-18605"></span>From Peaches and Herb&#8217;s <em>Reunited</em>:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;">Reunited, and it feels so good<br />
Reunited &#8217;cause we understood<br />
There&#8217;s one perfect fit<br />
And, sugar, this one is it<br />
We both are so excited &#8217;cause we&#8217;re reunited, hey, hey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a rough ride from London to Kuala Lumpur. I am not one to dwell on the negative side of life, and we have to be careful with our choice of words. This is not a <em>trial</em>, I am not <em>depressed, </em>my life is not <em>doomed. </em></p>
<p>Having left London Heathrow, transited at Singapore Changi and arrived in Kuala Lumpur&#8217;s KLIA, Mr Gochugaru and I picked up only three of our four pieces of checked-in luggage. It my own suitcase which was missing.</p>
<p>As I contemplated a long trip with one set of underclothes, one pair of socks and trainers, one pair of culottes and one blouse, I thought about reunions.</p>
<p>Mr Gochugaru and I are in Kuala Lumpur to be with my extended family for the Chinese New Year. My suitcase was packed with lovely clothes and more importantly, my swimsuits and goggles. I love swimming. That one suitcase did not leave Heathrow. I wanted desperately to be reunited with my clothes and shoes.</p>
<p>I knew that this was not the end of the world. What this experience does point to is the sadness when we are parted from the things we love. It points to our devastation when we are parted from the people we love. And it points to our human condition when are separated from the God who created and who loves us.</p>
<p>During the first 48 hours here in KL I thought a lot about how we humans are like lost pieces of luggage on the conveyor belt of life. We have an owner who really wants to claim us but we keep going astray. During meetings with my relatives and when talking with the hotel staff and sales assistants about my predicament, I was often asked: <em>what about compensation? </em></p>
<p>I hesitate to be abrupt, but I really just wanted the contents of the bag I had packed because I had purposefully and intentionally picked the items in it. They were mine and I did not want something else. And God is like this too, in wanting us to be in that relationship with him and not to be offered something else instead of ourselves. When my suitcase finally arrived at my accommodation four days after I had last seen it, I was so, so happy. I understood a little more about the joy God feels when the humans he has been continually searching for are reunited with him.</p>
<p>I am sure you get the point. And now to some photos from the first of many meals with our extended family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our first proper meal was at the Mandarin Oriental where I had some lovely Johor Laksa. No further photos as I needed to talk with my mother and Hong Kong Sister and of course, to concentrate on the buffet lunch</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Dinner at Cousin A&#8217;s house last night which was attended by around 30 friends and family. I have mentioned <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2019/02/tiramisu-a-sweet-ending/">previously</a> that Cousin A is called Cousin A because she gives her best in everything she does</p>

<p>There will be another extended family gathering on Chinese New Year&#8217;s Day. More conversation and more food, so I had better do more swimming. I am so glad my swimsuit and goggles are now here with me.</p>
