    <h1>Reverse Engineering All the Raspberry Pis</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month I covered <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/reverse-engineering-raspberry-pi-zero-2w">Jonathan Clark&#39;s effort to reverse-engineer the Pi Zero 2 W</a>, and just yesterday, I discovered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tubetime.bsky.social/post/3lx6erpo5lc2u">TubeTime reverse-engineered the Compute Module 5</a>.</p>



<p>Both are graciously sharing their schematics and process on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jonny12375/rp3a0">jonny12375/rp3a0</a> for the Zero 2 W / RP3A0</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schlae/cm5-reveng">schlae/cm5-reveng</a> for the CM5 / RP2712</li>
</ul>

<p>Raspberry Pi shares limited board schematics, but sometimes—especially when digging into some esoteric edge case for a carrier board, or in Jonathan&#39;s case, desoldering all the chips and building a Pi Zero 2W into a Pico form factor PCB—you need more.</p>

<p>Well, in both cases, I realized <em>after</em> the fact I was sitting on some highly detailed Lumafield scans, which I had planned on making a video going through at some point for a project I&#39;m working on this year. But that data would&#39;ve helped in both projects (at least mildly). It&#39;s not as good as hand-sanding a PCB and getting high resolution scans, but it is especially helpful in getting a &#39;look inside&#39; 3D representation of the complete board.</p>

<p>So, along with a video on my 2nd YouTube channel today, I&#39;m releasing <em>all</em> the Lumafield scans of the modern Raspberry Pi lineup (excluding the larger keyboard form factor Pis, like the Pi 400 and Pi 500... maybe I can get to those too, someday).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the video:</p>

<p>And here are links to all the Lumafield scans in their Voyager tool, so you can play with them and dig into the Pi internals <em>yourself</em>:</p>

<p>HUGE thanks to Lumafield for helping me produce these scans.</p></div></div>
