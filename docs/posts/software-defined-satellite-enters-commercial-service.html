    <h1>Software-defined satellite enters commercial service</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>


Europe&#39;s first commercial satellite capable of being completely reprogrammed while in space is now in commercial use.</p><p>

Satellite operator Eutelsat has sold six of its eight beams - used for data and mobile communications - to organisations including governments and other users. It is expected that the entire satellite capacity will be sold in the coming months.</p><p>

The satellite - called Eutelsat Quantum - was launched on 30 July 2021 by an Ariane 5 from Europe&#39;s spaceport in French Guiana.</p><p>

The satellite offers unprecedented mission reconfiguration capacity. Its beams can be reshaped and redirected to provide information to people on moving planes, trucks and cars in close to real time.</p><p>

Eutelsat Quantum is a collaboration under an ESA Partnership Project between Eutelsat and satellite manufacturer Airbus, with significant support from the UK Space Agency. Its cutting-edge technologies were developed and manufactured in the UK and in Spain, with additional contributions from companies based in Canada, Italy, Norway and the Netherlands.</p><p>

Elodie Via, Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said: &#34;ESA&#39;s Partnership Projects help to federate industry around large-scale programmes that have a demonstrable economic impact. This satellite commercialisation represents a major milestone for this successful ESA Partnership Project, creating jobs and prosperity across ESA&#39;s Member States.&#34;</p>
