    <h1>Italy demands Google poison DNS under strict Piracy Shield law</h1>

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/court-orders-google-to-poison-public-dns-to-prevent-iptv-piracy-250321/">TorrentFreak</a>, AGCOM Commissioner Massimiliano Capitanio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308503541390741504/">took to LinkedIn</a> to celebrate the ruling, as well as the existence of the Italian Piracy Shield. &#34;The Judge confirmed the value of AGCOM&#39;s investigations, once again giving legitimacy to a system for the protection of copyright that is unique in the world,&#34; said Capitanio.</p>
<p>Capitanio went on to complain that Google has routinely ignored AGCOM&#39;s listing of pirate sites, which are supposed to be blocked in 30 minutes or less under the law. He noted the violation was so clear-cut that the order was issued without giving Google a chance to respond, known as <em>inaudita altera parte</em> in Italian courts.</p>
<p>This decision follows a similar case against Internet backbone firm Cloudflare. In January, the Court of Milan found that Cloudflare&#39;s CDN, DNS server, and WARP VPN were facilitating piracy. The court threatened Cloudflare with fines of up to 10,000 euros per day if it did not begin blocking the sites.</p>
<p>Google could face similar sanctions, but AGCOM has had difficulty getting international tech behemoths to acknowledge their legal obligations in the country. We&#39;ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this report if we hear back.</p>
