<h3><a rel="bookmark" name="2022-09-22.1" href="http://boston.conman.org/2022/09/22.1">So when did POP and IMAP become a “legacy protocol?”</a></h3>

<!-- legacy protocols, centralization of email, the process, The Enterprise, embrace extend extinguish -->

<p>I just received the following email at work:</p>

<blockquote>
  

<p>To All [The Enterprise] Staff,</p>

<p>Please be aware that Microsoft is disabling the use of several <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online-september/ba-p/3609437">legacy protocols</a>
related to old methods of retrieving and sending email in the coming weeks.</p>

<h4>What does this mean for you?</h4>

<p>If you are using Outlook as [The Enterprise] provisions it, you do not need to
do anything.  If you use an alternate email program that relies on <abbr title="Post Office Protocol version 3">POP3</abbr>,
<abbr title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr> or <abbr title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</abbr>, like native mail programs in iOS and Android, expect your [The Enterprise]
email connection for that app to stop functioning when Microsoft chooses to
disable these protocols.</p>

<h4>What should you do?</h4>

<p>[The Enterprise] only supports the use of the approved email client Outlook,
Outlook 365 available in our [The Enterprise] tenant, or Outlook for iOS and
Android.  If you are not using Outlook, please switch today.  If you require
assistance, please contact <span>XXXXX­XXXXX­XX</span>.</p>

<p>Instructions for installing Outlook for mobile devices can be found here .</p>

<p>Thank You,</p>

<p>Enterprise Services</p>


</blockquote>

<p>On one level,
this doesn&#39;t bother me.
I&#39;m using the web version of Lookout
(I assume that&#39;s the Lookout 365 for The Enterprise tenant they mention, at least,
I hope so).
I also don&#39;t check work email on my phone—never have,
and I don&#39;t have plans on starting that any time soon either.</p>

<p>But on another level,
this is concerning.
Even though Microsoft announced this three years ago,
it comes across as locking email down into a more centalized,
proprietary system.
I do have to wonder how long until Google decides that only certain clients can connect with Gmail?
You know,
for “enhanced security” or a “better experience.”
I don&#39;t use Gmail,
but I do have concerns about my ability to run my own email server and general interoperability with the large email providers like Google and Microsoft.</p>

	<p>You have my permission to link freely to any entry here.  Go
	ahead, I won&#39;t bite.  I promise.</p>

	<p>The dates are the permanent links to that day&#39;s entries (or
	entry, if there is only one entry).  The titles are the permanent
	links to <em>that</em> entry only.  The format for the links are
	simple: Start with the base link for this site: <a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/">http://boston.conman.org/</a>, then add the date you are
	interested in, say <a href="http://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01">2000/08/01</a>,
	so that would make the final <abbr title="Uniform Resource
	Locator">URL</abbr>:</p>

	<p><a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01">http://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01</a></p>

	<p>You can also specify the entire month by leaving off the day
	portion.  You can even select <a class="page" href="http://boston.conman.org/about/technical.html">an arbitrary portion of time.</a></p>

	<p>You may also note subtle shading of the links and that&#39;s
	intentional: the “closer” the link is (relative to the
	page) the “brighter” it appears.  It&#39;s an experiment in
	using color shading to denote the distance a link is from here.  If
	you don&#39;t notice it, don&#39;t worry; it&#39;s not all <em>that</em>
	important.</p>

	<p>It is assumed that every brand name, slogan, corporate name,
	symbol, design element, et cetera mentioned in these pages is a
	protected and/or trademarked entity, the sole property of its
	owner(s), and acknowledgement of this status is implied.</p>
