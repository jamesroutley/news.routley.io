    <h1>A Brief History of the Miracle Bacterium</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>At 1:15 p.m. on Monday, August 8th, 1904, a British physician named M. H. Gordon took some soil he had “richly impregnated with a living emulsion” of the virulent bacterium,</span><span> </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span>, and sprinkled it near a lamp post in front of the U.K. House of Commons. Gordon knew that was the exact spot Members of Parliament had to cross before their 2 p.m. session. His hope was for the politicians to step on the contaminated ground and spread the bacteria inside the Debating Chamber.</span></p><p><span>Gordon wasn’t executing a terrorist attack. Rather, he had been appointed by a committee to study how germs spread inside the House of Commons following an outbreak of influenza among its members. Gordon had chosen </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> because the bacterium forms easily recognizable red colonies. For his experiment, he placed numerous open Petri dishes inside the Debating Chamber on which the colonies could grow. Gordon’s idea was simple: politicians’ boots would carry contaminated soil and spread </span><em>Serratia marcescens </em><span>into the building; he would go away with his Petri dishes and reveal colonies of the bacterium to </span><a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/anx9pwfj/items" rel="">point at faults</a><span> in the House of Commons’ ventilation system.</span></p><p><span>But despite placing hundreds of Petri dishes around the chamber, Gordon wasn’t able to retrieve more than a handful of colonies. Suspecting the microbe might not spread easily by means of boots, he followed this up with a theatrical experiment: Inside the Debating Chamber, he gargled a suspension of </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> and recited Shakespeare’s “King Henry V” and “Julius Caesar” for one hour to no one but an audience of open Petri dishes. This time, copious colonies of </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> appeared, leading him to conclude that speech can transmit microbes as far as 70 feet (21 meters) away.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, </span><em>Serratia marcescens’</em><span> vivid blood-red color has prompted its use in a wide range of experiments that have increased our understanding of how germs disperse within human bodies, buildings, and populations. Sightings of the striking microbe outside the lab have awakened both fear and awe in the general population. </span></p><p><span>The awareness that certain strains of </span><em>Serratia marcescens </em><span>can cause severe harm to humans — counter-intuitively, the paler varieties are most dangerous — only became evident decades after Gordon’s investigations. Before then, hospitals </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/358722" rel="">deliberately sprayed</a><span> </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> inside their facilities to investigate microbial dispersion, and laboratory handbooks demonstrated </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.168.3927.64.a" rel="">transmission by handshake</a><span> by having students coat their fingers in the microbe. While greater awareness of its dangers eventually led to its discontinuation in tracing experiments, </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> remains an important subject of biomedical research. </span></p><p>Its scientific journey began over 200 years ago with a bloody polenta.</p><p><span>When growing on solid substances, like foodstuffs or Petri dishes filled with agar, </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> forms red colonies reminiscent of blood, earning it the informal moniker </span><a href="https://ia601207.us.archive.org/30/items/biologicaltestin00unit/biologicaltestin00unit.pdf" rel="">“masquerader of blood.”</a><span> Its appearance on the polenta of a wealthy Paduan farmer during a particularly hot and humid summer in 1819 — ideal conditions for its flourishing — prompted the flurry of investigation that gave it its scientific name.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg" width="1200" height="1108.5164835164835" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;imageSize&#34;:&#34;large&#34;,&#34;height&#34;:1345,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:1200,&#34;bytes&#34;:810698,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f6e3015-8d87-4a0d-b6e8-85834c33bee2_2327x2149.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> looks like blood droplets when grown at room temperature on solid media.

Also taking an interest in the mysterious “bloody polenta” was </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeo_Bizio" rel="">Bartolomeo Bizio</a><span> (1791-1862), a young pharmacy student who joined the investigation on his own. In the meantime, red spots started to appear on food in hundreds of homes throughout Pittarello’s village as well as in villages close by.</span></p><p><span>Through a series of ingenious experiments, Sette and Bizio reproduced the red spots on fresh polenta independently in their own home laboratories. Both concluded (erroneously) that the cause was a microscopic fungus.</span><span> Sette called it </span><em>Zaogalactina imetrofa</em><span> (from the Latin, “slime living on food”); Bizio called it </span><em>Serratia</em><em> </em><span>to honor an Italian Benedictine monk and physicist, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serafino_Serrati" rel="">Serafino Serrati</a><span> (whom he felt had not gotten adequate credit for his contributions to the invention of the steamboat) and </span><em>marcescens</em><span> (from the Latin, “to decay”) since, much to his disappointment, the microbe’s red color fades easily. </span></p><p><span>Racing to gain acclaim for identifying the source of the “bloody polenta” before Sette, Bizio made two deft moves. First, by citing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazzaro_Spallanzani" rel="">Lazzaro Spallanzani</a><span>, a pioneering biologist known for having worked to disprove the theory of spontaneous generation, he hoped to lend credibility to his findings; indeed, by demonstrating a biological origin for the “bloody polenta,” Bizio again refuted spontaneous generation decades before Louis Pasteur. And second, Bizio quickly published his discoveries in a Venetian newspaper.</span><span> Sette was furious about being scooped by </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZUJ1cC2omsevaO3osuZ0blPlgpqUDps/view?usp=drive_link" rel="">Bizio’s article</a><span>, although Bizio’s results didn’t contradict his own.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg" width="1456" height="1651" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1651,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:2148155,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F565cc057-08ba-414b-ad96-0846d6da4ff5_1974x2239.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption>Bartolomeo Bizio</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>As Bizio </span><a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/epdf/10.1128/jb.9.6.527-543.1924" rel="">reported in a letter to a priest</a><span>, Angelo Bellani, three years after the event: </span></p><blockquote><p>For several days succeeding its publication, there was much discussion of my experiments in the columns of this newspaper [The Official Gazette]; and to make them still more well known, an enterprising publisher printed them in a small pamphlet which he sold in the streets, so that the general public as well as educated persons came to know about them.</p></blockquote><p><span>By recreating red spots of </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> on fresh polenta, Bizio grew pure colonies of microbes more than half a century before the “culture plate technique” developed by Robert Koch, </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/meet-the-forgotten-woman-who-revolutionized-microbiology-with-a-simple-kitchen-staple-180984572/" rel="">Walther and Fanny Angelina Hesse</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/210666#page/313/mode/1up" rel="">Julius Petri</a><span>.</span><span> The significance of Bizio’s experiments has survived over the centuries, showing the falsehood of a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065216400470000" rel="">dismissive remark</a><span> made by renowned bacterial systematist S. T. Cowan, who said: “I believe we shall not lose anything by ignoring all work before the pioneer [sic] work of Pasteur.”</span></p><p><span>The bacteriological investigations of another predecessor of Pasteur, the naturalist </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Gottfried_Ehrenberg" rel="">Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg</a><span> (1795-1876), have survived as well. In 1848, several decades after the bloody polenta first appeared in Padua, red spots began popping up on boiled potatoes in Germany. Unaware of Bizio’s work, Ehrenberg observed the phenomenon and </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4884130/" rel="">called the organism</a><span> responsible </span><em>Monas prodigiosa</em><span>, one of the many names that </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> has held over the centuries. Ehrenberg studied historical records and concluded that the bacterium was most likely responsible for </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4884130/" rel="">more than 100 documented cases</a><span> of so-called “miraculous blood.”</span></p><p><span>Specifically, </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> holds a large but unintended place in two of the world’s religions due to this shocking resemblance to blood. The 1264 “Miracle of Bolsena” of a Host “bleeding” with </span><em>Serratia marcescens </em><span>was believed to have </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4884130/" rel="">contributed to the establishment of the Holy Communion</a><span>, a central sacrament of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic church. Additionally, the infamous antisemitic “</span><a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/blood-libel" rel="">blood libels</a><span>” might have been due to this microbe, with thousands of Jews executed as heretics following accusations of having stabbed holy wafers in what was most likely a naturally occurring outbreak of </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> on the starchy substratum. </span></p><p><span>It is difficult to verify if </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> was the precise biological cause of such “miracles” or “heresies,” however, since many microorganisms, such as mold or yeast, are often red or pink and grow readily on food. But it seems likely, for as </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4884130/" rel="">researchers have pointed out</a><span>: “We know of no organism [ … ] looking more like drops of fresh blood than </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>With its centuries-long history, it’s perhaps no surprise that </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> has had so many different names and presents </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3194826/" rel="">“one of the most confusing taxonomies in the bacterial world.”</a><span> In 1924, </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC379089/" rel="">bacteriologists rehabilitated</a><span> Bizio’s Linnean appellation, retaining Ehrenberg’s “term of miracle (prodigium) bacterium for use as a trivial or common name.” By the end of the 19th century, however, due to its vivid hue, </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span> had become one of </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?&amp;title=Geschichtliche%20und%20experimentelle%20Studien%20%C3%BCber%20den%20Prodigiosus&amp;journal=Arch.%20Hyg&amp;volume=26&amp;publication_year=1896" rel="">“the cornerstones of modern bacteriology.”</a><span> </span></p><p><span>Specifically, </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span>’ striking color made it the microbe of choice for several decades amongst bacteriologists studying how pathogens spread through buildings and cities. </span></p><p><span>In 1897, German bacteriologist Carl Flügge used the bacteria to perform experiments which served as a template for Gordon’s (but without the Shakespearean flair).</span><span> Flügge was the first to demonstrate that </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02220473" rel="">mouth droplets carry bacteria</a><span>.

In a secret project called “Operation Sea Spray,” the Navy sprayed enormous quantities of the pathogen along the coast of San Francisco to study large-scale, open-air transmission of germs in biological warfare. Navy scientists also set up monitoring stations and traced the microbe up to 50 miles inland, but experts disputed any scientific and epidemiological merit of the experiments. Notably, “Operation Sea Spray” coincided with </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/555999" rel="">the first recorded nosocomial outbreak</a><span> of </span><em>Serratia marcescens</em><span>, with eleven inpatients infected at Stanford Hospital between September 1950 and February 1951.

As early as 1903, infectologist E. Bertarelli showed that the bacterium was lethal to mice, rats, and guinea pigs “following </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3181/00379727-30-6916" rel="">inoculation</a><span> of massive doses of </span><em>Bacillus prodigiosus</em><span>” (one of the microbe’s many names).

When susceptible patients are infected by a virulent form of the pathogen, symptoms may include discoloration of extremities, shock, convulsions, deafness, delirium, and coma.
