    <h1>How to market to developers on Twitter: Learnings from 4 months of Supabase feed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>For months I couldn’t find a single account of a developer-focused company that did <a href="https://wearesculpt.com/blog/developer-social-media-marketing" target="_blank">great dev marketing on social media</a>.</p><p>And then I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank">@swyx</a> mention <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase" target="_blank">Supabase Twitter account</a>. Checked it out and they are crushing it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62602ea2838c0f98afe2832c_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220417183652%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/supabase" target="_blank">Supabase Twitter profile</a></figcaption></figure><p>28k+ followers and tweets getting 400+ likes and 100+ comments every week like it’s nothing. In 2 years. Nice.</p><p>Just so you understand, most of the billion-dollar dev-focused companies are getting 10 likes and 2 retweets on Twitter.</p><p>So the Supabase team is doing something really well. I wanted to know what it is.</p><p>Took a weekend to go over the last 4 months (Jan-April 2022) of their Twitter feed to extract some learnings that you and I could use to get our company Twitter account some results.</p><p>Here is what I learned:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Connect with your ideal users</strong>: They understand who their ideal developer is. They create content that connects with this ideal user. They make it functional and emotional. They use memes and jokes to do that.</li><li><strong>Talk like your ideal users:</strong> They use jargon and dev terms. There is no fluff. Sometimes dry, sometimes funny. But it always feels as if a developer is writing those (which is probably true).</li><li><strong>Make your tweets look great:</strong> Almost every tweet has either an image or a great-looking thumbnail. They use emojis and a nice text structure. Their tweets stand out in the feed and make you stop scrolling.</li><li><strong>Retweet everything about your product and community:</strong> They retweet users sharing good words about Supabase, people being happy about their first accepted PR, devrels creating stuff with Supabase, other companies integrating with the tool.</li><li><strong>Build up excitement for events</strong>: They create tweets and a lot of engagement before, during, and after the live events. That goes for hackathons, features, live coding sessions, everything.</li><li><strong>Mix different types of content:</strong> Their content is a mix of product announcements, memes, blog and videos promotion, events communication, and live sessions. It didn’t get monotone even after reading 3 months of content in a few hours.</li></ul><p>Ok, let’s dive deeper into examples of how exactly they do those things.</p><h2>Connect with your ideal users</h2><p>Ok, so I think folks from Supabase really understand who their ideal user is and talk to that user.</p><p>Marketing 101 but almost nobody actually does it. Let alone does it so well.</p><p>This is <a target="_blank" href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase homepage</a> hero section:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62602ec0847961ad028b179d_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220417183615%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption><a href="https://supabase.com/" target="_blank">Supabase homepage</a></figcaption></figure><p>The way I see it is that their audience cares about:</p><ul role="list"><li>open-source software</li><li>Setting up projects quickly. Often as a side projects</li><li>Are backend website devs</li><li>PostgresSQL</li><li>Authentication</li></ul><p>And they talk to this exact audience in their memes and jokes. They make a connection.</p><p>You can show that you are part of the tribe when you like/retweet something that only backend website devs find funny.</p><p>And it is a great way of attracting other website backend devs who don’t yet know anything about Supabase.</p><h3>Memes</h3><p>Each and every one of those is about their ideal users.</p><p>I don’t get those jokes sometimes :) but looking at the comments it seems that hundreds of backend devs do.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62602ee6e0953a16bc1c2b94_Supabase%20memes%20(4)%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Memes from Supabase Twitter profile</figcaption></figure><blockquote>One additional tactic I liked here was to start the <strong>tweet with a link to an article and add a meme that is related to the article</strong>. </blockquote><h3>Joke questions</h3><p>The idea behind the joke questions is the same. Connect to the ideal users.</p><p>Let people feel smart and understood. It’s about belonging IMHO.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62602ef828e6ac3ff4110269_Supabase%20Joke%20Questions%20(3)%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Jokes from Supabase Twitter profile</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><blockquote>One tactic I saw that I really liked was the <strong>“... Wrong answers only”</strong> question. I am stealing that for sure.<br/></blockquote><h3>Product releases and integrations</h3><p>They even use memes in their product releases. There are two benefits:</p><ul role="list"><li>if people don’t care about the released feature they may still like the meme and share it</li><li>memes make the tweet pop in the feed which gets more eyes on your product announcement</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62602f0b6c258da582b45dc7_Supabase%20product%20announcements%20(3).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Feature and product announcement form Supabase Twitter profile</figcaption></figure><p>They even pulled off talking about the enterprise plans with a meme.</p><blockquote>In this video you get a sneak peek into <strong>how folks from Supabase ideate memes</strong>.

That is what matters.</p><p>A big benefit of using <strong>tech jargon is that it signals that you are part of the tribe</strong>. I think with devs this is really important. It builds trust.</p><p>I like the use of code snapshots here as well (you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://snappify.io/">Snapify</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://carbon.now.sh/about">Carbon</a> for that).</p><p>Let’s look at one more example:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62602f49fa905a43cb41164a_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220416223940%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Video promotion tweet from Supabase</figcaption></figure><p><em>“create a trigger listening for insert events” </em>it feels like dev is writing this.</p><p>Takeaway?</p><ul role="list"><li>Try and get your devs to write tweets :),</li><li>If not hire dev advocates to do it</li><li>If not get your devs (if they are close to your ideal user) to review your content</li></ul><h2>Make your tweets catch attention visually</h2><p>Something that was very clear was that <strong>their successful tweets are all very attention-grabbing</strong>.</p><p>Supabase folks use many things to make Tweets pop in the feed:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Memes</strong>: they used them even when the tweet was about a feature or an article.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62602f5cf20ec0fac9c6ebbc_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220416214235%20(1)%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Integration announcement from Supabase</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li><strong>Code snippet images</strong>: Code snippet speaks a thousand words.

Who is your ideal user? What do they relate to?</li><li><strong>Create content that relates to your ideal user</strong> (duh). Ideally, find that ideal user in your company and put that person in charge of your social media. Srsly, if you could get Supabase results for your company it could have 10x the impact of implementing a feature or something. But more realistically get that ideal user to review the stuff you are creating.</li><li><strong>Make your tweets more visual</strong>, more attention-grabbing in the Twitter feed. Doesn’t matter if it is a product announcement, a blog promotion, or whatever. You can make it pop.</li><li>Create a <strong>mix</strong> of entertainment, product info, product education, and promotion.</li><li>Have some<strong> fraction of content that connects emotionally.</strong> Devs like memes. So that is probably a good place to start. But if your brand guidelines say “no memes” you can probably still do snarky jokes or funny graphics.</li><li><strong>Retweet whatever positive</strong>, whoever is saying about your brand.</li><li>Create a <strong>build-up for events</strong>. And make things more eventful, special, and worth waiting for.</li></ul><p>Now, go crash that Twitter!</p></div></div></div></div>
