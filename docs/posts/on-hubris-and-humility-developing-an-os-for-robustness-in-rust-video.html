    <h1>On Hubris and Humility: developing an OS for robustness in Rust [video]</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cliff is a software generalist at Oxide Computer Company working on server system software. He&#39;s spent the most recent 12 years of his career neck-deep in low-level applications from processor sandboxing on Native Client, to stratospheric avionics firmware at Loon, to machine learning ASIC design at Google. He has a passion for equipping programmers with better tools that let them build more complex things, faster, with fewer defects, which caused him to get really excited about Rust around 2015. He is the author of &#34;Learn Rust the Dangerous Way,&#34; a tutorial aimed at C systems programmers like him.</p>
<p>When not exchanging services for currency, he enjoys building absurdist electronic art and upending fashion norms.</p></div></div>
