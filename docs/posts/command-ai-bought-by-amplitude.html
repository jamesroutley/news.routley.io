Over time, we will be migrating key infrastructure to Amplitude, so you may see some changes, but all of those will be communicated with plenty of lead time. There will be no disruption for your users; in fact, we think in the near term things will be getting better for them.</p><p>So what does this mean: weâ€™re joining forces with a company and product that we&#39;ve admired for a long time. Our Amplitude integration is one of the most popular integrations we offer, and whenever asked to give a recommendation to our customers seeking an analytics, CDP, experimentation, or session replay tool, they have been our go-to answer.</p><p>Over the last few months we&#39;ve been working on a plan to take that integration to much greater heights. Amplitude helps you understand user behavior; we help you instrument experiences that influence user behavior (without overbearing them). We&#39;re going to integrate across Amplitudeâ€™s stack to craft better solutions for builders and better experiences for users.</p><p>Vinay, Richard, and I started Command AI to make the software and the internet easier to use. It didn&#39;t make sense to us that software had become so powerful but is still weirdly hard to use. And so much of what exists to supposedly help users is actually very annoying -- popups, FAQs, bots.</p><p>At times we<a href="https://www.command.ai/blog/user-assistance/"> <u>thought we were crazy</u></a>. But the folks at Amplitude clearly share our view -- in fact, they probably feel even more deeply than we do, having helped so many teams understand their users better.</p><p>We would never have partnered with a team we didn&#39;t feel shared our mission to work for the user. And I could not be more confident that we have found the right springboard to help even more users.</p><p>To our investors, customers, and our end users â€“ thank you for letting us serve you for 4.5 years. It has been the greatest privilege, and we cannot wait to show you what we&#39;re going to be capable of as part of Amplitude.</p><p><strong>Investors</strong> â€“ we really had no idea what we were doing, but you backed us to do it. If you don&#39;t believe me saying we had no idea,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/commandbar-seed-deck-teardown/"> <u>check out our seed deck</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Customers</strong> â€“ taking a bet on a young startup that wants to embed in your product and interact with your users is... a bet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxZqCJQVTHg"><u>This was the original product they bet on</u></a>. The folks who started the snowball of &#34;Hey, that cool company is using CommandBar (our old name), maybe we should try it&#34; are the only reason our company worked.</p><p><strong>End users</strong> â€“ you probably don&#39;t know us but if you didn&#39;t click our CTAs and chat with our chatbot, no one would pay us.</p><p><strong>Our team</strong> â€“ I now know the greatest professional privilege is to work with good people who care about what you&#39;re collectively building <em>more</em> than you do. It&#39;s the wildest feeling. Every morning I wake up, grab my phone, scroll through Slack, and just marvel at all the great ideas whizzing around, issues being raised and dealt with, and seasoned with good banter.</p><p>The show goes on. We canâ€™t wait to show you what we&#39;re going to be capable of as part of Amplitude. ðŸ«¡</p><p>â€” James </p></div></div>
