">The chief financial officer of the Epoch Times news outlet has been arrested over his alleged involvement in a massive money-laundering scheme. <!-- --></b></p><p>Federal prosecutors allege that Bill Guan, 61, participated in a global plot to launder at least $67m (Â£52m) of illegal cash to benefit himself and the Epoch Times.<!-- --></p><p>According to the indictment, Mr Guan led the outlet&#39;s &#34;Make Money Online&#34; team, which used cryptocurrency to purchase tens of millions worth of crime proceeds. <!-- --></p><p>Mr Guan has not yet entered a plea. If convicted, he could spend more than 30 years in prison.  <!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a statement on Monday evening, the Epoch Times told the BBC that it &#34;intends to and will fully cooperate with any investigation dealing with the allegations against Mr Guan&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;Although Mr Guan is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the company has suspended him until this matter is resolved,&#34; the news outlet said. <!-- --></p><p>It did not respond to specific questions about the Make Money Online team referenced by prosecutors. <!-- --></p><p>Mr Guan could not be reached by the BBC. <!-- --></p><p>In the 12-page indictment, federal prosecutors detailed the alleged plan, which they say began around 2020.<!-- --></p><p>The plot, prosecutors said, was simple: members of the Make Money Online (MMO) team would purchase crime proceeds via cryptocurrency at a discount and transfer those proceeds into bank accounts held by entities affiliated with newspaper. <!-- --></p><p>The illegal proceeds would ultimately be moved back into the Epoch Times accounts through &#34;tens of thousands of layered transactions&#34;, including through prepaid debit cards and financial accounts opened using stolen identification information. <!-- --></p><p>According to the indictment, for years the scheme worked to enriched the Epoch Times, pumping tens of millions of dollars into the paper.<!-- --></p><p>Coinciding with the time Mr Guan came up with the alleged scheme, the outlet&#39;s internal accounting showed its annual revenue balloon by some 410% - from $15m in 2019 to roughly $62m the following year.  <!-- --></p><p>When banks asked Mr Guan where the surge of money was coming from he lied, claiming the funds came from &#34;donations&#34;, prosecutors said.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Guan has been charged with one count of conspiring to commit money laundering and two counts of bank fraud. <!-- --></p><p>Prosecutors noted these charges &#34;do not relate to the Media Company [the Epoch Times&#39;] newsgathering activities&#34;.  <!-- --></p><p>Founded in 2000, the Epoch Times began as a small, low-budget newspaper handed out for free in New York. <!-- --></p><p>It was started by Chinese-Americans affiliated with a religious group called Falun Gong.<!-- --></p><p>In the years since, it has grown into purportedly one of the US&#39;s most powerful conservative news organisations and a home to conspiracy theories, right-wing misinformation and sharp opposition to the Chinese Communist Party.<!-- --></p></div></div>
