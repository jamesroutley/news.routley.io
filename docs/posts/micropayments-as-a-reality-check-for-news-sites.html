    <h1>Micropayments as a reality check for news sites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body_copy"><p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-media-lost-newsstand-micropayments-obvious-way-rick-bruner-dexpe/">Digital
Media Lost the Newsstand. Micropayments Are the Obvious Way Back</a>,
Rick Bruner makes the case for giving micropayments another try.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet has dramatically diversified reading patterns. In the
print era, readers subscribed to a small, fixed set of publications
constrained by geography, distribution, and cost. Today, thanks to
search, aggregators, and social sharing, readers routinely consume
journalism from dozens of sources in the course of a month, including
international and niche publications that were previously inaccessible.
This has expanded total news consumption while weakening the economic
link between any individual reader and any individual publisher. As a
result, large portions of valuable readership generate little or no
direct revenue. Micropayments convert that fragmented, currently
untapped demand into incremental revenue without undermining the
subscription base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And—like any other payments directly from readers—micropayments would
be a multiplier for advertising, not an alternative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a marketplace increasingly distorted by bot activity and opaque
platform reporting, micropayment histories give publishers a powerful,
independent way to demonstrate the authenticity and engagement of their
audience, strengthening their position with advertisers and supporting
premium pricing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <cite>404 Media</cite> team explains the value of a known human
audience in <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/">We
Need Your Email Address</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://digiday.com/media/in-graphic-detail-subscriptions-are-rising-at-big-news-publishers-even-as-traffic-shrinks/">Subscription
revenue is growing at big news publishers even as traffic shrinks</a>,
and that’s good news for legit sites—stuck in a struggle for ad budgets
with Big Tech oligarchs who want to bury us in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260203-paris-prosecutor-s-cybercrime-unit-raids-x-s-french-office">deepfakes,
extreme right wing bullshit</a> and AI slop <a href="https://rjionline.org/news/the-traffic-and-revenue-crisis-for-news-is-a-symptom-of-big-techs-economy-wide-trust-collapse/">until
nobody trusts anybody</a>.</p>
<p>Clay Shirky’s old <a href="http://shirky.com/essays/fame-vs-fortune-micropayments-and-free-content/">argument
against micropayments from 2003</a>, based on mental transaction costs,
doesn’t work so well any more. We know that micropayments can work
because mobile games are a thing. Shirky was probably right for the
micropayments of his day, but mobile game developers have figured out
how to get people to spend money on in-app-purchases (IAP), by turning
it into a two-step process.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>exchange real money for in-game coins—which feels like you’re not
spending, just exchanging one currency for another.</p></li>
<li><p>exchange in-game coins for an in-game asset—which feels like
you’re not spending real money.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A brilliant cognitive trick that works in all kinds of games. Of
course, it doesn’t work on everybody. Figure <a href="https://kotaku.com/free-to-play-mtx-adults-82-video-games-usa-comscore-1851599100">about
half of adults play mobile games, and about 80 percent of those make an
in-app purchase</a>. But if the numbers for a pay by the article system
were similar, that would result in enough payment records to enable an
advertiser to tell a legit site—where somebody spends a coin every so
often—apart from an AI slop site.</p>
<p>So it doesn’t seem like micropayments are necessarily unworkable⁠—⁠and
with a powerful industry devoted to pushing misinformation and slop,
legit content needs every human attention metric it can get—but the
tricky part is how to introduce micropayments. Publishers look at their
subscriber metrics and realize that a lot of subscribers read few enough
stories that they would save a lot of money by canceling and using
micropayments instead.</p>
<p>So it might be better to introduce publisher coins as a bonus feature
for subscribers, then let them leak out to non-subscribers. Instead of
saying that you get 5 gift articles per month, say a gift article is 20
coins and you get 100 free coins a month. Then open them up to more
uses. Another good lesson from how mobile games handle IAP coins is that
they hand out a few to non-buyers to help develop the habit. As part of
a direct sold ad deal, legit sites could issue a stack of coins to legit
advertisers, to hand out to customers, event visitors, and others.</p>
<p>Measuring marketing is already hard enough without a determined set
of adversaries in the picture. And with Big Tech under pressure to
obfuscate and enshittify every data flow, marketers will need to look
harder for trustworthy information. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/only-thing-ai-cant-do-advertising-measure-true-roi-rick-bruner-mkrze/">Rick
Bruner again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ROI for most advertisers is falling in inverse proportion to Big Tech
valuations going up. Advertisers are steadily paying more for less ROI,
and Google, Meta, and Amazon are laughing all the way to the
blockchain.</p>
<p>If there is one thing marketers have even heard about causation —
which, of course, is the ultimate point of advertising, causing
consumers to buy your product who wouldn’t have otherwise — it is that
correlation is not causation. But AI, you see, is nothing but
correlation. Very fast and very sophisticated statistical inference. The
fact remains that to truly know what is having an effect, you need to
conduct a randomized experiment: subjects assigned at random to a test
or control group, presented with an intervention where they are either
treated or not with the stimulus of interest (the ad), and measured
against the outcome of interest (incremental sales).</p>

<section id="the-fog-of-marketing">
<h2>The fog of marketing</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, legit sites are on a clock here. Right now the Big
Tech companies are <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/terminator-ending-for-privacy-sandbox/">quietly
pushing an in-browser advertising attribution tracking system</a>
through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It’s a complicated
proposal, technically, but it aims to centralize attribution measurement
at one chokepoint per browser vendor, so we can safely predict what the
attribution reports are going to look like. <code>beep, boop, the
optimal place to spend your ad money is . . . whatever Performance Max
(or other Big Tech ML) says is the right place to spend your ad
money</code>. If any attribution tracking reports start to come out
looking favorable to legit sites—and potentially costing Big Tech’s
misinfo and slop operations billions—then management will just demand
changes to code, policies, and personnel until the numbers come out the
way they want.</p>
<p>The survival of legit sites depends on how quickly marketers can
level up to stuff like <a href="https://github.com/rickcentralcontrolcom/geo-rct-methodology?utm_source=chatgpt.com">rickcentralcontrolcom/geo-rct-methodology</a>
and not just <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/reinventing-gosplan/">dump
money and customer data in to Big Tech and get conversions out</a>. The
problem with marketing today isn’t that marketers have gotten “too
technical” and ignored the creative mystique or whatever—it’s that
marketers are so afraid to look “non-technical” by asking the hard
questions.</p>
<p>Anyway, just going back and reading this, Rick Bruner has scored a
content marketing win here. Start people off thinking about
micropayments, and that ends up leading to the question of how to figure
out which sites are for real, in the presence of so many gatekeepers
with an interest in pushing the wrong answers? (and <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/you-can-do-something-to-hurt-the">destroying
the legit economy and crushing democracy, but that’s another
story</a>).</p>

<h2>Where micropayments systems can go from here</h2>
<p>Right now a lot of sites have a lot of, let’s just say malarkey to
get through before seeing the actual page.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“consent” dialogs (which don’t get real <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/#consent-principles">consent</a>
anyway, as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-consent-broken-privacy-ai-daniel-solove-1ogpc/">Prof. Daniel
Solove explains</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Email newsletter signups</p></li>
<li><p>Prompts to allow notifications</p></li>
<li><p>Sign in with (company name here)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A micropayment platform that can either eliminate those or act as a
front end for them, to consolidate on zero or one roadblock to get
through before reading, would be a user experience (and revenue) win.
Piling another thing to click onto already long-suffering users is not
the way to get people back to the web. <strong>More:</strong> <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/sharpen-your-pencils-people/">time to sharpen
