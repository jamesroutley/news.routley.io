    <h1>Self-hosting the Tor Project users forum</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A year and a half ago, we <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-forum-a-new-discussion-platform/">launched</a> the <a href="https://forum.torproject.net/">Tor Project users forum</a>, a new
discussion platform based on Discourse, allowing us to continue to grow the Tor
community and experiment new ways to gather feedback and provide support.</p>
<p>Today, we&#39;re happy to announce the forum will soon migrate from the free
cloud hosting graciously provided by the team behind Discourse to the Tor
Project&#39;s own server infrastructure.</p>
<p>This will offer us more control over the forum&#39;s configuration and allow us to
provide an experimental onion service for our users accessing the platform via
the Tor network.</p>
<p>The migration will happen on <strong>June 20th</strong>, 12 days from now.</p>
<p>Once migrated, the forum will have a new address: <a href="https://forum.torproject.org">forum.torproject.org</a>. The
old address will automatically redirect visitors to the new one.</p>
<h2>Important note for two-factor authentication</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re using a U2F key for two-factor authentication (2FA) on the forum,
youâ€™ll have to use a backup code in order to login after the migration.
Alternatively, you can disable two-factor authentication on your account before
the migration and re-enable it afterward. <strong>Please make sure you have either
saved a copy of your backup codes or disabled 2FA before 2023-06-20, or you
will be locked out of your forum account!</strong></p>
<p>Issues with the forum following the migration may be reported through the
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/support">usual support channels</a>.</p>
