    <h1>A Single-Cycle 64-Bit RISC-V Register File</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>It’s a simple question really: how can you read and write to the same register
in a single-cycle processor? If you have spent most of your life working with
software, it is tempting to think of all events as happening sequentially.
However, that sequential model that we have become so familiar with as software
engineers is really an abstraction that hardware offers to us to help our simple
brains reason about logic. In reality, the physical world is continuous, and
processors are the component that allow us to interact with it using sequential
operations.</p>
<p>In the memory hierarchy of machines, the fastest memory that lives closest to
the processor are the registers. The component within the processor that
controls reading and writing to this memory is commonly referred to as the
<strong>register file</strong>. In previous posts, we outlined why <code>moss</code> is <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/why-create-new-isa/">based on the
64-bit RISC-V integer
instruction</a> set (<code>RV64I</code>),
and also made the decision to initially <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/single-cycle-multicycle-processor-performance/">use a single-cycle
implementation</a>
for the processor. All RISC-V architectures use 32 general purpose registers
(GPRs), but the size of each register depends on the width of the architecture
(referred to as <code>XLEN</code> is RISC-V parlance), which in our case 64 bits. Let’s
take a look at the <code>moss</code> register file <a href="https://github.com/mosscomp/moss/blob/0a65b3f699692321fc0c8b3f99d267b465ef6967/rtl/regfile.v">as of
today</a>:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As one of the simpler components in a processor, the <code>moss</code> register file
consists of just a few inputs and outputs, and the internal logic is fairly
minimal. The <code>registers</code> declaration matches the assertion that 32 64-bit
registers are implemented.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="verilog"><span><span>    <span>reg</span> [<span>63</span>:<span>0</span>] registers [<span>31</span>:<span>0</span>];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The following statements ensure that the outputs, <code>rv1</code> and <code>rv2</code> (i.e.
“register value 1”, “register value 2”), are continuously assigned the values of
the registers specified by the <code>rs1</code> and <code>rs2</code> (i.e. “register source 1”,
“register source 2”) inputs.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="verilog"><span><span>    <span>assign</span> rv1 = registers[rs1];
</span></span><span><span>    <span>assign</span> rv2 = registers[rs2];
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So far, we haven’t encountered any sequential operations. We only have a circuit
that changes its output in response to changes of input. However, the next block
introduces a procedural block (<code>always</code>) with a sensitivity list containing a
single trigger on the positive edge of the clock signal (<code>posedge clk</code>).</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="verilog"><span><span>    <span>always</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk) <span>begin</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>if</span> (write_ctrl)
</span></span><span><span>	    <span>begin</span>
</span></span><span><span>	        registers[rd] &lt;= data;
</span></span><span><span>      <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Logic wrapped in this block will only be evaluated on positive transitions (i.e.
low to high) of the clock signal. In this case, the logic states that if
<code>write_ctrl</code> is high, we write the contents of the <code>data</code> input, a 64-bit value,
to the register specified by <code>rd</code> (i.e. “register destination”).</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/single-cycle-multicycle-processor-performance/">last
post</a>,
we talked about the classic 5 stages of executing an instruction in a processor:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fetch</strong></li>
<li><strong>Decode</strong></li>
<li><strong>Execute</strong></li>
<li><strong>Memory Access</strong></li>
<li><strong>Write-Back</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The register file is involved in Execute (3) and Write-Back (5), though not all
instructions require (5). In the integer instruction set, there are <a href="https://danielmangum.com/posts/risc-v-bytes-intro-instruction-formats/#risc-v-instruction-format-overview">six formats
defined</a>:
<code>R</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>U</code>, and <code>J</code>. Today we’ll focus on <code>R</code> as it is the only
format that includes instructions that make use of <code>rs1</code>, <code>rs2</code>, and <code>rd</code> (i.e.
they read from two source registers and write to one destination). Specifically,
we’ll only use the <code>ADD</code> instruction. Consider the following sequence:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="nasm"><span><span>add a2, a0, a1
</span></span><span><span>add a3, a0, a2
</span></span><span><span>add a2, a2, a2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first instruction will add the value in the <code>a0</code> register to the value in
the <code>a1</code> register and store it in <code>a2</code>. In a vacuum, one could reasonably assume
that this can happen in a single cycle, even without sequential logic. For a
moment, let’s pretend our register file logic looked like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="verilog"><span><span>    <span>reg</span> [<span>63</span>:<span>0</span>] registers [<span>31</span>:<span>0</span>];
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>assign</span> rv1 = registers[rs1];
</span></span><span><span>    <span>assign</span> rv2 = registers[rs2];
</span></span><span><span>    <span>assign</span> registers[rd] = data;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There is no longer a clock or write control signal involved, and everything is
assigned continuously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to remember that the order of continuous assignments in
Verilog are inconsequential. We are designing a circuit, not writing a
program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of illustration, we’ll start with our registers populated with
arbitrary values.</p>
<p><img src="https://danielmangum.com/static/moss_single_regfile_0.png" alt="moss-single-regfile-0"/></p>
<p>For the first instruction, the inputs and outputs would be what we expect
because there is a stable state that can be reached. The inputs specified by the
instruction (<code>rs1</code>, <code>rs2</code>, <code>rd</code>) are constant and independent. That is, the
instruction is not changing and the registers specified (<code>a0</code>, <code>a1</code>, <code>a2</code>) are
all different. Though the data input will change based on the values read from
the a0 and a1 registers, it will eventually be written to a2, at which point
there will be no further state changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://danielmangum.com/static/moss_single_regfile_1.png" alt="moss-single-regfile-1"/></p>
<p>However, when we move to the second instruction, <code>rs2</code> and <code>rd</code> change, and the
continuous assignment of <code>data</code> to the register specified by <code>rd</code> will cause a
race between the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of <code>data</code> being written to <code>a2</code> (previous <code>rd</code>)</li>
<li>The value of <code>data</code> being updated to reflect the sum of the values of <code>a0</code> and
<code>a2</code> (previous <code>rs1</code> and <code>rs2</code>)</li>
<li>The value of <code>data</code> being written to <code>a3</code> (new <code>rd</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on which of these occurs first, the final state may differ. For
example, if <code>data</code>, which is calculated outside of the register file, is also
being continuously assigned, some intermediate value could be written to <code>a2</code>,
and that could change the value read from <code>a2</code>, which could also change the
value written to <code>a3</code>. This results in an unpredictable stable state.</p>
<p><img src="https://danielmangum.com/static/moss_single_regfile_2.png" alt="moss-single-regfile-2"/></p>
<p>This conundrum is even more apparent with the third instruction, as <code>a2</code> is used
as both source registers and the destination. This results in a circuit that
would never be stable. Reading from <code>a2</code> and calculating the sum of its value
with itself results in updating the data, which results in writing a new value
to <code>a2</code>, and so on; a stable state will never be reached. This is known as a
combinational loop.</p>
<p><img src="https://danielmangum.com/static/moss_single_regfile_3.png" alt="moss-single-regfile-3"/></p>
<p>Simulation of the logic using Verilator can be seen in the following waveform.
The values of <code>rv1</code>, <code>rv2</code>, and <code>a2</code> (<code>registers(2)</code>) are changing on every
evaluation step, all within the same clock cycle. Or said another way, the
values at the end of the clock cycle are not deterministic.</p>

  </a>
</h2>
<p>Fortunately, we do not continuously assign the <code>data</code> value to the register
specified by <code>rd</code>. Instead, our procedural block makes use of edge-triggered
logic to only evaluate whether write-back should occur, and, if so, perform it,
when the clock changes from low to high. This is typically implemented via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#D_flip-flop">D
flip-flop
circuits</a>.</p>
<p>But the original question still remains: how can you read and write to the same
register in a single-cycle processor? <code>rv1</code> and <code>rv2</code> are still continuously
assigned, so changing the values in the registers referred to by <code>rs1</code> and <code>rs2</code>
will result in <code>rv1</code> and <code>rv2</code> also being updated. However, though the <code>data</code>
value is calculated within the cycle in which the instruction is executed, it
only gets written when the clock goes from low to high. Therefore, on the rising
edge of the next instruction’s clock cycle, the edge-triggered logic will result
in <code>data</code> being written to the register referred to by <code>rd</code> from the previous
instruction (assuming the instruction requires write-back), and further writes
will not be able to be performed until the next rising edge.</p>
<p>It is helpful to remember that the register file is just one component of the
larger processor. When the clock cycle starts for a new instruction, we still
have to fetch and decode it, which won’t happen until the program counter is
incremented, which also is implemented using edge-triggered logic.</p>
<p><img src="https://danielmangum.com/static/moss_single_regfile_4.png" alt="moss-single-regfile-4"/></p>
<p>Between one rising edge and the next, the state of wires may be changing
frequently, which is the part we don’t see when we write software. As long as
values become stable within the duration of a clock cycle, it appears as though
we have a sequential machine. Whether a given circuit that <em>will</em> become stable
<em>does</em> become stable within the duration is another complex topic, and we’ll
dive deeper into <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Blog/2021/06/07/18/52/ImportanceofTimingConstraints">timing
constraints</a>
