    <h1>Miniature Macintosh with Raspberry Pi</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p><span>The original Macintosh’s boxy all-in-one design is iconic, but has long been surpassed by modern computing options. If you’d like a reminder of this techno-touchstone, in a boxy beige form factor that won’t dominate your desk, </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tiny-Mac-II-Pi-Zero-2-and-Tiny-Mac-III-Pi-4-With-A/" rel="nofollow">the Tiny Mac III uses a Pi 4 </a><span>to cram lots of retro goodness into a very small package.</span></p><p><span>The device was inspired by </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Making-a-Tiny-Mac-From-a-Raspberry-Pi-Zero/" rel="nofollow">the Tiny Mac</a><span> running on a Raspberry Pi Zero, which was in turn inspired by a similar little Mac </span><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2013/08/28/13-scale-classic-macintosh-made-with-raspberry-pi/" rel="nofollow">built a decade ago</a><span>. Creator The_Old_Wolf first built a Tiny Mac II with a Pi Zero 2, then branched off from its predecessors with a Pi 4 processing unit. This gives the Tiny Mac III lots of power to perform functions like running Pi-hole for ad blocking, using xscreensaver as an electronic photo frame, or even running gnome-weather to display conditions outside.</span></p><p>The Tiny Mac III features a 3D-printed enclosure, which houses the Pi 4 inside along with a 3.5&#34; Waveshare display as the monitor. The screen connector was cleverly modified to include a gap where pins for a safe shutdown button were installed. The button is mounted to the back, near a composite Apple/Raspberry Pi logo. Another brilliant touch is that the Pi&#39;s activity LED is visible via a fiber optic cable that routes light to the outside of the case.</p><p><span>Build and software instructions can be found </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tiny-Mac-II-Pi-Zero-2-and-Tiny-Mac-III-Pi-4-With-A/" rel="nofollow">in the project write-up</a><span>, and resources are available there as well as </span><a href="https://github.com/Lupus1968/TinyMac" rel="nofollow">on GitHub</a><span>. This also includes info on The_Old_Wolf’s Tiny Mac II. Between these and previous builds, there should be ample inspiration if you want to make your own mini-retro Macintosh!</span></p></div></section></div>
