    <h1>New plans for self-hosted Zulip customers</h1>

for efficient communication. Zulip is available as a
<a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">cloud service</a> or a
<a href="https://zulip.com/self-hosting/">self-hosted solution</a>. Organizations that
self-host Zulip can do so on their own (relying on
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/index.html">extensive documentation</a>
and best-effort <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">community</a> support),
or purchase commercial support for their installation. You can learn more about
Zulip in
<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/12/15/zulip-8-0-released/">today’s blog post</a>
announcing the 8.0 release.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-changing">What is changing</h2>
<p>Starting today, new self-hosted customers will no longer get unlimited free
access to
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html">Zulip’s Mobile Push Notification Service</a>.
Organizations with more than 10 users will need to sign up for a plan in order
to access the service. For current users of the service, unlimited free access
will end on <strong>February 15, 2024.</strong></p>
<p>We now offer two <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/#self-hosted">new plans</a> that include
unlimited access to mobile push notifications. The <strong>Business</strong> plan also
includes expert commercial support. The <strong>Community</strong> plan is free of charge,
and is
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/self-hosted-billing#free-community-plan">available</a> to
open-source projects, research groups, and communities.</p>
<p>As always, we remain fully <a href="https://zulip.com/values/">committed</a> to Zulip’s
100% open-source model. Organizations that do not require technical support or
services from us can freely install and use a complete version of Zulip. We are
not turning Zulip into a proprietary product with an “open core” demo version —
Zulip’s open-source software <em>is the product</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-are-introducing-a-new-business-plan">Why we are introducing a new Business plan</h2>
<p>Our aim is to make signing up for the new Business plan be the norm for
businesses relying on self-hosted Zulip as their mission-critical communication
platform. This will generate revenue for the company that stewards and
financially supports Zulip’s development.</p>
<p>Zulip is proudly independent, with
<a href="https://zulip.com/values/#building-a-sustainable-business-aligned-with-our-values">no venture capital funding</a>,
which means that our revenue strongly impacts the pace of Zulip’s development.
In addition to supporting the project as a whole, we expect this change will let
us dedicate more resources to product improvements requested by Zulip’s
self-hosted customers.</p>
<p>We also believe the new Business plan will establish a better framework for our
relationship with self-hosted customers. Until now, purchasing commercial
support required a conversation with our sales team. In practice, this process
felt too heavy for most small- and medium-sized businesses, and they would
instead end up self-managing their Zulip installation.</p>
<p>Self-managing might be OK for a while, but an extended team chat outage can stop
work in its tracks; Slack incidents regularly trigger a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/technology/slack-down.html">flurry</a>
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/07/27/office-messaging-app-slack-is-down-company-says-its-investigating/">of</a>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23835971/slack-major-issues-outage-send-messages">media</a>
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/slack-down-not-working-status-latest-b2425211.html">coverage</a>
about the disruption. This puts a big burden on system administrators who are
responsible for securing, maintaining, and upgrading a Zulip server on their
own.</p>
<p>Commercial support will now be included when organizations buy Business plan
access to
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html">Zulip’s Mobile Push Notification Service</a>.
Our support team can answer questions about installation and upgrades, provide
guidance in tricky situations, and help avoid painful complications before they
happen. We can also guide organizations on how best to use dozens of Zulip
features and configuration options.</p>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
<p>The Business plan is priced at $6.67/user/month with annual billing (or $8/month
billed monthly), which is the same price as
<a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">Zulip Cloud Standard</a>. This model lets organizations
budget for using Zulip without having to decide whether self-hosting or Zulip
Cloud will <a href="https://zulip.com/help/zulip-cloud-or-self-hosting">better suit</a>
their needs. On our side, the resources required to provide an excellent support
experience for a wide range of self-hosted configurations more than balance
Zulip Cloud hosting costs.</p>
<p>We offer a 30-day free trial of Zulip Business to make it convenient to run a
full-scale Zulip evaluation with your team, and never have to pay if you go with
a different chat product.</p>
<p>We created Zulip to empower teams to collaborate effectively, and are confident
that the <a href="https://zulip.com/why-zulip/">increased productivity from using Zulip</a>
makes our plans well worthwhile for organizations that pay people to get work
done.</p>
<p>As an example, the annual plan will pay for itself if an employee making
$65K/year saves just <em>3 minutes per week</em> [1] by using Zulip. Put another way,
the cost of the plan is <em>0.12%</em> of that employee’s direct compensation, not even
counting overhead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In fact now it seems strange to me to just fire off messages in Slack with no
subject – that’s chaos, madness. The genius of subject lines is that you can
quickly and easily catch up on the messages you missed in your off-hours… This
feature alone saves me hours a week.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In addition to providing a free Community plan, we offer
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/self-hosted-billing#business-plan-discounts">generous discounts</a>
for organizations whose circumstances make the Business plan pricing hard to
afford. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@zulip.com">sales@zulip.com</a> if you
have any questions.</p>
<h2 id="why-a-mobile-push-notification-service-is-needed">Why a mobile push notification service is needed</h2>
<p>As Zulip’s maintainers, we publish the
<a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile#readme">open-source</a> Zulip mobile apps
for <a href="https://zulip.com/apps/ios">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://zulip.com/apps/android">Android</a>, and offer a
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html">service</a>
that allows self-hosted Zulip servers to send mobile push notifications to their
users. Mobile push notifications must be centrally managed due to iOS and
Android
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html#why-a-push-notification-service-is-necessary">app store policies</a>.</p>
<p>We will continue to offer the
<a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/mobile-push-notifications.html">Zulip’s Mobile Push Notification Service</a>
free of charge for organizations with up to 10 users, and for organizations
eligible for the Community plan.</p>
<h2 id="what-these-changes-mean-for-self-hosted-customers">What these changes mean for self-hosted customers</h2>
<p>If you are a current user of the Mobile Push Notification Service, you will
continue to have unlimited free access to the service until <strong>February
15, 2024.</strong> Starting today, you also can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Do nothing.</strong> We remain <a href="https://zulip.com/values/">committed</a> to Zulip’s
100% open source model, so you do not have to purchase a plan in order to use
Zulip. We are not turning Zulip into a proprietary product with an “open core”
demo version — Zulip’s open-source software <em>is the product</em>. This option
doesn’t include support, and access to the Mobile Push Notification Service
will end on February 15, 2024 for organizations with more than 10 users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply for Zulip Community.</strong> The Community plan is free of charge, and
<a href="http://(details)">available</a> to open-source projects, research groups, and
community organizations. It includes unlimited push notifications and
community support for many Zulip features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrade to Zulip Business or Zulip Enterprise.</strong> Both plans include
unlimited access to the Mobile Push Notification Service, and commercial
support for dozens of features and integrations that help businesses take full
advantage of their Zulip implementation. Zulip Enterprise additionally
includes real-time support during installation and upgrades, technical support
for advanced deployment options, and more. Discounts are available for
education, non-profits, customers based in the developing world, and other
situations where the standard Zulip Business pricing would be a stretch for an
organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move to Zulip Cloud</strong>. The Business plan is priced the same as
<a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">Zulip Cloud Standard</a>, which we hope will help you
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/zulip-cloud-or-self-hosting">choose</a> between
self-hosting and Zulip Cloud based on what best suits your needs. If you would
like to switch to Zulip Cloud hosting, with its professionally managed, always
up-to-date experience, our high-quality
<a href="https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization">export</a> tools make it easy
to move your organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve put a lot of care into designing a pricing model that we believe offers
great value compared to other team chat options on the market, and allows
organizations without an IT budget to continue using Zulip unchanged, for free.
If this announcement makes you consider migrating off Zulip, please
<a href="mailto:sales@zulip.com">get in touch with us</a> before you make your decision —
we may be able to help!</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>You can <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/#self-hosted">learn more</a> about the new plans,
and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/self-hosted-billing">read</a> detailed instructions on
how to sign up. When you upgrade to the Business plan, you can start the plan
right away (if you’d like support to start immediately), or schedule a February
15 start date.</p>
<p>Upgrading your Zulip server to version 8.0
(<a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2023/12/15/zulip-8-0-released/">released today</a>!) makes
it significantly more convenient to manage your plan, but you do <em>not</em> have to
upgrade your Zulip installation in order to sign up for a plan. The same plans
are offered for all Zulip versions.</p>
<p>If you wish to apply for the Community plan or a discounted Business plan, we
strongly recommend submitting your application by January 31 in case additional
information is required before your application is approved.</p>
<h3 id="let-us-know-if-we-can-help">Let us know if we can help</h3>
<p>We’d love to work with you to make the transition as smooth as possible for your
organization. If you have any questions or concerns about the next steps, the
timeline, which plan is appropriate for you, or anything else, send us a note at
