Cowles is a historian of modern science and medicine based at the University of Michigan. His research and teaching focus on the sciences of mind and brain, evolutionary theory, and the experimental ideal in the United States and Great Britain. His book, <em>The Scientific Method: An Evolution of Thinking from Darwin to Dewey,</em> was published by Harvard University Press in 2020. Current projects include a study of the relationship between tools and theories in psychology and psychiatry since 1800 and a history of habit from the celebration of daily routine in Thoreau&#39;s <em>Walden</em> to the rise of “persuasive technologies&#34; in Silicon Valley and beyond.</strong></p><p>LARB CONTRIBUTOR</p></div></div></div></section><section></section></div></div>
