<p>What fol­lows is a nar­ra­tive descrip­tion of a pro­to­col that I believe might open up some inter­est­ing new pos­si­bil­i­ties on the inter­net. My goal here isn’t to “sell you” on its design; rather, I just want to lay out my think­ing as clearly as I can.</p>
<p>It’s okay to share this link, but I want to under­score that I am send­ing it specif­i­cally to you with the hope that you will … really think about it! At such a pri­mor­dial stage, a pro­posal like this doesn’t need diffuse, drive-by attention. It needs, instead, close con­sid­er­a­tion and gen­er­ous imagination.</p>
<p>If you are return­ing to this newslet­ter after read­ing it once before, don’t miss the grow­ing <a href="#discussion">dis­cus­sion</a>.</p>
<p>Since mid-June, a ton of great work has percolated; you’ll find much of it linked <a href="https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83-spec">in the GitHub project</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Provocation</h2>
<p>Near the end of last year, I asked myself:</p>
<p><em>What do you want from the inter­net, anyway?</em></p>
<p>Somewhat to my surprise, I found an answer waiting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I want to fol­low peo­ple who are inter­est­ing to me, in a way that’s sim­ple, expres­sive, and predictable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want this to work, furthermore, whether those peo­ple are shar­ing a ran­dom thought every day, a blog post every week, or an art project every two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I want it to work, of course, across media, so I can fol­low writers, musicians, programmers, theorists, troublemakers … </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty basic! And yet, noth­ing on the inter­net presently allows me to do <span>this — </span><wbr/>not in a way that’s suf­fi­ciently sim­ple, expres­sive, and predictable.</p>
<p>“Surely,” you say, “either Twit­ter, RSS, or email must suffice.”</p>
<p>Well, let’s go through them, quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter’s time­line is a muddle.</strong> It’s too uneven; when a user stops speaking, they disappear, and, by corollary, as a fol­lower, you mostly encounter the users who are speak­ing nonstop. In my mem­ory, Twitter was once a gen­er­ous router of attention, with an ecol­ogy friendly to links; as the years have ticked by, the cir­cle has tightened, and today, Twit­ter points mostly into itself.</p>
<p>That’s not the only problem. <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/lost-thread/">As I wrote earlier:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many ways peo­ple might relate to one another online, so many ways exchange and con­vivi­al­ity might be organized. Look at these screens, this wash of pixels, the liq­uid potential! What a colos­sal bum­mer that Twit­ter eked out a local maximum; that its net­work effect still (!) con­sumes the fuel for other pos­si­bil­i­ties, other explorations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means I’m unin­ter­ested in the projects that accept Twit­ter’s design as sen­si­ble and try to imple­ment it “better”. (I’m think­ing of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a>, and <a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">Bluesky</a>.) A decen­tral­ized or fed­er­ated timeline is still a timeline, and for me, the time­line is the problem.</p>
<p><strong>RSS is too stark.</strong> I fol­low a lot of RSS feeds, and I appreciate them, and I almost want to leave it at that; noth­ing’s more bor­ing than re-litigating RSS. I will just observe that there is some­thing about this tech­nol­ogy that has seemed, over the years, to scold rather than invite; enclose rather than expand; and strip away rather than layer upon.</p>
<p>For my part, I believe presentation is fused to content; I believe pre­sen­ta­tion is a <em>kind</em> of con­tent; so RSS can­not be the end of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Email is a retreat.</strong> You prob­a­bly reached this web page through an email. Whew! It worked! The thing is, email inboxes have been algo­rith­mic for a long time, and pub­lish­ers strug­gle with Gmail’s caprice almost as much as they do Instagram’s. Furthermore, email’s crusty underpinnings, though they are pre­cisely what make it so sturdy, really pinch at a moment when the web’s expres­sive power is waxing strong.</p>
<p>For me, the recent resur­gence of the email newslet­ter feels not much like a renaissance, and more like a mass­ing of exhausted refugees in the last reli­able shelter. I’m glad we have it; but email can­not be the end of the story, either.</p>
<p>I’m dis­sem­bling a bit. The truth is, I reject Twit­ter, RSS, and email also because … I am hyped up to invent things!</p>
<p>So it came to pass that I found myself dream­ing about designs that might sat­isfy my requirements, while also sup­port­ing new inter­ac­tions, new ways of relating, new aesthetics. At the same time, I read a ton about the early days of the inter­net. I devoured oral histories; I dug into old pro­to­cols.</p>
<p>The cru­cial spark was <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc865.html">RFC 865</a>, pub­lished by the great Jon Pos­tel in May 1983. The mod­ern TCP/IP inter­net had only just come online that January, can you believe it? RFC 865 describes a Quote of the Day Pro­to­col:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A server lis­tens for TCP con­nec­tions on TCP port 17. Once a connection is estab­lished a short mes­sage is sent out the con­nection (and any data received is thrown away). The ser­vice closes the con­nec­tion after send­ing the quote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it. That’s the pro­to­col.</p>
<p>I read RFC 865, and I thought about May 1983. How the internet might have felt at that moment. Jon Pos­tel main­tained its sim­ple DNS by hand. There was a time when, you wanted a com­puter to have a name on the inter­net, you emailed Jon.</p>
<p>There’s a way of think­ing about, and with, the inter­net of that era that isn’t mere nostalgia, but rather a con­jur­ing of the deep oppor­tu­ni­ties and excite­ments of this global machine. I’ll say it again. There are so many ways peo­ple might relate to one another online, so many ways exchange and con­vivi­al­ity might be organized.</p>
<p>Spring ‘83 isn’t over yet.</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>
<p>From my lab notebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FIRST LIGHT: suc­cess­ful request to server, cryp­to­graphic ver­i­fi­ca­tion in browser, and dis­play, on Sun April 24 at 3:42 pm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spring ‘83 is a pro­to­col for the trans­mis­sion and dis­play of some­thing I am call­ing a “board”, which is an HTML fragment, lim­ited to 2217 bytes, unable to exe­cute JavaScript or load exter­nal resources, but oth­er­wise unrestricted. Boards invite pub­lish­ers to use all the rich­ness of mod­ern HTML and CSS. Plain text and blue links are also enthusiastically sup­ported.</p>
<p>The trans­mis­sion side of the pro­to­col is a tiny HTTP API; the dis­play side is a simple set of rules. Put together, they help users fol­low <span>pub­lish­ers — </span><wbr/>who might be peo­ple, com­puter programs, or any­thing <span>else — </span><wbr/>in a way that is (you guessed it) sim­ple, expres­sive, and predictable.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83">Here’s the cur­rent draft spe­cification.</a> I hope it is leg­i­ble to the spec-read­ers among you; this is, I have discovered, a really dif­fi­cult kind of writing!</p>
<p>I am not shar­ing, at this time, code for a client or server, although I have ref­er­ence imple­mentations of both that I’m test­ing with a cou­ple of friends. I’ll post them on GitHub eventually … but I think there’s some­thing inter­est­ing, maybe useful, about approach­ing this first as a dis­cus­sion. Per­haps it leaves a lit­tle more space, here at the start, for imagination.</p>
<p>Also gives me a chance to avoid the <em>really</em> ruinous errors.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve now posted a sim­ple <a href="https://github.com/robinsloan/the-oakland-follower-sentinel">demo client</a>. There are a few server imple­mentations brewing, too! The ones I know about are <a href="https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83">listed here</a>.</p>
<p>Before I go further, I want to say: I recommend this kind of project, this fla­vor of puzzle, to any­one who feels tan­gled up by the present state of the inter­net. Pro­to­col design is a form of inves­ti­ga­tion and critique. Even if what I describe below goes nowhere, I’ll be very glad to have done this think­ing and writing. I found it chal­leng­ing and energizing.</p>
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>On the client side, Spring ‘83 rejects the time­line and the inbox, aspir­ing instead to the logic of news­pa­per <span>classifieds — </span><wbr/></p>
<p><img src="https://www.robinsloan.com/img/sf-chronicle-may-1-1983.gif" alt="Classifieds"/></p>
<p>—and vin­tage comic books <span>ads — </span><wbr/></p>
<p><img src="https://www.robinsloan.com/img/wired-comic-ads.jpg" alt="Comic book ads"/></p>
<p>—and mag­a­zine racks:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.robinsloan.com/img/il-gazzettino.jpg" alt="Newsstand"/></p>
<p>A touch of chaos? Yes. More importantly, every board holds its place, regard­less of when it was last updated. Each pub­lisher main­tains just one; there is no con­cept of a history. Think instead of a white­board that is amended or erased, or a mag­a­zine replaced with the new edition.</p>
<p>Client appli­ca­tions dis­play all the boards you are fol­lowing together, lay­ing them out on a 2D canvas, pro­duc­ing unplanned juxtapositions, just like the news­stand above. Boards might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>mini home pages, updated regularly with new work</li>
<li>lists of links to web pages recently read, perhaps with brief notes</li>
<li>daily logs, wiped clean each morning</li>
<li>yawlps to the universe</li>
</ul>
<p>Some boards will be baroque CSS confections, others a sen­tence and a link in the sys­tem font, still others blar­ing <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>s. Some pub­lishers will be friends, others anony­mous geniuses, still oth­ers robots. You’ll follow and unfol­low pub­lish­ers with a sim­ple inter­face defined by the client, not the pro­to­col.</p>
<p>Spring ‘83 clients com­bine fol­lowing and pub­lishing. A board isn’t a project you man­age separately; it’s a chunk of HTML you edit right there along­side the oth­ers, per­haps assisted by a sim­ple template.</p>
<p>You might react to a book with a board like this:</p>
<board-item>
<p>Just fin­ished <i>Ways of Being</i>, the new Bri­dle book. What a kaleidoscope. The mate­r­ial on alter­na­tive approaches to computing, includ­ing liq­uid com­puters (!), was fascinating.</p>
<p>Previously:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mountain in the Sea</li>
<li>Frankenstein audiobook</li>
<li>A truckload of Edgar Allan Poe</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="mailto:robin@robinsloan.com">💌 Recs wel­come!</a></p>
</board-item>
<p>Or with one like this:</p>
<board-item>
<p>This book is so good it&#39;s mak­ing me mad</p>
</board-item>
<p>Hmm, nice gradient. I could use one of those. No problem: clients always sup­port View Source.</p>
<p>You might update your board twice an hour or twice a month; you might amend one sen­tence or reboot the whole thing. Pub­lish­ing a new ver­sion is instantaneous, as easy as tap­ping a button. You don’t have to man­age a server to pub­lish a board; you don’t even have to estab­lish an <em>account</em> on a server.</p>
<p>Spring ‘83 doesn’t for­mal­ize inter­ac­tions and relationships. The pro­to­col doesn’t pro­vide any mech­a­nism for replies, likes, favorites, or, indeed, feed­back of any kind. Pub­lish­ers are encour­aged to use the full flex­i­bil­ity of HTML to develop their own approaches, invit­ing read­ers to respond via email, join a live chat, send a postcard … whatever!</p>
<p>This is a “pull-only” pro­to­col. As a user, you don’t see any­thing you didn’t specif­i­cally ask to see; no notifications, no recommendations, no unsolicited mes­sages.</p>
<p>There are no analytics, obviously. Noth­ing is counted. Boards can’t load track­ing pixels, and they can’t ping remote ana­lyt­ics APIs. Sorry, folks … you’ve got to let go of the numbers. In 2022, they are not help­ful feed­back, but rather a clear warn­ing you are in the wrong place.</p>
<p>This raises the question, how can a net­work that abjures all these dark pat­terns pos­si­bly grow? The only pos­si­ble answer is: I don’t know! Maybe we’ll fig­ure it out together.</p>

<h2>Transmission</h2>
<p>Let’s turn to the server side. The trans­mis­sion pro­to­col, a tiny HTTP API, is out­lined in <a href="https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83/">the spec</a>. There are two things to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In operation, a Spring ‘83 server is mostly a “plain old web” server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boards are cryp­to­graphically signed in such a way that they can be passed from server to server and, no mat­ter where your client gets a copy of a pub­lisher’s board, you can be assured it is valid.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The under­ly­ing cryptography is sim­ple, <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures">totally off the rack</a>, but still, every time I think about it, I’m aston­ished it works. Because pub­lish­ers are iden­ti­fied by public keys, and because their boards are signed using those same pub­lic keys, the pub­lisher/board link is “self-certifying”, a term <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.32.6773&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">gleaned from David Mazières’s 2000 Ph.D thesis</a>.</p>
<p>In a self-certifying sys­tem, con­tent car­ries its own durable provenance, allow­ing a net­work of servers to share it between them, and if one or two or a hun­dred are male­fac­tors bent on deception, who cares? They can’t fool us.</p>
<p>So … who runs these servers?</p>
<p>A large frac­tion of my think­ing about this pro­to­col has con­sisted of me squirm­ing out of actu­ally oper­at­ing infrastructure. I squirm still. My appetite for main­tain­ing a server is infinitesimal. I whine to myself: can’t I just <em>propose</em> some­thing? Do I really have to <em>operate</em> it?</p>
<p>Then, I remember a con­ver­sa­tion with <a href="https://twitter.com/hannu?lang=en">Hannu Rajaniemi</a> about Frankenstein, one in which Hannu lamented the novel’s com­mon por­trayal as a cau­tion­ary tale about sci­en­tific hubris. In fact, Hannu argued, Frankenstein’s tragic mistake was not cre­at­ing the monster. Mary Shel­ley makes this very, very clear: the great mis­take was abandoning him.</p>
<p>Fine, okay, I get it! And yet: the last thing I want to do is start an inter­net business, even a cute, “sustainable” one. Data­bases ter­rify me. I’m offline for long stretches of the year. How is this pos­si­bly going to work?</p>
<p>Well, here’s an argument for you. Pro­to­cols aren’t only for using; <em>they are for imple­menting</em>. That’s part of their value in the world. They sup­port nego­ta­tions between devices, <span>yes — </span><wbr/>and also con­ver­sa­tions, even games, between peo­ple. This has been for­got­ten as pro­to­cols have got­ten <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html">more complicated</a>, but when I read the early RFCs, I get it so clearly: pro­to­col as puzzle, argu­ment, joke!</p>
<p>Spring ‘83 is very sim­ple, so I hope it might invite imple­mentation, just for fun, in your favorite pro­gram­ming language, on your weird­est device, with plenty of elbow room for exper­i­men­ta­tion and innovation.</p>

<h2>Invitation</h2>
<p>So that’s the idea. On the client side, a light­weight HTML mag­a­zine rack offered as an alter­na­tive to the time­line; on the server side, a fed­er­ated net­work that tries to be more than just a bur­den to its operators, with an invi­ta­tion to invent and explore.</p>
<p>I’m dis­trib­ut­ing this to you as an RRFFCC, which of course stands for Robin’s Request For Friendly Cri­tique and Comment. For my part, I’ll con­tinue to test my ref­er­ence imple­mentation with a very small group of peo­ple. I’m in no great rush with <span>this — </span><wbr/>which is a new feel­ing for me.</p>
<p>It was the expe­ri­ence of draft­ing <a href="https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83">the spec</a> that changed my view, and my pace. Writing! Gets you every time! It also helped me under­stand the appeal of the crypto white papers, honestly. Doc­u­ments like these give you an oppor­tu­nity to boot some­thing up in your head, exam­ine it in a way that’s technical, sure, but also literary, imaginative, maybe even dreamlike … I don’t know; I like it!</p>
<p>Anyway … I wonder if you might want some of the same things from the inter­net that I do. I wonder if you, too, might be hyped up to invent things. If so, I invite dis­cus­sion all up and down the lad­der of abstraction, from the pro­to­col’s broad aims to its spe­cific strategies. Send me a note, <code>robin@robinsloan.com</code>, or pub­lish your thoughts and pass along the link. I’ll add it here.</p>
<p>In another year it will be Spring 2023, the mod­ern inter­net’s for­ti­eth birthday. Four decades is <span>noth­ing — </span><wbr/>the kind of inter­val that rolls up neatly for storage, like a pro­jec­tor screen. Spring ‘83 is still graspable, in mem­ory and in spirit, and time remains to build a net­work that can take us hap­pily into the 2020s and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>I have received a ton of ter­rific email <span>correspondence — </span><wbr/>thank you!</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://tinysubversions.com/spring-83/rrffcc-dfk-1.txt">a pub­lic con­sid­er­a­tion</a> from Dar­ius Kazemi, who has</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some expe­ri­ence review­ing RFCs, as I did a year­long blog project where I wrote about each of the first 365 RFC documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://write.as/365-rfcs/table-of-contents">What amaz­ing context.</a> As I mentioned above, I found the par­tic­u­lar genre of the RFC, or RFC-alike, extremely chal­leng­ing (not in a bad way); so, feed­back from some­one who “knows from RFC” couldn’t be more wel­come or useful. As you’ll see, Dar­ius’s notes have a lot to do with clarity, the “why” along­side the “how”.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/06/10/following-people-outside-feed/">some musings</a> from Tracy Durnell, focused on design, which is fantastic. It’s help­ful to see her think through a few ways that Spring ‘83 might con­nect to exist­ing web technologies.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://www.louispotok.com/spring83">some notes and questions</a> (fronted by a very kind meme) from Louis Potok, who traces the spec’s logic into a few inter­est­ing cor­ners and edges. I feel like Louis’s post is per­fectly in the spirit of this document; it’s like, “RFC? OK! C!”</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://maya.land/responses/2022/06/12/robin-sloan-spring-83-initial-musing.html">a wide-ranging con­sid­er­a­tion</a> from Maya, who main­tains one of the great mod­ern home pages; I am a long­time admirer and reader. It’s so <span>useful — </span><wbr/>and <span>energizing! — </span><wbr/>to absorb com­ments that take the <em>feel­ings</em> of/in a sys­tem so seriously.</p>
