    <h1>Join my new Risk Musings subscriber chat</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Today I’m announcing a brand new addition to my Substack publication: the </span><em>Risk Musings</em><span> subscriber chat.</span></p><p>This is a conversation space in the Substack app that I set up for my subscribers — kind of like a group chat or live hangout. I’ll post short prompts, thoughts, and updates that come my way, and you can jump into the discussion. </p><p>Today at 1pm Eastern time, as announced in the newsletter, I’ll be on Chat to discuss two books I read recently: Human Compatible by Stuart Russell and HumanKind by Rutger Bregman. You can join now for a live chat or leave a comment later, and I’ll reply.</p><p><strong><span>To join our chat, you can either download the </span><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect" rel="">Substack app</a><span> or go to </span><a href="https://substack.com/chat" rel="">https://substack.com/chat</a><span> while logged in to the Substack website on your computer, and you’ll see a row for my Risk Musings chat.</span></strong><span> Chats are not typically sent via email, so turn on push notifications so you don’t miss conversation as it happens.</span></p><p><span>Hope to see you there! Jump in to say hi, and if you have any issues, check out </span><a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/sections/360007461791-Frequently-Asked-Questions" rel="">Substack’s FAQ</a><span>.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://open.substack.com/pub/riskmusings/chat&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Join chat&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/riskmusings/chat" rel=""><span>Join chat</span></a></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
