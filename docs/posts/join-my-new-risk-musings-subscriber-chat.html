        <p>The day before 2023 on of my favorite artists decided to drop a new track (link)! Amazing, I thought, I’ll add it to my Spotify playlist.</p>

    	<p>Unfortunately it was no where to be found, and this wasn’t the only song. Easy! I can just download the mp3 off YouTube and add it to my Spotify playlist manually. Let me just find a website.</p>

        <p>Admittedly the website was pretty nice with only a single strange ad, however it still left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Downloading random files off websites like these probably isn’t the most hygienic computing practice. After all I’ve been a full stack dev for a little bit (just graduated college!) This should be no problem let’s just see what YouTube does…</p>

        <p>Oh... that&#39;s ALOT of parameters</p></section>
