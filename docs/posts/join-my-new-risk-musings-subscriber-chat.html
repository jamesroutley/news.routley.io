	<p><small>December 30, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often someone needs to create a more or less permanent
internal identifier in their system every person&#39;s account. Some
of the time they look at how <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OIDCThreeEmailAddresses">authentication systems like OIDC
return email addresses among other data</a> and decide that since pretty
much everyone is giving them an email address, they&#39;ll use the email
address as the account&#39;s permanent internal identification.
As <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">the famous saying</a> goes,
now you have two problems.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with email addresses as &#39;permanent&#39; identifiers
is that people&#39;s email addresses change even within a single
organization (for example, <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">a university</a>).
They change for the same collection of reasons that people&#39;s
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/FullLegalNamesProblems">commonly used names</a> and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/LoginsDoChange">logins change</a>. An organization that refuses to change
or redo the email addresses it assigns to people is being unusually
cruel in ways that are probably not legally sustainable in any
number of places.</p>

<p>(Some of the time there will be some sort of access or forwarding
from the old email address to the new one, but even then the old
email address may no longer work for non-email purposes such as
OIDC authentication. And beyond that, the person won&#39;t want to keep
using their old and possibly uncomfortable email address with you,
they want to use their new current one.)</p>

<p>The lesser problem is that you have no particular guarantee that
an organization won&#39;t reuse email addresses, either in general or
for particularly desirable ones that get reused or reassigned as
an exception because someone powerful wants them. Sometimes you
sort of have no choice, because account recovery has to run through
the email address you have on file, but at other times (such as in
theory with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)">OIDC</a>), you
have some form of internal ID that is supposed to be unique and
permanent, which you should use.</p>

<p>Even if you have to remember an email address for account recovery,
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/PowerOfMeaninglessIDs">you want your internal identifier for accounts to be meaningless</a>. This will make your life much simpler in
the long run, even if this is never exposed to people.</p>

<p>(There are also security issues lurking in the underbrush of reading
too much into email addresses, <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">cf</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38720544">via</a>).)</p>
