				<p>Hi! I&#39;m a tool to teach you the most popular responses 
				to each chess opening and its variations. I&#39;ll ask you for the best move, and then I&#39;ll make any respectable move back.
				I do this by looking at what many Master (&gt;2200 Elo) chess players have played before.
				I play the most popular moves more often but still like to play rarer openings. 
				I&#39;m in active development, and I hope I can help improve your chess game!</p>
