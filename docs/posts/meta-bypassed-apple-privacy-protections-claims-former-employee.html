<p>A former <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta</a> product manager has claimed that the social network circumvented Apple’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a> protections, as well as cheating advertisers, and fired him when he repeatedly raised the issue internally.</p>



<p>Meta is said to have found ways to identify Apple users even after they refused consent for app tracking, in order to avoid an estimated <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/01/apples-app-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10 billion loss of revenue</a> …</p>







<p>Meta relied heavily on selling personalized advertising, which required it to be able to target particular demographics and interest groups. This was achieved by tracking individual users across different apps.</p>



<p>Apple’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-tracking-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Tracking Transparency</a> (ATT) was introduced in 2021 and meant that companies required user permission in order to carry out this tracking. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of users declined.</p>



<p>It was estimated at the time that this would cost social media companies many billions of dollars, and Meta’s CFO warned investors that its own loss would be around $10B per year</p>







<p>It was quickly alleged that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/22/app-tracking-transparency-workaround/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta was using workarounds</a> to continue to track users who had denied permission, alongside <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/24/facebook-privacy-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other privacy violations</a>. A class action lawsuit followed.</p>



<p>A fired product manager at the company, Samujjal Purkayastha, has now taken his case to an employment tribunal claiming he was unlawfully dismissed for raising concerns about the practice, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be6a99d2-22de-48ec-9afa-1d2e2f709afc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Times</a></em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Meta secretly linked user data with other information to track users’ activity on other websites without their permission — despite Apple in 2021 introducing measures explicitly requiring consent, according to Purkayastha’s filings […]</p>



<p>A “closed and secretive” team at Meta is alleged to have used “deterministic matching” — gathering identifiable information that could then be used to connect data across multiple platforms in violation of Apple’s new privacy policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also accuses Meta of inflating the value of sales achieved by advertising on its platforms.</p>



<p>Meta denies any wrongdoing, and claims that Purkayastha was dismissed for unrelated reasons. The tribunal was unable to rule immediately, and said a full hearing will be held later in the year.</p>
