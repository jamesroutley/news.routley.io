            <p dir="auto">Using the screenshot in the original discussion post, I&#39;d like to share a shortcoming of the current implementation of this feature. Here, 4 files were modified. The file tree shows these 4 files, but also 5 folders, since every file is in a different folder.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1285131/157993942-41f66299-ff19-4524-b256-220c74458838.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1285131/157993942-41f66299-ff19-4524-b256-220c74458838.png" alt="156570120-574a6f58-75fa-4cf8-af1a-12fb78cc021b"/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This isn&#39;t too bad for small PRs, but on big PRs that might touch, say 100 files, we&#39;re talking about potentially showing 100+ folders too, which adds a lot of noise to the view if the developer doesn&#39;t care about folder structure (or the folder structure is very complex).</p>
<p dir="auto">I&#39;d love an index like this on large PRs to help me navigate without needing to <code>Cmd+F</code> or scroll too much. Code-mods are examples of large PRs where this would be useful to me, but they are also example of PRs where this tree gets very noisy, since they often touch a bunch of different files in a bunch of different folders. I don&#39;t really care much about the folder these files are in when I&#39;m code-modding.</p>
<p dir="auto">A toggleable and persistent &#34;List View&#34; option would be very helpful here. It would show all files and be filterable just like this tree view, but display them in a flat list, and so skip on also displaying all the folders, indenting the entries, etc.</p>
