    <h1>The Case for Higher Rates</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>What is the role of the Federal Reserve? </p><p>At its core, the role of the Fed is to promote economic stability. Indeed the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment suggests as much. The Fed has abdicated this duty, with great cost. </p><p>The primary way the Fed seeks to influence the economy is through interest rates, the cost of money. When money is cheaper, people have a higher propensity to borrow, expanding money supply, increasing economic growth and improving employment. When money is more expensive, the opposite occurs. Or so the thinking goes.</p><p>This is the knob that the Fed turns. In order to spur economic growth, it lowers interest rates, and to cool the economy down, it increases rates. Under this framework, the Fed uses its judgement to tilt the economy hotter or cooler with its rate policy. </p><p>However, there are two problems. First, the impacts of interest rate policy are far more complex than this simple framework suggests, particularly when near the lower bound of zero percent. Second, the Fed’s judgement about what the economy truly needs may be misguided. </p><p>For the past forty years since Fed President Paul Volker broke inflation in the early 1980s, the Fed has made money ever cheaper in order to stimulate economic growth. After exhausting its traditional tools at the zero percent lower-bound, the Fed has moved on to new, exotic methods of lowering nominal rates, such as Quantitative Easing. </p><p>In doing so, the Fed has cast aside its core mandate as an economic referee ensuring stability, in favor of being a cheerleader and driver of economic growth. While this may not be immediately problematic, the Fed’s most essential role is to stabilize - which means counterbalancing the animal spirits of the private economy or signs of excessive money growth and inflation before they take hold. But the Fed has made it clear it no longer seeks to play referee. Its policy is all gas, no breaks. </p><p>The result is a bloated and debt-ridden economy, massive wealth inequality, unstable financial markets hopelessly addicted to the Fed’s largesse, and now, the true Achilles heel of low rates - inflation like we haven’t seen since the days of Volker. </p><p>To analyze the true impact of Fed policy, we will consider the topics below in detail:</p><ul><li><p>Diminishing Returns of Low Rates</p></li><li><p>Debt, Wealth &amp; Inequality</p></li><li><p>Financial Stability</p></li><li><p>Inflation</p></li></ul><p>What we desperately need today is higher rates, not merely as a temporary measure or to restore a sense of near term credibility, but higher for longer, in order to promote long-term economic vibrancy. In the near term, this will cause economic pain and wealth destruction. But the pain is merely the hangover - a necessary step on the road to sobriety - and the wealth that may be destroyed was not the product of meritorious productivity, but manufactured by the Fed in the first place. In the long run, this will lead to a more prosperous, productive and equally distributed economy. I hope the Fed has the courage and wisdom to do so. </p><h2>Diminishing Returns of Low Rates</h2><p>In the introduction, I suggest that lowering the cost of debt boosts the economy because it makes it easier for people to borrow money to do economic activities. In other words, <em><strong>it encourages productive investment.</strong></em> This theory is at the heart of the lower interest rate policy, and is directionally true. However, as rates fall, the incremental benefit diminishes, and at some point reverses. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png" width="1456" height="306" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:306,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:243405,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10726b0-e12e-45db-87b3-8fbfff6224ed_1906x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a></figure></div><p>Let’s say you invent a Box that can literally mint money. This box can produce one real US coin per year, and it will cost you exactly $1.00 to build. The only problem is that you don’t have any money to build the box. Should you borrow a dollar to build it? </p><p>Well, you need some more information - which box is it, and at what rate can you borrow. </p><p>If this is a Nickel Box that produces one nickel a year, and the interest rate is 6%, then your interest cost of 6 cents exceeds the 5 cents the box produces, and you lose money. But, if interest rates were to suddenly drop from 6% to 4% it would change your opinion - it is now profitable to borrow and build the Nickel Box. </p><p>If you were building a Dime Box, you would borrow at either 4% or 6% to build it since the box produces more than either interest expense. Under neither circumstance would you build a Penny Box.  </p><p>This elementary school example is meant to make an important financial point that you may gloss over if you read on its own: <em><strong>for debt to be accretive, the asset you are financing must have a higher return than the cost of debt</strong></em><strong>.</strong> In this sense, the interest rate sets the bar for a minimum productivity of new assets that can be financed. </p><p>When the Fed lowers interest rates from 15%  to 5%, it “unlocks” assets that return between 5% - 15% to be debt-financed. This likely leads to healthy, productive investment and economic growth. But as rates continue lower and lower, the Fed can only unlock less and less productive assets. This is the diminishing economic returns of lower rates. At some point, the only things left to unlock are the worst assets - Penny Boxes.</p><p>A CFO of a fast growing and profitable manufacturing company is going to build a new factory with a 10-year payback whether rates are at 0% or 5%, because the economics of his endeavor justify it. Penny Boxes have a payback period of 100 years.</p><p>When your growth is reliant on unlocking Penny Boxes, you have reached the end of the benefit of low rates for economic growth, and likely have already become counterproductive, as assets almost always produce less than you expect when you build them. This results in misallocation of capital, an increase in money supply and debt load, without a corresponding level of productivity to show for it, ultimately zombifying the economy.  </p><p>But of course productive investment is not the only way debt is created…</p><h2>Debt, Wealth &amp; Inequality</h2><p>Rather than funding new productive investment, debt can also be obtained against an asset that already exists, particularly if there is a reliable price marker and a reasonably liquid market. </p><p>Examples of assets that can be borrowed against are homes and stocks. Such collateralized borrowing could either be provided to a new buyer in order to finance the acquisition of an existing asset (i.e. a new mortgage to buy an existing house, or new margin debt to buy a stock), or by the existing owner of an asset to cheaply and tax efficiently monetize an asset they already hold (i.e. a home equity loan, or a $12.5 billion margin loan to buy Twitter).  </p><p>This kind of borrowing does not create anything new, it merely provides cash to sellers of assets, financed by debt accumulated by the buyers, thereby <em><strong>benefitting</strong></em> <em><strong>those who already own assets</strong></em>. Even if an asset owner isn’t a seller, he or she will still see the value of the equities or house increase as cheap debt allows new buyers to bid up the broader market.</p><p>But this is only the beginning. New debt need not be created to benefit existing asset holders. When interest rates decline, the value of financial assets increase mathematically. </p><p>Fixed rate debt such as US Treasuries and corporate bonds are priced relative to the prevailing floating rate of debt in the market at any time. This means, if you buy a 10-year US Treasury when rates are at 5%, and then rates fall, the value of the bond you bought increases. </p><p>To see this in practice, consider the TLT ETF, a fund of long-term US Treasuries.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png" width="1456" height="867" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:867,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:57454,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54b246b4-8075-46a8-a73b-802717c0770e_1662x990.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a><figcaption>Source: Trading View</figcaption></figure></div><p>The price of TLT was $120 at the peak of the Fed’s hiking cycle in late 2018. By April 2020, in the earliest days of a pandemic that halted global economic activity, the price of those exact same securities had increased to $170 - a 42% increase in just over a year. This increase was driven almost entirely by the decision of the Fed to cut rates to zero and embark on unlimited QE<a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="">1</a>.

Market Premium reliably fluctuates between a relatively tight band of 0.0% - 4.0%<a id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" rel="">3</a>. While this provides credence to the notion that lower rates are largely a policy decision of the Fed rather than driven by market forces, there is another important point to draw. </p><p>Since the Policy Rate has declined by over 10% in the past 40 years, and the Market Premium has not expanded or contracted outside of its cyclical range, the Fed has gradually ceded control over nominal rates to the market. In the extreme, <em><strong>when policy rates are at zero, the nominal rate entirely is determined by the market. </strong></em>It is precisely because the Fed emptied the chamber on its Policy Rate, that it was forced into its extreme tool of QE in order to regain its influence on long-term nominal rates. </p><p>The trouble is that the market is fickle and unpredictable. While this piece argues for the need for higher interest rates in general, the Fed ultimately needs to be a counterbalance to the market, which means lowering Policy Rate in moments of market stress to counterbalance rate increases and maintain relatively steady nominal rates. </p><p>Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in 30-year mortgage rates, which have increased by 2.40% since September 2021 - the Fed’s Policy Rate only increased by 0.25% in this period, meaning market rates drove the fast majority of the move. By comparison, the most mortgage rates rose in the same time frame during the popping of the 2000’s housing bubble was just 0.87%. </p><p>Making matters worse, is duration. While changes in interest rates have a near-linear impact on the price of short-duration assets, longer duration assets have significant convexity. </p><p>The present value of $100, 30 years from now at an interest rate of 10% is ~$5. At a 5% rate, that present value increases to $23. At a 1% interest rate, the present value is $74. </p><p>As nominal rates go lower and lower, the movement in present value (i.e. bond prices) is much greater. <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1506599098530635781?s=20&amp;t=BakTrrqSM-ExMqDEV-ZK0A" rel="">The result is headlines like this</a>. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png" width="847" height="198" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:198,&#34;width&#34;:847,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:24940,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a224efa-2613-4ee0-b117-31725e317c79_847x198.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></a><figcaption>Source Bloomberg, as of 3/23/22.</figcaption></figure></div><p>By pushing interest rates to the minimum, the Fed pushes financial asset prices to their maximum. The resulting unwind means massive and potentially disorderly value destruction. Particularly when this occurs in fixed income or treasury markets, which are the bedrock of financial markets, the global financial market becomes deeply unstable - the opposite of the the Fed’s mandate. </p><h2>Inflation</h2><p>To date, the Fed seems unperturbed by the points above. Rather, their answer to “how low can we go” is to observe measures of consumer price inflation as the sole indication of overly loose policy. In other words, the Fed feels it can continue to juice financial assets and exacerbate wealth inequality so long as the average person doesn’t notice price increases - true trickle-down economics.</p><p>The fact that headline inflation remained subdued for the past decade despite the advent of QE has given the Fed and its cheerleaders enough evidence that their policies are not somehow inflationary. </p><p>While headline inflation remained in check for much of the past 40 years of declining rates, there are many non-monetary factors that impact consumer prices - and further, there is a lag between monetary policy decisions and their feedthrough to consumer prices. </p><p>Until recently, commodity prices - energy being the most important - remained well below overall consumer price trends. For much of the past decade, both oil and natural gas prices were a fraction of their price in the prior decade - a powerful deflationary force.</p><p>Even though this inflation test is inadequate by itself, it has been screaming trouble for over a year. Rather than abide by these tell-tale warning signs, the Fed instead abandoned its strict inflation target for an “average inflation” paradigm - tacitly acknowledging that inflation would exceed its 2% average target, and relying on the wishful thought that it would prove transitory. Now, real disposable personal income per capita has fallen in 10 out of the last 12 months.</p><p>Make no mistake - inflation is a regressive tax. The impact is far greater on those who spend nearly all their income on necessities, rather than the financial class, and pro-stimulus economists, who write off the phenomenon as tolerable. To the financial class and pro-stimulus economists, it is indeed tolerable because they occupy the high income segment of society. For those who have been left behind by the low-rate, money printing Fed, it is not. </p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>The reason why I write so frequently about monetary policy is because it is so important. We have witnessed a failure of leadership by the most economically influential institution in the world - the Federal Reserve. </p><p>The folly of the Fed should have been acknowledged long before it got to such extremes. But that is not where we are. </p><p>The benefits of low rates has run dry. For a more productive, vibrant and equal society, we need higher rates, now. </p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
