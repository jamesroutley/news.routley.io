It started in 2021 and runs for a week each year with some theme. It is a chance for folx to try new ways of approaching computing and to work with old/limited hardware and technology. There’s an IRC channel people hang out in and share ideas as well as a list of websites that people are logging their experiments and experience on too.</p><p>Suffice to say, it really resonated with me! Turns out that it started this week (July 13 - 19), so I’m just in time. :) For this week, I have some ideas that I’ll aim to do to participate and will blog about it under the <a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/tags/occ2025">occ2025 tag</a> as I go:</p><ul><li>Experiment with non-graphical enviroments for linux ( TTY only maybe??? :O )</li><li>Try using <code>qutebrowser</code> instead of firefox (mouseless!)</li><li>Look into TUI/terminal replacements for some of the last GUI programs I use still</li><li>Look into trying out <a href="https://chimera-linux.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chimera Linux</a> which has a unique, cool approach that uses Musl C + FreeBSD tools for userland! &lt;3</li></ul><p>⁂</p><p>This should be fun! :) I’m looking forward to the excuse to play around with my computer and setup a bit this week and to see what others get up to as well. Cheers!</p></div></div>
