<p>Canonical recently <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061">announced</a>
that it will no longer ship <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> as
part of its default installation for the various <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop/flavours">official Ubuntu flavors</a>,
which is in keeping with the practices of the core Ubuntu distribution. The
Flatpak package format has gained popularity among Linux users
for its 
convenience and ease of use. Canonical will focus exclusively on its own
package-management system, <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap</a>. The
decision has caused <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061/8">disgruntlement</a>
among some community members, who felt like the distribution was making
this decision 
without regard for its users. 
</p>

<p>The announcement was made on the Ubuntu Discourse Forum, where Philipp
Kewisch, a Community Engineering Manager at Canonical, said: 
</p>

<blockquote>
As part of our combined efforts, the Ubuntu flavors have made a joint
decision to adjust some of the default packages on Ubuntu: Going forward,
the Flatpak package as well as the packages to integrate Flatpak into the
respective software center will no longer be installed by default in the
next release due in April 2023, Lunar Lobster. Users who have used Flatpak
will not be affected on upgrade, as flavors are including a special
migration that takes this into account. Those who haven&#39;t interacted with
Flatpak will be presented with software from the Ubuntu repositories and
the Snap Store. 
</blockquote>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p>In the announcement, Kewisch said the decision came from a desire to,
&#34;<q>improve the out-of-the-box Ubuntu experience for new users while
respecting how existing users personalize their own experiences</q>.&#34;
Ubuntu
is prioritizing deb and Snap, its default packaging
technologies, while no longer providing a competitor by default. This is
described as an effort to provide consistency and 
simplicity for 
users.  
</p>

<p>By focusing on these technologies, Ubuntu claims it can provide better
community 
support to resolve issues in the software packages. While Canonical
does not have full control over every Snap package published in the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/store">Snap
Store</a>, it does have some control over the format
itself. That makes it easier for Canonical to diagnose and fix problems that
arise in the packaging or distribution. Furthermore,
because Canonical curates the official Snap Store, it has a degree of
control over the quality of the packages that are included. It
can work with developers to ensure that packages meet certain
standards and do not contain obvious bugs or security vulnerabilities. 
</p>

<p>In comparison, Flatpak is developed and maintained by a community of
contributors, rather than being tied to any company or organization. This
can make it more difficult to coordinate bug fixes or updates, Canonical
claims, since there
may not be a single entity responsible for the technology. In the
announcement, Kewisch mentioned fragmentation issues as a problem area: 
</p>

<blockquote>
In an ideal world, users experience a single way to install
software. When they do so, they can expect that this mechanism is supported
by the community and receives the majority of attention when it comes to
resolving issues in software packages. When a new packaging technology is
provided by default, there is an expectation that the distribution provides
community support and is invested in contributing to development to resolve
issues. This creates fragmentation instead of focusing on improving the
technologies chosen for the distribution. 
</blockquote>

<p>There is a key difference between having the base
Flatpak package installed by default and having a Flatpak repository, such
as <a href="https://flathub.org/home">Flathub</a> (or something
Ubuntu-specific),  
configured, which Ubuntu and its flavors never did. Merely removing the base
Flatpak installation from the default install won&#39;t prevent users from
having problems with Flatpak applications if they go ahead and install them
anyway.  Nor will it make those problems any easier to
solve. 
</p>

<p>
This adds fuel to the fire that Canonical is doing this largely to
further its own interests. 
Since it controls the Snap Store, the company will be in a position to
share in the revenue from any proprietary Snaps available there, for example.
But even if Canonical has some self-serving reasons
for making this change, it&#39;s important to remember that it hasn&#39;t
removed Flatpak entirely; users will still be able to install
the package-management system manually. 
</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>

<p>The move generated mixed reactions in the Linux community, with some users
and developers expressing disappointment in the decision. Others argued
in favor of Canonical&#39;s choice, agreeing with its reasoning about the
unnecessary 
burden Flatpak places on support staff.  Forum user Aaron Rainbolt
(&#34;arraybolt3&#34;) <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061/9">said</a>
that Ubuntu tries to change its package versions rarely and only update
them for important
bug fixes, which is not at all the case with Flatpaks so users may experience
instability when using them, for example. In a reply,  &#34;h0lly&#34;
<a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061/24">saw
things differently</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
People who opt to using flatpaks do so precisely because they do want
the most recent (stable) releases, which I suspect is a lot of users
evidenced by the raise of flatpak popularity. 

<p>furthermore, thanks to the sandboxing flatpak apps generally work great
out of the box. the picture you paint of users having a bad experience with
unstable flatpaks is mostly made up. and even then, flatpak not being
selected as the default source in the app store is already plenty to
&#34;guard&#34; inexperienced users. if it was really about that, it could just
display a little notice warning the user when selecting a flatpak source
for the first time. 

</p><p>imho there is no need for Canonical to control anything here. there is
absolutely nothing technical stopping its support staff from being able to
say, &#34;sorry you&#39;ll have to seek support from that flatpak&#39;s maintainer, we
can&#39;t help you&#34; and having [it] as an integrated option at the same
time. although I don&#39;t think this would happen anywhere as frequently as
you make it out to. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Rainbolt further defended the change, <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061/25">noting</a>,
that while Flatpak may be more convenient, Snap packages will provide
greater long-term compatibility and lessen the burden placed on technical
support staff. &#34;<q>An app doesn&#39;t have to have anything wrong with it for it
to cause problems for technical supporters. It just has to have something
different from what the supporters are used to.</q>&#34; 
</p>

<p>Another potential concern may be that Canonical
could be using this decision to force
package upstreams to offer a Snap version or face not being easily
available in the
default Ubuntu installation. 
</p>

<p>Ubuntu clearly wanted to present this decision as a united front with
its flavors, but some have called that into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/118w9mc/comment/j9kjc1h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">question</a>.
As recently as December 2022, Sean Davis, Technical Lead for the Xubuntu flavor,
was seen promoting Flatpak. While a lot can change in a few
months, it does seem strange that Davis <a href="https://blog.bluesabre.org/2022/12/03/xubuntu-development-update-december-2022/">commented</a>
on its benefits fairly recently: 
</p>

<blockquote>
With the addition of the <tt>flatpak</tt> and
<tt>gnome-software-plugin-flatpak</tt> 
packages, Xubuntu now supports the popular Flatpak packaging format. You
can now easily install applications from Flathub with just a couple of
clicks. In fact, any <tt>.flatpakref</tt> or <tt>.flatpakrepo</tt> file is
natively supported 
thanks to GNOME Software. 
</blockquote>

<p>The motives behind Canonical&#39;s move remain somewhat murky, but Flatpak
users can be comforted by the fact that enabling the 
package-management system is still possible, though it&#39;s now
something of a chore to do so. 
</p>

<h4>Using Flatpak</h4>

<p>For starters, it means that users will first need to manually install
Flatpak and a repository, like Flathub, before they can begin to install
Flatpak applications using the Ubuntu Software Center.  Flatpak is a part
of the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories#Universe">universe
repository</a>, which means 
it is included in the community-maintained repository of Ubuntu packages that
are not officially supported by Canonical. Due to this, Flatpak can be
installed via the Ubuntu Software Center or the GNOME Software GUI. 
</p>

<p>Once Flatpak is installed, it can be connected to a Flatpak
repository, such as Flathub. 
To configure Flathub, the following command can be used:
</p>

<pre>    $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
            https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
</pre>

<p>In the announcement, Kewisch addressed some common
concerns that users may have regarding the decision. For example, users
would not lose 
access to
applications that depend on the Flatpak ecosystem: 
</p>

<blockquote>
We&#39;ve added a special migration that checks if you have Flatpak packages
installed or remotes configured. If so, flatpak and related software centre
plugins won&#39;t be auto-removed on an upgrade to Lunar Lobster. Therefore,
you don&#39;t need to be concerned about this change. 
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, Flatpak users do not have to worry about the
package-management system being removed on current and older versions of
Ubuntu 
either: 
</p>

<blockquote>
No, flavors are not actively removing package managers from the current
or older releases. This change is for the upgrade to Lunar Lobster and
beyond, where it is available but will not be installed by default in new
installations. 
</blockquote>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Ubuntu&#39;s decision to stop shipping Flatpak by default is 
significant, but it is not the end of the road for the package-management
system on Ubuntu. As the Linux ecosystem continues to evolve, 
it&#39;s likely that we will see other new technologies and approaches emerge
to meet 
the needs of users and developers. For now, Ubuntu users who want to use
Flatpak will need to adjust to the new way of doing things, but they will
still have access to a same wide range of Flatpak apps.
