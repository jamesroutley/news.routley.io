    <h1>etu: my current cli journal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A classic thing for me to build when I am bored is note taking, time tracking or wiki software. I often create some mixture of the three. If I&#39;m not doing that I am cleaning up this site or <a href="https://natwelch.com">my personal website</a>.</p>
<p>The last few years those projects have landed in the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/icco/etu">icco/etu</a>. The current iteration of Etu is a command line journal that uses a <a href="https://www.notion.com/help/intro-to-databases">Notion database</a> as its backend.</p>
<p>I bet you&#39;re wondering why the heck I would build something like this. Time Tracking is a classic nerd snipe. Check out <a href="https://github.com/merveilles/Time-Travelers">merveilles/Time-Travelers</a> or <a href="http://feltron.com/index.html">Feltron Annual Reports</a> for others lost in this rabbit hole.</p>
<p>In reality <code>etu</code> has been a long project. The first commit was in <a href="https://github.com/icco/etu/commit/f5d000ba296f0cd4aeff2e446812cdaaf03edf67">2019</a>, and randomly an idea catches my brain and I code it up.</p>
<p>Its current evolution is Go project that uses <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea">Bubble Tea</a> for a simple to use CLI. In past iterations I just launched <code>vim</code> and captured the output buffer, but I found the UX to be faster if I just launched the UI myself. The downside of my design is the <a href="https://github.com/jomei/notionapi">Notion API</a> is incredibly slow.</p>

<p>I did this work as a part of<!-- --> <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/decemberadventure">#decemberadventure</a>, and a general want to fix complaints I had with the tool. The biggest complaints I had was after I made a post, viewing them was best done by going to Notion. I disliked that. So I rewrote the entire UX to use more off the shelf components, and added new list, view and delete abilities.</p>
<p>I also created <a href="https://github.com/icco/homebrew-tap">a homebrew tap</a> to make installing on multiple machines easily.</p>
<p>Anyways, just wanted to write this up. Hope you&#39;re having a happy holidays.</p>
