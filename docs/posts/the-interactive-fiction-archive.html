light. In the center of the room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a 
side. Engraved on the side of the cube is some lettering.”

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Archive’s mission is to preserve the history and practice of
interactive fiction and make it freely available to the public. Since
1992, the Archive has collected thousands of text adventures, text
adventure development tools, articles, essays, hint files, walkthroughs,
jokes, and sly references to Greek politics. It also preserves the
history of IF institutions such as the 
<a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IF Competition</a> 
and 
<a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>. 
This cultural memory is one of the foundations of the IF community.

Mirrors of the Archive, including ftp and gopher access points, are
<a href="https://www.ifarchive.org/misc/mirrors.html">listed here</a>. (We do not guarantee
these mirrors are up to date, however.)

of its contents is largely the work of David Kinder, Doug Orleans,
and Andrew Plotkin.
