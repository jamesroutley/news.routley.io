    <h1>Stop selling “unlimited”, when you mean “until we change our minds”</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><article><div><div><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong><span> Anthropic just added weekly limits to Claude Pro ($20/month) and Claude Max ($200/month), affecting their heaviest users of Claude Code…mid-workflow.</span></p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><span> This is the same playbook we’ve seen AI companies </span><a href="https://blog.kilocode.ai/p/cursors-500-requests-unlimited-225" rel="">use before</a><span>—hook users with &#34;unlimited&#34; access, then cap the power users who matter most.</span></p><p><span>Here&#39;s how the </span><a href="https://blog.kilocode.ai/p/the-ai-pricing-bait-and-switch" rel="">AI pricing bait-and-switch</a><span> works:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Launch with </span><strong>generous/unlimited limits</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Build user</span><strong> dependency</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Add </span><strong>caps</strong><span> targeting &#34;less than 5%&#34; of users</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Frame as &#34;sustainability&#34; or &#34;fairness&#34;</strong></p></li></ol><p><span>Sound familiar? That&#39;s because we&#39;ve </span><a href="https://blog.kilocode.ai/p/the-ai-pricing-bait-and-switch" rel="">seen this movie before</a><span>. Cursor </span><a href="https://apidog.com/blog/cursor-rate-limit/" rel="">did it</a><span>. Windsurf </span><a href="https://windsurf.com/blog/pricing-v2" rel="">followed</a><span>. GitHub Copilot </span><a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-07-enforcement-of-copilot-premium-request-limits-coming-soon/" rel="">tightened screws</a><span>. Now </span><a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1949898502688903593" rel="">Claude Code</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The thing is, Anthropic isn&#39;t wrong about the economics. Running Claude Sonnet or Opus models costs real money—we&#39;re talking about serious compute infrastructure here. But that&#39;s </span><em><strong>precisely</strong></em><span> why the bait-and-switch approach is so damaging to the developer community.</span></p><p>Who actually gets hit by these limits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Power users</strong><span> with deep workflow integration</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Early adopters</strong><span> who took platform risks</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Team influencers</strong><span> who drive organizational adoption</span></p></li><li><p><strong>$200/month Claude Max subscribers</strong><span> doing serious work</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>The real damage:</strong><span> You&#39;re not frustrating 5% of users—you&#39;re breaking trust with the exact people who drive growth and adoption.</span></p><p>Every bait-and-switch makes developers hedge bets instead of fully committing. Or maybe, at “best” they delay AI adoption, waiting for &#34;stable&#34; pricing. Or perhaps worst of all…self-limit usage to avoid hitting caps.</p><p><span>And on HackerNews, </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44714494" rel="">wowfunhappy observed</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>I&#39;m probably not going to hit the weekly limit, but it makes me nervous that the limit is weekly as opposed to every 36 hours or something. If I do hit the limit, that&#39;s it for the entire week—a long time to be without a tool I&#39;ve grown accustomed to!</p></blockquote><p><strong>When developers get &#34;rate limit exceeded&#34; while debugging at 2 AM, they&#39;re not thinking about your infrastructure costs—they&#39;re shopping for alternatives.</strong></p><p>We all know AI inference costs money. Developers get resource constraints…we have them ourselves!</p><p><strong>What we don&#39;t get:</strong><span> Being sold &#34;unlimited&#34; and then discovering asterisks after we&#39;ve built workflows around your tool.</span></p><p><strong>What we want:</strong><span> Transparent costs upfront so we can make informed decisions.</span></p><p><span>As </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44716182" rel="">landl0rd on HN</a><span> pointed out:</span></p><blockquote><p>You can tell how it&#39;s intentional with both OpenAI and Anthropic by how they&#39;re intentionally made opaque. I cant see a nice little bar with how much I&#39;ve used versus have left on the given rate limits</p></blockquote><p>At Kilo Code, we skipped the charade:</p><ul><li><p><strong>No &#34;unlimited&#34; promises</strong><span> with hidden limits</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Transparent pay-per-use</strong><span> from day one</span></p></li><li><p><strong>You control spending</strong><span> and usage</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Credits never expire</strong><span> (bonus credits do)</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>This week only:</strong><span> </span><a href="https://multiplier.kilocode.ai/" rel="">300% bonus credits on every deposit</a><span>. Add $20, get $80 total.</span></p><p><strong>Translation:</strong><span> While Claude limits $200/month users, you get $200 of AI coding help for $50. The only limit? You have to use your bonus credits within 30 days. Keep what you pay for forever.</span></p><p>It&#39;s not rocket science. It’s our way of attracting users. Not bait and switch, but credits to try.</p><p>I firmly believe that AI will not replace developers, but a developer using AI will replace a developer who does not.</p><p>But having said that, the AI space needs to grow up. Users are getting smarter about pricing games.</p><p><strong>For companies:</strong><span> Be honest about costs, let users control limits, and make pricing </span><strong>predictable</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>For developers:</strong><span> Stop accepting bait-and-switch as “normal.” There are transparent alternatives.</span></p><p><em><span>Ready for honest AI pricing?</span><a href="https://multiplier.kilocode.ai/" rel=""> Try Kilo Code</a><span> and get 300% bonus credits this week.</span></em></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div><div><div id="discussion"><div><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div></div></div>
