    <h1>Australian Open resorts to animated caricatures to bypass broadcast restrictions</h1>

<p>The first Grand Slam of the year is well and truly underway, with the Australian Open at Melbourne Park beginning earlier this week. As one of the biggest events on the Australian and international sporting calendar, it’s available in Australia to watch on free-to-air television through Channel 9, as well as through its associated streaming services and in 4K on its subscription streaming service, Stan Sport. </p>



<p>However, that ease of access to tennis’ first major of the year is not necessarily replicated worldwide. To watch the Australian Open in Europe, you need access to pay TV channel Eurosport, while the cable channel ESPN broadcasts it in North America. </p>





<p>Sports fans may have noticed another broadcast option: an animated caricature version. Broadcast on YouTube, the Australian Open’s own channel has streamed select matches using cartoonish avatars of players instead of the actual broadcast.</p>



<p>The novelty broadcast avoids issues with contractual rights overseas by being both delayed and caricaturing the action. Tennis Australia did not respond to <em>Crikey’s</em> questions asking whether it had consulted with broadcast partners ahead of time, or whether it anticipated its “<a href="https://ausopen.com/articles/news/australian-open-2025-redefining-experience-global-fans">fresh, gamified approach to tennis coverage</a>” impacting sports rights in the future, one of the few remaining consistent sources of revenue in an increasingly precarious media landscape. </p>



<p>Nine, the domestic rights holders of the Australian Open, declined to comment. </p>

<p>The technology debuted for the 2024 Australian Open, but <em>Guardian Australia</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/14/australian-open-avatars-helping-tennis-reach-new-audience">reports</a> that this year has seen a marked increase in interest and viewership. </p>



<p>Tennis Australia’s director of innovation Machar Reid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/14/australian-open-avatars-helping-tennis-reach-new-audience">said</a> the technology used 12 cameras tracking 29 skeletal points that are stitched together to create the reproduction on a two-minute delay. </p>

<p>The animated feed includes the same commentary and environmental sounds heard on court, all synced with the cartoon images. </p>



<p>Tennis Australia has funded several startups through its venture capital fund as it looks to push into the technology space, including a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/14/almost-10000-images-of-tennis-balls-plunge-up-to-90-in-value-as-australian-open-appears-to-ditch-nfts">failed flirtation</a> with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that concluded last year. </p>



<p>The fund, AO Ventures, is worth US$30 million (A$41.8 million) and <a href="https://ausopen.com/articles/news/ao-ventures-completes-first-close-us30-million-vc-fund">includes</a> support from Tesla chair Robyn Denholm’s Wollemi Capital Group (which also has <a href="https://wnbl.basketball/sydneyflames/news/hoops-capital-and-wollemi-capital-group-announce-investment-in-future-of-basketball/">investments</a> in the NBL and the Sydney Kings), as well as Art Gallery of NSW chair Mark Nelson and Packer <a href="https://www.afr.com/rear-window/ashok-jacob-s-son-gets-the-ellerston-capital-tick-of-approval-20240421-p5flfc">confidante</a> Ashok Jacob.</p>
