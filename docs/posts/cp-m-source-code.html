<p><SPAN color="red">NEW 02/07/2020 </SPAN>
<a href="http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/basic-e.zip">BASIC-E</a> : 90K
Developed by Gordon Eubanks for his master&#39;s thesis, it was based on a BASIC compiler originally written by Gary Kildall. It&#39;s the predecessor of CBASIC.
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/plm80s.zip">PLM compiler source</a> : 90K Here is the
source to the Intel PLM compiler. It is written in Fortran (66), and is supposed
to be pretty clean.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/plm2c.zip">PLM to C translator</a> : 406K Here is the
source for a PLM to C translator. I believe it is written in C, and was targeted
for unix type systems. It may be able to compile with Turbo C, but will need
some work. There is a lot of text in with the source code that is not surrounded
with &#34;/* */&#34; C comment delimiters. If someone gets it to compile,
please send it back to me so I can post the fixed version. This package is GNU,
so enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/newplm.zip">PLM to C translator</a> : 56K This archive
conitains the above PLM2C translator, cleaned up, and buildable on a unix

which is frontend parser for gcc.</p>

<p><SPAN color="red">NEW 08/17/2002 </SPAN>
<a href="http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/vaxplm.zip">PL/M VAX compiler</a> : 210K 
This archive contains the sources for a PL/M-VAX compiler and
the command files necessary to build the compiler from scratch.
</p><blockquote>
There is indeed one PL/M file, control.plm, that is a part of the compiler.
However, there is also a file, control.tmp, that looks like control.plm
translated to VAX assembly, possibly by the compiler itself. My guess is
therefore that as long as there is a decent FORTRAN compiler and an
assembler on the VAX, the PL/M compiler should build.
