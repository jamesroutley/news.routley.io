        Not all projects are winners! Here is a write-up of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/hannahilea/BongoBoard">BongoBoard</a>, a project I’ve lost interest in completing: while the hardware part is
        done, the user experience leaves much to be desired. And it’s going to stay that way, unless someone else takes it over from me!<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>

      <h2 id="what-is-the-bongoboard">What is the BongoBoard?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The BongoBoard is a set of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/DK_Bongos">DK Bongos</a>, disassembled and reassembled into a wireless Bluetooth keyboard.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                DK Bongos are a video game controller built by Nintendo for the Donkey Konga rhythm games—games where you drum your way through a jungle.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>The DK Bongos controller has four buttons—two in each drumhead—which are triggered when the drumhead is drummed; it also has a microphone, used to detect claps.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                In the BongoBoard’s current state, each drumhead button corresponds to a directional arrow key. My initial plan was to combine button combinations into more sophisticated keystroke outputs in the software; I ran out of
                interest before I implemented that.
              </p>

      <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Because the idea tickled my fancy: I find the concept of “drumming” input into a computer hilarious.</li>
        <li>
          Because I could. Thanks to having recently built a <a href="https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/slide-whistle-trombone-champ-controller/">slidewhistle-based Trombone Champ controller</a>, I knew that the physical construction was something I could now do
          relatively easily, and I wanted to practice those skills.
        </li>
        <li>Why not?!</li>

      <h2 id="who">Who?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Me.</li>
        <li>AF, who one midnight told me about a drum-inspired video game controller for a drumming-based video game.</li>
        <li>A stranger on eBay who wouldn’t cancel an order made at midnight.</li>
        <li>A friend with the elbow grease and determination to unscrew a bunch of proprietary screws without a proprietary screwdriver, who also offered advice towards attempting to salvage the onboard microphone.</li>
        <li>Some friends who helped brainstorm fun use cases.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Basic use-cases that can be done with the current “sends arrow key keystrokes” configuration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drum <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://play2048.co/">2048</a> (h/t OBR)</li>
      </ul>

        </iframe>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Play Tetris? Drum Tetris! <em>Challenge mode: play along with the theme song. Even more challenging mode: don’t play along with the theme song.</em></li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        Even though these games <em>can</em> be played with the current BongoBoard, the drum-to-key mappings don’t really feel smooth or fun. A really solid implementation of a Tetris mode, for example, might use double-hand hits or claps
        to make a block fall fast.

      <p><strong>Ideas for future BongoBoard applications:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Type messages? Drum messages!
            <em>Use ever-popular Morse code, or use the BongoBoard-specific B4, the latest in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)">T9-inspired</a> predictive text

      <h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>BongoBoard was more fun to imagine than it was to see through to a satisfying-to-use result.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the future, I may try to separate the “what would I do if I was going to do it?” stage from the “…and do I actually want to have done it?” stage more often.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it was pretty cool to say to myself “I want to build this thing” and then…be able to build it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            BongoBoard got me a lot of conversational mileage, which was a plus. One of my favorite parts of building silly things is getting to talk about building silly things with other people, who have lovely silly ideas of their own.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            One thing that I don’t love about this project is that the plastic body of the physical controller doesn’t feel particularly appealing, so I don’t really want the resultant BongoBoard sitting around as an
            <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_d%27art">objet d’art</a>. If it was a little nicer (wood? metal? etc) or was slightly smaller, or both, I would be more inclined to keep it
            around and spend a couple hours tuning at least one use-case to feel fun. (That said, the drum-button triggers are really nicely designed, and feel solid and nice to use. It’s really just the look of the drum body that isn’t my
            favorite.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I kind of want this thing out of my home? I have limited space, and it does not bring me joy. If you want to take it from its current state and turn it into something truly delightful, drop me a line and we can figure out a
        transfer.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> If I know you irl I’ll even throw in complimentary consultation, if you want it.
