<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-citizen/" target="_blank">Star Citizen</a> has been in development for well over a decade now, during which time it has raised <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" target="_blank" data-url="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">more than $450 million</a> in crowdfunding, and if you&#39;re wondering why it&#39;s still in an alpha state after all that time and money, the latest <a href="https://mailchi.mp/cloudimperiumgames/squadron-42-update-146756" target="_blank" data-url="https://mailchi.mp/cloudimperiumgames/squadron-42-update-146756">update</a> from developer Cloud Imperium Games might hold a clue.</p><p>It all comes down to something called &#34;bedsheet deformation,&#34; which is exactly what it sounds like: Ensuring that blankets on beds are mussed up accurately, just like they would be in real life. This is important because the &#34;sleep and bed relaxation&#34; element of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-citizen-squadron-42-release-date-trailer/" target="_blank">Squadron 42</a>, the singleplayer portion of Star Citizen, was recently updated so NPCs are now able to find and enter their beds, and then sleep until they&#39;re scheduled to get up.</p><p>&#34;We knew early on that, to hit the fidelity we expect for Sq42, we would need to do some R&amp;D on bedsheet deformation,&#34; the AI Content team explained, apparently straight-faced. &#34;This work is currently underway and, if successful, will allow the AI to deform their sheets when entering, exiting, or sleeping inside them. This is a challenging assignment and expands the complexity of the feature. For example, what happens to the sheets if the AI needs to exit the bed in an emergency?&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s certainly a concern, I guess, although to be honest I suspect that in the midst of a crisis like an alien attack or a catastrophic blowout, I wouldn&#39;t be spending too much of my time looking to see how believable the NPC sleeping quarters are. Based on reactions to the update on Reddit, it seems that quite a few Star Citizen players feel the same way:</p><hr/><p><em>ðŸš€ &#34;what the actual fuck lmao this game was supposed to be out years ago and they&#39;re implementing fucking BEDSHEET DEFORMATION?? I&#39;m done lol&#34; â€“ </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/uig8bd/comment/i7gq7fq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/uig8bd/comment/i7gq7fq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">torvi97</a></p><p><em>ðŸš€ &#34;R&amp;D on bedsheet deformation....for a game that is 10 years overdue.

In fact, the updates are ordered alphabetically, by team, and AI Content just happens to come first. There&#39;s plenty of other activity going on: The Animation team, for instance, worked on improvements to facial animations for several characters, while the Gameplay Story team updated several scenes in chapter one with new motion capture.</p><p>Most of that work, though, seems like it will have some material impact on the game. Bedsheet deformation? Not so much. Immersion is certainly a worthwhile goal but at some point I feel like it might be the sort of thing that you could sacrifice in favor of, you know, some <em>focus</em>.</p><p>Even though neither Star Citizen nor Squadron 42 are out yet, Cloud Imperium began talking about potential <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cloud-imperium-starts-referencing-star-citizen-spinoff-sequels/" target="_blank">sequels</a> earlier this year. In February, the studio also reworked its development roadmapâ€”ironically, to avoid &#34;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-citizen-is-reworking-its-roadmap-to-avoid-distractions-caused-by-unhappy-players/" target="_blank">distractions</a>&#34; from unhappy followers.</p><p>Thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-space-sim-starring-mark-hamill-is-currently-looking-into-accurate-bedsheet-deformation/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-space-sim-starring-mark-hamill-is-currently-looking-into-accurate-bedsheet-deformation/">GamesRadar</a>.</p>
