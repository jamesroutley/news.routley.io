    <h1>Do I need to get out the soldering-iron again? (2018)</h1>

      <p>
        So I had this idea that it would be nice to listen to music
        when I get home from work everyday, so I put all my ripped
        music onto my phone, and I bought some good quality over-ear
        headphones.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/new_headphones.jpg" alt="new headphones" width="1446" height="810"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I found I liked the great sound quality of the headphones, and
        the way they block atmospheric noise out a bit so I can just
        hear the music. It&#39;s a great experience to listen to some
        great music for 20 minutes when I get home to relax.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I had a problem. When my phone plays certain tracks
        it makes and explosion of noise when switching songs, or
        pausing and resuming.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  I tried converting the music to different formats (flac, wav
          and vorbis), it didn&#39;t help.
	</li>
	<li>
	  I tried a different music-player app, it didn&#39;t help.
	</li>
	<li>
	  I tried a different Android phone, it didn&#39;t help.
	</li>
      </ul>

        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/code_culprit.png" alt="section of code from Android music-player app" width="300" height="300"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        It turns out that all music players on Android actually play
        music using the Android-media-player-service. Apparently this
        service has some sort of bug. Maybe it doesn&#39;t like the
        metadata in those tracks?
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;d actually noticed this problem before, but these new
        headphones make it much more of a problem because they&#39;re much
        more sensitive, so the sound explosion is extremely loud
        relative to the music, scaring the hell out of me. This is not
        OK because the whole point is for me to be relaxing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Android
        is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free
        Software</a>, meaning I can modify the code, it would probably
        take me months to learn enough about music decoding and the
        Android-media-player-service to write a fix.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my first idea was to just get one of those portable CD
        players. So I bought a medium priced one from Argos.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/cd_player.jpg" alt="black portable CD player" width="1584" height="932"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        But this device has a problem too; it constantly feeds a
        hissing sound into the headphones. Like the phone&#39;s explosion
        problem, it&#39;s made worse by the sensitivity of the headphones,
        as the hiss has a constant amplitude, which is unaffected by
        the volume control.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point I&#39;m kind-of surprised at how hard it is to just
        listen to music with headphones. I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t have such
        bad problems doing this 15 years ago with a cheap MP3 player.
      </p>
      <p>
        My desktop has great sound quality but I don&#39;t want to be
        sitting at my computer chair while I listen to my music, I do
        that too much already. So I thought why don&#39;t I use my spare
        old laptop as a music-player?
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/spare_laptop.jpg" alt="white netbook" width="1518" height="1018"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        So I put a fresh install of Debian and installed mpd and
        ncmpc. It works and frankly ncmpc has a much nicer interface
        than any android music player apps I&#39;ve tried, or a CD
        player. But the sound quality on the laptop is just not quite
        up-to scratch. I think the output buffer on the amplifier is
        just not very good and struggles with the dynamic load of the
        transducers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I&#39;m absolutely astonished at how difficult it
        appears to be to just listen to music with a good pair of
        headphones. Is it not 2018? The media is full of talk about
        preposterously ambitious ideas such as AI and self-driving
        cars and yet I can&#39;t even listen to a fuck-damn music track?
        O_o
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;ve done my best to avoid this ... but it looks like I&#39;m
        gonna have to solve this problem with A FUCKING SOLDERING
        IRON!
      </p>
      <p>
        So the circuit is this fucking simple OK?
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/schematic_20181028.jpg" alt="circuit diagram" width="1289" height="867"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        OK so now I made it with parts I had lying around and it&#39;s
        fucking primitive:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/madeit.jpg" alt="unenclosed circuit board, plugged into the CD player, my headphones and a battery." width="1470" height="934"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        It works completely great! I plug it into my laptop or CD
        player and it sorts out the sound quality and gets rid of all
        the hiss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds fab, what else can I say?
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;d like to point out that you could have built this in the 70s. The
        <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne5532.pdf">NE5532P</a>
        op-amps I&#39;m using were first made and sold in
        1979. Interesting how a 1979-technology audio buffer can best
        a 2010 laptop or a 2018 CD-player.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course I need to make a case and find a more sensible way
        to power it but right now I&#39;m just glad I&#39;ve got something
        that works.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone reads this post I&#39;m sure loads of people will tell
        me that my problems are all my own making and if only I
        invested in an iPhone all my problems would go away. Well you
        know what? APPLE IS A SYMBOL OF PRETENTIOUSNESS AND IGNORANCE
        - YOU DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW YOUR PHONE WORKS - I DO NOT HAVE TO
        PAY A TAX TO APPLE TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC.
      </p>
      <h2>More about the circuit I made</h2>
      <p>
        The rest of this article is technical notes on how the circuit
        works for anyone who&#39;s interested or wants to make one.
      </p>
      <p>
        This circuit is a buffer and it helps by two mechanisms:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It improves sound quality by taking away the hard work of
          driving the dynamic load of the headphones from the
          device. It can do this job well because op-amps work great
          when they have lots of voltage.
        </li>
        <li>
          It has a gain of 0.1, which means it makes the source
          quieter. This helps with the problems I&#39;ve had because these
          headphones are very sensitive and my devices do not like
          driving them at the low amplitudes they require.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you want to make this but don&#39;t want the quietening effect,
        I think it should be fine to just remove the four 10K
        resistors. This gives you a gain of 1, which means the voltage
        levels are unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wanted best possible sound you&#39;d use some actual audio
        op-amps rather than these cheap NE5532P. And buffer the output
        of the op-amps somehow. But of-course size and cost balloons
        if you start adding buffers and stuff.

      <h3>Notes on performance:</h3>
      <p>
        I don&#39;t have an oscilloscope so I can&#39;t do any proper signal
        analysis on the circuit but frankly if it sounds good; it is
        good as far as I&#39;m concerned. And as I said it sounds great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intrinsic DC-offset is unmeasurable with my equipment (0.0mV
        according to my voltmeter). Furthermore it divides the DC
        offset of the source by 10!  There is however a small pop when
        it switches on and off.
      </p>
      <h3>Pictures of construction:</h3>
      <p>
        Here are the components before assembly. The headphone jacks
        are scavenged from an old computer:
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        I arranged all the parts with the prototyping board balanced
        on a tray. The annoying thing about doing it this way is that
        you then have to turn it over to solder it, and the parts
        start falling out!
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        By holding it on it&#39;s side with a handy-andy I was able to get
        it all soldered up without too many things falling out:
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        This circuit was easy to make; I didn&#39;t even bother to
        prototype it and yet it worked first time. Though note I have
        made audio amps before so I knew what I was doing.
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Now I just need to finish this off with a proper case and
        power-supply so it&#39;s not a pain-in-the arse to use. Shame
        Maplin closed because now I have to order parts off the
        internet and WAIT. I&#39;m beginning to notice a trend in the
        world-order whereby the shinier Apple&#39;s iPhones get the worse
        everything else gets.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;m sure one-day everyone will get their music injected direct
        from their iPhone to their brain by a needle. And anyone who
        tries to listen to music with their ears will be burned as a
        heretic for betraying &#34;the Gods&#34; (Apple, Spotify and other
        tech deities).
      </p>
      <h2>Update: Finishing it off!</h2>
      <p>
        So I did eventually finish it off with a proper enclosure.
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        So that it can be repaired if necessary, I gave it a
        magnetically attached lid. By putting the two pairs of magnets
        different ways, I was able to make it repel of you try to put
        the lid on wrong. Quite cool :)
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/inside.jpg" alt="" width="2016" height="928"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The circuit is held-in by screws and is connected to the
        power-supply through a mini terminal block so it can be
        removed for maintenance, or even replacement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it requires &gt;10V, I had to use two PP3 batteries to
        power it. These battery holders are quite nice, just draws
        that slide out.
      </p><figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Battery life is only a few hours unfortunately because the
        circuit draws an enormous idle current of 23mA :o
      </p><p>
        I&#39;ve put some nice &#34;Bumpon&#34; rubber feet on the bottom.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/bottom.jpg" alt="" width="959" height="620"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I designed a clever little circuit to drive the indicator
        LED. I wanted an indication of battery level. This is the schematic:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.naughtycomputer.uk/03_article_assets/do_i_really_need_to_get_out_the_soldering_iron_again/indicator.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="349"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        What this does is, when the amp is turned on, lights up for a
        moment, then turns off and stays off. But the amount of time
        which it comes on for depends on battery level. If battery is
        good, it lights up of only a fraction of a second. But as the
        battery gets low, it stays on for longer and longer. If
        battery level is unacceptable it lights up forever.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        So that&#39;s that!
