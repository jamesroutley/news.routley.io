    <h1>The case for flywheel storage in the Philippines</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An international research team is assessing the potential of flywheels for renewables storage in the Philippines. They considered the use of a flywheel energy storage system developed by US-based Amber Kinetics.</p> <p><time datetime="2023-01-13T16:00:44+01:00" itemprop="datePublished" title="Friday, January 13, 2023, 4:00 pm">January 13, 2023</time> </p></div><div><p>A group of flywheel storage experts from De La Salle University and California-based <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/03/14/pilot-project-for-flywheel-storage-underway-in-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amber Kinetics</a> has investigated potential opportunities and issues for the deployment of this storage technology in the Philippines.</p><p><span data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">“Flywheel energy storage systems can capitalize on storing energy during off-peak periods of the day and releasing them during peak usage periods,” researcher Roy Francis Navea told <strong>pv magazine</strong>. “In addition, aside from the basic electric energy source through the grid, the flywheel can also store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. Hence, this technology fits a tropical country like the Philippines.”</span></p><p>The researchers describer their findings in “<a href="http://www.warse.org/IJETER/static/pdf/file/ijeter668102020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Challenges and Opportunities of Flywheel Energy Storage in the Philippines</a>,” which was recently published in the <em>International Journal of Emerging Trends in Engineering Research.</em> They looked at how <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">the la</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">ndscape and geography of the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">country could affect the logistics of flywheel installations such as the <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/magazine-archive/reinventing-the-wheel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M32 flywheels</a> developed by Amber Kinetics, especially in off-grid areas. </span></p><p>The M32 system is a <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">5,000 kg, </span><span id="page368R_mcid37"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">four-</span></span><span id="page368R_mcid38"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">hour Kinetic Energy Storage System (KESS)</span></span><span id="page368R_mcid39"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation"> flywheel technology.
