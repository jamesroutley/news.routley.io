                    <div id="intro">
                        <p>You are about to undertake a journey into the mysterious world of cryptography. If you are
                            like
                            me, and you find the experience equal parts challenging and rewarding, you may stay on this
                            journey long after you finish reading this book. I am writing this in late 2021, seven years
                            after the publication of the first edition, and my own journey is
                            still very much ongoing. I don’t think it’s going to end any time soon.</p>

                        <p>I spent about two years writing the first edition of this book. At first, I thought I’d be
                            able
                            to spread the effort so that I wouldn’t have to work on it full time, but that didn’t
                            work. At
                            some point, I realized that things are changing so quickly that I constantly needed to go
                            back
                            and
                            rewrite the chapters I thought were finished. I had to switch to working full time on this
                            book after all.</p>

                        <p>I am now working on the second edition, and the situation is very similar. Since the
                            first edition’s publication, TLS 1.3 was released, and that’s a brand-new protocol that has
                            led
                            to many other changes elsewhere. It’s not surprising that I needed to write a new chapter
                            for
                            TLS 1.3. But in the next three chapters I worked on, I made deep changes and added a
                            great
                            deal of new content throughout. More work followed. In the end, it took
                            another
                            two years to complete the second edition.</p>

                        <p>I wrote this book to save you time. I’ve spent many years learning everything I could about
                            SSL/TLS and PKI and I know that only a few can afford to do the same. I thought that if I
                            put
                            the most important parts of what I’ve learned into a book, others might be able to achieve a
                            similar level of understanding in a fraction of the time—and here we are.</p>

                        <p><b>Here&#39;s what changed since the first edition:</b> 1) The TLS 1.3 chapter is brand new and
                            the
                            Configuration chapter has been completely rewritten; 2) With exception of possibly two
                            chapters,
                            most other chapters have seen heavy updates and rewrites; 3) The last four chapters from
                            the first edition are no longer in the second. This <a href="https://blog.ivanristic.com/2022/02/bulletproof-tls-and-pki-is-out.html">blog

                    <div id="chapter1">
                        <h4><b>Part I: SSL/TLS and PKI</b></h4>

                        <p>The first part, chapters 1 through 4, lays out the foundations with a discussion of
                            cryptography, SSL, TLS, and PKI.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 1, SSL, TLS, and Cryptography</b>, begins with an introduction to SSL and TLS and
                            discusses where these secure protocols fit in the Internet infrastructure. The remainder
                            of the chapter provides an introduction to cryptography and discusses the classic threat
                            model of the active network attacker.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 2, TLS 1.3</b>, focuses on the most recent TLS protocol revision. At the time
                            of writing, TLS 1.3 is well supported by both clients and servers, and widely used. This is
                            the chapter you should read to understand how things work today.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 3, TLS 1.2</b>, discusses previous major revision, TLS 1.2, which is still very
                            relevant and needed in practice. Understanding this protocol is also very useful to
                            understand what improvements were made in TLS 1.3 and why. Information about earlier
                            protocol revisions is provided where appropriate. An overview of the protocol evolution from
                            SSL 3 onwards is included at the end for reference.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 4, Public Key Infrastructure</b>, is an introduction to Internet PKI, which is the
                            predominant trust model used on the Internet today. The focus is on the standards and
                            organizations as well as governance, ecosystem weaknesses and possible future improvements.
                            This chapter now includes coverage of Certificate Transparency.
                        </p>

                    <div id="chapter2">
                        <h4><b>Part II: Problems and Attacks</b></h4>

                        <p>The second part, chapters 5 through 8, details the various problems with trust
                            infrastructure, our security protocols, and their implementations in libraries and
                            programs.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 5, Attacks against PKI</b>, deals with attacks on the trust ecosystem. It covers
                            all the major CA compromises, detailing the weaknesses, attacks, and consequences. This
                            chapter gives a thorough historical perspective on the security of the PKI ecosystem, which
                            is important for understanding its evolution.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 6, HTTP and Browser Issues</b>, is all about the relationship between HTTP and
                            TLS, the problems arising from the organic growth of the Web, and the messy interactions
                            between different pieces of the web ecosystem.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 7, Implementation Issues</b>, deals with issues arising from design and
                            programming mistakes related to random number generation, certificate validation, and other
                            key TLS and PKI functionality. In addition, it discusses voluntary protocol downgrade and
                            truncation attacks, as well as high-profile issues, such as Heartbleed, FREAK, and Logjam.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 8, Protocol Attacks</b>, is the longest chapter in the book. It covers all the
                            major protocol flaws discovered in recent years: insecure renegotiation, BEAST, CRIME, Lucky
                            13, POODLE and POODLE TLS, RC4, TIME and BREACH, and Triple Handshake Attack. The newer
                            ROBOT and Raccoon attacks are also there, among others. A brief discussion of Bullrun and
                            its impact on the security of TLS is also included.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="chapter3">
                        <h4><b>Part III: Deployment and Development</b></h4>

                        <p>The third part, chapters 9 through 11, provides comprehensive advice about deploying TLS in a
                            secure and efficient fashion.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 9, Performance</b>, focuses on the speed of TLS, going into great detail about
                            various performance improvement techniques for those who want to squeeze every bit of
                            speed out of their servers.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 10, HSTS, CSP, and Pinning</b>, covers some advanced topics that strengthen web
                            applications, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security and Content Security Policy. It also
                            covers pinning, which is an effective way of reducing the large attack surface imposed by
                            our current PKI model.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 11, TLS Configuration Guide</b>, is the map for the entire book and provides
                            step-by-step instructions on how to deploy secure and well-performing TLS servers and web
                            applications. This chapter has effectively been rewritten for the second edition
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="chapter4">
                        <h4><b>Part IV: OpenSSL Command-Line</b></h4>

                        <p>The fourth and final part consists of chapters 12 and 13, which focus on OpenSSL, the de
                            facto standard for everyday TLS and PKI work on the command line.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 12, OpenSSL</b>, describes the most frequently used OpenSSL functionality, with a
                            focus on installation, configuration, and key and certificate management. The last section
                            in this chapter provides instructions on how to construct and manage a private certification
                            authority.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 13, Testing with OpenSSL</b>, continues with OpenSSL and explains how to use its
                            command-line tools to test server configuration. Even though it’s often much easier to use
                            an automated tool for testing, OpenSSL remains the tool you turn to when you want to be sure
                            about what’s going on.</p>

            TLS and PKI</a>, the result of more than a decade of research and study, is widely recognised as the
            de-facto SSL/TLS and PKI reference manual. His work on <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com">SSL Labs</a> made
            hundreds of thousands of web sites more
            secure. Before that, he created <a href="https://www.github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity">ModSecurity</a>, a
            leading open source web application firewall.
