    <h1>The Typography of Legal Opinions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><title-block><topic>court opinions</topic><short-rule>More diverse than you might think</short-rule></title-block><p>A com­mon coun­ter­ar­gu­ment I hear from at­tor­neys re­sis­tant to bet­ter ty­pog­ra­phy is called What Judges Want. In Mad Libs for­mat, it goes like this:<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “Sure</dquo-open-pull> Matthew, that’s a fine idea, but <madlib>____ <lower>noun</lower> ____</madlib> is what judges want, be­cause all judges are <madlib>____ <lower>ad­jec­tive phrase</lower> ____</madlib>.”</p><p>What goes in the blanks?</p><p>Or any­thing, really. Be­cause What Judges Want is based on the same faulty rea­son­ing as all broad-brush­stroke ar­gu­ments. Whether you’ve met ten judges or a thou­sand, it’s ap­par­ent that they’re as dif­fer­ent from each other as at­tor­neys are. Why try to <span>generalize?</span></p><p>I don’t. Rather than de­bate What Judges Want, I en­cour­age these at­tor­neys to rely on ev­i­dence. Court rules are one <span>example.</span></p><p>Court opin­ions are an­other. If it were true that judges are<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “only</dquo-open-pull> in­ter­ested in sub­stance”—a fa­vored con­tention—then we’d ex­pect judges to put zero ef­fort into the pre­sen­ta­tion of their own work. But that’s not the case. Sure, plenty of judges is­sue doc­u­ments that look aw­ful. Just as plenty of at­tor­neys do. But many oth­ers ap­pre­ci­ate that ty­pog­ra­phy makes a <span>difference.</span></p><p>This next ex­am­ple is not fic­tional. It shows re­cent im­prove­ments made by the Utah Supreme Court to the ty­pog­ra­phy of its <span>opinions.</span></p><p><a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/samples/court-opinion-before.pdf"><img src="https://typographyforlawyers.com/samples/court-opinion-before.png"/></a></p><ol><li><p><a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/monospaced-fonts.html">Mono­spaced font</a>.</p></li><li><p>Mid­dle of page is dis­or­ga­nized and hard to fol­low.</p></li><li><p>Small <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/page-margins.html">page mar­gins</a>; over­sized <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/line-length.html">line length</a>.</p></li></ol><p>This opin­ion is an ex­cel­lent sum­mary of the pre­vi­ous chap­ters, show­ing what hap­pens when you toss out ob­so­lete <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/typewriter-habits.html">type­writer habits</a> and re­place them with sim­ple prin­ci­ples of good <span>typography.</span></p><p><a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/samples/court-opinion-after.pdf"><img src="https://typographyforlawyers.com/samples/court-opinion-after.png"/></a></p><ol><li><p>More read­able <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/body-text.html">body text</a> font.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/centered-text.html">Cen­tered text</a> used to or­ga­nize mid­dle of page.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/justified-text.html">Jus­ti­fied text</a> used with <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/hyphenation.html">hy­phen­ation</a>.</p></li></ol><p>Sim­i­lar to the Vi­o­let–Trixie ré­sumé test in <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/why-does-typography-matter.html">why does ty­pog­ra­phy mat­ter</a>, I of­ten show skep­ti­cal law­yers this pair of opin­ions. I ask: which one would you rather read? No one fails to pick this <span>one.</span></p><p>Con­sid­er­ing where they started, the Utah Supreme Court de­serves credit for most im­proved. If they can do it, you can do <span>it.</span></p><p>But who’s pro­duc­ing the best-de­signed court opin­ions in the coun­try? Maybe it’s an ob­vi­ous pick, but this court is al­most <span>infallible—</span></p><p><a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/samples/supreme-court-sample.pdf"><img src="https://typographyforlawyers.com/samples/supreme-court-sample.png"/></a></p><p>The United States Supreme Court, of <span>course.</span></p><ol><li><p>Gen­er­ously large page mar­gins.

But this sim­ply demon­strates a point from <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/maxims-of-page-layout.html">max­ims of page lay­out</a>: when you de­sign the text block prop­erly, the white space takes care of it­self. This book­let-sized text block is equally read­able on larger <span>paper.</span></p><p>Prac­ti­tion­ers should note that in the Supreme Court, Times New Ro­man is for­bid­den. So if you’re prepar­ing your first pe­ti­tion, don’t wait till the night be­fore to read Rule 33(b) and find a font in the<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “Cen­tury</dquo-open-pull> fam­ily”, as it re­quires. There are some <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/system-fonts.html">sys­tem fonts</a> in the Cen­tury fam­ily, and pro­fes­sional-font op­tions as <span>well.</span></p><p><dquo-open-pull>“Wait—it</dquo-open-pull> looks like the Supreme Court is us­ing two spaces be­tween sen­tences.” It ap­pears so. But I’m not the type po­lice. As you’ve gath­ered by now, the goal of this book is to share the knowl­edge and tools you need to make your ty­pog­ra­phy bet­ter. But you get to de­cide what that means—and where to take it <span>next.</span></p><p>And who knows? The Supreme Court might still switch to one space. Greater prece­dents have been over­turned. My am­i­cus brief is <span>ready.</span></p></div></div>
