    <h1>Internet Archive&#39;s big battle with music publishers ends in settlement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a lawsuit where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/record-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-obsolete-vintage-records/">music publishers sued the Internet Archive</a> over the Great 78 Project, an effort to preserve early music recordings that only exist on brittle shellac records.</p>
<p>No details of the settlement have so far been released, but a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UMG-v-Internet-Archive-Joint-Notice-of-Settlement-9-15-25.pdf">court filing</a> on Monday confirmed that the Internet Archive and UMG Recordings, Capitol Records, Sony Music Entertainment, and other record labels &#34;have settled this matter.&#34; More details may come in the next 45 days, when parties must submit filings to officially dismiss the lawsuit, but it&#39;s unlikely the settlement amount will be publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>Days before the settlement was announced, record labels had indicated that everyone but the Internet Archive and its founder, Brewster Kahle, had agreed to sign a joint settlement, seemingly including the Great 78 Project&#39;s recording engineer George Blood, who was also a target of the litigation. But in the days since, IA has gotten on board, posting a <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/09/15/an-update-on-the-great-78s-lawsuit/">blog</a> confirming that &#34;the parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.&#34;</p>
<p>For IA—which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/music-labels-will-regret-coming-for-the-internet-archive-sound-historian-says/">strove to digitize 3 million recordings to help historians document recording history</a>—the lawsuit from music publishers could have meant financial ruin. Initially, record labels alleged that damages amounted to $400 million, claiming they lost streams when IA visitors played Great 78 recordings.</p>
<p>But despite IA arguing that there were comparably low downloads and streams on the Great 78 recordings—as well as a music publishing industry vet <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/internet-archive-major-label-music-lawsuit-1235105273/">suggesting</a> that damages were likely no more than $41,000—the labels intensified their attacks in March. In a court filing, the labels added so many more infringing works that the estimated damages increased to $700 million. It seemed like labels were intent on doubling down on a fight that, at least one sound historian suggested, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/music-labels-will-regret-coming-for-the-internet-archive-sound-historian-says/">labels might one day regret.</a></p>
