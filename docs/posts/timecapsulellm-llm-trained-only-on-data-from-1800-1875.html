<p dir="auto">First model to recall and connect a real historical event with an actual figure from the dataset.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example: Prompt: &#34;It was the year of our Lord 1834&#34;</p>
<p dir="auto">The output: &#34;It was the year of our Lord 1834 and the streets of London were filled with protest and petition. The cause, as many re counted, was not bound in the way of private, but having taken up the same day in the day of Lord Palmerston, the public will receive a short statement of the difficulties under which the day of law has reached us. It is a matter of deep regret, that the present events in the history of the world are clear, and consequently will be&#39;known. It is not true that the very men who first settled in the Gospel at Jerusalem should have so extensive and so interesting a record of the prosperity and prosperity&#34;</p>

<p dir="auto">PROMPT:Charles Darwin</p>
<p dir="auto">Charles DarwinECCEMACY. Sir, — The following case is interesting to me : — I was in London a fortnight, and was much affected with an attack of rheumatism. The first attack of rheumatism was a week before I saw you, and the second when I saw you, and the third when I saw you, and the third in the same time. The second attack of gout, however, was not accompanied by any febrile symptoms, but was accompanied with an increased flow of urine, and with a more copious discharge of urine. The third attack was an hour after I saw you, and was succeeded by a return of a paroxysm of gout, and a more rapid return of the gout. The fourth attack was also accompanied by a fever, but was not always accompanied by any febrile symptoms. The third attack of gout was a fortnight after you had been ill, and the fourth was followed by a paroxysm of gout. The fourth attack was a fortnight after you were attacked, and was accompanied by a sense</p>

<p dir="auto">Selective Temporal Training (STT) is a machine learning methodology where all training data is specifically curated to fall within a specific historical time period. It&#39;s done in order to model the language and knowledge of that era without influence from modern concepts. For example, the current model I have now (v0.5) is trained on data exclusively from 1800-1875, it&#39;s not fine tuned but trained from scratch resulting in output that reflects the linguistic style and historical context of that time period.</p>

<p dir="auto">For this project I&#39;m trying to create a language model that is unclouded from modern bias. If I fine-tune something like GPT-2, it&#39;s already pre-trained and that information won&#39;t go away. If I train from scratch the language model won&#39;t pretend to be old, it just will be.
