    <h1>The appeal of using plain HTML pages</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The appeal of using plain HTML pages</h2>

	<p><small>April 24, 2019</small></p>
</div><div><p>Once upon a time our local support site was a wiki, for all of the
reasons that people make support sites and other things into wikis.
Then <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/WikiTrap">using a wiki blew up in our faces</a>. You might
reasonably expect that we replaced it with a more modern <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, or perhaps a static site generator of some
sort (using either HTML or Markdown for content and some suitable
theme for uniform styling). After all, it&#39;s a number of interlinked
pages that need a consistent style and consistent navigation, which
is theoretically a natural fit for any of those.</p>

<p>In practice, we did none of those; instead, <a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">our current support
site</a> is that most basic thing, a
bunch of static <code>.html</code> files sitting in a filesystem (and a static
file of CSS, and some Javascript to drop in a header on all pages).
When we need to, we edit the files with <code>vi</code>, and there&#39;s no
deployment or rebuild process.</p>

<p>(If we don&#39;t want to edit the live version, we make a copy of the
<code>.html</code> file to a scratch name and edit the copy, then move it back
into place when done.)</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a solution that works for everyone. But for us at our
modest scale, it&#39;s been really very simple to work with. We all
already know how to edit files and how to write basic HTML, so
there&#39;s been nothing to learn or to remember about managing or
updating the support site (well, you have to remember where its
files are, but that&#39;s pretty straightforward). <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/StaticHTMLStability">Static HTML files
require no maintenance</a> to keep a wiki or a
CMS or a generator program going; they just sit there until you
change them again. And everything can handle them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m normally someone who&#39;s attracted to ideas like writing in a
markup language instead of raw HTML and having some kind of templated,
dynamic system (whether it&#39;s a wiki, a CMS, or a themed static site
generator), as you can tell from <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> and
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> itself.  I still think that they make sense at large scale.
But at small scale, if I was doing a handful of HTML pages today,
it would be quite tempting to skip all of the complexity and just
write plain <code>.html</code> files.</p>

<p>(I&#39;d use a standard HTML layout and structure for all the <code>.html</code>
files, with CSS to match.)</p>

<p>(This thought is sort of sparked by <a href="https://mu.zaitcev.nu/notice/9i6hQXt8KzGe5AgRiy">a question by Pete Zaitcev
over on the Fediverse</a>,
and then reflecting on our experiences maintaining our support site
since we converted it to HTML. In practice I&#39;m probably more likely
to update the site now than I was when it was a wiki.)</p>
