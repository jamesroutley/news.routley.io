    <h1>How much do construction costs matter to the price of housing?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div dir="auto"><p>One of the goals of this newsletter is to figure out ways to improve construction productivity and reduce the costs of construction, particularly residential construction (ie: housing) - if you could reduce the costs of construction, housing costs would fall as well. <a href="https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/housing-economics/housings-economic-impact/housings-contribution-to-gross-domestic-product" rel="">Roughly 15-18%</a> of US GDP goes towards housing costs (including mortgages, rents, and construction of new homes), and fraction of income spent on housing is inversely proportional to income, so being able to reduce costs associated with it would have substantial benefits.</p><p>But outside of this little corner of the internet, there’s relatively little focus on construction costs as a driver of housing costs. Instead, discussions of housing cost tend to be focused on what we might call ‘price distortions’ - increases in housing costs caused by things like zoning rules, height caps, onerous permitting requirements, and other policy decisions [0]. These factors are a major focus of <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Overview-Talk-Panel-5.pdf" rel="">urban economists</a>, and of policy advocates <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/bigideas/to-improve-housing-affordability-we-need-better-alignment-of-zoning-taxes-and-subsidies/" rel="">like</a> <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/whos-to-blame-for-high-housing-costs-its-more-complicated-than-you-think/" rel="">Brookings</a>, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/NiskanenCenter/status/1435978113385652228" rel="">Niskanen</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=yimby&amp;src=typed_query" rel="">YIMBY</a> movement. They’re also fairly central in housing discussions in major media outlets such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/opinion/housing-crisis-eviction.html" rel="">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-housing-crisis-in-japan-home-prices-stay-flat-11554210002" rel="">Wall Street Journal</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/theres-no-such-thing-luxury-housing/618548/" rel="">Atlantic</a> (as well as smaller publications like <a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/" rel="">Works in Progress</a>.) </p><p>I suspect this is at least partly due to the fact that urban areas like San Francisco and New York, which have a disproportionately large influence on what gets discussed in major media outlets [1], have both extremely high housing costs, and extremely restrictive building policies that limit housing construction.</p><p>This isn’t necessarily unreasonable - supply restrictions are a problem with a clear path towards a solution (let people build more houses!), and it’s a solution that can (theoretically) be reached by getting the right people paying attention and talking about it. So it makes sense for media discussions around housing costs to focus on them - you won’t be able to reduce construction costs by writing an op-ed in the New York Times, but it might help <a href="https://www.gibsondunn.com/california-governor-newsom-signs-three-important-new-bills-into-law-impacting-residential-zoning-and-development/" rel="">get SB9 passed</a>. But because it’s so central to the conversation, it would be easy to get the idea that policy decisions are the <em>main thing</em> that affect housing costs, and (implicity) that construction costs don’t matter as much. So it’s worth diving into some of the factors that affect the price of housing, and how construction costs fit in.</p><h3>Land and structure</h3><p>We can think of housing as a bundle of a parcel of land and a structure (plus other improvements) sitting on top of it. We can thus break down the cost of housing into a) the cost of putting up the structure, and b) the cost of the land it sits on [2]. For single family homes, this breakdown is often done by taking the purchase price of a house, then subtracting the (depreciated) costs of construction, typically determined by using RS Means or similar construction cost data [3]. What’s left is the value of the land itself. When using this method of cost breakdown, outside of price distortions that increase the cost of construction (which we’ll look at), <strong>price distortions caused by limits on how much housing can be built will show up as increased land prices, </strong>assuming you keep the amount of housing per lot constant (more on this later.)</p><p>One way to think about it is that land is also a bundle, consisting of a ‘hedonic’ or consumption portion (the value people get from having the land itself) and a ‘permission slip’ that allows you to build a certain quantity of housing on it. In general, <strong>the hedonic value of land is fairly low</strong> - when <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10124/w10124.pdf" rel="">Ed Glaeser calculated this</a> for 21 metro areas in early 2000 (by analyzing home price sales and estimating how much a larger lot added to the home’s value), he found that in 16 of them, the hedonic value was less than (inflation adjusted) $1.50 per square foot, or less than $12,000 dollars for the <a href="https://nahbnow.com/2020/10/median-single-family-lot-size-hits-record-low/" rel="">median lot size of ~8,000 square feet</a> (though we should be careful with a simple inflation adjustment of this hedonic value [4].) By comparison, the median new home in 2020 sold for around $330,000.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12601/w12601.pdf" rel="">similar study of single family homes in Boston</a> found that the hedonic value of land for the average lot was just $11,200, compared to an average house cost of $450,000.</p><p><strong>The permission slip, by contrast, is often incredibly valuable,</strong> especially if the permitting body limits how many of them it gives out [5]. For instance, in the previous study Glaeser calculated the hedonic value of land for single family homes in San Francisco at $4.10 per square foot (the highest out of any metro examined), or about $10,000 for the average <a href="https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/rs_archive/other/706EHEP_web_only_appendix.pdf" rel="">lot size at that time.</a> The ‘zoning tax’ portion, by contrast (the portion of the cost due to various building and supply restrictions), was priced at around $220,000 - in other words, over 95% of the land’s value (and over half the price of the house), was due from being allowed to build on it [6].</p><p>Similarly, multifamily developers have told me that they will generally value land in terms of how many housing units they’re allowed to build on it. Increase the number of housing units you’re allowed to build (say, by getting it rezoned), and you greatly increase the value of the land. This is a lever developers have to work with when putting together a development deal - they might decide to take a risk and buy a cheaper piece of land that’s zoned for a relatively small number of units, in the hopes of getting permission to build more on it than is currently allowed.</p><p>One effect of this is that <strong>supply restrictions increase land price overall, but density restrictions (limits on how much you can build on a given lot) can actually </strong><em><strong>decrease</strong></em><strong> land price on certain lots</strong>, if they prevent you from building as many units as you otherwise might (a lot in San Francisco might be outrageously expensive for a single family home, but it nonetheless might be even more valuable if you were allowed to build a skyscraper on it.) <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837719310841" rel="">This study</a> in China, for instance, found that the higher the allowed Floor-Area-Ratio, the greater the value of urban land, and <a href="https://rsaiconnect.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pirs.12421" rel="">this study</a> found similar results for New York. This is perhaps why San Francisco has both <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/americans-burdened-by-increasing-housing-costs-slow-wage-gains" rel="">higher housing costs than New York</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/america-s-urban-land-is-worth-a-staggering-amount" rel="">lower land value per acre</a>.</p><h3>Land value and existing housing</h3><p>So supply restrictions can matter a lot for the price of…a lot. Of course, most jurisdictions aren’t New York or San Francisco - if we look at the whole US, what fraction of existing residential real estate price is the land itself?</p><p>This varies over time, and depends on how you measure it.

Depending on what depreciation rate you use when calculating your replacement cost (the Fed seems to use a rate between 1.1 and 1.5% depending on the year of construction), this would have the effect of making land cost a larger fraction of real estate value without any sort of change in demand, policy, or replacement cost.</p><h3>Land value and new construction</h3><p>So on average, the cost of the structure itself is around 60% of the value of residential real estate, with a great deal of variance depending on where you are and how expensive the land is.</p><p>But those values are for <em>existing</em> housing. <strong>For new construction, we tend to see land make up a smaller fraction of overall costs</strong>. <a href="https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/02/cost-of-constructing-a-home-in-2019/" rel="">NAHB’s 2020 survey of homebuilder</a>s found an average land price of just 18.5% of the overall costs, with 61% of the remaining costs due to construction directly and ~20% due to profit and overhead (which you may or may not decide counts as construction costs - estimates of replacement costs based on RS Means tend to include builder profit.) Keeping the proportion of land cost below 20% for a new house is apparently a popular rule of thumb for homebuilders, and we don’t see a huge amount of deviation from this even at the peak of pre-crisis exuberance. We actually see a slight tendency towards a lower proportion of costs due to land, and a higher proportion due to construction cost, over time (though there’s a lot of variance here):</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb26c6b74-a001-40db-a4be-4e62f004e446_615x186.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb26c6b74-a001-40db-a4be-4e62f004e446_615x186.png" width="615" height="186" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b26c6b74-a001-40db-a4be-4e62f004e446_615x186.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:186,&#34;width&#34;:615,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>We get a similar cost fraction if we look at government statistics.

It’s also likely due to the fact that, in line with Glaeser’s suggestion that people don’t actually value land very much, median lot size for new homes has been steadily decreasing since the early 1990s [7]:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e945b0c-22f6-4b65-baac-8b2b8dfd5e54_954x535.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e945b0c-22f6-4b65-baac-8b2b8dfd5e54_954x535.png" width="588" height="329.748427672956" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e945b0c-22f6-4b65-baac-8b2b8dfd5e54_954x535.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:535,&#34;width&#34;:954,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:588,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>So that’s for single family homes. And based on conversations with developers, multifamily property cost breakdown is somewhat similar: on average perhaps 15-20% of the cost will be the land, with another 50-60% going to ‘hard’ costs (the costs of the physical structure) and the rest of ‘soft’ costs (overhead, design, financing, administration, profits, etc.) <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/making-apartments-more-affordable-starts-with-understanding-the-costs-of-building-them/" rel="">This breakdown by Brookings</a> of multifamily development costs gives similar proportions.</p><h3>Supply restrictions and construction costs?</h3><p>So for new construction, land is (on average) perhaps 20% of the cost or less, with 60-80% due to the costs of construction (depending on what you count as construction costs.) This suggests that for most new housing that&#39;s currently built, the effects of zoning and other supply restrictions aren’t a particularly large fraction of the cost.</p><p>One objection to this would be that supply restrictions might show up as increased construction costs as well.

So the US builds <a href="https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/60-years-of-homebuilding?r=23el8" rel="">huge numbers of single family homes and comparatively few multifamily buildings</a>, because it makes the former easy to build and the latter much harder. And it builds huge numbers of homes in Texas and the south, and few in California, because California has made it extremely hard to build homes and the south makes it easy.</p><p><strong>Ultimately, I think that housing policy and construction costs are two blades of a scissor</strong>. Being able to build inexpensive housing starts with being able to build housing at all, and being able to build densely on valuable urban land. But because construction costs are such an overwhelmingly large part of almost all housing costs, reducing housing costs will require reducing construction costs as well.</p><h3>New York and San Francisco are anomalies</h3><p>One thing I feel is important to glean from this is that <strong>New York and San Francisco are very non-central examples with regards to housing</strong>. These two cities are outliers in both regulatory burdens and construction costs, and the bay area especially has unusually high costs of housing compared to the rest of the country.</p><p>Which is not to say that housing policy for these cities isn’t important - it’s of course hugely important, both for the cities themselves and the country as a whole (since they’re critical economic engines [8].) But <strong>they should not be reference examples for considerations about broader housing policy, </strong>and they should not be the <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_tooze/status/1114558384123076608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1114558384123076608%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F08%2F10%2Fopinion%2Fhousing-crisis-eviction.html" rel="">only two cities on your graph</a> when<strong> </strong>comparing the US to other countries.<strong> </strong></p><p>(I actually think this is a problem for construction startups, that they’re likely to over-index on the inefficiency of San Francisco construction, and run into problems when they expand to places where construction is cheaper and easier, which is basically everywhere else.)</p><h3>Recent trends</h3><p>One final thing to note is that this data is largely pre-pandemic. And as anyone who has shopped for a house recently knows, the pandemic has made the real estate market extremely chaotic. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS" rel="">Home prices are way up</a>, as are materials and construction costs. Completion dates are getting pushed out due to supply chain issues, and inventory has been unusually low in the face of a huge demand spike as people shifted to working from home. I think the jury is still out on whether this is a fundamental shift in residential real estate and housing construction, or if it’s a temporary deviation that will eventually correct itself, but it’s something to consider.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>So, to sum up:</p><ul><li><p>Supply limitations on housing will mostly show up as increases in land prices.</p></li><li><p>For existing housing, land fraction makes up on average around 30-40% of the value of a house (though much of this data comes from single family homes.)</p></li><li><p>For new construction, both single family and multifamily land fraction tends to be 20% or less. 50-80% of the cost of new housing is due to the costs of construction, depending on what you count as construction cost. Construction cost is thus the majority of cost for most new housing construction.</p></li><li><p>In regions or time periods of extremely high demand, home prices can get bid up well in excess of the cost to produce them, though new construction seems more resistant to this (suggesting that the rate of new building is an important consideration factor in housing prices.)</p></li><li><p>New York and San Francisco are not representative of the US housing situation overall.</p></li></ul><p><em>These posts will always remain free, but if you find this work valuable, I encourage you to <strong><a href="https://constructionphysics.substack.com/publish/settings/https://constructionphysics.substack.com/subscribe?" rel="">become a paid subscriber</a></strong>.
