    <h1>Day 2 at RC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Day 2 of RC was really interesting. The biggest event of the day was a pairing
workshop. But I also attended a couple of group events:</p>
<ul>
<li>a discussion of WebGL,</li>
<li>the start of a reading group for Nand2Tetris.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then in the evening I attended a couple of non-programming talks.</p>
<p>I also finally finished Protohackers day 6 in Rust which felt really good.</p>
<h2 id="pairing-workshop">Pairing Workshop</h2>
<p>I&#39;m really interested in pair programming but I haven&#39;t done much of it.
I have watched a good number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RubberDuckEng/streams">Rubber Duck Engineering</a>
streams and thought &#34;yeah, that seems like some of the most fun I can imagine&#34;.
The workshop brought me back to earth a little bit: I don&#39;t think I am very
good at pairing. That being said, I really want to do as much pairing as possible
over the next few months.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the workshop, some of the RC
staff discussed the benefits of pairing and provided an example of what effective
pairing might look like. We then split off into groups to work on implementing Mastermind.
As we jumped into groups, I found myself in a
group of three. I ended up driving to start out. There are 2 roles in pair
programming: the driver who types and the navigator who follows along. Driving is
hard. From experiences that I&#39;ve had, it feels most similar to taking a coding
interview with a bit more communication. I got a little carried away and ended up
taking 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes for my section of driving. When we
switched off, I discovered that navigating is at least as hard as driving.
Finding the right time to mention something to the driver is tough and I can get
a little bit fixated on tiny issues (as my wife would surely attest). Overall,
this was a really valuable session and I&#39;m looking forward to working through
some of my discomfort with pairing over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As an aside, node&#39;s blocking-averse design made it surprisingly difficult
to read input from the user. Especially when compared with python&#39;s <code>input</code>.</p>
<h2 id="webgl">WebGL</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve always been kind of curious about graphics programming, but I consistently
bounce off. I think the gap between &#34;wow, this is a triangle with a gradient&#34; to
&#34;holy smokes, a hand-written shader for a high-fidelity 3D flying sequence&#34; seems
insurmountable. I&#39;ve also always struggled with extemporaneous creativity.
Whenever I was called on to improvise in jazz band, I would clam up immediately.
I&#39;m curious how I might be able to work through some of my &#34;improv anxiety&#34; and
come up with silly ideas to try that might help me work through some of my
misgivings with shaders. We&#39;ll see.</p>
<h2 id="nand2tetris">Nand2Tetris</h2>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://codehiddenlanguage.com/">Charles Petzold&#39;s Code</a> which
I thoroughly enjoyed. Slowly building up a stack of abstractions starting from
sending signals between neighboring houses was really neat. I bought <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539807/the-elements-of-computing-systems/">The Elements
of Computing Systems</a>
a while ago, but haven&#39;t done much aside from the first couple of chapters.</p>
<p>Working through the book seems like it might be a fun way to bolster my mental
model of hardware and the hardware/software interface.</p>
<h2 id="non-programming-talks">Non-programming Talks</h2>
<p>These talks were great. I learned a lot about tabletop RPGs and chairmaking.
Most of all, it was further proof that the people at RC are awesome.</p>
<h2 id="protohackers-day-6-in-rust">Protohackers day 6 in Rust</h2>
<p>It was really neat to finally finish protohackers day 6 in Rust <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sgeisenh/protohackers/tree/main/item/06/src/main.rs">link</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not handling connections the best and I could definitely use some logging
to make debugging easier. But the automated tests passed, and a heck of a lot
faster than my python implementation, at that!</p>
<h2 id="that-s-all-for-now">That&#39;s all for now</h2>
<p>Most of these will probably be quick updates with maybe a more in-depth update
once every week or two. Thanks for reading!</p>
