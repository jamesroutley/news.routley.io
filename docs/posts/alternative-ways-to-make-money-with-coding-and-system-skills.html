    <h1>Ask HN: Alternative ways to make money with coding and system skills?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The thought of returning to corporate working kind of disgusts me. daily meetings, middle management bs, politics, bureaucracy... im sure your familiar with the typical complaints.</p><p>Ive realized I don&#39;t seem to have any money generating skills, the only thing I seem actually be good at is making money for other people.</p><p>So im wondering if anyone has been able to use their coding skill to make a living that isn&#39;t working in a business.</p><p>Things ive tried and thought about(please correct anything that seems wrong!):</p><p>monetizing hobbies - I see why people don&#39;t recommend this, im not good enough anyway. to old to go pro at sports, not good enough or have credentials to teach.</p><p>coding tutoring and teaching - i tried this on codementor.io, there&#39;s more mentors then people needing help, its competitive and doesn&#39;t pay much when you consider how much extra work goes into it. I also don&#39;t have a CS degree so it doesn&#39;t seem like I can teach at a school. Maybe there are better ways to teach?</p><p>bug bounty chasing - I thought this would be easier then it really is. i guess its like a whole different skill set, interesting as a hobby but its going to take to long to get good. and its competitive</p><p>make a company or sell a thing software thing - I can code up my dream ideas with ease, what i don&#39;t know how to do is market anything or get users. seems to be another skill that will take months and maybe not even turn out to do anything</p><p>freelance - compared to just working rates seem low and its hard to find work from what ive seen</p><p>If you have cool ideas or something worked out for you, id be interested in hearing them! Otherwise I need to get working on a resume, id rather not!</p></div></div></div>
