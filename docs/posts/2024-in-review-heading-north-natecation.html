</blockquote>
<p>At the end of each year, I like to write a year in review. In large part, they’re a way for me to remember — it’s fascinating to read them <a href="https://www.reuters.com/back-to-normal-2021-in-review/">three</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/startup-year-a-review-of-my-year-at-jupiter/">four</a>, or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/why-i-dropped-out/">five</a> years later and see how my life and thinking has changed over time. At the same time, they’re also a way for me to share a more detailed update with those who happen to be interested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately — if you are one of those people who happen to be interested — this year may have been one of the <em>least</em> interesting in recent memory: I didn’t <a href="https://www.reuters.com/why-i-dropped-out/">drop out of college</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/startup-year-a-review-of-my-year-at-jupiter/">become the first employee at a startup</a>, or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/100-days-in-the-wild-pacific-crest-trail/">live in the wilderness for 100 days</a>. Instead, I spent the entire year in one state, doing relatively ordinary things: I began the year at school, finishing up a few final requirements; then, I returned to the <a href="https://www.caldera.xyz/">startup</a> I worked at two summers ago, instead now as a full-time employee. No new cities lived in, no new companies worked at.</p>
<p>That said, I have exciting plans for 2025, and I can see myself maybe reminiscing on the relative simplicity of this past year if the upcoming one shakes out as well as I hope it does. So, here I am, writing this, so I don’t forget.</p>

<p>At the end of the quarter, my family flew out to attend graduation-related activities at UCLA. We met up with our relatives in the Los Angeles area and enjoyed dinners together at trendy Westside restaurants.</p>
<p>The next weekend, I was up in San Francisco participating in a healthcare + AI hackathon hosted by the <a href="https://www.outofpocket.health/">Out of Pocket newsletter</a> team. My hackathon team <a href="https://www.outofpocket.health/p/some-cool-ai-healthcare-projects">won the “Most Practical Application”</a> prize, and after the announcement went out, some newsletter readers reached out about turning our hack into a product. Although I haven’t been working actively on the project since the event, it’s a promising avenue that I’m looking forward to pursuing more intently in the coming year.</p>

            </span></p><p>In a similar way, great universities also attract ambitious people; and similar to the specific types of amibition in different cities, students’ ambitions are often specific to their chosen universities.<span></span>Concretely, while UCLA is undoubtedly an excellent school for those with ambitions in the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1braiu0/uc_berkeley_vs_ucla_premed/">life</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240625222516/https://www.aamc.org/media/9636/download?attachment">sciences</a>, I get the sense that many smart, ambitious people who are interested specifically in startups (and even computer science and technology more broadly) who are admitted to UCLA are also admitted to Berkeley, and many (reasonably) choose to go to Berkeley instead. With that in mind, while I met some ambitious (in my preferred sense of the word) people at UCLA, I feel a much stronger sense of community now, in San Francisco, where I’m clearly surrounded by other people seriously, credibly interested in startups and entrepreneurship.<span></span>Not that I was necessarily unaware of this before deciding which school to transfer to, but it’s something to consider if you’re a high school senior choosing between the two schools.</p><p><a data-footnote-identifier="13">

<p>Back in San Francisco, I settled into familiar routines. Long rides on the PCH gave way to meandering excursions among the <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=469">redwoods in Marin</a> and the Peninsula; climbs into the Santa Monica Mountains turned into morning ascents of Hawk Hill and the occasional trek up Mt. Tam. I returned to <a href="https://caldera.xyz">Caldera</a>, the blockchain startup I’d worked at last summer, as a full-time employee, continuing to focus on fullstack engineering with some smart contract work here and there. And I took my annual summer pilgrimage to Pennsylvania to run in my high school cross country team’s alumni meet.</p>

<p>The last few months of the year were filled with travel. In October, Caldera hosted an offsite in Montreal — my first time in Canada in over a decade. Although the prevalence of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca">young Canadians</a> I’d meet in San Francisco who’d left their homes to work tech jobs here in the States sometimes made me wonder whether there was something wrong with the country, I was pleasantly surprised. The streets were clean and the infrastructure was functional; Montreal had pleasing public plazas, beautiful European-style architecture, and excellent bike lanes; the fall weather was lovely.</p>
<p>November brought me to Bangkok for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241109215917/https://devcon.org/en/">Devcon</a>, an Ethereum conference, where I met up with friends in the space whom I could’ve seen in San Francisco or New York. It was my first time in Asia. I enjoyed the warmth of the locals, the delicious food, and the thrill of being on a new continent. Unlike my stay in South America last year, though, I didn’t spend much time outside of the major cities, and I was struck by the relentless march of globalization: almost everyone I spoke to spoke English and the malls were full of Western shops. If I’m back, which I hope to be, I want to spend more time outside of the large metropolises.</p>

<p>As I write this, and as I reread <a href="https://www.reuters.com/foreign-and-domestic-2023-in-review/#twenty-24">2023’s Year in Review</a>, I realize that I fell a little short this past year, to the extent that I didn’t do anything unequivocally “big, new and risky” in 2024 despite writing that I would do so; to the extent that I alluded to starting a company of my own but didn’t end up doing that.

<p>I imagine daily life will actually be less interesting, though. While I do not yet viscerally understand the day-to-day experience of my founder friends, they have given me a better sense of the immense responsibility inherent to the journey. People will rely on me to steward the creation of something valuable and hopefully important. If things go as well as planned, I will be responsible for making decisions that have ramifications beyond myself and my immediate circles. I will be responsible for any outcome that is not a massive success. It will be hard work, and in many cases, it will not be interesting. Concurrently, the opportunity cost of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/100-days-in-the-wild-pacific-crest-trail/">living in the wilderness for 100 days</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/foreign-and-domestic-2023-in-review/#august--september">spending two months in Argentina</a>, or even <a href="https://www.reuters.com/cycling-california-sf-la-sd/">taking a week off to bike from San Francisco to Los Angeles</a> will increase substantially; these “interesting” experiences will become substantially less accessible.</p>
<p>This is just one tradeoff of choosing this path. But over my last five-or-so-odd years in the space — having seen so many friends embark on their own founder journeys, and having <a href="https://www.reuters.com/startup-year-a-review-of-my-year-at-jupiter/">lived through the early days</a> of a few early-stage startups myself — I think by now I have the best understanding I’ll ever have of what I’ll be getting into short of actually doing it. And I think life will find a way to become interesting in other ways, too, that I don’t see or understand yet. I am excited to see how.</p>

<li id="fn-1">I found my sublet on the <a href="https://uclabackpackingclub.wixsite.com/tubc">UCLA Backpacking Club</a>’s Slack group as I was finishing up my fall study abroad.<span></span>I’d highly recommend joining if you’re at UCLA — in addition to the awesome weekend trips the group organizes, it’s one of the deepest and most liquid marketplaces I’ve found on campus (outside of Facebook).<a href="#fnref-1">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-2">I was never a huge decoration guy, given that I was very rarely staying in one place for more than a year.<span></span>“I’m moving out and I’ll have to take them down soon anyways” was always the thought.<a href="#fnref-2">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-3">This was actually my first genuine stay in Texas (ignoring layovers).<span></span>I liked Austin a lot: the weather was mild, the locals were friendly, and the barbecue was good. I worry about the temperatures in the summer, though.<a href="#fnref-3">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-4">Didn’t <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/22/treehacks-attendance-reaches-new-heights-on-back-of-ai-excitement/">take home any hardware</a> this time, but always great to catch up with friends in the Bay.<a href="#fnref-4">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-5">which — due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2024_California_atmospheric_rivers">atmospheric rivers we received in February</a> and the ensuing landslides — were <a href="https://abc7.com/topanga-canyon-boulevard-closure-frustration-among-residents-businesses/14653313/">partially closed to cars</a>, making for very enjoyable cycling<a href="#fnref-5">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-6">Although we weren’t able to ride the Big Sur coast due to landslides, the group hopes to return sometime in 2025 to close the gap.<a href="#fnref-6">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-7">Peaks and Professors, as its name suggests, is a club which organizes local hikes led by UCLA professors.<span></span>There are also chapters at other schools — I found about UCLA’s through my friend <a href="https://www.brooks.team/">Ben Brooks</a> who went to USC.<a href="#fnref-7">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-8">In fact, I made it all the way to San Ysidro. I was hoping to bike into Tijuana, but I’d unfortunately forgotten my passport.<a href="#fnref-8">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-9">As part of the class, we were told to watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/YY85VwSHFmA?t=118">Royal Shakespeare Company’s 2018 production</a> of Romeo and Juliet on YouTube.<span></span>I actually really enjoyed it — probably the first time I’ve ever actually enjoyed Shakespeare — although maybe it’s just that high school AP Lit isn’t as conducive to developing an appreciation for the classics vs. a very chill, spring quarter “Introduction to Acting” class comprised almost entirely of graduating seniors.<a href="#fnref-9">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-10">If I were to go back to school to do more math, I would probably take more probability.<a href="#fnref-10">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-11">Hanson let me borrow it while he was doing a summer internship in New York.<span></span>Thanks Hanson! Sorry for scuffing the rims!<a href="#fnref-11">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-12">My friend David was visiting from Alaska around this time, so instead of the 5, we took the 395 up and stopped midway, in the Sierra, to do some backpacking (and climb Mt. Whitney along the way).<span></span>It was my first time back on these trails since I was on the PCT in 2022, and it was as beautiful as I remembered.<a href="#fnref-12">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-13">In a similar way, great universities also attract ambitious people; and similar to the specific types of amibition in different cities, students’ ambitions are often specific to their chosen universities.<span></span>Concretely, while UCLA is undoubtedly an excellent school for those with ambitions in the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1braiu0/uc_berkeley_vs_ucla_premed/">life</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240625222516/https://www.aamc.org/media/9636/download?attachment">sciences</a>, I get the sense that many smart, ambitious people who are interested specifically in startups (and even computer science and technology more broadly) who are admitted to UCLA are also admitted to Berkeley, and many (reasonably) choose to go to Berkeley instead. With that in mind, while I met some ambitious (in my preferred sense of the word) people at UCLA, I feel a much stronger sense of community now, in San Francisco, where I’m clearly surrounded by other people seriously, credibly interested in startups and entrepreneurship.<span></span>Not that I was necessarily unaware of this before deciding which school to transfer to, but it’s something to consider if you’re a high school senior choosing between the two schools.<a href="#fnref-13">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-14">Despite spending twice as much time in Westwood vs. Ann Arbor, the majority of my friends are still Michigan-affiliated in one way or another. There’s truly no time <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/social-annealing">like freshman year</a>.<a href="#fnref-14">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-15">It’s a bit far from my office downtown, but if I wanted to settle down in San Francisco right now (and happened to have an extra <a href="https://www.redfin.com/CA/San-Francisco/428-Belvedere-St-94117/home/1826473">$3 million liquid</a> lying around somewhere), Cole Valley would be where I would buy.<a href="#fnref-15">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-16">I thought it’d be fun and that maybe I’d get some startup ideas out of it.<span></span>If you’re looking for a condo in downtown SF sometime next year, let me know.<a href="#fnref-16">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn-17">Flew the 747 from Asia back to JFK — my first time on a plane with more than one level.<span></span>Thank you to Elliot, Varun, and Pranav for the hospitality every time I decide to fly into NYC instead of PHL!<a href="#fnref-17">↩</a></li>
