But with few immediate levers for Mr Biden to pull, it&#39;s not clear the efforts are resonating. </p><p>His support has especially eroded among younger people - whose record turnout in 2020 helped put him in office. Voters in this demographic are least likely to own homes and most likely to see housing affordability as a top concern. </p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t see any platform that purposely looks out for somebody like first-time homebuyers, wanting to ease their pain,&#34; says Braiden Dogherty, a 30-year-old from Florida who works in manufacturing and has been checking for houses daily for three years. </p><p>Despite a $50,000 inheritance, no debt, and decent jobs, he and his wife can&#39;t find an affordable two-bedroom near their families in the Orlando area.  </p><p>He says the problem of housing costs is too big to blame on any one politician or party, but the seeming lack of solutions has contributed to his wider political disillusionment. He is uncertain how he will vote in November.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m fed up,&#34; he says. &#34;Housing is part of it.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The growing outcry has raised pressure on the US central bank to cut interest rates to bring relief, a move Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has said is likely at some point.</p><p>But expectations that a cut would happen early this year, helping to improve the country&#39;s mood, have been steadily pushed back. This reflects concerns that progress in lowering inflation - which was hovering at 3.4% in April, still well above the bank&#39;s 2% target - could be stalling.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Julia Mokhnatkiina (JM Photos Inc)</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Mimi Than and her husband are among those affected by the rise in interest rates this year</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Instead, since January mortgage rates have mostly moved higher. </p><p>Mimi Than, a 29-year-old who recently bought a three-bedroom condo in the Boston, Massachusetts area, says she is facing roughly $200 more in monthly costs than when she and her husband were pre-approved for a loan in March. </p><p>They did not lock in the rate then, unaware borrowing costs might shift significantly.
