<p>It’s a generally accepted truism that once you’ve acquired your first frequency
counter, you slowly get sucked into the Cult of the
<a href="http://www.leapsecond.com/time-nuts.htm">Time Nuts</a>
and their never ending quest for increasingly accurate time measurements.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/2023/06/16/Frequency-Counting-with-Linear-Regression.html">previous blog post</a>
about high precision frequency measurements, I mentioned the need for an accurate 
time reference. In addition to their own internal clock generator, test equipment such
as frequency counters, signal generators, spectrum analyzers etc. have an external 10MHz 
reference clock input so that all equipement in the lab can use the same time reference.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/external_ref_clock.jpg" alt="Racal Dana 1992 external reference clock input"/></p>

<p>Such a 10MHz clock be created by kinds of devices: I have a GTI300 frequency standard,
for example, and ultra-stable Rubidium atom clock modules can be found on eBay for less 
than $500, but ultimately you need to be calibrate such a standard against a golden 
reference.  For almost all hobbyists, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation">global navigation satellite system</a> 
(GNSS), in its various forms<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, is used as the golden reference.</p>

<p>In a satellite positioning system, each satellite has an atom clock that is
synchronized its own central golden reference on the ground. The satellites continously
transmit their time and location back to earth. A GPS receiver tries to capture the signal 
from as many satellites as possible, and figures out its location through 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration">trilateration</a>:
due to the speed of light, the received time stamps will be different for different
satellites.</p>

<p>But instead of using the satellites’ time stamps to derive a location, you can also just
use them as a very accurate time reference.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I’ll first discuss the principles of a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_disciplined_oscillator">GPS Disciplined Oscillator</a>
(GPSDO), and then I’ll tear down the TM4313, a $95 GPSDO that I got from eBay.</p>



<p>A GPSDO uses two time keeping mechanisms with complementary characteristics to 
create the best of both worlds: a reference clock that is accurate both in the short 
and the long term.</p>

<p>The time extracted from the GPS module is long term stable: it’s as accurate
as the GPS system itself. However the 1PPS signal often has a lot of jitter.
Cheap GPS modules typically have a jitter of tens of nanoseconds on them.</p>

<p>On a signal that pulses once every second, that means the 1PPS signal has short
term relative accuracy of around 10^-8. For a GPSDO, we’re looking for something
that’s around 10^-10!</p>

<p>The other time keeping mechanism is the oven controlled crystal oscillator or
OCXO. They consist of a crystal oscillator that is embedded inside an insulated
oven, with a control circuit to keep the inside of the oven at a constant
temperature to combat the temperature dependency of the oscillator frequency.</p>

<p>OCXO specifications vary a lot (and so does the cost!) but they tend to
have excellent short term jitter phase noise characteristics.  However, they are subject 
to various drift mechanism. There are some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>despite their built-in oven to keep the temperature stable, their output frequency 
still changes when the ambient temperature changes.</li>
  <li>new OCXO must run for about a month to get past there initial aging phase, during
which the output frequency can change significantly.</li>
  <li>once past the initial aging, OCXOs will still drift, though at a much lower rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>OCXOs have a tuning input to nudge the output frequency up and down by a tiny
fraction. It’s not uncommon for the total tuning range of a 10MHz OCXO to be less than 1Hz.</p>

<p>A GPSDO uses an OCXO to create a stable clock in the short term, while using the GPS
system to adjust the OCXO so that it also stays stable in the long term. Hence the
name GPS Disciplined Oscillator: the oscillator is kept in check by the GPS system.</p>



<p>I stumbled onto the TM4313 while searching for GPSDOs on eBay. I hadn’t seen the TM4313 before, 
and with a nice metal enclosure and one of the lowest GPSDO prices around, they seemed
attractive.</p>

<p>There is almost no information about the TM4313: when you google for just the “TM4313” terms,
there’s tons of GPSDO related results, but none of them actually discuss the TM4313, except
for this one in-depth report: 
<a href="https://reeve.com/Documents/Articles%20Papers/Reeve_GDOComp.pdf">Comparison of Inexpensive 10 MHz GNSS Disciplined Oscillators</a>.</p>

<p>It judged the TM4313 to a good-enough option, so I placed an order. Shipping time was supposed to 
be a few weeks, but it arrived only a few days later.</p>

<p>The non-descript box contained the following items:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_contents.jpg" alt="TM4313 contents"/></p>

<ul>
  <li>the GPSDO unit</li>
  <li>a GPS window antenna with a long cable</li>
  <li>a USB-A to micro-USB cable</li>
  <li>a 5V power brick</li>
</ul>

<p>The unit itself has a good looking aluminum enclosure with front and
back plate that are aluminum as well.</p>

<p>The front plate has 4 blue LEDs for power status, time tracking status,
GPS lock, and serial communication status.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_front.jpg" alt="TM4313 Front"/></p>

<p>There’s a micro-USB port to connect the GPSDO to a PC and extract time information and
a socket for a 5V power plug. I would have prefered the power plug to be in the back but
there wasn’t any room left there.</p>

<p>The back plate has 3 SMA connectors: the GPS antenna input, a 10MHz reference clock
outputs, and a 1-pulse-per-second (1PPS) output.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_back.jpg" alt="TM4313 Back"/></p>

<p>The 10MHz reference output of a GPSDO is either a sine wave or a digital square wave.
The benefit of a sine wave is the lack of strong harmonics in the signal. The TM4313
doesn’t come with a specification sheet or manual, and there is no mention anywhere
about the type of output. When put on a scope, I can see 10MHz sinewave with an
amplitude of +-1.1V into a 50 Ohm termination resistor.</p>

<p>The 1PPS output is a 5V TTL signal with 100ms on and 900ms off time.</p>

<p>On my oscilloscope, there was no obvious jitter between the 10MHz reference clock and
the 1PPS output.</p>



<p>Immediately after powering up, an OCXO needs to warm up its oven. This can take minutes
on large OCXOs with a high thermal capacity, but it’s very fast on the TM4313: it consumes
5.6W for about one minute after which power drops down to around 2.2W.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_startup_power.jpg" alt="TM4313 startup power"/></p>

<p>It can take hours for a GPSDO to reach their true stable state, so it’s common
for them to be stuck in a closet and powered on all the time. It’s important to keep the
power consumption to an minimum.</p>



<p>Opening the TM4313 is a simple matter of removing 2 Torx T6 screws from the front panel and 
sliding out the PCB.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_PCB_with_OCXO.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_PCB_with_OCXO.jpg" alt="TM4313 PCB with OCXO"/></a>
<em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Here are the main components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an HBFEC OC5SC25 OXCO</p>

    <p>This seems to be a clone of a CTi OC5SC25, which can be found for just a few dollars
  on eBay or AliExpress. Tony Albus has the <a href="https://www.tonyplaza.nl/download/YT079/CTi_OSC5A2B02-CTi_OC5SC25.pdf">following specification sheet</a>
  about it:</p>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/CTI_OCXO_specs.png" alt="CSI OCXO specs"/></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an unmarked ATGM332D-5N-31 GPS module</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an NXP LPC1752 microcontroller (<a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LPC1759_58_56_54_52_51.pdf">datasheet</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an FTDI232RL USB-to-serial converter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>power regulators and some jelly-bean ICs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is that all there is? No!</p>

<p>The OCXO is not soldered flush against the PCB, but floats a few mm above it.
And there’s bunch of components soldered in between them:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_stuff_underneath_OCXO.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_stuff_underneath_OCXO.jpg" alt="TM4313 with stuff underneath the OCXO"/></a>
<em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>It’s common practice to leave a gap between an OCXO and the PCB to prevent the PCB from
acting as a heat sink. Many OCXOs have small glass-like spacers to enforce such
a gap. But it’s unusual to see additional components squeezed in between.</p>

<p>The urge to know what was below was too strong, so I desoldered the OCXO. This is the
result:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_unannotated.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_unannotated.jpg" alt="TM4313 PCB unannotated"/></a>
<em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Underneath the OCXO sits MAX6192A voltage reference 
(<a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/max6190-max6198.pdf">datasheet</a>)
and another jelly-bean IC.</p>

<p>Let’s dive deeper and figure out how it works.</p>



<p>Here’s the PCB again, but now fully annotated:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_annotated_small.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_annotated_small.jpg" alt="TM4313 PCB annotated"/></a>
<em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>From this, we can recover a block diagram that is quite traditional
for a GPSDO:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_schematic.svg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_schematic.svg" alt="TM4313 block diagram"/></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The OCXO generates a 5V 10MHz square wave signal.</li>
  <li>One branch buffers the signal with an inverter and then sends it through
an L/C filter to create a 10MHz sine wave output.</li>
  <li>The other branch buffers the 10MHz signal as well and sends it to the microcontroller.</li>
  <li>The GPS unit creates a 1PPS signal that also goes to the microcontroller</li>
  <li>The microcontroller does its magic and generates an OCXO tuning value. It uses
pulse width modulation an R/C filter, and an opamp to create a slow but 
precise discrete D/A converter (DAC).</li>
  <li>The DAC output goes to the OCXO tuning input and the loop is closed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside the main loop, there’s also the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An FTDI FT232RL USB-serial converter can either be connected to the
GPS module, that’s the default, to send standard 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183">NMEA codes</a> 
for further processing by a PC, or it can connect to the serial port of the
microcontroller.</li>
  <li>There’s a discrete 5V regulator that uses a MAX6192 voltage reference,
another OPA340 opamp, and a transistor.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are 2 ways to create GPSDO: with a frequency lock loop (FLL) or a phase
locked loop (PLL).</p>

<p><strong>Frequency Locked Loop</strong></p>

<p>In a frequency locked loop, a controller measures the frequency of a generated
signal against a reference signal, and adjust the generated signal when the value is off.</p>

<p>FLLs are easier to design, but they react slower when the generated frequency
gets off the mark (e.g. due to external temperature changes.) That’s because it’s
possible for the phase of the 2 signals to be off, but not sufficiently so that
there’s a difference in measured frequency.</p>

<p><strong>Phase Locked Loop</strong></p>

<p>In a phase locked loop, the phase between 2 signals is measured and the frequency
is adjusted to keep the phase in check. A PLL will react faster to a deviation
in frequency, but they are often harder to control and keep stable.</p>

<p>A PLL controlled GPSDO needs a phase detector between the generated and the
reference signal. This almost always happens in the analog domain, with a capacitor
that gets charged more or less depending on the phase difference, and an A/D
converter (ADC) to read out the value.</p>

<p>There is no such phase detector or ADC on this PCB, so it’s a good guess to assume
that the TM4313 uses frequency locked loop.</p>



<p>I ran a quick test to check the startup behavior of the TM4313. I taped
a thermocouple to the top of the OCXO, put the PCB back in the enclosure, 
and let it go through the motions after power up the device.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_with_thermocouple.jpg" alt="TM4313 with thermocouple"/></p>

<p>The temperature in my lab was a constant 23.3C.</p>

<p>The GNSS lock time depends heavily on the position of the antenna. This time,
it locked very fast, just 23 seconds, but I’ve seen it take minutes with the
antenna in the same exact position.</p>

<p>We already know that the OCXO heater goes full blast only during the first
minute. The steep part of the OCXO warming-up curve takes longer,  about 2 minutes. 
It takes time for the heat inside the oven to warm up the outside shell.
Things then slow down significantly. It takes another 3 minutes for the
FLL to lock and the GPSDO to track the GPS signal.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_with_thermometer.jpg" alt="TM4313 with thermometer"/></p>

<p>After that, the temperature continues to creep up. It take another
hour before the temperature stablizes at around 50.4C. By then, the
outside temperature had also increase to 23.6C. When I moved that
thermocouple away from the GPSDO, the temperature dropped back down
to 23.3C. I guess it was just sitting to close the GPSDO.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a MAX6192 voltage reference that’s
squeezed between the PCB and the OXCO (without touching it!)</p>

<p>Why is it located there? I think it’s because the output of a voltage 
reference has still some amount of temperature dependency.
In this case, it’s around 5ppm/C.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/MAX6192_spec.png" alt="MAX6192 spec"/></p>

<p>Since the OCXO has temperature controlled oven, the location underneath
is the one with the most predictable, constant temperature.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t answer a more important question: why is there a voltage
reference to begin with?</p>

<p>It’s essential to have a voltage reference in a stand-alone non-GPS controlled
OCXO, because there’s no feedback mechanism to keep the output frequency in
check when outside conditions change. But that’s not the case here. There are
tons of GPSDO designs out there, built by hobbyists but with better specifications, 
yet none of them have a voltage reference.</p>

<p>The voltage reference in the TM4313 is used to create the stable 5V 
power supply that is used to power the heater inside the OCXO and the DAC
opamp. I don’t have the specifications of the OC5SC25, but for most OCXOs, the sensitivy
of the output frequency to the power supply is very low.</p>

<p>It’s surprising that one of the lowest cost commercial GPSDOs out there has
an expensive component<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> that isn’t really needed.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the microcontroller has a 10-bit DAC, the TM4313 uses pin 
P1[25] of the LPC1752 to construct a discrete DAC and control the tuning input
of the OCXO. There’s a good reason for this: 10-bit is just not enough to resolution
to create a tuning voltage with microvolt precision.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/PWM_pin.png" alt="PWM pin"/></p>

<p>It’s no coincidence that this pin has PWM functionality. I couldn’t find the number
of bits of the PWM controller, but even if that is also only 10-bits, you can
increase the precision by dithering between different values and low pass filtering
the result. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Using PWM to create a OCXO tuning voltage is a standard
technique.</p>

<p>At the output of the DAC is a 5-stage low-pass R/C network that consists of a ladder of 4 33k 
resistors with 5 2.5uF capacitors shunted to ground in between. That should be
sufficient to kill dead the ripple on a dithered PWM signal. An OPA340 opamp buffers the
analog signal before it’s sent into the OCXO.</p>

<p>Like the voltage reference, the R/C filter and the opamp are located underneath the
OCXO.</p>



<p>Immediately after plugging in the main power, the GPS module dumps the following

<ul>
  <li>ATGM332D is the name of the GPS module. It’s
<a href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Satellite-Positioning-Modules_ZHONGKEWEI-ATGM332D-5N31_C128659.html">available on LCSC for just $2.99</a>
if you buy just one.</li>
  <li>The module is based on an <a href="https://www.icofchina.com/d/file/xiazai/2016-12-05/b1be6f481cdf9d773b963ab30a2d11d8.pdf">AT6558-5N-31 GNSS SOC</a>
from Hangzhou ZhongKe Microelectronics.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 5N-31 version of the SOC only supports GPS and BDS, no GLONASS or Galileo.</p>



<p>There are 2 devices with a UART on the TM4313 PC: the GPS module, which sends
out standard NMEA messages, and the LPC1752 controller.</p>

<p>By default, the GPS is connected to the FTDI USB to serial port converter.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_gps_serial.jpg" alt="TM4313 GPS serial"/></p>

<p>It’s not 
documented anywhere (there’s no documentation at all), but you can use jumpers to 
connect the LPC1752 to the FTDI chip instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tm4313/TM4313_uc_serial.jpg" alt="TM4313 uC serial"/></p>

<p>The GPS UART runs with 9600N1 and the LPC1752 with 115200N1 parameter. When I connect
the TM4313 to my Linux PC with the USB cable, it shows up as a <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> device.</p>

<p>For most use cases, the NMEA data is more useful than the GPSDO internal state, but if
you ever need to know whether or not the GPSDO tracking algorithm has locked the
OCXO to the GPS unit, or whether the tracking is in coarse or fine mode, the information is 
there.</p>

<p>After moving the 2 jumpers and powering up the device, you’ll see the following:</p>

<p>TURN Dynamic Systems is the creator of the TM4313. They also show up at the creator
of the FSA3011 frequency stability analyzer.</p>

<p>After some miscellaneous information, you get a bunch of columns with the internal 
state of the GPSDO machine. Here’s what I think it all means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ph: phase difference?</p>

    <p>Once the GPSDO is locked, Ph typically only sees the numbers -1, 0, and 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>D: ?</p>

    <p>I think this number is related to the tuning value that is sent to the
  OCXO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GL: GPS Loss?</p>

    <p>This value is 1 when the GNSS LED is off. Once the GNSS signals have been acquired,
  the LED goes on and GL becomes 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LOS: LOck State?</p>

    <p>This number goes from 0 to 3 while progressing through different phases of the
  GPSDO finite state machine (FSM).</p>

    <p>0: power up state.</p>

    <p>1: the FSM is some tracking state where it starts to lock the OCXO onto the
     1PSS signal. It stays there until an ‘STB’ number converges to 0.</p>

    <p>2: the FSM is in another tracking state. It stays there until a value <code>cK</code> shows
     up as being very small.</p>

    <p>3: Tracking state. The OCXO is locked onto the 1PPS signal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ST: State Time?</p>

    <p>This number counts the number seconds the FSM has been in the current LOS state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AF: Adjustment something?</p>

    <p>A parameter that indicates whether or not the GPSDO tracking algorithm is in a coarse
  or fine tracking state. Initially, it has a number of 19 and the value of <code>D</code> jumps
  around quite a bit. After while, this number jumps to 73 and <code>D</code> value changes are more
  subtle.</p>

    <p>When you tap onto the OCXO while it’s in the 73 state, it will immediately jump back to 19.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RT: Run Time</p>

    <p>Starts at 0 at power up. Increases continuously every second.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of the GPSDO going through different states:</p>

<p><strong>Power On</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code>Ph =    0, D =  548850, GL = 1, LOS = 0, ST =      0, AF =  19, RT = 1

<p><strong>GPS Lock</strong></p>

<p>The GNSS LED goes on. GL goes low. Notice how the Ph value starts changing right away.</p>

<p><strong>LOS changes from 1 to 2</strong></p>

<p>Initally during state 1, the same columns are sent to the UART, but at the
end, an additional STB field is added that converges to 0. Once it’s below
a certain threshold, the GPSDO switches to state 2.</p>

<p><strong>LOS changes from 2 to 3, Track LED goes on</strong></p>

<p>Close to the end of state 2, a single ‘cK’ field is printed out with some low number. Once
this happens, the FSM soon switches to state 3 and the Track LED switches on. At that point, 
the Ph value starts fluctuating between values that are usuall -1, 0, and 1.</p>

<p>The <code>D</code> values start changing with each tick, but the difference between consecutive
numbers is quite high, usually between 10 and 15.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of a GPSDO its performance: how stable is the output frequency.</p>

<p>I currently don’t have the setup and expertise yet to evaluate that. For that, I’ll
just refer to the earlier mentioned report: 
<a href="https://reeve.com/Documents/Articles%20Papers/Reeve_GDOComp.pdf">Comparison of Inexpensive 10 MHz GNSS Disciplined Oscillators</a>.</p>



<p>Building your own GPSDO is a bit of rite of passage for many hobbyists, and
something I’ve been researching for quite a bit. But with commercial
GPSDOs being available for less than $100, it’s tempting to just buy one.</p>

<p>For now, the TM4313 seems good enough to a reference clock for my frequency counters,
spectrum analyzer, and signal generators, or to calibrate the OCXOs that are
living inside them.</p>

<p>Its design is also simple enough for a beginner to get a decent understanding.</p>

<p>For now, my desire to get improve the accuracy of my measurements has been met,
but we’ll see how long it takes before I want it to the next level.</p>
