          <p>Starting a new car company isn&#39;t easy—just ask Henrik Fisker, whose <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/fisker-debuts-an-entire-range-of-new-evs-including-one-sub-30000/">second bite</a> at that particular cherry ended the same way as his first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/ev-firm-fisker-files-for-bankruptcy-months-after-it-stopped-making-the-ocean/">when it filed for bankruptcy</a> this July. At the time, Fisker said it wanted to try to &#34;preserve certain customer programs,&#34; but Ars wondered what this actually meant, particularly now that electric vehicles are so dependent on software support and cloud connectivity. Now, thanks to <a href="https://www.veritaglobal.net/fisker/document/2411390241007000000000012">a recent court filing</a> spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/08/fisker-bankruptcy-hits-major-speed-bump-as-fleet-sale-is-now-in-question/">TechCrunch</a>, we know the answer: nothing good.</p>
<p>Car publications <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/do-not-buy-a-new-fisker-ocean.html">were already warning consumers</a> to steer clear of the Ocean as early as this March, despite massive price cuts that saw these electric SUVs being offered for less than $25,000. A New York-based company called American Lease was less deterred by this warning and in June agreed to purchase the remaining Fisker inventory—approximately 3,300 cars for a total of $46.3 million dollars. By October, American Lease had paid Fisker $42.5 million and had taken delivery of about 1,100 Oceans.</p>
<p>That was the plan until the end of last week, at least. Last Friday evening, Fisker informed American Lease that the Oceans &#34;cannot, as a technical matter, be &#39;ported&#39; from the Fisker server to which the vehicles are currently linked to a distinct server owned and/or controlled by&#34; American Lease.</p>
