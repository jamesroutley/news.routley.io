		<p>On 2022-04-07 I moved all my Emacs projects from GitLab to SourceHut:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-07-all-emacs-projects-sourcehut/</a>.
I am now undoing that decision. My code is on GitLab and GitHub, with
the latter as the de facto primary source.</p>

<p>Why the change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SourceHut web interface does not show any kind of indication
that a message has an attachment. Last time I tried it, I had to
download an mbox file and extract the patch from there. This was
helped by the fact that I knew what I was searching for, but the
experience was not pleasant anyway.</li>
  <li>Many users are reluctant to subscribe to my project‚Äôs mailing list
and instead email me directly. This is fine, as I do get the work
done eventually, but it beats the point of having a public inbox if
I am the only one who reads those messages anyway.</li>
  <li>Personal emails for package maintenance make it more difficult for
me to apply filters. I cannot easily go from ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù to
‚Äúpackages‚Äù and thus have trouble prioritising tasks.</li>
  <li>Users replying to mailing list threads frequently do not ‚Äúreply to
all‚Äù, so the filter I have for SourceHut lists does not apply and my
inbox is noisy again.</li>
  <li>Coordinating work between my ‚Äúofficial‚Äù SourceHut-based repository
and the de facto GitHub one is a problem, because a user on one may
not be aware of what a user on the other is doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other papercuts as well, but I understand SourceHut is still
in ‚Äúalpha‚Äù, so I will not list them here.</p>

<h2>What happens to the Git repositories on SourceHut?</h2>

<p>I am no longer updating them and plan to delete them in the near
future.</p>

<h2>What about the mailing lists?</h2>

<p>I will continue to reply to messages sent there, but I will eventually
ask people to use other media. If you do not want to use a Git forge
to report an issue or send a patch, then do it via my personal email:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">https://protesilaos.com/contact</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you host your own Git server?</h2>

<p>I want to do this at some point because I am mindful of the issues
with proprietary Git forges. But this is a task that requires
knowledge and resources. So it will not happen soon.</p>
