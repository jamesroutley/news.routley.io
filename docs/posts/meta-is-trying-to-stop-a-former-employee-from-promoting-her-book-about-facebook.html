    <h1>Meta is trying to stop a former employee from promoting her book about Facebook</h1>

In a decision, the arbitrator said that she should immediately stop making disparaging comments about Meta and stop “further publishing or distributing” the book. It’s unclear what exactly this means for the book, which is already on sale. The publisher, Flatiron Books, which was also named in Meta’s complaint, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>“This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in <a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.threads.net/@andymstone/post/DHHWKxixxS5?xmt=AQGzgrURF2tV9n94alup_eObLD_fRFh51WTKiPQaiWJeCA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a statement;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><ins>a statement</ins></a>. “This urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry’s standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years.”</p></div></div>
