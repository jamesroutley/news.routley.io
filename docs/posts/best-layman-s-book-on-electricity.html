    <h1>Ask HN: Best Layman&#39;s Book on Electricity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m looking for a book that will explain how electricity and electronics work to a level that will be useful day to day. Concepts like how the grid works, how electricity does work, what different electrical components do and how they do them.</p><p>Something not requiring multivariable calculus.</p><p>I recently read &#34;Immune!&#34; by Phillip Detmer about the human immune system. Is there anything at a similar level to that that you would recommend?</p></div></div></div>
