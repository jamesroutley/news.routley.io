    <h1>4) Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I took up Russell’s generous offer to provide me with a mock interview for <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/">this leetcode problem<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>. Because Russ had instructed me to just find a problem I hadn’t done before and to not look at it, I didn’t realize that this problem worked with linked lists. I had read about linked lists, but never used one, so I ended up having to figure that out during the interview.</p>
<p>This was what the failing code looked like at that point:</p>

<p>^ This was after 45 minutes, the allotted time for the interview. Russ invited me to keep going and see this process to it’s end.</p>
<p>Russ was the one to realize my mistake. If you look, you can see that in the base cases* (a term I learned today) of the iterateNodes function, I am accidentally returning <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code>, not <code>list1Pointer</code> and <code>list2Pointer</code>.</p>
<p>I could have avoided this mistake by declaring my recursive function outside of the main function, or even by simply doing everything in one function. I do stand by my call of writing a second function however, as it was easier for me to reason about recursion that way.</p>

<p>It took us another 10 minutes to take this function to fruition. Afterwards, I went back over it and cleaned it up to demonstrate to myself that a second function wasn’t necessary:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am proud of how well I was able to figure out how to use linked lists under pressure</li>
<li>I am satisfied with my process of levelly walking back through my code with actual values when I did run into a bug</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>~~Don’t declare functions inside other functions. Not only does it allow for variable collisions like the one above - it’s also less performant <del>and readable</del>
<ul>
<li>Be careful when declaring functions inside of other functions, a construction also called a “closure”. These certainly can be stumbled upon, but can be very useful as well. For example: <a href="https://elijer.github.io/garden/devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/7)-Depth-First-Search" data-slug="devnotes/LeetCode-Journal/7)-Depth-First-Search">7) Depth First Search</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In JavaScript especially, scan for variable name conflicts as a first step when addressing bugs</li>
<li>Avoid the blanket anxiety that there is something fundamentally wrong with an implementation - even if there is, there is a specific bug that causes it. Look for those, and permit those bugs to be trivial</li>
</ul>
<blockquote data-callout="lived" data-callout-metadata=" Interview Experience">

<p>The last point continues to track! I just had an interview with Figma and although my general implementation was spot on, there was a single detail in my way from solving my interview problem. As my hail mary in the last three minutes, I decided to modify my implementation, further showing that under pressure I tend to doubt, myself. But once again - the implementation was generally good. I could have benefited more from calmly reviewing my code than by supposing a major anti-pattern.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>If an interview is asking questions during the whiteboard or implementation phase, they are probably trying to tell you something</li>
<li>Ask for examples to run in your code - they may tell you something about the cases you need to worry about most</li>
<li>Listen carefully to the interviewer - it is psychologically difficult <em>not</em> to help people when you know the answer, and they may slip up and give you major hints. At the very least, it is easy to slip into a more collaborative mode, and you can certainly use a collaborator</li>
<li>Don’t panic</li>
<li><em>Do</em> ask very basic questions about the problem</li>
<li>Talk through your process, and if you get lost, start from first principles, not some grand idea of what you “should” do</li>
<li>Write Psuedocode - it can be turned into real code</li>
<li>Write real code whenever possible, and if you aren’t sure it’s ready, just comment it - this will save time later</li>
</ul>
<blockquote data-callout="lived" data-callout-metadata=" Interview Experience">

<p>On the the subject of listener carefully to an interviewer, I had the advantage here of being in the same room as them. However, online, using a multiscreen setup, you may be looking at another screen much of the time instead of the interview. At this time, I believe this is a mistake - there is a lot of information conveyed by their faces, gestures, and mannerisms. I believe that keeing a videocall window next to the IDE as much as possible is valuable.</p>

<p>*<strong>Base Case</strong>
the part of a recursive function that is not recursive. In this example, conditionals that set out “current” linked list</p>

<ul>
<li>handles, symlinks, references, pointers - how are these things different? Relevant to the way <code>javascript</code> works here in lines <code>5</code> and <code>6</code> of the function we defined. We set current to <code>list2</code>, and then we <em>change</em> list 2. I had a nightmare moment where I though, <em>wait</em> we’re changing what <code>list2</code> means and <code>current</code> references <code>list2</code>, aren’t we also changing current?? But no, in javascript, setting <code>current</code> to <code>list2</code> doesn’t point <code>current</code> to the reference <code>list2</code> itself, but the base object that <code>list2</code> refers to in memory, so we’re safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I’d still like to understand this better. Are there situations in javascript where we <em>are</em> chaining our references, and if the address one reference points to changes, then the ones downstream do too?</p>

<p>Okay I’ve gotten around to refreshing how values are referenced in JS, depending on variable type!</p>
<p>In JavaScript, simple values like strings and numbers aren’t <em>references</em>. That is to say, if <code>var1</code> and <code>var2</code> are both strings and <code>var2</code> is set to the value of <code>var1</code>, you can do whatever you want to <code>var1</code> and <code>var2</code> will stay the same.</p>
<p>But other data structures in JavaScript, like arrays and Lists, <em>are</em> references rather than the value of those references themselves. So if <code>var2</code> is set to the value of <code>var1</code> and these things are arrays or objects, a change to <code>var1</code> <em>will</em> affect what <code>var2</code> evaluates to.</p>
<p>Here’s that behavior in simple variables:
<img src="https://elijer.github.io/garden/media_sync/2024/11/26/093438/04728.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>But when we are working with <em>arrays</em> and <em>objects</em>, that behavior is different.</p>
<p><img src="https://elijer.github.io/garden/media_sync/2024/11/26/093438/74694.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>If we <em>don’t</em> want this behavior, we can use the spread operator:</p>
<p><img src="https://elijer.github.io/garden/media_sync/2024/11/26/093438/05800.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p>If I understand this correct, what we are doing here is getting the value of zuko at that time, similar to what we did with the <code>string</code> and <code>number</code> data types, and we are creating a whole new <code>array</code> or <code>object</code> with the value we receive. Our data structure is still a reference to a value that can change, but it’s now a new data structure with no relation to the original.</p>
<p>Like prince Zuko himself, you have to understand how you are referencing memory (addresses) of the past in order to evaluate the present.</p>
