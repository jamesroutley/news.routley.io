<p>&lt;<b>Cadey</b>&gt; Note for the readers, I usually try to do one post per week. This is not that
post this week. I am just frustrated by being used as a human subject in a
Princeton study without my consent. If you are ever in a position to be doing
this kind of survey, please don&#39;t send legal threats around
recklessly.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a response to <a href="https://blog.freeradical.zone/post/ccpa-scam-2021-12/">CCPA Scam November
2021</a> from the
<a href="https://blog.freeradical.zone/">freeradical.zone</a> blog. On or about 2021-12-11
11:29 PM I got an email from <a href="https://christine.website/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#660b071f070b0f150e0f080726080910071209140b070f0a481413">Maya Mishina</a>
with the following contents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>My name is Maya Mishina, and I am a resident of Novosibirsk, Russia. I have a
few questions about your process for responding to California Consumer Privacy
Act (CCPA) data access requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would you process a CCPA data access request from me even though I am not a
resident of California?</li>
<li>Do you process CCPA data access requests via email, a website, or
telephone? If via a website, what is the URL I should go to?</li>
<li>What personal information do I have to submit for you to verify and process
a CCPA data access request?</li>
<li>What information do you provide in response to a CCPA data access request?</li>
</ol>
<p>To be clear, I am not submitting a data access request at this time. My
questions are about your process for when I do submit a request.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your answers to these questions. If there is a better
contact for processing CCPA requests regarding christine.website, I kindly ask
that you forward my request to them.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of
this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Maya Mishina</p>

<p>This scared the shit out of me. My blog is a passion project that I do as a way
to get better at writing. I almost contacted a lawyer. This should probably have
stood out as suspect to me, however I am a believer that people have a right to
privacy and that they should be able to be forgotten.</p>
<p>I go out of my way to ensure that this website handles as little user data as
possible. I have gone so far to do this that the only unique identifiers I deal
with are IP addresses, but even then only a tiny fraction of those IP addresses
even get to my server because I use Cloudflare for caching. I probably need to
set up some kind of proper log rotation in my server, but right now there are
only three things collected by my site:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are a patron to my site, your name shows up on <a href="https://christine.website/patrons">/patrons</a>.
This queries the Patreon API to get the display name that you configured in
your account and is refreshed every time the site restarts.</li>
<li>If you send me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention">Webmention</a>, they
will be shown on the footer of the website. They are stored in a SQLite
database on the same server. I can remove entries from that table upon
request.</li>
<li>Your IP address is recorded in <code>/var/log/nginx/xesite.access.log</code> in common
log format on my server which is located in the Netherlands. Here is an
example of what this looks like:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>
<span>127.0.0.1 - - [18/Dec/2021:04:04:57 +0000] &#34;GET /security.txt HTTP/1.1&#34; 404 2110 &#34;-&#34; &#34;Go-http-client/2.0&#34;
</span>
</code></pre>
<p>No other data is stored. Any intermediate things in the system journal disappear
after an hour or two because my journal is limited to 512 MB and my services are
chatty.</p>
<p>Here is what the application logged for that request:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>Dec 18 04:04:57 lufta xesite-start[2121878]: 2021-12-18T04:04:57.585717Z  INFO xesite/2.3.0: - &#34;GET /security.txt HTTP/1.1&#34; 404 &#34;-&#34; &#34;Go-http-client/2.0&#34; 12.474µs
</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It is literally the bare minimum that I can get away with.</p>

<p>&lt;<b>Cadey</b>&gt; Wanna know why there&#39;s no comments on this blog? I don&#39;t want to have to deal
with storing user data and doing moderation!</p>
</div>

<p>I probably should have consulted a lawyer before drafting this, but here is what
I replied with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<ol>
<li>I can process a CCPA data access request even for people that are not
residents of California.</li>
<li>My website does not collect personal information, but emailing either
<a href="https://christine.website/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#563b3316353e243f25223f383378213334253f2233"><span data-cfemail="ec8189ac8f849e859f98858289c29b898e9f859889">[email protected]</span></a> or <a href="https://christine.website/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7505071c0314160c350d10061007035b0006"><span data-cfemail="dfafadb6a9bebca69fa7baacbaada9f1aaac">[email protected]</span></a> would be the correct action.</li>
<li>My website does not collect personal information, including IP
addresses. I keep track of hit counts via CloudFlare analytics, but as
far as I know there is no way for me to collect information about a
single subject (all I see is aggregate anonymized data). I guess if you
give me a public IP address I can dig through the system logs to see if
anything pops up.
4. I would provide relevant request logs provided they exist. That is
the only information that I could provide and I would be willing to
provide it in the industry standard plaintext log format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please keep in mind this is a blog run by a single person as a passion
project to get better at writing. As it is not a corporate endeavor, I
don&#39;t believe that I need to provide this information at all. However I
am willing to search the logs folder to see if anything is there.</p>
<p>Please let me know which IP addresses to look up and I will do my best
to get you that information as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks and be well,</p>
<p>Xe</p>

<p>I should have expected this to be a human research study after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410164/linux-kernel-university-of-minnesota-banned-open-source">University
of Minnesota
disaster</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, I am disappointed in this. I want to have a positive outlook on
humanity. I want to be able to trust that requests to be forgotten are
legitimate. I am going to have a harder time doing that now.</p>
<p>In case you actually do want to make a GDPR/CCPA request, here is the process
and the rough steps I will take:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will need your Twitter username and any links listed on the Webmentions
section of any article on my blog if you want those removed. I will require
you to either tweet a magic phrase and email me a link to it, a DNS TXT
record on the domain or for you to upload an arbitrary string to a path on
your server. These processes will help me confirm that you are the person who
wants the information. Send me an email to <code><a href="https://christine.website/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="1f6f6d76697e7c665f677a6c7a6d69316a6c">[email protected]</a></code>. If you want
access logs deleted, please let me know what IP addresses to delete and I
will see what I can do.</li>
<li>I will prepare a <code>.zip</code> file that will contain the following:
<ul>
<li>The email conversation in the industry-standard <code>.eml</code> format.</li>
<li>Any SQLite rows from my Webmention service in <code>.csv</code> format.</li>
<li>Any request logs from nginx in <code>.log</code> format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This may take up to a week or two. I am only one person and I have a job.
This blog is not my primary source of income.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not have to offer this service. I am not a business. I am a single person
that wants to get better at writing. Please do not include wording that gives me
the impression that you are making a legal threat. I know you are allowed to,
but it scares the shit out of me when you do that and will make me put your
request at the end of the list.</p>
<p>tl;dr: I got phished by trying to be a good netizen. Don&#39;t fall for <a href="https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu/">this
scam</a>.</p>
