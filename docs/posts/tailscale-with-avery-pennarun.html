    <h1>Tailscale with Avery Pennarun</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span data-timestamp="118"><strong>Marc Campbell: </strong>Hi, and welcome to another episode of the podcast.</span> <span data-timestamp="120">Today we have Avery Pennarun, founder of Tailscale here.</span> <span data-timestamp="123">Hey, welcome, Avery.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="124"><strong>Avery Pennarun: </strong>Hi there, thanks for having me.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="126"><strong>Marc: </strong>And of course Benjie is here.</span> <span data-timestamp="127">Benjie, how are you?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="128"><strong>Benjie De Groot: </strong>I&#39;m good. How are you, Marc?</span> <span data-timestamp="129">We&#39;ve been off for a little while, but I&#39;m</span> <span data-timestamp="133">really excited to have Avery and Tailscale on.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="135"><strong>Marc: </strong>Yeah, me too. Let&#39;s just dive right in here.</span> <span data-timestamp="137">Avery, we&#39;d love just to start by giving you an opportunity</span> <span data-timestamp="141">to share your story and understand your background a little bit with</span> <span data-timestamp="144">us. Do you mind doing that?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="146"><strong>Avery: </strong>Sure. I&#39;ll try to keep it super short, I guess.</span> <span data-timestamp="149">I started my first startup when I was in university, it was a company called Net</span> <span data-timestamp="152">Integration Technologies.</span> <span data-timestamp="154">We made Linux based appliances for small business,</span> <span data-timestamp="157">and that went reasonably well.</span> <span data-timestamp="159">We ended up selling out to IBM in 2008.</span> <span data-timestamp="162">I did some banking software for a little while after that, then I went</span> <span data-timestamp="165">to Google where I worked on Google Wallet and then</span> <span data-timestamp="169">Google Fiber, and ended up in charge of the Google</span> <span data-timestamp="172">Fiber Wi-Fi routers.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="174">Some of the technology for which is still in Google, not Google Fiber</span> <span data-timestamp="177">routers, today.</span> <span data-timestamp="180">When I left Google I decided, &#34;Okay, that was enough big company for</span> <span data-timestamp="183">me. I think it&#39;s time to do some kind of startup,&#34; and I wasn&#39;t totally sure what I</span> <span data-timestamp="187">wanted to do. But that was 2019 or so, I thought I</span> <span data-timestamp="190">would take two months off, ended up taking six months off to recover from</span> <span data-timestamp="193">the big company world, and then started Tailscale.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="197"><strong>Marc: </strong>Great. Let&#39;s just dive into Tailscale for a minute</span> <span data-timestamp="200">here. What is Tailscale?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="203"><strong>Avery: </strong>That is one of the hardest questions for people to answer.</span> <span data-timestamp="205">We still actually don&#39;t have the world&#39;s greatest answer.</span> <span data-timestamp="208">There&#39;s a few different versions.</span> <span data-timestamp="209">One of them is that it&#39;s a VPN, some of our customers have described it</span> <span data-timestamp="213">back to us as like, &#34;Well, look, I know it&#39;s not good to be a VPN,</span> <span data-timestamp="216">everyone has negative feelings about VPNs, but imagine the best</span> <span data-timestamp="219">VPN you&#39;ve ever used, the one that totally changes the way you think about the</span> <span data-timestamp="222">internet.&#34;</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="222">That&#39;s how I like to think of Tailscale,</span> <span data-timestamp="226">but the technical definition is that it is a</span> <span data-timestamp="229">mesh overlay network.</span> <span data-timestamp="231">So instead of connecting you to a single</span> <span data-timestamp="234">point as your VPN, that&#39;s a single point of failure, it actually</span> <span data-timestamp="238">allows you to connect to every computer that you might want to connect to</span> <span data-timestamp="241">directly, regardless of firewalls that might be in</span> <span data-timestamp="244">between.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="244">So it sort of turns a bunch of devices that are</span> <span data-timestamp="247">scattered around the internet into a virtual</span> <span data-timestamp="251">LAN that you don&#39;t have to think about encryption and routing</span> <span data-timestamp="254">and firewalls, and that kind of thing.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="256"><strong>Benjie: </strong>One thing that I hear a lot is the comparisons</span> <span data-timestamp="260">to WireGuard. Can you give us just a quick overview on how,</span> <span data-timestamp="265">if I&#39;m coming at this with a WireGuard understanding, how is</span> <span data-timestamp="268">Tailscale similar?</span> <span data-timestamp="269">How is Tailscale different?</span> <span data-timestamp="271">What do you think about that?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="273"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. So Tailscale actually relies on WireGuard and includes a copy of</span> <span data-timestamp="276">WireGuard inside of it.</span> <span data-timestamp="278">WireGuard is what we call the data plane.</span> <span data-timestamp="280">So Tailscale, like I said there&#39;s many different ways to describe</span> <span data-timestamp="283">Tailscale, one way of describing it is a software defined network, and if you have</span> <span data-timestamp="287">heard about software defined networking or SDNs, they have a control plane</span> <span data-timestamp="290">and a data plane.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="290">The data plane is high throughput but dumb,</span> <span data-timestamp="294">and the control plane configures the data plane so</span> <span data-timestamp="297">it&#39;s low throughput but smart.</span> <span data-timestamp="300">So WireGuard, no offense to the intelligence of the WireGuard</span> <span data-timestamp="303">code, is the high throughput, dumb code, right?</span> <span data-timestamp="305">Its job is to be a very small number of lines of code that does encryption</span> <span data-timestamp="308">really, really well and really, really quickly, and moves packets fast</span> <span data-timestamp="312">and securely, and it does that really well.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="314">But if you download just WireGuard, you quickly find out it&#39;s</span> <span data-timestamp="317">kind of batteries not included.</span> <span data-timestamp="319">You have to move the keys around yourself, you have to put the public keys in the right</span> <span data-timestamp="322">place, you have to tell it which IP addresses all of your nodes are connected</span> <span data-timestamp="325">to, you have to set up your own subnets, you have to load things into the</span> <span data-timestamp="329">kernel and so on.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="331">Tailscale does that part for you, but at the most basic</span> <span data-timestamp="334">level, Tailscale handles your key management for</span> <span data-timestamp="337">WireGuard and it also handles so called nat traversal, which is getting</span> <span data-timestamp="341">connections established in the first place from between</span> <span data-timestamp="344">two nodes that might both be behind different firewalls that don&#39;t have ports open.</span> <span data-timestamp="348">So the combination of WireGuard with our little control plane is</span> <span data-timestamp="351">what makes Tailscale into the thing that it is.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="354"><strong>Marc: </strong>So is Tailscale something I run completely on my</span> <span data-timestamp="358">laptop, in my environment, in my home or my office?</span> <span data-timestamp="362">Or is there a SaaS service?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="364"><strong>Avery: </strong>So Tailscale, again, it&#39;s a split between the data plane and the control plane.</span> <span data-timestamp="367">So generally you run the data plane part of Tailscale</span> <span data-timestamp="371">on whichever devices you want to connect to the Tailscale network.</span> <span data-timestamp="374">Now, you can also run so called subnet relays,</span> <span data-timestamp="377">so like a more traditional VPN, you have it</span> <span data-timestamp="380">installed on a router or on a virtual machine that can</span> <span data-timestamp="383">then relay traffic for the rest of your subnets so you don&#39;t have to install Tailscale on</span> <span data-timestamp="386">all of the devices on your subnet.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="388">Then those devices all communicate data with each</span> <span data-timestamp="391">other directly over WireGuard, but in order to</span> <span data-timestamp="394">find out about each other in the first place and exchange their keys</span> <span data-timestamp="398">around, they go through this really tiny SaaS service that we call the</span> <span data-timestamp="402">coordination server or the control server that acts as the control</span> <span data-timestamp="405">plane that tells each of the nodes what they should do and who they</span> <span data-timestamp="408">should connect to, what kinds of packet authorization to use and so on.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="412">So there is a SaaS service, but it&#39;s very important that it&#39;s not</span> <span data-timestamp="415">fundamental to the data transfers.</span> <span data-timestamp="416">So even, for example, if the SaaS service goes down for several</span> <span data-timestamp="420">hours, your network keeps working because the data plane keeps on running.</span> <span data-timestamp="423">The only thing you can&#39;t do is reconfigure the data plane until the control</span> <span data-timestamp="427">server comes back up.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="428"><strong>Benjie: </strong>So it&#39;s almost like a DNS for WireGuard,</span> <span data-timestamp="432">but it&#39;s not because you don&#39;t need it up to</span> <span data-timestamp="435">actually still use it?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="436"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. That&#39;s a pretty accurate way of thinking about</span> <span data-timestamp="440">it, right. Even DNS, if the root DNS servers</span> <span data-timestamp="443">went down, well, that wouldn&#39;t be great.</span> <span data-timestamp="445">But any names that you&#39;ve looked up previously could be cached for a certain</span> <span data-timestamp="448">amount of time before you absolutely rely on those root DNS servers again.</span> <span data-timestamp="452">So Tailscale is more aggressive about caching, it makes sure that you have everything</span> <span data-timestamp="456">you could possibly need to know about the network upfront so that in</span> <span data-timestamp="459">case the control server had a problem, you can last for a really long time.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="463"><strong>Benjie: </strong>That&#39;s super interesting. One thing that I want to talk about,</span> <span data-timestamp="467">maybe we&#39;ll get back to it, but the whole NAT traversal thing is something that&#39;s always</span> <span data-timestamp="470">really interested me.</span> <span data-timestamp="472">I think the web socket term was Turn, I wanna say.</span> <span data-timestamp="475">I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s right.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="477"><strong>Avery: </strong>Oh yes, STUN and TURN.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="478"><strong>Benjie: </strong>STUN, STUN. The STUN was what I was trying to think of.</span> <span data-timestamp="480">Yeah, that&#39;s super interesting.</span> <span data-timestamp="483">Maybe I&#39;m skipping ahead a little bit, but can you just tell us a little bit how the</span> <span data-timestamp="487">NAT traversal works?</span> <span data-timestamp="488">At least at a high level.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="490"><strong>Avery: </strong>Sure. Well, how many hours do you have?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="492"><strong>Benjie: </strong>We could do like a seven, ten hour podcast.</span> <span data-timestamp="494">Whatever, it&#39;s fine.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="495"><strong>Avery: </strong>Seven to 10 hour podcast, all right, that&#39;s about right.</span> <span data-timestamp="498">So just stepping back to the absolute most</span> <span data-timestamp="501">basic level, I think most of us have</span> <span data-timestamp="505">played, say, video games that if you want to do multiplayer</span> <span data-timestamp="508">they tell you to go your router and configure some kind of either UPNP</span> <span data-timestamp="512">or open a port or something like that.</span> <span data-timestamp="514">That works kind of okay for video games where you have a</span> <span data-timestamp="517">residential router that let&#39;s you do that, but even then it doesn&#39;t really work that well, right?</span></p><blockquote><span><svg width="26" height="20" viewBox="0 0 26 20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M6.45 19.08C5.33 19.08 4.37333 18.87 3.58 18.45C2.83333 18.03 2.22667 17.4467 1.76 16.7C1.29333 16 0.943334 15.16 0.71 14.18C0.476667 13.1533 0.36 12.1967 0.36 11.31C0.36 8.97666 0.943334 6.85333 2.11 4.94C3.32333 2.98 5.16667 1.41666 7.64 0.249998L8.27 1.51C6.91667 2.07 5.72667 2.95666 4.7 4.17C3.72 5.38333 3.13667 6.62 2.95 7.88C2.81 8.76667 2.83333 9.58333 3.02 10.33C3.95333 9.39667 5.14333 8.93 6.59 8.93C8.08333 8.93 9.32 9.37333 10.3 10.26C11.28 11.1467 11.77 12.4067 11.77 14.04C11.77 15.5333 11.2567 16.7467 10.23 17.68C9.20333 18.6133 7.94333 19.08 6.45 19.08ZM20.03 19.08C18.91 19.08 17.9533 18.87 17.16 18.45C16.4133 18.03 15.8067 17.4467 15.34 16.7C14.8733 16 14.5233 15.16 14.29 14.18C14.0567 13.1533 13.94 12.1967 13.94 11.31C13.94 8.97666 14.5233 6.85333 15.69 4.94C16.9033 2.98 18.7467 1.41666 21.22 0.249998L21.85 1.51C20.4967 2.07 19.3067 2.95666 18.28 4.17C17.3 5.38333 16.7167 6.62 16.53 7.88C16.39 8.76667 16.4133 9.58333 16.6 10.33C17.5333 9.39667 18.7233 8.93 20.17 8.93C21.6633 8.93 22.9 9.37333 23.88 10.26C24.86 11.1467 25.35 12.4067 25.35 14.04C25.35 15.5333 24.8367 16.7467 23.81 17.68C22.7833 18.6133 21.5233 19.08 20.03 19.08Z" fill="#EE8146"></path></svg></span><p><span data-timestamp="521">Quite often you have to go find the technical person</span> <span data-timestamp="525">just to reconfigure a router so you can play your favorite Xbox game or whatever in</span> <span data-timestamp="528">multiplayer mode and without sucking.</span> <span data-timestamp="531">This is fundamentally a problem that has come up in the last</span> <span data-timestamp="534">25 years or so of the internet, so called Network Address</span> <span data-timestamp="537">Translation, or NAT, plus firewalls.</span></p></blockquote><p><span data-timestamp="539">You have a address that&#39;s assigned to your on LAN, like</span> <span data-timestamp="543">192.168.something that is a private subnet</span> <span data-timestamp="546">that is reused, repeatedly by other people&#39;s homes all over the</span> <span data-timestamp="550">world. If you want to make a connection to somebody else</span> <span data-timestamp="553">who&#39;s computer is also inside a home, you have to get</span> <span data-timestamp="557">through your firewall and their firewall, and</span> <span data-timestamp="560">also deal with the fact that your address might even</span> <span data-timestamp="563">be the same IP address as the person on the other network,</span> <span data-timestamp="567">because you both have these private addresses.</span> <span data-timestamp="569">It converts into something else as it goes over the internet and then converts it back.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="573">So NAT traversal is a</span> <span data-timestamp="576">series of really obscure tricks you can play to</span> <span data-timestamp="579">basically make the NAT firewalls that are in</span> <span data-timestamp="582">between you and the other person believe that you have</span> <span data-timestamp="585">established a connection, basically established</span> <span data-timestamp="588">two connections that are both unidirectional outgoing.</span> <span data-timestamp="591">This is getting more complicated than I hoped for.</span> <span data-timestamp="596">One thing that your NAT firewall let&#39;s you do when you&#39;re behind it is make</span> <span data-timestamp="600">outgoing connections to the internet.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="601">Obviously the internet would not work if you were not allowed to make outgoing</span> <span data-timestamp="605">connections, right? But the result is that most of the things that you connect to are on</span> <span data-timestamp="608">cloud services that don&#39;t have incoming firewalls, they just let you</span> <span data-timestamp="611">connect in. What they don&#39;t let you do is have the cloud call</span> <span data-timestamp="614">back and make connections back to you.</span> <span data-timestamp="616">However, the catch to that is every connection once</span> <span data-timestamp="620">its established is actually bidirectional.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="622">You make an outgoing connection, of course the other end has</span> <span data-timestamp="626">to be able to send packets back for the answer for that connection,</span> <span data-timestamp="629">right? So what NAT traversal is at its most fundamental level is you</span> <span data-timestamp="632">trick the two firewalls into thinking you&#39;ve both</span> <span data-timestamp="636">made outgoing connections at the same time</span> <span data-timestamp="639">so that the packets from each other&#39;s connections look</span> <span data-timestamp="642">like responses to the connection that you made outgoing.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="647">If you do that you can actually establish a true peer-to-peer</span> <span data-timestamp="650">connection between two devices that are behind completely different firewalls with no</span> <span data-timestamp="653">ports open.</span> <span data-timestamp="655">This is better than what you get with video games, but it&#39;s also</span> <span data-timestamp="658">better than you get with typical VPNs that almost always go through a central relay</span> <span data-timestamp="662">to solve this problem. The net result is you have the minimum possible</span> <span data-timestamp="665">latency between any two points.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="667">You actually go through the internet with no</span> <span data-timestamp="671">intermediate relays to make this connection.</span> <span data-timestamp="673">To tie this into STUN and TURN, one of the things you need to</span> <span data-timestamp="677">do to establish this connection is find out, oddly enough, what</span> <span data-timestamp="680">your own address is. So you make an outgoing connection, you know you</span> <span data-timestamp="684">are 192.168.something, that doesn&#39;t help anybody.</span> <span data-timestamp="687">You can ask a STUN server, &#34;Hey, what was my address when I</span> <span data-timestamp="690">came out?&#34;</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="690">And the STUN server, all it does is just respond and say, &#34;Well, to</span> <span data-timestamp="693">me, you look like 1.2.3.4 or whatever.&#34;</span> <span data-timestamp="697">Then you take that 1.2.3.4,</span> <span data-timestamp="700">tell the other person you want to talk to, &#34;I</span> <span data-timestamp="703">need you to connect to 1.2.3.4 on such and</span> <span data-timestamp="707">such port.&#34; They connect outwards and they can get in through this little</span> <span data-timestamp="710">pinhole that you&#39;ve made in the firewall that STUN told you was</span> <span data-timestamp="713">1.2.3.4. Does that make any sense at all?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="717"><strong>Marc: </strong>That makes a ton of sense, I think that explains it, and I think this all comes down to</span> <span data-timestamp="720">the fact that I&#39;m sitting here right now</span> <span data-timestamp="723">recording at home but I have one IP</span> <span data-timestamp="726">address that&#39;s going into my entire house.</span> <span data-timestamp="728">Everybody else is using it and they all have their own incoming connections and stuff</span> <span data-timestamp="731">like this, and like you mentioned, I&#39;m on a private IP so this</span> <span data-timestamp="735">allows me to use the outgoing connection to</span> <span data-timestamp="738">look up who I am, my advertise address and it&#39;ll allow</span> <span data-timestamp="741">connections back through that.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="743"><strong>Avery: </strong>Right. That&#39;s the whole reason NAT exists, is because there&#39;s not enough IP</span> <span data-timestamp="746">addresses in the world so you have to map all of your home devices</span> <span data-timestamp="750">on to a single IP address that you&#39;ve been given by your ISP because</span> <span data-timestamp="753">otherwise there wouldn&#39;t be enough IP addresses.</span> <span data-timestamp="755">So if we didn&#39;t have that problem, and a lot of people say, &#34;Well, look, if we just had</span> <span data-timestamp="758">IPv6 everywhere we wouldn&#39;t need any of this stuff because every device would</span> <span data-timestamp="762">just have a unique IP address and all the problems would go away.&#34;</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="762">That&#39;s</span> <span data-timestamp="765">partly true, because firewalls would still exist, I think we&#39;d still want to block</span> <span data-timestamp="769">traffic from coming into our home network, but it would be a lot easier.</span> <span data-timestamp="772">The difficulty of everything getting mapped onto that one IP address is</span> <span data-timestamp="776">then how to make connections back the other way.</span> <span data-timestamp="778">When someone connects back to your public IP address,</span> <span data-timestamp="780">1.2.3.4, how do we know which device</span> <span data-timestamp="784">that&#39;s even supposed to go to when it goes back through, unless that device</span> <span data-timestamp="787">in behind has initiated the connection in the first place?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="790"><strong>Marc: </strong>Got it. You mentioned in the description one</span> <span data-timestamp="793">of the ways that WireGuard is</span> <span data-timestamp="796">faster or different, anyway, than the</span> <span data-timestamp="800">traditional VPN is that once it establishes that connection it&#39;s a</span> <span data-timestamp="803">direct connection going through the internet.</span> <span data-timestamp="805">Not going through a central server like most VPNs do.</span> <span data-timestamp="808">Is that the primary difference here between a traditional VPN and</span> <span data-timestamp="811">what you&#39;re doing?

Then because people spent so</span> <span data-timestamp="950">much time inventing all the complexity of IPsec, they only had</span> <span data-timestamp="954">time to implement a relatively simple control plane on top</span> <span data-timestamp="957">of IPsec, so you almost always ended up with most devices can</span> <span data-timestamp="960">only make one or two or five tunnels at most, so you&#39;d use it</span> <span data-timestamp="964">for inter office links.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="965">You&#39;d have like one router in each office, each of those</span> <span data-timestamp="969">routers would talk to each of the other office routers.</span> <span data-timestamp="971">Or, even worse, you might have one router in each office talking to the</span> <span data-timestamp="974">central office, and then going back out from there just because it&#39;s such a hassle</span> <span data-timestamp="978">to configure. The nice thing about having WireGuard pre made</span> <span data-timestamp="982">for us is we could plug that into the more fancy control</span> <span data-timestamp="985">layer that we wanted to put in and make it do</span> <span data-timestamp="989">more advanced stuff.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="989">We could spend all of our time thinking about this control plane</span> <span data-timestamp="992">and almost none of our time thinking about this data plane that most VPN</span> <span data-timestamp="995">products have to spend almost all their time thinking about.</span> <span data-timestamp="999">Does that make sense?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1000"><strong>Marc: </strong>Yeah.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1000"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Yeah, it does, vaguely for me.</span> <span data-timestamp="1003">But I know Marc</span> <span data-timestamp="1006">gets it.

So there&#39;s two different sides of what people</span> <span data-timestamp="1076">might do if they weren&#39;t using Tailscale, one of them is a traditional VPN where you&#39;d</span> <span data-timestamp="1079">have a VPN sitting on an outward facing router with a</span> <span data-timestamp="1082">port opened on the firewall that allows incoming connections.</span> <span data-timestamp="1086">The other thing people might do is a lot of</span> <span data-timestamp="1089">people use Tailscale for, say, SSH, or</span> <span data-timestamp="1092">accessing a remote desktop or something like that.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1095">What happens in a lot of cases is people will actually just do a port</span> <span data-timestamp="1098">forward on the router back to one of their internal</span> <span data-timestamp="1101">devices, and leave the SSH port just basically sitting there open on the</span> <span data-timestamp="1105">internet, or leave RDP, Windows Remote Desktop sitting</span> <span data-timestamp="1108">out on the internet and just hope nobody will find it.</span> <span data-timestamp="1111">That is a pretty huge security problem, but it&#39;s the normal thing to do.</span> <span data-timestamp="1114">If you spin up a device in AWS or Google</span> <span data-timestamp="1117">Cloud with a virtual machine, the easiest way to get into it is just</span> <span data-timestamp="1121">opening that SSH port to the world.</span> <span data-timestamp="1123">A lot of people do that and it&#39;s a really dangerous thing to do.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1125"><strong>Benjie: </strong>I don&#39;t do that, what are you talking about?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1128"><strong>Avery: </strong>Do you use it with a three letter password too?</span> <span data-timestamp="1131">That&#39;s the best--</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1132"><strong>Benjie: </strong>No, I don&#39;t use a password.</span> <span data-timestamp="1134">I like to just leave Telnet open with no password, and that&#39;s</span> <span data-timestamp="1137">kind of my-</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1137"><strong>Avery: </strong>Okay. Did you know Telnet doesn&#39;t even come with Mac OS anymore?</span> <span data-timestamp="1140">It&#39;s really disappointing.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1141"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Really? I actually did not know that.</span> <span data-timestamp="1144">Today I learned.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1145"><strong>Marc: </strong>It&#39;s disappointing.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1146"><strong>Avery: </strong>It is, it&#39;s one of my favorite programs.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1149"><strong>Benjie: </strong>I love Telnet too, that&#39;s always the first thing I do whenever a get a new</span> <span data-timestamp="1153">type of device to play around with, I&#39;m always trying to Telnet in and see</span> <span data-timestamp="1157">where I can get. Okay, no, that&#39;s super cool and</span> <span data-timestamp="1160">that&#39;s showing it off a bit more.</span> <span data-timestamp="1162">Maybe talk a little bit more around use cases.</span> <span data-timestamp="1165">So RDP is a great one, SSH is another.</span> <span data-timestamp="1168">Well, not SSH, but...

It doesn&#39;t have to do any NAT traversal or firewall stuff because</span> <span data-timestamp="1315">Tailscale already dealt with all that stuff.</span> <span data-timestamp="1318">So you&#39;re back to a world like the olden days of the FDP</span> <span data-timestamp="1321">program where you can just FDP to any computer you want and get</span> <span data-timestamp="1324">input files because you&#39;re confident that that connection has already been</span> <span data-timestamp="1327">validated right.</span> <span data-timestamp="1329">When you&#39;ve got that ability you can start applying that to more and more things.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1332">The thing that we&#39;ve launched recently is called Tailscale SSH,</span> <span data-timestamp="1335">Tailscale already worked with SSH because it&#39;s a network layer so you</span> <span data-timestamp="1339">can maintain your own SSH servers.</span> <span data-timestamp="1341">The first advantage is you don&#39;t have to expose those SSH servers to</span> <span data-timestamp="1344">the world, you just install Tailscale on your computer, you install</span> <span data-timestamp="1347">Tailscale on the server, and now you can SSH to the server without worrying about</span> <span data-timestamp="1351">firewalls.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1351">That was pretty neat the way it was, but we found that a</span> <span data-timestamp="1354">lot of people still were having trouble setting up</span> <span data-timestamp="1357">their SSH keys to make that process as seamless as possible.</span> <span data-timestamp="1361">Especially when you&#39;re dealing with big companies where employees come and</span> <span data-timestamp="1365">go and you&#39;ve got servers that are shared, in production.</span> <span data-timestamp="1367">It was actually kind of a hassle removing all of people&#39;s SSH keys</span> <span data-timestamp="1371">when they left the company.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1371">So what Tailscale SSH</span> <span data-timestamp="1374">does is it actually includes an SSH server of its own that you can</span> <span data-timestamp="1377">install as part of Tailscale on one of these servers, and it&#39;ll actually let</span> <span data-timestamp="1381">you into the SSH server based on your Tailscale</span> <span data-timestamp="1384">identity so you don&#39;t have to deal with any SSH keys whatsoever.</span> <span data-timestamp="1388">Then if you drop somebody out of your Tailscale network in the Tailscale admin</span> <span data-timestamp="1391">panel, which is the little SaaS</span> <span data-timestamp="1394">service that I was talking about that&#39;s part of the coordination server, then instantly</span> <span data-timestamp="1398">any device that&#39;s authenticated over Tailscale SSH will stop</span> <span data-timestamp="1401">allowing that person in.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1403">Or if you add a new person to your engineering team, you just</span> <span data-timestamp="1406">put them in the engineering team and it automatically reflects all of that information</span> <span data-timestamp="1410">out so any device that&#39;s supposed to let people in from the engineering team</span> <span data-timestamp="1413">can suddenly SSH into that device.</span> <span data-timestamp="1415">So it&#39;s pretty slick, it completely eliminates the most annoying part of</span> <span data-timestamp="1419">SSH which is key management, and the second most annoying part of SSH which is</span> <span data-timestamp="1423">net ports and finding them on the internet and naming them and stuff.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1426"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Wow, that&#39;s super cool. Little pedantic question here, but what if</span> <span data-timestamp="1429">I&#39;m currently connected and you revoke my</span> <span data-timestamp="1433">Tailscale privileges?</span> <span data-timestamp="1434">What happens?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1435"><strong>Avery: </strong>It will immediately disconnect you.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1437"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Really?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1438"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. Because it&#39;s the network, right?</span> <span data-timestamp="1440">So the network knows this is the control plane informing the data plane, &#34;Okay,</span> <span data-timestamp="1444">you no longer have a route between these two things, so cut it off.&#34;</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1446"><strong>Benjie: </strong>So it&#39;ll break it immediately because it&#39;s all gone?</span> <span data-timestamp="1449">That&#39;s super cool.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1450"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. And every Tailscale reconfiguration is reflected out to</span> <span data-timestamp="1453">everybody in network in about 100 milliseconds or less, so it&#39;s</span> <span data-timestamp="1456">really, really fast. You&#39;re not sitting around, you can reconfigure your packet</span> <span data-timestamp="1460">filtering rules in the admin panel and you might have 10,000</span> <span data-timestamp="1463">nodes and you just save the configuration and those</span> <span data-timestamp="1466">10,000 nodes reflect the new packet filter instantly.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1469"><strong>Benjie: </strong>So even a fleshing credential</span> <span data-timestamp="1473">type mechanism, if you have some Sec Op stuff you need do here,</span> <span data-timestamp="1476">this is a really valuable tool for that as well?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1479"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah, you can suspend users, for example, if somebody is</span> <span data-timestamp="1482">going on leave and you don&#39;t want them to have access or they&#39;re going to a country where</span> <span data-timestamp="1485">they might have their computer confiscated or something.</span> <span data-timestamp="1488">You just suspend their user account and instantly that user account is shut</span> <span data-timestamp="1491">off and then you click unsuspend and it&#39;s instantly back.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1494"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Wow. That&#39;s super powerful.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1495"><strong>Marc: </strong>Without having to provision new keys or anything like that, it&#39;s just-</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1499"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah, there&#39;s no messing around with keys.</span> <span data-timestamp="1500">You never have to think about keys with Tailscale because you&#39;re talking about</span> <span data-timestamp="1503">users, and it has a list of the user&#39;s devices and you can tag devices, and</span> <span data-timestamp="1507">you can talk about users in these groups are allowed</span> <span data-timestamp="1510">to talk to the SSH port on computers</span> <span data-timestamp="1514">that are tagged in this group.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1516">Then people in this group are allowed to apply these tags to these servers when they</span> <span data-timestamp="1519">bring them up, so you can have an operations team who&#39;s allowed to use certain</span> <span data-timestamp="1522">tags when they&#39;re spinning up servers that will then be accessed by people in</span> <span data-timestamp="1526">other groups. But it&#39;s all these high level concepts, you&#39;re talking about</span> <span data-timestamp="1529">people and you&#39;re talking about tags, as</span> <span data-timestamp="1532">opposed to talking about IP addresses and port numbers and setting up</span> <span data-timestamp="1535">firewalls because it would be really hard to configure a</span> <span data-timestamp="1538">network of firewalls for a mesh network, right?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1541">Where do you even put the firewall in order to block the traffic in the</span> <span data-timestamp="1544">right place? The firewall has to exist on every single Tailscale node, and</span> <span data-timestamp="1548">you obviously don&#39;t want to set that up by hand, but it&#39;s really neat that</span> <span data-timestamp="1551">10,000 nodes can have their firewalls reconfigured instantly by the central</span> <span data-timestamp="1554">control service.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="1556"><strong>Marc: </strong>Yeah, that&#39;s cool. We&#39;ll make sure to include links.</span> <span data-timestamp="1558">I collected a couple, I&#39;ve been reading through it as you&#39;ve been</span> <span data-timestamp="1561">describing it too, Tailscale SSH and Taildrop are both cool.</span> <span data-timestamp="1565">Talking about use cases though, you said earlier you can use your</span> <span data-timestamp="1568">imagination and think of anything you can build on top of this meshed</span> <span data-timestamp="1571">network now. As you&#39;ve been building this</span> <span data-timestamp="1575">and sharing it as open source and hearing folks using it,</span> <span data-timestamp="1578">has there been anything that you couldn&#39;t have even imagined when you</span> <span data-timestamp="1582">started building it?

We all got that in computer science school.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2171"><strong>Avery: </strong>Exactly, that&#39;s also why I talk about what happens when the control server goes</span> <span data-timestamp="2175">down. It seems like a weird thing to bring up, why would you talk about the possibility</span> <span data-timestamp="2178">of your server going down? This was architecturally a</span> <span data-timestamp="2181">major decision for us, a lot of people get super</span> <span data-timestamp="2184">obsessed with, &#34;My service has to be up 99.999% of the</span> <span data-timestamp="2188">time.&#34; That actually makes all of the stuff you do really hard.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2191">Five nines of reliability is super, insanely difficult.</span> <span data-timestamp="2195">But if you just say, &#34;Look, I architected the whole thing so that it can go down</span> <span data-timestamp="2199">for hours and who cares?&#34; Not that I want it to be down for hours,</span> <span data-timestamp="2202">it&#39;s never been down for hours, but if I just say, &#34;Look, it</span> <span data-timestamp="2205">could be,&#34; then I can just not do</span> <span data-timestamp="2209">any of that stuff that I need to do to make it five nines of</span> <span data-timestamp="2212">reliability. It makes my job so vastly much easier, and this is</span> <span data-timestamp="2215">something that I think people don&#39;t realize anymore.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2218">They&#39;re so used to just thinking, &#34;Well, it has to be up all the time, right?&#34;</span> <span data-timestamp="2222">Well, why not design something that doesn&#39;t have to be up all the time, because</span> <span data-timestamp="2225">your life will be much simpler?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2227"><strong>Marc: </strong>Yeah. I think the story here, I</span> <span data-timestamp="2230">agree, it&#39;s a really, really great story.</span> <span data-timestamp="2233">I think even the idea of before you know what you were going to build you</span> <span data-timestamp="2236">wanted to make sure that everybody could use it, so you wanted to</span> <span data-timestamp="2240">architect and design the system in a way that your cost isn&#39;t going to scale</span> <span data-timestamp="2243">with additional users.</span> <span data-timestamp="2244">It has side effects too where it&#39;s faster, it&#39;s more</span> <span data-timestamp="2247">secure, data is not flowing through your system.</span> <span data-timestamp="2250">Not just for cost, but that&#39;s one of the</span> <span data-timestamp="2254">risks of a VPN, right?</span> <span data-timestamp="2255">Is that that data could be spied on and looked at by</span> <span data-timestamp="2259">anybody in the middle.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2260"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. That&#39;s one of the reasons why we often get the advice to, &#34;Please, would you</span> <span data-timestamp="2264">stop calling your product a VPN because it has such a terrible reputation for</span> <span data-timestamp="2267">privacy and security.&#34; Part of that is because there&#39;s two kinds of</span> <span data-timestamp="2270">VPN, there&#39;s corporate VPNs and privacy VPNs.</span> <span data-timestamp="2274">Tailscale is more like a corporate VPN but it can actually be used like one of</span> <span data-timestamp="2277">these consumer privacy VPNs, because you could if you</span> <span data-timestamp="2281">want set up an endpoint with a Tailscale instance on</span> <span data-timestamp="2284">it and then route all of your traffic through that endpoint over Tailscale.</span> <span data-timestamp="2287">It&#39;s called an exit node.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2287">But when you do that, even if you&#39;re</span> <span data-timestamp="2290">routing all of your internet browsing traffic over Tailscale, we</span> <span data-timestamp="2294">still don&#39;t see it.</span> <span data-timestamp="2295">The private keys for all of your devices, stay on your devices.</span> <span data-timestamp="2298">All we do is exchange some public keys around, which means we can&#39;t decrypt your</span> <span data-timestamp="2301">traffic at all. We have absolutely no idea what is going over your</span> <span data-timestamp="2305">Tailscale network, and we never even see the packets.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2308"><strong>Marc: </strong>That&#39;s super interesting.</span> <span data-timestamp="2310">So taking a step back to the architecture and how Tailscale</span> <span data-timestamp="2313">works, where it&#39;s built on top of WireGuard, I&#39;m going to ask maybe the</span> <span data-timestamp="2316">dumbest question.

I think that the lesson that you&#39;re trying to</span> <span data-timestamp="2581">explain here to us is something that we all should apply.</span> <span data-timestamp="2584">It&#39;s definitely something that we think about at Shipyard and I know I&#39;ll speak to</span> <span data-timestamp="2587">Replicated, trying to simplify really complicated things and</span> <span data-timestamp="2590">abstract it away is really the goal of a successful company and a</span> <span data-timestamp="2594">successful product.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2594">Also that

rock</span> <span data-timestamp="2604">solid, really well thought out and every time you</span> <span data-timestamp="2607">improve it goes to the masses.</span> <span data-timestamp="2610">So what&#39;s Tailscale written in and what open source license is it?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2614"><strong>Avery: </strong>Ah, important questions.</span> <span data-timestamp="2616">So most of Tailscale is written in Go, there&#39;s a few frontends</span> <span data-timestamp="2619">like the iOS and Mac OS ones that use Swift that then call</span> <span data-timestamp="2623">into the Go backend.</span> <span data-timestamp="2625">Which is a little bit unusual on those platforms, but we made it work so that basically</span> <span data-timestamp="2628">the core of Tailscale is always the same code running in Go.</span> <span data-timestamp="2632">It&#39;s of course been a little bit tricky getting Go to do the stuff we</span> <span data-timestamp="2635">want as fast as we wanted, but actually it&#39;s getting faster and faster all the</span> <span data-timestamp="2638">time and I think we&#39;re really happy with that choice.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2642">Open source license, we used...</span> <span data-timestamp="2645">Actually, let me try and remember specifically.</span> <span data-timestamp="2648">What we did, I think, was copy whatever the Go project</span> <span data-timestamp="2651">used because it turned out some of our earliest developers are actually on the Go</span> <span data-timestamp="2654">team or were on the Go team.</span> <span data-timestamp="2657">They really liked the license and they wanted it to be compatible, so it&#39;s some kind of</span> <span data-timestamp="2660">MIT license with maybe an extra exception or something like that.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2663">I forgot exactly what we did, but it&#39;s very open.</span> <span data-timestamp="2665">The only exception is what we call the coordination server or the control</span> <span data-timestamp="2669">server, which is not open source.</span> <span data-timestamp="2670">However, there is an open source project called</span> <span data-timestamp="2673">Headscale that we didn&#39;t start but we&#39;ve been assisting them</span> <span data-timestamp="2677">and throwing them information every now and then on how to do it.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2680">They&#39;ve replicated the control server so you can</span> <span data-timestamp="2683">take Headscale, run it completely on your own and then</span> <span data-timestamp="2686">combine that with the open source Tailscale clients and have a completely open</span> <span data-timestamp="2690">source Tailscale deployment that doesn&#39;t depend on</span> <span data-timestamp="2693">any proprietary stuff.</span> <span data-timestamp="2696">Incidentally, we just hired one of the developers of Headscale</span> <span data-timestamp="2699">recently, Christopher, who is going to be</span> <span data-timestamp="2703">working with us on both the Tailscale side and the Headscale side.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2707">Basically, we were always thinking of making some kind of open</span> <span data-timestamp="2711">source control server, we never got around to it and we&#39;re really happy that</span> <span data-timestamp="2714">Headscale exists so now we can just contribute to it instead of having to</span> <span data-timestamp="2717">start our own.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2719"><strong>Benjie: </strong>So why not make the control plain open source then,</span> <span data-timestamp="2722">if you guys are open to that anyway?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2725"><strong>Avery: </strong>We actually just made a blog post a couple weeks</span> <span data-timestamp="2729">ago about exactly why that is, but the short version is the</span> <span data-timestamp="2733">code for the control server was...</span> <span data-timestamp="2735">I don&#39;t know, you know how proprietary software gets where</span> <span data-timestamp="2738">there&#39;s a lot of hacks and there ends up being a bunch of network</span> <span data-timestamp="2741">specific hacks as we adopt a particular customer with a particular need, then we try</span> <span data-timestamp="2745">to remove those hacks over time and so on.</span> <span data-timestamp="2747">The code just got more and more messy and</span> <span data-timestamp="2750">less and less the kind of thing we&#39;d want to present to the</span> <span data-timestamp="2753">world.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2754"><strong>Benjie: </strong>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re referring to, in all the code that I&#39;ve ever been a part of-</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2758"><strong>Avery: </strong>I mean, maybe we&#39;re special.</span> <span data-timestamp="2759">Maybe only we have ugly code at Tailscale.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2762"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Those Go developers, those guys are pretty suspect so</span> <span data-timestamp="2766">that&#39;s probably the problem.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2768"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah, we were going to get to it but we would&#39;ve had to strip a bunch of stuff out, it</span> <span data-timestamp="2771">would&#39;ve been a big clean up job.</span> <span data-timestamp="2772">There would&#39;ve been a question about are we actually</span> <span data-timestamp="2776">forking this thing or are we maintaining two different projects, or are we going to</span> <span data-timestamp="2779">somehow keep our commercial, weird hacks</span> <span data-timestamp="2782">in there at the same time as having the open source version?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2785">The Headscale project basically solved it for us, they wrote it from scratch, they have</span> <span data-timestamp="2788">some things simple. It won&#39;t scale</span> <span data-timestamp="2791">to billions of users running on a single</span> <span data-timestamp="2794">control plane, which is what Tailscale needs to scale to.</span> <span data-timestamp="2798">But it will scale to your organization running on a single control</span> <span data-timestamp="2802">plane, and so I think it&#39;s a good balance.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2805"><strong>Benjie: </strong>That brings up a good question, and this is a little bit about</span> <span data-timestamp="2808">the business, but how do you guys make money?</span> <span data-timestamp="2810">How do you monetize this?</span> <span data-timestamp="2811">Because you had mentioned the professional services not being something you were</span> <span data-timestamp="2814">interested in, but obviously you&#39;re running a business here so how do you</span> <span data-timestamp="2817">monetize?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2818"><strong>Avery: </strong>Right. First thing to know is that the reason</span> <span data-timestamp="2822">that we don&#39;t really recommend for most</span> <span data-timestamp="2825">companies to use the open source control plane is it&#39;s the only</span> <span data-timestamp="2828">thing in all of Tailscale that needs to have</span> <span data-timestamp="2832">both access to all your public keys and</span> <span data-timestamp="2835">be public facing on the internet.</span> <span data-timestamp="2837">Which is a really bad combination, this is a security nightmare.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2840">The control plane is essentially a certificate</span> <span data-timestamp="2844">authority that has all of the keys to your whole network,</span> <span data-timestamp="2847">so if you&#39;re running one of these things you have to spend a lot of time securing that</span> <span data-timestamp="2851">thing because it is where the attackers should focus all of their</span> <span data-timestamp="2854">attacking. So the value Tailscale provides is we run the</span> <span data-timestamp="2857">control plane and we actually have a whole bunch of security policies and access</span> <span data-timestamp="2861">controls, and only a few people can do this and only a few people can do that, there&#39;s</span> <span data-timestamp="2864">firewall layers and there&#39;s logging and auditing and SOC2.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2867">All of that stuff around this control plane to make sure that we are</span> <span data-timestamp="2871">actually running it correctly, so that then the stuff you need to deploy, you</span> <span data-timestamp="2874">never have to open a firewall port.</span> <span data-timestamp="2875">If you never open a firewall port, like 97% of all the</span> <span data-timestamp="2879">possible attacks are just gone.</span> <span data-timestamp="2881">So that&#39;s pretty beautiful, the beauty of Tailscale is not</span> <span data-timestamp="2885">having to run this one little bit that ties everything together.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2889">So the value that people pay us for is not having to</span> <span data-timestamp="2892">run that thing, right?</span> <span data-timestamp="2893">That&#39;s the best part. That said, we can</span> <span data-timestamp="2897">segment Tailscale users into roughly three categories.</span> <span data-timestamp="2900">One of them is individuals using the free product that we intend to always keep</span> <span data-timestamp="2903">free because that&#39;s not who we want to collect the</span> <span data-timestamp="2907">money from.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2907">Those people tell their friends, there&#39;s a huge word of mouth</span> <span data-timestamp="2910">spread of Tailscale, almost all people who find out about Tailscale find out about</span> <span data-timestamp="2914">it from their friends who are already using it, which is great.</span> <span data-timestamp="2916">Some of those people bring it to work, usually on the development</span> <span data-timestamp="2919">team. They&#39;ll try it out inside the company,</span> <span data-timestamp="2922">whether under the table or officially, they&#39;ll spread it around to a</span> <span data-timestamp="2926">few more of the developers that get excited.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2928">As things grow, then it goes to the IT department, people are like, &#34;Well, why are we</span> <span data-timestamp="2932">using this crappy legacy VPN and Tailscale?</span> <span data-timestamp="2935">Why don&#39;t we just drop the old VPN and use Tailscale for everything?&#34; Next thing you know</span> <span data-timestamp="2938">it becomes a top down sale through executives.</span> <span data-timestamp="2941">Then there&#39;s a few much larger enterprise customers that we</span> <span data-timestamp="2945">work with, and I think over time there will be even more of those</span> <span data-timestamp="2948">enterprise customers.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2948">But it hasn&#39;t been our primary focus of the business</span> <span data-timestamp="2951">up until now. The things that these companies pay for,</span> <span data-timestamp="2955">first of all, the ease of use and the security guarantees that Tailscale can</span> <span data-timestamp="2959">provide. Your security problems go away if we&#39;re handling all of the</span> <span data-timestamp="2962">difficult stuff in the control plane, and the stuff that you&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t have any</span> <span data-timestamp="2965">open firewall ports.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2967">But the next part on top of that is access controls</span> <span data-timestamp="2970">between groups, being able to have fine grained role based</span> <span data-timestamp="2974">access control and that kind of stuff, that as companies get bigger they really want</span> <span data-timestamp="2977">to be able to say, &#34;This group of servers is only for this group of users.</span> <span data-timestamp="2980">I really need to be able to offboard someone extremely efficiently and make sure they&#39;re</span> <span data-timestamp="2984">cut off from everything instantly.&#34; These kinds of things are</span> <span data-timestamp="2987">super valuable, where you wouldn&#39;t have been able to</span> <span data-timestamp="2991">buy them for any price a few years ago.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2994"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Right. And also that onboarding use case you explained also is</span> <span data-timestamp="2997">super valuable.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="2998"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. The onboarding is really nice, you download Tailscale from the App Store on your</span> <span data-timestamp="3002">Mac, you log in with your corporate SSO identity, and now</span> <span data-timestamp="3005">we already know what group you&#39;re in because of your SSO.</span> <span data-timestamp="3008">It drops you into having access to all the right things, it puts your SSH keys in the</span> <span data-timestamp="3011">right places so you can just SSH to all the right devices.</span> <span data-timestamp="3013">There&#39;s like nothing to do.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3015"><strong>Benjie: </strong>That&#39;s pretty cool, that&#39;s pretty cool.</span> <span data-timestamp="3018">I feel like there&#39;s some version of using Tailscale for Git,</span> <span data-timestamp="3022">somehow, that would help me.</span> <span data-timestamp="3023">But I&#39;m not sure if that actually makes sense.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3025"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. Well, I mean you can host your own Git servers, of course.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3029"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Right. No, I&#39;m thinking about the GitHub integration in particular.</span> <span data-timestamp="3031">How does that work?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3032"><strong>Avery: </strong>Oh, there&#39;s lots of GitHub integration.</span> <span data-timestamp="3034">So for example, you can put Tailscale in your GitHub</span> <span data-timestamp="3037">actions, we have a GitHub actions plugin, and so you</span> <span data-timestamp="3040">can do continuous deployment, for example.</span> <span data-timestamp="3042">So something builds in a GitHub action and then it pushes something over</span> <span data-timestamp="3046">Tailscale to either your code signing</span> <span data-timestamp="3050">server or to something on your</span> <span data-timestamp="3053">internal network that then allows it to actually continuously deploy the</span> <span data-timestamp="3056">software. Or it can push it to, say if you have a mobile app,</span> <span data-timestamp="3060">you can have a network of little mobile devices that actually can run tests that</span> <span data-timestamp="3063">are connected over the Tailscale network.</span> <span data-timestamp="3065">So people use it for all kinds of stuff in there.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3068"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Super cool. Wait, sorry, you didn&#39;t answer one question though.</span> <span data-timestamp="3070">How do you make money? What do you charge for exactly?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3075"><strong>Avery: </strong>When you get into the multi user corporate plans...</span> <span data-timestamp="3077">We have, incidentally for people doing free software projects</span> <span data-timestamp="3081">or family stuff, we have a community plan that&#39;s free.</span> <span data-timestamp="3084">But if you&#39;re a corporation we</span> <span data-timestamp="3088">basically charge a per user, per month fee for either the</span> <span data-timestamp="3091">team plan or the business plan.</span> <span data-timestamp="3092">The main difference between the two is the advancedness</span> <span data-timestamp="3096">level of the role based access control.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3098"><strong>Benjie: </strong>So just basically enterprise controls, which makes perfect sense.</span> <span data-timestamp="3101">So if I&#39;m trying to protect my sandcastles I can go use the free version?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3105"><strong>Avery: </strong>Exactly. And you can share with your friends on the free version, because each</span> <span data-timestamp="3108">of you has a free copy of Tailscale and you can share nodes out to other people.</span> <span data-timestamp="3112">But there&#39;s no central control then of who gets to share what.</span> <span data-timestamp="3116">If you&#39;re on the corporate plan, then the administrator of your</span> <span data-timestamp="3119">company has a global view of everything going on in your network.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3123"><strong>Benjie: </strong>I feel like Marc would try and knock down my sandcastle, so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll</span> <span data-timestamp="3126">share that with him. But maybe.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3128"><strong>Marc: </strong>You can choose, that&#39;s the magic.</span> <span data-timestamp="3130">Right? But it&#39;s interesting to note that it&#39;s per user that you&#39;re actually...</span> <span data-timestamp="3134">the commercial side is per user, not per device.</span> <span data-timestamp="3137">The size of my network, the number of pods, whatever, it doesn&#39;t matter?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3140"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. We thought about per device, and it didn&#39;t seem</span> <span data-timestamp="3143">like... We know developers are cheapskates,</span> <span data-timestamp="3146">right? That&#39;s the one thing we know for sure about developers.</span> <span data-timestamp="3149">We didn&#39;t want a developer to have to think every time they&#39;re spinning up a</span> <span data-timestamp="3152">device, &#34;Do I want to spend another however much per month</span> <span data-timestamp="3156">on this device? Because it&#39;s just a toy.&#34; When you do that you&#39;re really going to</span> <span data-timestamp="3160">slow down the adoption.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3161">We were just like, &#34;Look, when people are hiring a developer, they can just</span> <span data-timestamp="3164">include that in the budget.</span> <span data-timestamp="3166">Okay, here&#39;s an extra $10 a month on top of the</span> <span data-timestamp="3169">10,000 or 20,000 a month that I&#39;m paying this developer.</span> <span data-timestamp="3173">I think I can afford that, the budgeting is done.&#34; And now the</span> <span data-timestamp="3176">developer can just do whatever they want, that was the magic we</span> <span data-timestamp="3179">wanted to go for.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3180"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Yeah. That dovetails into the strategy you were</span> <span data-timestamp="3184">talking about earlier on about you&#39;re not trying to</span> <span data-timestamp="3187">squeeze everything, you&#39;re just trying to be a productive tool.</span> <span data-timestamp="3190">By the way, we prefer the term fiscally conservative to</span> <span data-timestamp="3194">cheapskate. But I think everyone-</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3198"><strong>Avery: </strong>Might be an Iowa thing.</span> <span data-timestamp="3199">I think in New York it&#39;s the same word.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3201"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Yeah, I&#39;m in New York.</span> <span data-timestamp="3202">You know that Avery, so I&#39;m just trying to represent</span> <span data-timestamp="3205">some of our other brethren in the middle, maybe.</span> <span data-timestamp="3208">Okay. So how about roadmap and the</span> <span data-timestamp="3211">community? How has building this as an open source</span> <span data-timestamp="3214">project... Obviously you&#39;ve hired some people from the</span> <span data-timestamp="3218">community, but tell us a little bit more about the Tailscale community and what it&#39;s like</span> <span data-timestamp="3221">interacting with them and how it&#39;s been running an open source</span> <span data-timestamp="3224">project with obviously a bunch of contributors?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3227"><strong>Avery: </strong>That&#39;s a good question. It&#39;s interesting.</span> <span data-timestamp="3230">I think the Tailscale client project,</span> <span data-timestamp="3233">I would not say has had a ton of external contributors.</span> <span data-timestamp="3236">There&#39;s been some. But for better or worse,</span> <span data-timestamp="3240">the networking stuff that we&#39;re doing is really</span> <span data-timestamp="3243">advanced and there&#39;s not that many people who have a lot of</span> <span data-timestamp="3247">spare time who wanted to work on that kind of thing.</span> <span data-timestamp="3251">Headscale of course has a bunch of community developers, because that&#39;s more of a</span> <span data-timestamp="3254">client-server application.</span> <span data-timestamp="3255">The control plane is much more standard web stuff, so lots and lots of people are able</span> <span data-timestamp="3259">to contribute and they do.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3259">But I think the place where the</span> <span data-timestamp="3262">community really shines with Tailscale is</span> <span data-timestamp="3265">building stuff on top of the core of Tailscale, and</span> <span data-timestamp="3269">we&#39;re seeing not just in open source but there&#39;s a whole</span> <span data-timestamp="3272">bunch of partners we recently announced collaborations with, people integrating</span> <span data-timestamp="3275">Tailscale into their products.</span> <span data-timestamp="3277">All kinds of people will post, &#34;Here&#39;s how you can use Tailscale with</span> <span data-timestamp="3281">this kind of container system.</span> <span data-timestamp="3282">Here&#39;s the Docker file you need to do this and that.</span> <span data-timestamp="3284">Here&#39;s something you can build on top of Tailscale&#39;s</span> <span data-timestamp="3288">inventory system so if you want to keep track of all the</span> <span data-timestamp="3291">devices in your company you can use Tailscale&#39;s node lists and</span> <span data-timestamp="3294">track exactly what&#39;s going on, when they come and go, what geographic region they go</span> <span data-timestamp="3297">through and so on.&#34;</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3297">The community is more of a</span> <span data-timestamp="3301">community of developers who use</span> <span data-timestamp="3304">Tailscale and then help other developers use</span> <span data-timestamp="3307">Tailscale for things, as opposed to necessarily extending</span> <span data-timestamp="3310">Tailscale themselves. Does that make sense?</span> <span data-timestamp="3312">It&#39;s a little unusual, but I think it&#39;s-</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3313"><strong>Benjie: </strong>No, it makes perfect sense.</span> <span data-timestamp="3315">Literally at Shipyard, we&#39;re evaluating</span> <span data-timestamp="3319">some CLI stuff that we&#39;re working on and it&#39;s like, &#34;Hey, do we</span> <span data-timestamp="3322">embed KubeCuddle?</span> <span data-timestamp="3323">Do we kind of use Tailscale?&#34; And I&#39;m</span> <span data-timestamp="3327">more convinced than ever that Tailscale seems like a really forward thinking</span> <span data-timestamp="3331">solution, so I very much understand that.</span> <span data-timestamp="3334">What about roadmap? Anything interesting on the roadmap that you want to talk about?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3338"><strong>Avery: </strong>We try not to talk too much about future stuff</span> <span data-timestamp="3341">because we like to keep it a surprise as much as possible.</span> <span data-timestamp="3344">There&#39;s some performance improvements on the way, I think we&#39;re going</span> <span data-timestamp="3348">to be making an announcement about something like that in the next few weeks and I think</span> <span data-timestamp="3351">people will be extremely surprised at how fast</span> <span data-timestamp="3354">you can make WireGuard go. There&#39;s other features about the control</span> <span data-timestamp="3358">plane.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3358">I think most of the stuff on the roadmap in the near future is going to</span> <span data-timestamp="3361">come down to partnerships, where we make it</span> <span data-timestamp="3364">easier than ever for other companies to work with Tailscale.</span> <span data-timestamp="3368">There&#39;s one partnership we announced already for Materialize,</span> <span data-timestamp="3371">where they have a data flow product</span> <span data-timestamp="3374">and their data flow product, you can paste a Tailscale</span> <span data-timestamp="3378">access key into it and then all of a sudden</span> <span data-timestamp="3381">their SaaS product shows up on your private network and can access</span> <span data-timestamp="3384">your private databases to help with the data flow stuff.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3387">Which is something that they never could&#39;ve done otherwise, and this is because they</span> <span data-timestamp="3389">embedded Tailscale into their product, right?</span> <span data-timestamp="3392">I think there&#39;s going to be lot more companies doing stuff like that in the next little</span> <span data-timestamp="3396">while. So we&#39;ve been scrambling to make sure all of the APIs and stuff are in</span> <span data-timestamp="3399">place so everybody can build this really neat integration on top.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3403">Most of Tailscale itself, yes, we&#39;re going to refine some of the UIs and</span> <span data-timestamp="3406">stuff, we&#39;re going to make Taildrop even better, we&#39;re going to keep improving Tailscale</span> <span data-timestamp="3410">SSH. We didn&#39;t talk about Magic DNS which is the thing that makes it so</span> <span data-timestamp="3413">that you can just ping host name, and that host name actually works.</span> <span data-timestamp="3417">All of that stuff is going to continue to get improved, but you shouldn&#39;t</span> <span data-timestamp="3420">see too many giant, thundering changes.</span> <span data-timestamp="3423">It&#39;s going to be mainly more stuff built on top.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3426"><strong>Benjie: </strong>That&#39;s cool. That integration stuff sounds super cool.</span> <span data-timestamp="3430">It&#39;s a very different use case than me wanting to connect to</span> <span data-timestamp="3433">something, but it&#39;s like two SaaS services connecting to each</span> <span data-timestamp="3437">other. I don&#39;t know, the way you described it</span> <span data-timestamp="3440">was like it&#39;s a reverse connection where I&#39;m actually</span> <span data-timestamp="3444">integrating the SaaS service into my environment, to get access to</span> <span data-timestamp="3447">sensitive connections that maybe my</span> <span data-timestamp="3450">VPC setup or my routing tables otherwise wouldn&#39;t have allowed</span> <span data-timestamp="3453">incoming connections to.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3455"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. There&#39;s so many people right now, you&#39;ve probably run into it, but they use</span> <span data-timestamp="3458">these so called IP Allow lists on their server, so if you pay</span> <span data-timestamp="3462">the extra expensive plan for such-and-such SaaS service you can then make a</span> <span data-timestamp="3465">list of IP addresses that are allowed to connect in and login as you.</span> <span data-timestamp="3468">Then in order to make that work, you have to funnel everybody through a particular</span> <span data-timestamp="3472">IP address, often using a more traditional style VPN.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3475">Then that IP address changes because IP addresses change sometimes and, &#34;Oh, I</span> <span data-timestamp="3478">got cut off from my service so now I have to go to all the other services that I</span> <span data-timestamp="3482">configured these IP Allow lists with and fix the list of IP addresses</span> <span data-timestamp="3485">so that people can actually get in again.&#34; It&#39;s really tedious and it&#39;s also</span> <span data-timestamp="3489">bad for security because it&#39;s actually not real security.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3492">Somebody can be a man in the middle of the network and</span> <span data-timestamp="3496">just pretend to be one of these IP addresses and walk right into</span> <span data-timestamp="3499">this allow listed service.</span> <span data-timestamp="3501">So Tailscale being used for that kind of stuff, connecting one</span> <span data-timestamp="3504">service to another service is one of the neatest things it</span> <span data-timestamp="3507">can do. A really simple use case is, even if you&#39;re not using</span> <span data-timestamp="3511">Tailscale at your company at all, you install Tailscale on</span> <span data-timestamp="3515">one server node and you ask your partner to install</span> <span data-timestamp="3518">Tailscale on one client device.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3520">Now that client device can access your internal API server</span> <span data-timestamp="3523">while you&#39;re working on this partnership and it wouldn&#39;t even cost you anything because</span> <span data-timestamp="3526">you only need one user account for that.</span> <span data-timestamp="3528">But it&#39;s the beginning of integrating Tailscale into a company, but</span> <span data-timestamp="3532">it&#39;s this kind of cross integration stuff.</span> <span data-timestamp="3535">It&#39;s so much nicer than trying to create a VPC to</span> <span data-timestamp="3539">VPC connection on AWS, between companies</span> <span data-timestamp="3542">where you have to agree on IP addresses and not using the same subnets</span> <span data-timestamp="3545">on your two VPCs and you have to be in the same region, and you have to setup</span> <span data-timestamp="3549">all these keys.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3549">Forget about key rotation, because now you have to convince both</span> <span data-timestamp="3552">companies to rotate their keys at the same time, all that other stuff, and it just</span> <span data-timestamp="3555">goes away. I install Tailscale, you install Tailscale, and now it&#39;s gone.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3559"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Cool. So for us, we have a SaaS service and we definitely get</span> <span data-timestamp="3563">some requests from some of our larger</span> <span data-timestamp="3566">customers that they want to make sure from a security perspective that</span> <span data-timestamp="3569">it&#39;s a SAML login, what can they do to make sure that nobody that&#39;s not</span> <span data-timestamp="3573">authorized to access their team account inside our SaaS service</span> <span data-timestamp="3577">is able to. But they&#39;re all working from home, developers today, right?</span> <span data-timestamp="3580">And so is there a way that we&#39;d be able to use Tailscale to solve that problem, where</span> <span data-timestamp="3584">we can say, &#34;Yeah, here&#39;s a Tailscale team and if you&#39;re</span> <span data-timestamp="3587">able to go through that you can actually access this team in our</span> <span data-timestamp="3590">SaaS service&#34;? Through some obviously deeper integration?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3594"><strong>Avery: </strong>Sure. So the simple quick answer, or the answer a lot</span> <span data-timestamp="3597">of people are doing right now which requires no special software integration is you just</span> <span data-timestamp="3600">set up a Tailscale subnet router, you configure that subnet</span> <span data-timestamp="3604">router for a couple of IP addresses that are the IP address of the</span> <span data-timestamp="3607">public facing server for this customer.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3610">Then that customer has that subnet router in network, so</span> <span data-timestamp="3614">everybody at that company using Tailscale will funnel the traffic</span> <span data-timestamp="3617">just for your service through that one subnet router and it&#39;ll always</span> <span data-timestamp="3620">come from that one address, and then you can create the IP block list for just that one</span> <span data-timestamp="3624">address. Even though they&#39;re not all in the office.</span> <span data-timestamp="3626">So you&#39;re not running all of their traffic through a single point, you&#39;re just</span> <span data-timestamp="3629">routing only the traffic that&#39;s intended for</span> <span data-timestamp="3633">you through that single point.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3634"><strong>Marc: </strong>Yeah. Similar to the exit node that you had the link to earlier, but it&#39;s</span> <span data-timestamp="3638">targeted?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3639"><strong>Avery: </strong>Yeah. But not all of your traffic so it doesn&#39;t slow things down or add latency for</span> <span data-timestamp="3642">the average thing you&#39;re doing.</span> <span data-timestamp="3644">Then the more fancy version is if you can get them to use Tailscale,</span> <span data-timestamp="3648">you could actually share your Tailscale node with their</span> <span data-timestamp="3652">network and then you&#39;d have an actual encrypted connection.</span> <span data-timestamp="3656">But then they have to be on Tailscale and you have to have Tailscale integrated, so a</span> <span data-timestamp="3659">little more work to do. But that&#39;s what Materialize did.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3661"><strong>Marc: </strong>Yeah. That&#39;s super interesting.</span> <span data-timestamp="3663">Thanks.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3664"><strong>Avery: </strong>No problem.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3665"><strong>Benjie: </strong>Well, I am going to have to go listen to this episode three</span> <span data-timestamp="3668">times to make sure I understand everything that you said.</span> <span data-timestamp="3671">But this has been super informative, really interesting.</span> <span data-timestamp="3675">I wish we had those extra five hours because I think I have</span> <span data-timestamp="3678">400 more questions for you, but I think we&#39;re up on time</span> <span data-timestamp="3682">here. Marc, did you have anything else to ask before we</span> <span data-timestamp="3685">wrap up or anything else?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3687"><strong>Marc: </strong>No, I think we went through it. Avery, did we miss anything that you want to share?</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3690"><strong>Avery: </strong>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve missed anything.</span> <span data-timestamp="3691">If I was to very quickly summarize the thing I try to</span> <span data-timestamp="3695">tell everybody about Tailscale is it really does only take five</span> <span data-timestamp="3698">minutes. I know you don&#39;t believe me, but please just try it.</span> <span data-timestamp="3700">It&#39;s in the App Store. You don&#39;t have to do anything, click, click, click,</span> <span data-timestamp="3704">you log in with your Google account or whatever, and now your connection</span> <span data-timestamp="3707">is made.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3707">When people actually try it, that&#39;s when they</span> <span data-timestamp="3710">realize how amazing it is.</span> <span data-timestamp="3712">You can hear people tell you 100 times and not</span> <span data-timestamp="3716">believe them, but when you try it you can get it.</span> <span data-timestamp="3719">We hear that over and over again, it&#39;s kind of funny how many people are like, &#34;Okay, I</span> <span data-timestamp="3722">set aside my Saturday to install Tailscale, and I&#39;m</span> <span data-timestamp="3725">like 15 minutes in and now I have to find something else to do with</span> <span data-timestamp="3729">my Saturday.&#34; So that&#39;s the most important thing about</span> <span data-timestamp="3732">Tailscale, is I know you don&#39;t believe me, but it is that easy.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3736"><strong>Benjie: </strong>I for one, I&#39;ve played with Tailscale in the past.</span> <span data-timestamp="3739">But I&#39;m going to take some time this Saturday and install it somewhere as well.</span> <span data-timestamp="3743">I&#39;m convinced. Well, look, Avery, we really appreciate</span> <span data-timestamp="3746">having you on. And you know what?</span> <span data-timestamp="3749">Maybe we&#39;ll have you guys back and we&#39;ll talk about some of the</span> <span data-timestamp="3752">applications for some of this stuff in the CNCF ecosystem.</span> <span data-timestamp="3755">But I think we can all extrapolate how cool this is</span> <span data-timestamp="3758">and where all of it&#39;s going.</span> <span data-timestamp="3760">So thanks so much for being on and really appreciate the time.</span></p><p><span data-timestamp="3764"><strong>Avery: </strong>Awesome. Well, it&#39;s been great to talk to you as well.</span></p></div></div>
