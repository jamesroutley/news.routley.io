    <h1>&#39;Unstoppable force&#39; of solar power propels world to 40% clean electricity</h1>

      <p>Clean power provided 40% of the world&#39;s electricity last year for the first time since the 1940s, new figures show.</p><p>Clean energy comes from nuclear and renewable sources like wind and solar.</p>
<p>The milestone has been reached thanks to the &#34;staggering&#34; rise of solar, which has doubled in just three years, energy thinktank Ember said in its new report.</p><p>And solar was the fastest-growing electricity source for the 20th year in a row.</p><p>It now provides 7% of the world&#39;s electricity.</p>
<p>But it remains eclipsed by wind, which grew to 8% last year, and nuclear to 9%.</p><p>Hydropower - produced by running water, usually from rivers or reservoirs, and the world&#39;s oldest and largest single source of renewable power - has hovered at 14%.</p><p>Phil MacDonald, Ember&#39;s managing director, said: &#34;Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force.</p><p>&#34;As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world&#39;s ever-increasing demand for electricity.&#34;</p>

<p>Nuclear energy is considered a clean energy source because it produces almost zero greenhouse gases or other air pollutants.</p><p>The report&#39;s findings come as US President Donald Trump, in charge of the world&#39;s second most polluting country, <strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/the-climate-rules-trump-has-ripped-up-already-13293428" target="_blank">restricts offshore wind farms</a> </strong>and seeks to expand the mining and burning of coal in a bid to fuel booming AI data centres.</p><p>China and <a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/india-5990/1" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a>, the world&#39;s largest and third largest polluting countries respectively, are steaming ahead with their clean power plans.</p><p>More than half the world&#39;s new solar electricity came from <a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/china-5869/1" target="_blank"><strong>China</strong></a> last year - though it is still <strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/new-coal-plants-in-china-soar-despite-president-xi-s-pledge-to-strictly-control-dirtiest-fuel-13112101" target="_blank">building new coal power</a></strong> plants too.</p><p>Professor Xunpeng Shi, president of the International Society for Energy Transition Studies (ISETS), said: &#34;The future of the global power system is being shaped in Asia, with China and India at the heart of the energy transition.&#34;</p><p><strong>Electricity demand on the rise</strong></p><p>Despite the rise in renewable power, electricity from more polluting fossil fuels crept up by 1.4% last year due to surging demand, meaning emissions from the sector rose too to an all-time high.</p><p>Ember had previously predicted that these emissions <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/renewable-power-reaches-record-30-of-global-electricity-13131048" target="_blank"><strong>would peak in 2023</strong></a>.</p>     <a href="https://news.sky.com/download-app" target="blank" data-tracking-label="ui-app-promo-download-link" data-type="" data-component-name="ui-app-promo">

<p>But a series of heatwaves thwarted those expectations, as the world turned up the air conditioning to cope with hot weather turbocharged by <a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/climate-change-6161" target="_blank"><strong>climate change</strong></a> and the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/2023-was-worlds-hottest-year-on-record-and-2024-could-be-worse-13044196" target="_blank"><strong>El Nino weather phenomenon</strong></a>, which has since subsided.</p><p>Increases in AI, electric vehicles and heat pumps are also driving up electricity demand.</p>     
<p>Ember forecasts the growth in clean power will soon outpace the growth in demand, helping to displace fossil fuels from the system.</p><p>Bruce Douglas, chief executive of the Global Renewables Alliance, said: &#34;Despite geopolitical and economic headwinds, the renewables industry delivered an additional 858 TWh of generation to the system last year - more than the combined annual electricity consumption of the UK and France.&#34;</p>
