<h4><a href="https://milkytracker.org/news/2020/07/30/domain-renewal/">Domain renewal</a></h4>
<p>A couple of years ago I was contacted by the owner of the domain name <a href="http://milkytracker.org">http://milkytracker.org</a>, who after some time had a change of heart and kindly decided to help us out one last time by transferring ownership of the domain to us. We really appreciate this, and I am thrilled that we can now keep this domain maintained and pointing to the project we all love, and so for that, you have our sincere gratitude. Thankyou!</p>

<p>Since then, I have gladly been renewing this domain when it expired, and whilst it isn’t a huge amount of money, it’s <em>something</em>, and when the expiry date drew nearer this year, I thought I’d <a href="https://twitter.com/_d0pefish_/status/1285177100094316544">reach out to the community</a> for help with the costs.</p>

<p>The response has been absolutely phenomenal, and I was amazed by the generosity of MilkyTracker’s users and supporters.</p>

<p>I’m delighted to announce that as of today, <a href="http://milkytracker.org">http://milkytracker.org</a> has now been renewed for <strong>5</strong> years, and we won’t need to worry about the domain until the <strong>23rd of August, 2025</strong>!</p>

<p>Our sincere thanks go out to all who donated to the domain fund, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arabek</li>
  <li>Mantratronic</li>
  <li>Marcus Karlbowski</li>
  <li>Matt Forshaw</li>
  <li>PROTODOME</li>
  <li>syphus</li>
</ul>

<p>We can also be equally grateful to the supporters who preferred to stay anonymous, so many thanks to you too - please get in touch if I’ve made a mistake and you’d like to be added to the list!</p>

<p>Finally, we have made some changes to how our domains are set up:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://milkytracker.org">http://milkytracker.org</a> now directly resolves to GitHub Pages, our web host. <strong>This is now the primary address for the website</strong>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://milkytracker.titandemo.org">http://milkytracker.titandemo.org</a> is now a redirect that will forward you to <a href="http://milkytracker.org">http://milkytracker.org</a>. Shoutout to neoman of TiTAN for assisting with reconfiguring the subdomain!</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you are all doing well during this strange and disruptive year with the pandemic and all, so stay safe and keep on tracking!</p>

<h4><a href="https://milkytracker.org/news/2016/11/09/website-back-up-and-running/">Website back up and running</a></h4>
<p>Hello all - a quick update for the website, as it’s been a while and some things have changed!</p>

<p>MilkyTracker’s website has now been moved over to GitHub Pages alongside the source code, so that it’s easier to update and so that we don’t risk losing access to it any more. Unfortunately, our previous domain at <a href="http://milkytracker.org">http://milkytracker.org</a> has been lost and the owner is unwilling to co-operate with us in having it point to the correct location.</p>

<p>Thankfully, our friends at <em>TiTAN</em> have given us a new subdomain, so please update your bookmarks to <strong><a href="http://milkytracker.titandemo.org">http://milkytracker.titandemo.org</a></strong>.</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason you are unable to reach us at the above address, <a href="http://milkytracker.github.io">http://milkytracker.github.io</a> should always point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <em>Deltafire</em> and I have slowly been preparing a new release! If you can’t wait for the binaries, please feel free to check out our <em>pending</em> branch over at <a href="http://github.com/milkytracker/milkytracker">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to our friend <em>maep</em>, your old Tiger can now also run the new MilkyTracker. Check out the <a href="https://milkytracker.org/downloads/">downloads</a>. The site and documentation also got a couple of fixes and <em>Valerio</em> tells us the quick reference printouts will soon be up to date. So if you’re planning to print out and laminate and/or frame some PDFs, you might want to wait over the weekend.</p>

<p>A new year, a new release.  This release contains many bug-fixes, several small additions/improvements and a change of license for MilkyTracker’s player library (MilkyPlay) from GPL to BSD (meaning you are now free to use it in your own applications/demos/games without having to release your source code. Note: the rest of MilkyTracker remains GPL).</p>

<p>The user manual and FAQ have also been updated.</p>

<h4><a href="https://milkytracker.org/news/2008/06/05/port-round-up/">Port round-up</a></h4>
<p>Since the release of MilkyTracker v0.90.80 as open source, new software distributions have been adopting it at a steady pace. The long-awaited Ubuntu package is also out already, and has been for a while too! Yeah, we didn’t know either for quite some time, due to a delay on the package search page we were monitoring. Other distributions that nowadays offer MilkyTracker include (but aren’t necessarily limited to) Arch Linux, Debian, Enlisy, FreeBSD, Gentoo, NetBSD and SUSE. Let us know if there’s more.</p>

<p>Varthall’s port for Amiga OS 4 was done in due time and we’re awaiting to hear about more positive developments from the Amiga front. Also, by request, a G3 compatible OS X version was built.
<cite>“I found a new use for my old white iBook: tracking! It’s now called MilkyBook. :)”</cite>, commented satisfied user azer4.</p>

<p>We would like to remind people that if they’re doing something interesting with the source code, please let us know so we can spread the news. That’s about it, nothing big, but at least I got to clean up the news page a little. ;)</p>

<h4><a href="https://milkytracker.org/news/2008/04/13/milkytracker-v0.90.80-is-out/">MilkyTracker v0.90.80 is out</a></h4>
<p>This is a big release for us and we hope you’ll like it too. As usual, the new
version fixes several bugs and replay issues but more interestingly, the code
refactoring has resulted in two things: A) Cool new features. B) MilkyTracker is
now open source (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License"><abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr></a>). That’s right, dig in, patch, port, maintain, you are
welcome to do so. Linux distributions can also now include MilkyTracker in their
sofware repositories, so spread the word. We’d also like to see some quality
player plugins and whatnot come out of this.</p>

<p>You might have already noticed but with the new release, the website was also
rebooted and the <a href="https://milkytracker.org/docs/MilkyTracker.html">manual</a> now has a comprehensive list
of the <a href="https://milkytracker.org/docs/MilkyTracker.html#effects">effect commands</a> with their
explanations. Hoping to serve you better and all in all, provide a better
MilkyTracker experience. If you’re still reading this, now would be a good time
to stop and go get your copy of MilkyTracker from <a href="https://milkytracker.org/downloads/">downloads</a>. For
more reading, check out the <a href="https://milkytracker.org/docs/ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a>.</p>

<p><del>PS The AmigaOS port will be up in a few days.</del></p>
