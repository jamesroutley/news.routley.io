    <h1>Hazel: A live functional programming environment featuring typed holes</h1>

        <h2>Quick Summary</h2><p>
        Hazel is a live functional programming environment that is able to typecheck, manipulate, and even run
        incomplete programs, i.e. programs with holes. <strong>There are no meaningless editor states.</strong>
      </p></div>
      <div id="about">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          When programming, we spend a substantial amount of our time working with program text
          that is not yet a formally complete program, e.g. because there are blank spots, type errors or merge
          conflicts at various locations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conventional programming language definitions assign no formal meaning to structures like these, so we are
          left without live feedback about the behavior of even complete portions of the program.
          Moreover, program editors and other tools have no choice but to resort to complex and <i>ad hoc</i> heuristics
          to
          provide various useful language services (like code completion, type inspection, and code navigation) without
          gaps in service.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are developing a more principled approach to working with incomplete programs, rooted in (contextual modal
          and gradual) type theory.
          We model incomplete programs as programs with <em>holes</em>, which (1) stand for parts of the program that
          are missing; and (2) serve as membranes
          around parts of the program that are erroneous or, in the collaborative setting, conflicted.
        </p>

        <p>The following papers describes our research vision in more detail.
        </p>

        <h2>Hazel</h2>
        <p>
          We are first implementing these ideas into <strong>Hazel</strong>, a web-based programming environment for an
          <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>/ML-like functional programming language designed around
          typed-hole-driven development.
        </p>

        <p>Uniquely, every incomplete program that you can construct using Hazel&#39;s language of edit actions is both
          <em>statically</em> and <em>dynamically</em> well-defined, i.e. it has
          a (possibly incomplete) type, and you can run it to produce a (possibly incomplete) result. Consequently,
          Hazel serves as an elegant platform for research on the future of programming (and programming education).
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          The <a href="./hazel/hazel.html">Hazel implementation</a> is a work-in-progress. As Hazel evolves, we plan to apply it first to teach introductory functional programming courses. As it evolves further, we plan to use Hazel to do data anlysis, music and visual art. One day, we plan for Hazel to serve as the foundation of a new kind of computational wiki.</p>
          -->

        <!--
          <p class="col-md-12">
          This substantially simplifies the design of a
          number of powerful editor services, and it substantially tightens the feedback loop between the programmer and the programming environment.
          Put pithily, Hazel is as live as it gets!
