    <h1>Immutable releases are now generally available on GitHub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>GitHub releases now support immutability, adding a new layer of supply chain security. With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish—and your users consume—remains secure and trustworthy.</p>
<h3 id="about-immutable-releases" id="about-immutable-releases"><a href="#about-immutable-releases">About immutable releases<span aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
<p>Immutable releases offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable assets</strong>: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can’t be added, modified, or deleted. This helps protect distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Tag protection</strong>: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can’t be deleted or moved.</li>
<li><strong>Release attestations</strong>: Immutable releases receive signed attestations so you can easily verify the authenticity and integrity of assets, both on GitHub and in external environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-enable-immutable-releases" id="how-to-enable-immutable-releases"><a href="#how-to-enable-immutable-releases">How to enable immutable releases<span aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
<p>You can enable immutable releases at the repository or organization level in your settings. Once enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>All new releases are immutable (i.e., assets are locked and tags are protected).</li>
<li>Existing releases remain mutable unless you republish them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disabling immutability doesn’t affect releases created while it was enabled. They remain immutable.</p>
<h3 id="release-attestations-and-verification" id="release-attestations-and-verification"><a href="#release-attestations-and-verification">Release attestations and verification<span aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
<p>Release attestations let you verify that an artifact is authentic and unchanged, even outside GitHub. Attestations use the <a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/about/bundle/">Sigstore bundle format</a>, so you can easily verify releases and assets using the GitHub CLI or integrate with any Sigstore-compatible tooling to automate policy enforcement in your CI/CD pipelines.
