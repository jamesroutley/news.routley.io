            <span>Abstract:</span>  Most open-domain dialogue systems suffer from forgetting important
information, especially in a long-term conversation. Existing works usually
train the specific retriever or summarizer to obtain key information from the
past, which is time-consuming and highly depends on the quality of labeled
data. To alleviate this problem, we propose to recursively generate summaries/
memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability.
Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue
contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and
following contexts. Finally, the LLM can easily generate a highly consistent
response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method using
ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, and the experiments on the widely-used public
dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a
long-context conversation. Notably, our method is a potential solution to
enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. Code and scripts will be
released later.
