    <h1>Terminology isn&#39;t universal</h1>

  <div><p>A little while back, I wrote that we shouldn&#39;t say &#34;auth&#34; but should use <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/blog/lets-say-instead-of-auth/">other terms instead</a>.
I stand by my argument in general, but it also has another side to it: my suggested terminology makes sense in some domains, but not in <em>all</em> domains.
And that&#39;s because terminology isn&#39;t—and <em>can&#39;t be</em>—universal.</p>
<p>After I wrote that blog post, I got an email from someone who had a really good point: the word &#34;login&#34; is often confused for &#34;username&#34;!
My terminology suggestion doesn&#39;t work in all cases, so what&#39;s the right word to use instead?
Unfortunately... there isn&#39;t one.
There&#39;s no one pair of words that will work perfectly.</p>
<p>Terminology makes sense relative to the context it&#39;s in.
If I say &#34;node&#34; to you, what does that mean?</p>
<p>My guess is you will think of either a node in a network/graph or a node as in a server.
But you could also think of a lymph node or myriad other things!</p>
<p>The other term you could use in a graph context is &#34;vertex&#34;.
This is often clearer, but it runs into issues if you&#39;re talking about anything with geometry!</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I ran into this headlong at my first job, working on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TigerGraph">graph database</a>.
When talking about a graph in a distributed system, if you use the word &#34;node&#34; it is confusing:
Do you mean a node of the graph or a node of the distributed system?
We ended up choosing &#34;vertex&#34; to mean the thing in a graph, and that worked—but would not work if we also wanted to represent geometry, like in, say, a graph visualization where you&#39;d be drawing vertices of polygons.</p>
<p>A lot of this confusion, I think, comes from when different domains <em>overlap</em> or border each other.
Words which make sense in one domain will leak into the other, but they&#39;ll end up being confusing or imprecise there.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>So what do we do about it?</p>
<p>A lot of it is accepting that we will run into challenges here, and there&#39;s not always a perfect solution.
If we run into imprecise or confusing language, that could mean that suboptimal word choices were made.
But there might <em>not</em> be a better choice!
Some confusion will always be possible, and we have to roll with that and be understanding about it.</p>
<p>We also have to remember that there still might be a better choice!
Even if it&#39;s not perfect, we can go for <em>better</em>, and we can improve the status quo.
We can choose words that are more clear in <em>our</em> domain, <em>our</em> context, and make things clearer there.</p>
<p>The other thing is we have to accept that terminology can&#39;t be universal.
Just because terminology works in one domain doesn&#39;t mean it will apply to <em>all</em> domains.
This is inherent to the whole issue, because if it were universal then there would be one single optimal choice.
But there&#39;s not.
And since it&#39;s not universal, we sort of have to expect that sometimes we&#39;ll run into terms that are imprecise or confusing, and that they&#39;re chosen to make sense <em>there</em>.</p>
