    <h1>Compiling at Compile Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>This is a blog post about <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/compfuck">a cute hack I threw together on a long train ride</a>. The gist of it is that I wrote a Brainfuck compiler that emits Carp code, in Carp. It’s entirely based on macros and dynamic functions, meaning that it executes at compile time. Basically, you have a compiler running inside another compiler.</p>
<p>The techniques I used to build this are not super advanced, but people seemed interested in knowing how it works, so I decided to write a little tutorial about it. You’ll learn a little bit about Brainfuck, a little bit about Carp, a little bit about macros, and a little bit about compilers—or so I hope.</p>
<p>Let’s get this party started!</p>
<h2 id="brainfuck-and-carp-partners-in-crime">Brainfuck and Carp, Partners in Crime</h2>
<p>Because this blog post doesn’t intend to be a comprehensive introduction either to Brainfuck or to Carp, I’m only going to talk about the parts of both languages that we’re going to use for building our little compiler.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-of-the-game-brainfuck">The rules of the game: Brainfuck</h3>
<p>We’ll quickly review the rules of Brainfuck for those of you unfamiliar with it, though I’d really like to recommend you read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">a more comprehensive resource</a>.</p>
<p>Brainfuck is a language that emulates a tape, composed of a number of cells containing numbers, and a tape head that looks at one cell at a time—very similar to a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>. Programs control the tape head. The head can move forwards and backwards on the tape, increment and decrement values in cells, read and write current values as ASCII characters to the screen, and loop. This leaves us with eight operations in total, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&gt;</code>: Move forwards one cell on the tape.</li>
<li><code>&lt;</code>: Move backwards one cell on the tape.</li>
<li><code>+</code>: Increment the value in the current cell.</li>
<li><code>-</code>: Decrement the value in the current cell.</li>
<li><code>.</code>: Print the value of the current cell as an ASCII character.</li>
<li><code>,</code>: Read in an ASCII character as a integer and put it into the current cell.</li>
<li><code>[</code>: If the value in the current cell is not zero, continue to the next character. If it is, jump to the matching <code>]</code>.</li>
<li><code>]</code>: If the value in the current cell is not zero, jump back to the matching <code>[</code>. If it is zero, continue to the next character. Together, the instructions <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> effectively form a <code>while (value != 0)</code> loop with the instructions between them as body.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this blog post, this is all you need to know about Brainfuck.</p>
<h3 id="carp-at-compile-time">Carp at Compile Time</h3>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Implementing_the_Builder_Pattern_in_Carp.html">written about</a> <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp_and_derive.html">Carp macros</a> before. They are similar to macros in other Lisps, meaning that they are functions that run at compile time and are often—but not always—used to generate code. This is perfect for our use case, and we’re going to write a few macros and dynamic functions—compile time functions that, unlike macros, evaluate their arguments—that act as our compiler.</p>
<p>Carp also already has a few functions that manipulate strings at compile time, which should come in handy for us. These functions have legitimate use cases—inside the Carp standard library, we use it for the <code>fmt</code> macro, among other things—, but today we’re going to bend them as far as they will.</p>
<p>The API that I envision for this blog post is simple. We will have one function called <code>brainfuck-translate</code> that will serve as an entrypoint into our compiler. It will take in a literal string and generate executable Carp code that is then consumed by the Carp compiler to generate a binary that will execute the Carp equivalent of the Brainfuck that was passed in originally.</p>
<pre><code>; this will print all ascii characters
(brainfuck-compile &#34;+[.+]&#34;)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 1: The full API of our compiler.
</p>
<p>Now that we have a plan for attack, let’s write some code.</p>
<h2 id="a-translation-job">A Translation Job</h2>
<p>To start with, we’ll have to think about what we want to generate. Importantly, we’ll have to generate a wrapper function that contains the Carp code. We could name that function, or give the user the opportunity to name the function themselves, but in this blog post, we’re just going to generate a <code>main</code> function so that we can generate an executable without any hassle.</p>
<p>Our main function will also need to setup a tape and tape head for the program to use. Traditionally, the tape is 30,000 cells long, and we represent it as an array of bytes. Then the head just has to store the current index.</p>
<p>Let’s try and create that in a Carp macro!</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro brainfuck-compile [prog]
  (list &#39;defn &#39;main []
    (cons &#39;let-do
      (cons (array &#39;t &#39;(Array.replicate 30000 &amp;0)
                   &#39;h 0)
        (brainfuck-compile-body prog 0)))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 2: The entry point.
</p>
<p>So, what happens when we run this, assuming that <code>brainfuck-compile-body</code> has been stubbed out? We end up with a skeleton for a Brainfuck program that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>(defn main []
  (let-do [t (Array.replicate 30000 &amp;0) ; our tape
           h 0] ; our tape head
    ; our program goes here
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 3: A compiled stub.
</p>
<p>Already, this is not bad! We have all the setup, and we know where our code must go! With all of that out of the way, it is time to look at actually compiling the code, a job for <code>brainfuck-compile-body</code>.</p>
<p>We’re going to iterate through the program string until we’ve reached the end, compiling from start to finish. Sometimes we might need to jump back to the start of the loop, so we pass in an index of where we currently are.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic brainfuck-compile-body [prog pi]
  (if (= pi (String.length prog))
    &#39;()
    (let [chr (String.char-at prog pi)]
      (if (= \] chr)
        &#39;()
        (let [incr-c (brainfuck-compile-instruction
                        chr prog i)]
          (let [incr (car incr-c)
                compiled (cadr incr-c)]
            (cons compiled
                  (brainfuck-compile-body
                    prog (+ pi 1)))))))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 4: Compiling the body.
</p>
<p>Compiling the body is pretty straightforward as well: we check whether we’ve reached the end of the string. If we have we terminate, returning an empty list. If not, we take the character that we want to compile right now. If it’s a closing parenthesis, then we terminate as well, because we’re inside a loop body that was closed<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If none of the premature exit conditions apply, we compile the character using <code>brainfuck-compile-instruction</code>. This will return a pair of an incrementor values that will tell us by how much we have to advance the index—that will be explained in more depth shortly—, and the compiled isntructions. We desconstruct that pair using the <code>car</code> and <code>cadr</code> list operations, and recurse into the next instruction. That way we’ll incrementally build our instructions until we end up with a full program.</p>
<p>At this point it might seem like we haven’t done an awful lot of compiling, which is true. Most of the raw translation work happens in <code>brainfuck-compile-instruction</code>, which is, at its core, extremely simple. Let’s take a look, shall we?</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic brainfuck-compile-instruction [c prog i]
  (if (= \+ f)
    (list 1 &#39;(Array.aupdate! &amp;t h &amp;(fn [x] (mod (Int.inc @x) 255))))
  (if (= \- f)
    (list 1 &#39;(Array.aupdate! &amp;t h &amp;(fn [x] (max 0 (Int.dec @x)))))
  (if (= \&gt; f)
    (list 1 &#39;(set! h (+ h 1)))
   (if (= \&lt; f)
    (list 1 &#39;(set! h (- h 1)))
   (if (= \. f)
    (list 1 &#39;(IO.print &amp;(str (Char.from-int @(Array.nth &amp;t h)))))
   (if (= \, f)
    (list 1 &#39;(Array.aset! &amp;t h (Char.to-int (IO.get-char))))
   (if (= \[ f)
    (let [end (search-matching-bracket
                  (String.suffix-string s (+ i 1)) 1)]
      (list (+ end 1)
        (list &#39;while &#39;(/= &amp;0 (Array.nth &amp;t h))
          (cons &#39;do
            (let [subs (String.substring s (+ i 1) end)]
              (brainfuck-compile-body subs 0))))))
    &#39;(1 ())))))))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 5: Compiling individual instructions.
</p>
<p>I’ve decided to use a bit of idiosyncratic formatting by putting all of the nested <code>if</code> expressions on the same level, because it’s basically one big <code>if-else</code> construct. At runtime, we could use <code>cond</code> for that, but since that is a macro as well, we can’t use it at compile time. Bummer.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what the individual instructions compile to. <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> use <code>Array.aupdate!</code> to increment and decrement the value under the tape head in place, respectively. <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> just <code>set!</code> the value of the tape head. <code>.</code> and <code>,</code> use the <code>IO</code> module to do their work. This is all pretty basic stuff. The only thing that stands out here is <code>[</code>, which generates slightly more complex code, namely a <code>while</code> loop. The body of that loop is generated by <code>brainfuck-compile-body</code> again, which is pretty cute. Now the early return of that function when encountering a <code>]</code> makes sense, too: we call the same function for compiling the top-level program body as all the nested loop bodies.</p>
<p>The incrementor that we return also falls into place now: since we’re taking care of loops in a bulk, we need the higher level to jump past that loop when we go back.</p>
<p>By now we’re mostly done, but what about <code>search-matching-bracket</code>? It will just hunt for the index of the matching bracket that closes our loop, and return its index. It’s mostly plumbing, but I’ll dump it here anyway:</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic search-matching-bracket [s m]
  (if (Dynamic.or (= (String.length s) 0) (= m 0))
    0
    (let [f (String.char-at s 0)]
      (inc (search-matching-bracket
            (String.tail s)
            (if (= \] f) (dec m) (if (= \[ f) (inc m) m)))))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 6: Hunting for the matching bracket.
</p>
<p>Basically, it keeps track of its current loop depth by keeping an index. Once that index is <code>0</code> or the string is empty<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, we’re done, if not we’ll keep hunting. We get the first character and decrement the depth if it is a <code>]</code> and increment if it’s a <code>[</code>, otherwise we leave it untouched. Then we recurse using the rest of the string and the updated depth.</p>
<p>And that’s it! In just under x45 lines we wrote a compile-time Brainfuck compiler!</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>While the code for this compiler is indeed very concise, it’s not exactly pretty or graceful. If you wanted to make this better, you could tackle such things as good errors or proper function names instead of compiling everything into <code>main</code>. There is a lot to be desired here, but you can start from a working prototype!</p>
<p>The compiler is also not terribly fast. The compile-time Carp evaluator is a simple tree-walking interpreter, and it’s not optimized for speed. Still there are some low-hanging fruits in speeding this up, like avoiding rescanning the string when looking for closing loop parentheses. You can have pretty good fun with that I think!</p>
<p>You could also turn this compiler into an interpreter almost without effort. I’ll leave figuring out how—and maybe doing so—as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>Today we built a compiler entirely in macros. While this sounds impressive, when you get right down to it it was just a lot of string mangling, and a little bit of emitting code. This is not actually all that uncommon: if you don’t use a parser generator or framework, parsers tend to be extremely big. I guess that means we need a compile-time parser combinator framework.</p>
<p>All jokes aside, building this thing was a lot of fun, and I hope it was also fun to read and reason through it all. Have a good one, and see you soon!</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> This leads to a compiler bug that will terminate the compiler if there is an unmatched closing parenthesis, but for the purposes of this blog post that’s good enough.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> Like in <a href="#1">1</a>, this is actually a bug. We should probably error out and tell our user that something went wrong, but that would be handling errors gracefully, and we don’t do any of that stuff around these parts.</p>
