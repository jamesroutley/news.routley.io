            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We released Zulip Server 5.3 today! This is a security release, containing a minor security fix and several cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 5.2.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>
<p>We recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See the <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a> in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available on <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">chat.zulip.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes">Notable changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2022-31017: Fixed message edit event exposure in protected-history streams.</li>
<li>Adjusted upgrade steps to cause servers using PostgreSQL 14 to upgrade to PostgreSQL 14.4, which fixes an important potential database corruption issue.</li>
<li>Upgraded the asynchronous request handling to use Tornado 6.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when displaying the error message for a failed attempt to create a stream.</li>
<li>Optimized the steps during <code>upgrade-zulip</code>, to reduce the amount of server downtime.</li>
<li>Added a <code>--skip-restart</code> flag to <code>upgrade-zulip</code> which prepares the new version, but does not restart the server into it.</li>
<li>Stopped mirroring the entire remote Git repository directly into <code>/srv/zulip.git</code>. This mirroring removed local branches and confused the state of previous deployments.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause the <code>delete_old_unclaimed_attachments</code> command-line tool to remove attachments that were still referenced by deleted (but not yet permanently removed) messages.</li>
<li>Stopped enabling <code>USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST</code> by default, which was generally unneeded; the proxy documentation now clarifies when it is necessary.</li>
<li>Fixed the nginx configuration to include the default system-level nginx modules.</li>
<li>Only attempt to fix the <code>certbot</code> SSL renewal configuration if HTTPS is enabled; this addresses a regression in Zulip Server 5.2, where the upgrade would fail if an improperly configured certificate existed, but was both expired and not in use.</li>
<li>Improved proxy and database backup documentation.</li>
</ul>
