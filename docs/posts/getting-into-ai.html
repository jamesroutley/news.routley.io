    <h1>Ask HN: Getting into AI?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m a software engineer with ~10 years of experience in robotics and in more traditional full stack development. For the past year I&#39;ve been looking at all the progress happening in ML/AI and each day I&#39;m more convinced that there&#39;s a lot of game-changing stuff that will come out of it (what we&#39;re seeing with Stable Diffusion and GPT3 are some examples of this).</p><p>I would love to pivot my career from traditional backend/frontend web development type work towards, but I&#39;m struggling to put a plan in place.</p><p>- What would be the main topics to learn?
