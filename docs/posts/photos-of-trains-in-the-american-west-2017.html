    <h1>Photos of trains in the American West (2017)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><cite>(CNN) â€” </cite><span>Against the backdrop of bright blue sky and the red rocks of the Colorado River canyon, a mustard-yellow train steams through the rugged landscape, the words &#34;Union Pacific&#34; emblazoned on its side.</span></p><p><span>Little has changed in this striking scene since the late 19th century, when the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/travel/destinations/usa">United States</a> first began building a network of railroads across its vast land mass.</span></p><p><span>British photographer Jonathan Lewis has journeyed across America&#39;s most beautiful -- and most isolated -- terrains, photographing timeless trains in spectacular landscapes across the country&#39;s West.</span></p><p><span>Lewis&#39; pictures have a vintage postcard look -- but the photos in the book were all taken within the past 10 years.</span></p><p><span>&#34;A family holiday to Colorado in 2000 was the first time I visited the USA and saw my first American train in Denver,&#34; Lewis tells CNN Travel.</span></p><p><span><h3>America&#39;s railroad history</h3></span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170927165731-union-pacific-sd70ace-8357-sullivans-curve-cajon-17th-march-2014.jpg" alt="Union Pacific SD70ACe 8357, Sullivan&#39;s Curve, Cajon, 17th March 2014"/></p><p>This Union Pacific train was photographed by Lewis at Sullivan&#39;s Curve, Cajon Pass, California.</p><p>Jonathan Lewis/Amberley Books</p></div><p><span>The first US transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, changing the path of America&#39;s history.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Once a railway reached an area it was able to develop its industry -- as it had an efficient means of moving its goods,&#34; says Lewis, who is fascinated by the link between America&#39;s history and its railway network.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Many towns were founded by railway companies to serve the railway.&#34;</span></p><p><span>The US no longer operates many long-distance passenger services, but railroads remain integral for freight trains.</span></p><div><a aria-current="false" href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/trains-western-us-photo-book/index.html?gallery=3"><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170927165251-bnsf-c44-9w-skykomish-washington.jpg" alt="BNSF C44-9W, Skykomish, Washington"/></p></div></a><p>America&#39;s railways -- including the route passing through Skykomish, Washington, pictured -- remain crucial to the country&#39;s transport network.</p><p>Jonathan Lewis/Amberley Books</p></div><p><span>Plus, the path of the railways still plays a part in the way we get across America -- even if we don&#39;t go by train.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Today many long-distance roads and interstates follow the original route of the railway,&#34; explains Lewis. &#34;This was the route which was developed and is often the best route.&#34;</span></p><p><span>Notably, railways in America are still run by private companies: &#34;They have remained private companies throughout,&#34; says Lewis. &#34;Each with their own unique paint scheme and different operating cultures.&#34;</span></p><p><span><h3>Great plains, great trains</h3></span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170927165020-alaska-railroad-2001-snow-river-23rd-july-2010.jpg" alt="Alaska Railroad 2001, Snow River, 23rd July 2010"/></p><p>The Western railroads weave through spectacular scenery, such as Snow River, Alaska. </p><p>Jonathan Lewis/Amberley Books</p></div><p><span>The railroads are also intertwined with the landscape of these rural American locations: &#34;Railways had to be built through deserts and over mountain passes, which were thought to be impossible at the time,&#34; explains Lewis.</span></p><p><span>It is the combination of classic trains -- some locomotives date from the 1960s and &#39;70s -- combined with stunning landscapes, that make Lewis&#39; images so striking.</span></p><div><a aria-current="false" href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/trains-western-us-photo-book/index.html?gallery=12"><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170927165311-bnsf-es44ac-6280-palmer-divide-at-larkspur-colorado-19th-september-2011.jpg" alt="BNSF ES44AC 6280, Palmer Divide at Larkspur, Colorado, 19th September 2011"/></p></div></a><p>Lewis plans his images carefully to ensure maximum sunlight, as in this photo at Larkspur, Colorado.</p><p>Jonathan Lewis/Amberley Books</p></div><p><span>Lewis extensively researches the types of train and the surrounding scenery before he takes the photos.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Doing research beforehand is important to understand what the railway operations are like,&#34; he says. &#34;And at what time of day a train might show up on less busy railway lines.&#34;</span></p><p><span>&#34;It is also important to study the route of the railway line on a map -- to know what the most scenic sections of line are, and what locations are going to have the sun in the perfect position to photograph the train.&#34;</span></p><div><a aria-current="false" href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/trains-western-us-photo-book/index.html?gallery=10"><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170927165545-union-pacific-6690-and-ac4460cw-7324-biggs-orgegon-12th-september-2010.jpg" alt="Union Pacific 6690 and AC4460CW 7324, Biggs, Orgegon, 12th September 2010"/></p></div></a><p>Lewis tries to get the whole train in the image whenever possible, as in this photo of a Union Pacific train in Oregon.</p><p>Jonathan Lewis/Amberley Books</p></div><p><span>The sweeping shots encompass sky, trees, canyons and wildlife.</span></p><p><span>&#34;It helps to get scenery in above the train, which can often only be done from an elevated viewpoint, which shows the train snaking through the Western American landscape,&#34; says Lewis.</span></p><p><span>&#34;I think it is an important aspect of railway photography, where possible, to get the whole train in the photograph.&#34;</span></p><p><span>Sometimes this involves a trek to capture the perfect shot.</span></p><p><span>&#34;It is sometimes necessary to walk up to a couple of miles and climb a hill to reach the required location,&#34; says Lewis.</span></p><p><span><h3>American dreaming</h3></span></p><div><a aria-current="false" href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/trains-western-us-photo-book/index.html?gallery=5"><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170927165712-union-pacific-sd40-2-3246-potash-in-the-colorado-river-canyon-31st-august-2007.jpg" alt="Union Pacific SD40-2 3246, Potash in the Colorado River Canyon, 31st August 2007"/></p></div></a><p>A Union Pacific train passes Utah&#39;s dramatic red rock formations.  </p><p>Jonathan Lewis/Amberley Books</p></div><p><span>Lewis&#39; interest in trains is not specific to the US. </span></p><p><span>&#34;I also do railway photography much closer to home all over the UK, especially in northern England and Scotland, as well as in Canada,&#34; he says.</span></p><p><span>But it&#39;s photographing America&#39;s railroads that&#39;s become his passion -- and has allowed him to see a side to the country he wouldn&#39;t have seen otherwise.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Traveling around America photographing trains takes you to spectacular places one would have little reason to visit, a long way off the normal tourist trail,&#34; he says.</span></p></div></div></div>
