We worked about 1,5 year with over +100 people from around the world. We developed the first ‘Pro’ Machines, a Sheetpress, Starterkits, Business calculators, new moulds, products and more. Looking back this was quite a unique moment. A lot of passionate work was done by volunteers and everything was shared Open Source online for free. Here some of the things we made<br/></p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa486e30e592d1032dd32_v4.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 96vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 699.9921875px, (max-width: 1919px) 71vw, 799.9921875px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa486e30e592d1032dd32_v4-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa486e30e592d1032dd32_v4-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa486e30e592d1032dd32_v4-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa486e30e592d1032dd32_v4-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa486e30e592d1032dd32_v4-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa486e30e592d1032dd32_v4.jpg 2004w" alt=""/></p><p><img src="https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SGTIk.gif"/></p><p>With a relatively small amount of money, we reached a global impact in 2023 of over 1100 organzations in 56 countries, who recycled 1.400.000KG Plastic, they generated together a revenue of +$3.7 Million, employed 530 people, works with 3.405 volunteers and built 1.175 machines.

We share everything online for free because we believe recycling knowledge should be available for everyone. As a consequence we don’t generate enough income to pay a team all year around. But after Version 4 a small group of seven dedicated ambitious volunteers wanted to try and sustain Precious Plastic all year around. So we can continue development and have a bigger impact to reduce plastic waste. This by itself is a hard job but we also had some extra problems on the way</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 96vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 699.984375px, (max-width: 1919px) 71vw, 799.9921875px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace-p-3200.jpg 3200w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa6f962c412ee92336560_workspace.jpg 3893w" alt=""/></p><p><strong>#2 No business model</strong>One of the main goals of this small team was trying to find a business model that would serve Precious Plastic’s mission, bring income to sustain a team and not compete with the rest of the community. The last one is difficult, because our most logical and common model would be to sell machines and moulds. There are not many Open Source Hardware projects like Precious Plastic in the world. And the ones that exist mostly sell their products. Arduino sells their circuit boards, Prusa sells 3d printers. However in our case we’re also building a global network of machine builders that can provide local recycling equipment. We didn&#39;t want to compete with our own community.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa8bb671bebd39224838b_next%20options1.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 96vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 699.984375px, (max-width: 1919px) 71vw, 799.984375px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa8bb671bebd39224838b_next%20options1-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa8bb671bebd39224838b_next%20options1-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa8bb671bebd39224838b_next%20options1-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa8bb671bebd39224838b_next%20options1-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa8bb671bebd39224838b_next%20options1-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5e004b03e5da773c54823bfb/673fa8bb671bebd39224838b_next%20options1.jpg 2339w" alt=""/></p><p><strong>What is next?</strong>I’ve been thinking about this.
