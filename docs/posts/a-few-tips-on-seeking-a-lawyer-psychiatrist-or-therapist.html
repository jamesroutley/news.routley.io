<p data-block-key="ld1ok">Recently I&#39;ve helped a few folks as they sought professional help from lawyers, or mental health professionals such as psychiatrists or therapists. Here are a few tips; they&#39;re more relevant in the United States but might also apply elsewhere.</p><h3 data-block-key="3n91u">Lawyers/attorneys</h3><p data-block-key="92llk">Check out <a href="https://mefiwiki.com/wiki/Get_a_lawyer">the guidance that MetaFilter commenters have compiled in this wiki page</a>; I also previously wrote about <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2010/how-to-get-and-deal-with-a-lawyer/">How to Get and Deal With a Lawyer</a> about the initial steps of seeking and talking with a candidate.</p><p data-block-key="15u05">In general, assuming you are an individual person or one-person business, you should be able to get an your initial cost-free consultation with a lawyer to interview them and get a sense of whether they could help you with your problem. In that initial call, you should be able to tell them about your situation and about what you are having trouble with, and (if you have one) your goal. In my opinion, once you&#39;ve laid that out, they should be able to say something like:</p><blockquote data-block-key="128sb">OK, I understand that you want [this] outcome. You have [these 2-4 choices of ways to achieve that]. For each of those approaches: it might take [about this] long, cost [this range including their own fees and other costs] much, and have [this range] chance of success. Approach [C] has [additional risk R] in case that would be acceptable to you. I would be able to help you with [approaches A and D], but for [B] you&#39;d be on your own, and for [C] I&#39;d refer you to a colleague in a different specialty.</blockquote><p data-block-key="905hs">They might not be able to get all of that information to you in the initial conversation, but then something like it ought to come soon after in written form - maybe an informal email.</p><p data-block-key="9jbe5">I, personally, particularly like it when a lawyer can also help me understand: <i>why is this problem happening?</i> and <i>why are we required to do x?</i> Whatever the topic -- real estate, employment, etc. -- sometimes I find various requirements and customs frustrating because I don&#39;t understand the fundamental reasons for them. When I ask &#34;Why is this set up the way it is?&#34; I really like it when a lawyer can treat me as though I am capable of comprehending complicated topics, and can explain, e.g.,</p><blockquote data-block-key="e9cqq">The state has a policy interest in [xyz happening] and so [this is the basic structure they have set up to make that happen]. While maintaining that, they need to balance the interests of [group G] and [group H], and so the threshold for allowing [activity/exception J] is set at [threshold T].</blockquote><p data-block-key="6j8">Some lawyers can and will do this and I can work better with the ones who do.</p><h3 data-block-key="4qjnj">Mental health professionals</h3><p data-block-key="8sr8u">Again, <a href="https://mefiwiki.com/wiki/ThereIsHelp#Therapy">there&#39;s a rich list of resources in this MetaFilter wiki collection</a>. This should help whether you&#39;re looking for a more talk-style counselor or a psychiatrist. And it might also help you if you&#39;re seeking more of a coach.</p><p data-block-key="9mk7b">Some people get stuck on the step where the therapist&#39;s office has an intake or &#34;new patient&#34; form for you to fill out and there&#39;s an open-ended &#34;tell me about yourself&#34; question, like &#34;tell us about your situation and why you&#39;re seeking counseling&#34;. It can be really hard to articulate what you need in the moment you need it!</p><p data-block-key="8n1hq">So here&#39;s a basic template for what you could write in there.</p><p data-block-key="cer2h">All this is optional and <b>if it&#39;s too hard, write like a single sentence</b> saying &#34;I&#39;m struggling a lot right now and am looking for help coping with everyday activities.&#34; They can deal with that. They would rather you write that, and send it in, than never send it in because you couldn&#39;t find the right words.</p><p data-block-key="3nqr1">But: If you want more structure and detail in there, I suggest you <i>write a paragraph on your current situation and problems</i>. If you have the energy to write more, add a few sentences on <i>what you&#39;ve tried and want to try</i>. And if you feel driven to write more, add 3-4 sentences on your <i>context</i>.</p><p data-block-key="d2itq"><b>Current situation and problems</b>: the most important stuff to tell them. You don&#39;t need to be complete or detailed here. They just need a place to start. Like:</p><ul><li data-block-key="11ska">I feel fatigue even when I feel like I &#34;shouldn&#39;t&#34; be tired</li><li data-block-key="bnh8g">I have trouble concentrating, even on things I want to focus on</li><li data-block-key="42u0n">I have impulsive anger</li><li data-block-key="dd7cs">I have trouble making decisions</li></ul><p data-block-key="80qsa">One way to start here is to look at some Internet quiz or diagnostic checklist and copy stuff from there that resonates with you.</p><p data-block-key="33neh">In this paragraph, try to also note if there&#39;s a temporary or new situation you need to cope with, like grief from a recent death, or a really stressful work schedule.</p><p data-block-key="43jhk"><b>Things you&#39;ve tried, and what has helped/might help:</b> If you can summon the energy to write a 2nd paragraph, write this one. Stuff like:</p><ul><li data-block-key="5ubfg">I got a diet plan from a nutritionist</li><li data-block-key="el3jt">When I can do it, meditation calms me down</li><li data-block-key="5ncok">I was on an SSRI but the side effects were too awful to bear, but I would like to try a different med</li><li data-block-key="4j57b">I think I would like to role-play difficult conversations with someone</li></ul><p data-block-key="6smq5">It&#39;s okay to say &#34;I want to talk to a counselor to help me understand my problems and figure out what to do about them&#34; and not have any clear idea of the specifics.</p><p data-block-key="63khr"><b>Context:</b> If you can get yourself to write a third paragraph, write this one too. You could include:</p><ul><li data-block-key="7sjnh">key bio details: e.g. &#34;middle-aged white man&#34;</li><li data-block-key="b8644">whether you have a job, are a student, and/or are financially struggling</li><li data-block-key="fsof2">where you live - by yourself? with family?</li><li data-block-key="1g5n7">whether you&#39;re in any partnership/relationships, e.g., being married</li><li data-block-key="94cmj">key physical health stuff that affects your mental health, such as &#34;pain from an old leg injury makes it hard for me to exercise&#34; or &#34;have multiple sclerosis&#34;</li><li data-block-key="6nooi"><b>if you&#39;re up for it:</b> key big past experiences that continue to affect you, e.g., being a survivor of domestic abuse</li></ul><p data-block-key="97mce">Again! If this feels overwhelming, you can write a single sentence. You can copy and paste this one: &#34;I&#39;m struggling a lot right now and want to talk to someone about it.&#34; I wish you well.</p>
