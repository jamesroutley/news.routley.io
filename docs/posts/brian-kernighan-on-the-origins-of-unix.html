Once again, the COVID pandemic has forced <a href="https://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a> to go virtual, thus
depriving your editor of a couple of 24-hour, economy-class, middle-seat
experiences.  This naturally leads to a set of mixed feelings.  LCA has
always put a priority on interesting keynote talks, and that has carried
over into the online event; the opening keynote for LCA 2022 was given by
Brian Kernighan.  Despite being seen as a founder of our community,
Kernighan is rarely seen at Linux events; he used his LCA keynote to
reminisce for a while on where Unix came from and what its legacy is.
</p><p>
He began by introducing Bell Labs, which was formed by US
telecommunications giant AT&amp;T to carry out research on how to improve
telephone services.  A lot of inventions came out of Bell Labs, including
the transistor, the laser, and fiber optics.  Such was the concentration of
talent there that, at one point, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>  and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a>
shared 
an office.  Kernighan joined Bell Labs in 1967, when there were about 25
people engaged in computer-science research.
</p><p>
Early on, Bell Labs joined up with MIT and General Electric to work on a
time-sharing operating system known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics">Multics</a>.  As one might
have predicted, the attempted collaboration between a research lab, a
university, and a profit-making company did not work all that well; Multics
slipped later and later, and Bell Labs eventually pulled out of the project.
That left two researchers who had been working on Multics — Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie — without a project to work on.
</p><p>
After searching for a machine to work on,
Thompson eventually found an old PDP-7, which was already obsolete at that
time, to do some work on filesystem design.  The first Unix-like system
was, in essence, a test harness to measure filesystem throughput.  But he
and Ritchie later concluded that it was something close to the sort of
timesharing system they had been trying to build before.  This system
helped them to convince the lab to buy them a PDP-11/20 for further development.

The initial plan was to create a system for document processing, with an
initial focus of, inevitably, preparing patent applications.  The result
was &#34;recognizably Unix&#34; and was used to get real work done.
</p><p>
The first Unix versions were entirely done in assembly, but the Multics
project had shown that higher-level languages could be used for
operating-system development.  Starting with the BCPL language used there,
Thompson pared it down to a language called B; Ritchie then added
niceties like a type system, creating C.  The C language hit a &#34;sweet
spot&#34; in language design that has proved hard for anybody else to hit
since, Kernighan said.
</p><p>
The advent of C brought the development of a wide range of system tools,
perhaps the most important of which was Steve Johnson&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_C_Compiler">portable C 
compiler</a>, which made the operating system itself portable.  Around this
time pipes were added as well.  That was the genesis of one of the core
Unix ideas: write small tools that can be combined to solve complicated
problems.
</p><p>
Sixth-edition Unix, released in 1975, was the first widely used version of
the operating system.  It included a number of other core Unix concepts,
including the hierarchical filesystem, devices represented as files, a
programmable shell, regular expressions, and more.  All of this was
implemented in about 9,000 lines of C code.  The system was small and
comprehensible, which led to a lot of interesting things, including the
highly influential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions%27_Commentary_on_UNIX_6th_Edition,_with_Source_Code"><i>Lions&#39;
Commentary on Unix</i></a>.
</p><p>
The 1980s were the golden age of Unix, Kernighan said.  Unix was everywhere
and widely respected.  Thompson and Ritchie were given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Turing Award</a> for 
their work.  The absolute peak, he said, was when Unix appeared in the film
Jurassic Park.  But then the fight between AT&amp;T and Berkeley began,
leading to a pointless lawsuit, and the beginning of the fragmentation of
the system.
</p><p>
In 1991, Linus Torvalds announced his work on Linux, and &#34;the rest is
history&#34;.
</p><p>
Kernighan moved into his conclusion by asking what the technical legacy of
Unix is.  Some significant pieces of that legacy, including the
hierarchical filesystem, use of 
high-level languages, and the programmable shell, have their origins in
Multics.  Others, including pipes, the whole tools concept, and regular
expressions, are a direct result of the Unix work.  And most importantly,
he said, was that Unix brought a new philosophy on how to create software.
</p><p>
Almost all of this was in place by 1975 and, he said, it may well be true
that there have been no great insights into operating-system design since.
Certainly Unix has seen a lot of additions, including networking,
multiprocessor support, graphical interfaces, Unicode, and more.  But it&#39;s
all built on the foundation created nearly 50 years ago.
</p><p>
The creation of Unix was the result of an accidental combination of
factors, starting with the juxtaposition of two exceptionally creative
people &#34;with good taste&#34;.  Kernighan gave a lot of credit to &#34;benign
management&#34; at Bell Labs that allowed this work to go forward, naming Doug
McIlroy in particular.  It was also spurred by the arrival of cheap
hardware (in which category he included the $50,000 PDP-11 used to develop
the system early on).  But a key part was the Bell Labs working
environment, which included stable funding and a long-term view, which is
something that is hard to find today.
</p><p>
Could something like Unix happen again?  There are plenty of talented
people around now, he said, and good management does exist.  Hardware has
never been cheaper, and most of the software is free.  But, he said, good
environments for the creation of this kind of work are hard to find.  Even
so, 
he concluded, think of all the great things that began with one or two
people and a good idea; that can certainly happen again.  Ritchie once said
that Unix was created to provide a community where interesting things could
happen; we should try to create such a community again.
</p><p>
In your editor&#39;s opinion, Kernighan missed an opportunity to evaluate the
free-software community in these terms.  Companies may not have long time
horizons, but many free-software projects do.  It is, still, a place where
people with good ideas can come together and see where those ideas lead.
It would have been good to hear his thoughts on whether the
free-software community has become that place where interesting things can
happen and, if not, what we should seek to change to get there.
