<p>Whenever a large corporation disgorges the personal information of millions of people onto the Internet, there is a standard playbook that is followed.</p>

<p>“Security is our top priority”.</p>

<p>“Passwords were hashed”.</p>

<p>“No credit card numbers were disclosed”.</p>

<p><em>record scratch</em></p>

<p>Let’s talk about that last one a bit.</p>



<p>This post could have been written any time in the past… well, decade or so, really.
But the trigger for my sitting down and writing this post is the recent breach of wallet-finding and criminal-harassment-enablement platform Tile.
As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-hacker-obtained-tile-customers-personal-information-171632302.html">reported by Engadget</a>, a statement attributed to Life360 CEO Chris Hulls says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The potentially impacted data consists of information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and Tile device identification numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But don’t worry though; even though your home address is now public information</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It does not include more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aaaaaand here is where I get salty.</p>



<p>Describing credit card numbers as “more sensitive information” is somewhere between disingenuous and a flat-out lie.
It was probably included in the statement because it’s part of the standard playbook.
Why is it part of the playbook, though?</p>

<p>Not being a disaster comms specialist, I can’t say for sure, but my hunch is that the post-breach playbook includes this line because (a) credit cards are less commonly breached these days (more on that later), and (b) it’s a way to <em>insinuate</em> that “all your financial data is safe, no need to worry” without having to say that (because that statement would absolutely be a lie).</p>

<p>The thing that not nearly enough people realise about credit card numbers is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The credit card holder is not usually liable for most fraud done via credit card numbers; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of actual, long-term damage to individuals, credit card fraud barely rates a mention.
Identity fraud, Business Email Compromise, extortion, and all manner of other unpleasantness is far more damaging to individuals.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Losing credit card numbers in a data breach <em>is</em> a huge deal – but not for the users of the breached platform.
Instead, it’s a problem for <em>the company that got breached</em>.</p>

<p>See, going back some years now, there was a wave of <em>huge</em> credit card data breaches.
If you’ve been around a while, names like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/target-security-breach-settlement.html">Target</a> and <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/522898/malware-cybercrime-heartland-largest-data-breach-ever.html">Heartland</a> will bring back some memories.</p>

<p>Because these breaches cost issuing banks and card brands a lot of money, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI-SSC) and the rest of the ecosystem went full goblin mode.
Now, if you lose credit card numbers in bulk, it will cost you big.
Massive fines for breaches (typically levied by the card brands via the acquiring bank), increased transaction fees, and even the Credit Card Death Penalty (being banned from charging credit cards), are all <em>very</em> big sticks.</p>



<p>In news that should not be surprising, when there are <em>actual</em> consequences for failing to do something, companies take the problem seriously.
Which is why “no credit card numbers were disclosed” is such an interesting statement.</p>

<p>Consider <em>why</em> no credit card numbers were disclosed.
It’s not that credit card numbers aren’t valuable to criminals – because they are.
Instead, it’s because <em>the company took steps to properly secure the credit card data</em>.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll start to consider why, if the credit card numbers were secured, why wasn’t the personal information that <em>did</em> get disclosed similarly secured?
Information that is far more damaging to the individuals to whom that information relates than credit card numbers.</p>

<p>The only logical answer is that it wasn’t deemed financially beneficial to the company to secure that data.
The consequences of disclosure for that information isn’t felt by the company which was breached.
Instead, it’s felt by the individuals who have to spend weeks of their life cleaning up from identity fraud committed against them.
It’s felt by the victim of intimate partner violence whose new address is found in a data dump, letting their ex find them again.</p>

<p>Until there are real, <em>actual</em> consequences for the companies which hemorrhage our personal data (preferably ones that have “percentage of global revenue” at the end), data breaches will continue to happen.
Not because they’re inevitable – because as credit card numbers show, data <em>can</em> be secured – but because there’s no incentive for companies to prevent our personal data from being handed over to whoever comes along.</p>



<p>My salty takes are powered by refreshing beverages.
