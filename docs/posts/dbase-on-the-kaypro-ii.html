Summarily, he&#39;d likely be alive and innovating the industry to this day.</p><p>Kildall&#39;s story is pitched as a &#34;butterfly flaps its wings&#34; inflection point that changed computing history. The truth is, of course, there were <em>many </em>points along our timeline which led to Kildall&#39;s fade and untimely death.</p><p>Rather, I&#39;d like to champion what Kildall <strong>did</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-094558-1.png" alt="Gary Kildall on the other side of the desk, looking dapper in a dark blue jacket, light blue dress shirt, and burgundy tie with a wide knot." loading="lazy" width="1878" height="1409" srcset="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-094558-1.png 600w, https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-094558-1.png 1000w, https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-094558-1.png 1600w, https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-11-094558-1.png 1878w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Gary, in a rare turn as the interviewee, on Computer Chronicles discussing Concurrent CP/M.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Kildall <strong>did </strong>co-host Computer Chronicles with Stewart Chiefet for seven years.

Kildall <strong>did</strong> create CP/M, the first wide-spread, mass-market, portable operating system for microcomputers, possible because of said BIOS. CP/M <strong>did</strong> dominate the business landscape until the DOS era, with 20,000+ software titles in its library. Kildall <strong>did</strong> sell his company, Digital Research Inc., to Novell for US $120M.</p><p>Kildall did <strong>good</strong>.</p><p>Systems built to run Kildall&#39;s CP/M were prevalent, all built around the same 8-bit limits: an 8080 or Z80 processor and up to 64KB RAM.

At this stage in my learning, this is strictly a manual process. Speaking frankly, this part blows, but it <em>also</em> blows for Gail Fisher, so my schadenfreude itch is scratched.</p><p><em>dBASE </em>does its best to minimize the amount of keyboard shenanigans during this process, and in truth data entry isn&#39;t stressful. I can pop through records fairly quickly, if the raw data is before me.</p><p>The prompt starts at the first field and <code>&lt;RETURN&gt;</code> (not <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> !) moves to the next. If entry to a field uses the entire field length (as defined by me when setting up the fields earlier), the cursor automatically jumps to the next field with a PC-speaker beep. I guess <em>dBASE </em>is trying to &#34;help,&#34; but when touch typing I&#39;m looking at my data source, not the screen. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m about to hit the end of a field, so I&#39;m never prepared when it switches input fields and makes that ugly beep.</p><p>More jarring is that if the final field of a record is completely filled, the cursor &#34;helpfully&#34; jumps to the beginning of a new record instantly, with no opportunity to read or correct the data I just input. It&#39;s never not annoying.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-02-151951.png" alt="Snippet from the book reads, &#34;Now I can tell you why we allowed 13 characters for the telephone number rather than 12.

First, I wanted to enter the critic score as a decimal value so I could get the average. Number fields, like all fields, have a &#34;width&#34; (the maximum number of characters/bytes to allocate to the field), but also a &#34;decimal places&#34; value and as I type these very words I see now my mistake. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging?ref=stonetools.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Rubber ducking works</a>.</p><p>I tricked myself into thinking &#34;width&#34; was for the integer part, and &#34;decimal places&#34; was appended to that. I see now that, like character fields, I need to think of the entire maximum possible number as being the &#34;width.&#34;</p><p>Suppose in a value we expect to record <code>0.39</code>. There are 2 decimal places, <strong>and </strong>a decimal point, <strong>and </strong>a leading 0, <strong>and </strong>potentially a sign, as <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>. So that means the &#34;width&#34; should be 5, with 2 &#34;decimal places&#34; (of those 5).</p><p>Though I&#39;m cosplaying as a store owner, I&#39;m apparently cosplaying as a store owner that sucks!

It goes through every record, in sequence, finding record matches. Records have positions in the database file, and <em>dBASE </em>is silently keeping track of a &#34;record pointer&#34; at all times. This represents &#34;the current record&#34; and commands without a query will be applied to the currently pointed record.</p><p>Typing in a number at the dot prompt moves the pointer to that record.</p><pre><code>. 3

RECORD: 00025</code></pre><p>At this point I could <code>EDIT</code> that record, or <code>BROWSE</code> to see a list of records from the located record onward. Depending on the order of the records, that may or may not be useful. Right now, the order is just &#34;the order I typed them into the system.&#34; We need to teach <em>dBASE </em>different orders of interest to a stripmall retail store. </p><p>While the modern reaction would be to use the <code>SORT</code> command, <em>dBASE&#39;s</em> Sort can only create entirely new database files on disk, sorted by the desired criteria. Sort a couple of times on a large data set and soon you&#39;ll find yourself hoarding the last of new-old 5 1/4&#34; floppy disk stock from OfficeMax, or being very careful about deleting intermediary sort results.</p><p>SQL brainiacs have a solution to our problem, which <em>dBASE </em>can also do. An &#34;index&#34; is appropriate for fast lookups on our columnar data. We can index on one or more fields, remapping records to the sort order of our heart&#39;s desire. Only one index can be used at a time, but a single index can be defined against multiple fields. It&#39;s easier to show you.</p><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-10-151636-1.png" alt="dBASE II screen showing two comparisons of indexed searches in green monochrome text.

Shenanigans with special controller hardware are eliminated, opening up a world of cheaper, standardized floppy drives of all sizes and capacities. It also accepts Centronics parallel and RS-232C serial devices, making tons of printers, modems, and more compatible with the Atari. The device also includes a 16K print buffer and the ability to attach up to four floppy drives without additional controller board purchases. A base ATR8000 can replace a whole stack of expensive Atari-branded add-ons, while being more flexible and performant. </p><p>The saying goes, &#34;Cheaper, better, faster. Pick any two.&#34; The ATR8000 is that rare device which delivered all three.</p><p>Now, upgrade that box with its CP/M compatibility option, adding a Z80 and 64K, and you&#39;ve basically bought a second computer. When plugged into the Atari, the Atari functions as a remote terminal into the unit, using whatever 40/80-column display adapter you have connected. It could also apparently function standalone, accessible through <strong>any </strong>terminal, no Atari needed.</p><p>That isn&#39;t even its final form.</p><p>The Co-Power-88 is a 128K or 256K PC-compatible add-on to the Z80 CP/M board. When booted into the Z80, that extra RAM can be used as a RAM disk to make CP/M fly. When booted into the 8088, it&#39;s a full-on PC running DOS or CP/M-86.</p><p>Tricked out, this eight pound box would set you back US$1000 in 1984 ($3,000 in 2026), but it should be obvious why this is a coveted piece of kit for the Atari faithful to this day.</p><h4 id="micro-z80-for-the-bbc-micro">Micro Z80 for the BBC Micro</h4><figure><img src="https://stonetools.ghost.io/content/images/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-01-26-135215.png" alt="In a home office setting, a man and child sit at a desk using a BBC Micro system connected to peripherals, with a small monitor displaying a pie chart.

It would be significant work in some cases; maybe not worth it or consider if you can do without those.</li><li>Your needs may exceed what CP/M-80 hardware can support; its 8-bit nature is a limiting factor in and of itself. If you have <strong>big plans</strong>, consider <em>dBASE III+ </em>on DOS to stretch your legs.
