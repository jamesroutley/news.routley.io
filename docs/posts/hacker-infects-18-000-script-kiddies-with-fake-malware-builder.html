<p>A threat actor targeted low-skilled hackers, known as &#34;script kiddies,&#34; with a fake malware builder that secretly infected them with a backdoor to steal data and take over computers.</p>

<p>Security researchers at CloudSEK report that the malware infected 18,459 devices globally, most located in Russia, the United States, India, Ukraine, and Turkey.</p>

<p>&#34;A trojanized version of the XWorm RAT builder has been weaponized and propagated,&#34; reads the <a href="http://www.cloudsek.com/blog/no-honour-among-thieves-uncovering-a-trojanized-xworm-rat-builder-propagated-by-threat-actors-and-disrupting-its-operations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CloudSEK report</a>.</p>

<p>&#34;It is <strong><em>targeted specially towards script kiddies who are new to cybersecurity</em></strong> and directly download and use tools mentioned in various tutorials thus showing that there is no honour among thieves.&#34;</p>

<p>CloudSEK has found the malware included a kill switch that was activated to uninstall the malware from many of the infected machines, but due to practical limitations, some remain compromised.</p>

<h2>Fake RAT builder installs malware</h2>

<p>The researchers say they recently discovered a Trojanized XWorm RAT builder being distributed through various channels, including GitHub repositories, file hosting platforms, Telegram channels, YouTube videos, and websites.</p>

<p>These sources promoted the RAT builder, stating it would allow other threat actors to utilize the malware without having to pay for it.</p>

<p>However, instead of being an actual builder for the XWorm RAT, it infected the threat actor&#39;s devices with the malware.</p>

<p>Once a machine is infected, the XWorm malware checks the Windows Registry for signs it is running on a virtualized environment and stops if the results are positive.</p>

<p>If the host qualifies for infection, the malware performs the required Registry modifications to ensure persistence between system boots.</p>

<p>Every infected system is registered to a Telegram-based command and control (C2) server using a hardcoded Telegram bot ID and token.</p>

<p>The malware also automatically steals Discord tokens, system information, and location data (from IP address), and exfiltrates it to the C2 server. Then, it waits for commands from the operators.</p>

<p>Out of the 56 commands supported in total, the following are particularly dangerous:</p>

<ul><li><strong>/machine_id*browsers</strong> – Steal saved passwords, cookies, and autofill data from web browsers</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*keylogger</strong> – Record everything the victim types on their computer</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*desktop</strong> – Capture the victim’s active screen</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*encrypt*&lt;password&gt;</strong> - Encrypt all files on the system using a provided password</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*processkill*&lt;process&gt;</strong> - Terminate specific running processes, including security software</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*upload*&lt;file&gt;</strong> - Exfiltrate specific files from the infected system</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*uninstall</strong> – Remove the malware from the device</li>
</ul><p>CloudSEK found that the malware operators had exfiltrated data from roughly 11% of the infected devices, mostly taking screenshots of infected devices, as shown below, and stealing browser data.</p>

<h2>Disrupting with the kill switch</h2>

<p>The CloudSEK researchers disrupted the botnet by utilizing hard-coded API tokens and a built-in kill switch to uninstall the malware from infected devices.</p>

<p>To do this, they sent a mass uninstall command to all listening clients, looping through all known machine IDs they had previously extracted from Telegram logs. They also brute-forced machine IDs from 1 to 9999, assuming a simple numeric pattern.</p>

<p>Although this caused the malware to be removed from many of the infected machines, those not online when the command was issued remain compromised.</p>

<p>Also, Telegram subjects messages to rate limiting, so some of the uninstall commands may have been lost in transit.</p>

<p>Hackers hacking hackers is a common scenario we often see manifesting in the wild.</p>

<p>The takeaway from CloudSEK&#39;s findings is never to trust unsigned software, especially those distributed by other cybercriminals, and only install malware builders on testing/analysis environments.</p>
