    <h1>A Mirror for Rust: Compile-Time Reflection Report</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://soasis.org/posts/a-mirror-for-rust-a-plan-for-generic-compile-time-introspection-in-rust/"><img src="https://soasis.org/img/2023/04/pexels-bogdan-dirica-mirror-ball.jpg" alt="A reflective glass ball sits on a root of a tree, photographed upside-down to allow for the reflection inside of the glass ball to appear right-side up. The reflection shows the sky and the trees around in the forested area."/></a></p><p>With a powerful trait system, compile-time constants, and <code>where</code>-and-<code>:</code>-style bounding for types and constants, Rust’s take on generic functions has been a refreshing departure from the anything-goes, Wild Wild West, errors-only-when-called template system of C++. Furthermore, its macro system has been a much needed replacement of C’s underpowered macro system, allowing users to actually generate code in a consistent and dependable manner at compile-time, with the ever-powerful Procedural Macros (“proc macros”) taking care of some of the heaviest language extension tasks. But…</p><p>Much like C, Rust perhaps a bit too heavily relies on (proc) macros and code generation techniques to avoid dealing with sincere deficiencies in the language, producing much heavier compile times by frontloading work at inappropriate compilation stages to offset the lack of language and library features. To this end, we have begun working on the specification, formalization, and potential integration (which may not be completed fully as part of this work<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) of a set of core language primitives we are bikeshed-naming <code>introwospection</code>, which we hope to make available under the <code>core::introwospection</code> and <code>std::introwospection</code> modules in Rust.</p><p>This article will spend a perhaps obscene amount of time reasoning, designing, critiquing, comparing, pontificating, and yearning for this or that feature, functionality, idiom, or capability.</p><p>As a general-purpose disclaimer, while we have spoken with a large number of individuals in specific places about how to achieve what we are going to write about and report on here, it should be expressly noted that no individual mentioned here has any recorded support position for this work. Whatever assertions are contained below, it is critical to recognize that we have one and only one goal in mind for this project and that goal was developed solely under our — Shepherd Oasis’s — own ideals and efforts. Our opinions are our own and do not reflect any other entity, individual, project and/or organization mentioned in this report.</p><p>One of the biggest things Shepherd’s Oasis wants to enable is <em>infinitely valuable and scalable code</em>. For example, in the <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/">primary serialization crate featured across the entire Rust ecosystem, <code>serde</code></a>, we want to enable David Tolnay (or any one of the 159/future contributors)’s code to be able to handle this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span> 0</span><span>	</span><span>struct</span> <span>Point</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>and have it work, in perpetuity, for the rest of their life for the <strong>vast majority</strong> of Rust types<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p><p>Right now, absolutely none of the above code makes sense to the vast majority of people. And that is fine. But, this is the ultimate goal of this combination article-report; we will be going through the constructs above, going to explain what it does, and how it enables less boilerplate, less markup, less “new type idiom” usage, and more doing exactly what you expect and want by-default out of the vast majority of code.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><p>The name is a placeholder. Originally, we wanted to simply call it “reflect” and “reflection”, but both are already reserved in Rust, including in the compiler as a symbol. It was then changed to “uwuflection”, but we are not doing code generation (in the macro sense) with this feature like other reflection facilities in other languages. Thus, it was changed to “introspection”. However, it was requested we make the name at least 11% sillier so there was no question that we honestly do not care what the final name will be, and to avoid what would undoubtedly be an entirely worthless bikeshed session. Enter: <code>introwospection</code>.</p><p>Introwospection’s core ideals are as follows:</p><ul><li>does not force the user to pay for what they do not use (if a type is not reflected on, then no information about it whatsoever should show up in the final artifacts);</li><li>will not produce run-time, dynamic allocations, nor will it require it under any circumstances (making it suitable for constrained and resource-starved environments);</li><li>will produce information that can be acted upon by the type system or at compile-time (i.e. <code>const fn</code> time) without exception;</li><li>can be utilized to inspect types and values within generic functions, including values and types of values not owned by the current crate;</li><li>and, cannot be utilized to inspect private or hidden properties that are invisible to code at the current scope, module, or crate.</li></ul><p>These core ideals shape what we want out of the API, and how it differs from existing attempts at this in Rust rather powerfully. In particular, current attempts at reflection and similar utilize (procedural) macro programming, defer entirely to run-time/type-erased entities, or some combination of the two in conjunction with hand-crafted wrapper types and methods. Introwospection wants to be able to work with <em>any</em> type whatsoever — much like in the above beefy default <code>Serialize</code> implementation — rather than types that provide a specific implementation or types that we explicitly own. To explain some of this requires us to go back, and talk about the way things work today, including the fact that Rust does not have compile-time reflection like folks originally explained to us when we first started the language a couple of years ago.</p><p>We held this belief upon first seeing Rust some time ago.

</span></code></pre></div><p>This code — apparently, with magic — is capable of understanding that we want a string (<code>&amp;str</code>, in this case, which is a reference to an existing blob of string memory) to designate a name, and an 8-bit integer for the age. It parses that automatically from the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;age&gt;</code> portions of this <code>get</code> attribute-labeled route. It also returns a string, that will then be transported in a basic HTTP-valid form of transportation all the way to the user’s browser. This means that — somehow — Rocket understands this <code>hello</code> function, its parameters, its return types, and — more importantly — the <strong>negotiation</strong> of these properties to and from a form understood by all web browsers. Is that not reflection? The ability to gaze into normal Rust code as written, and automatically generate the boilerplate and interop? Clearly, Rust had achieved something that C users only dream of, and that they can only produce with externally-orchestrated tools connected by <code>make</code> (or <code>CMake</code>, or <code>meson</code>, or <code>Bazel</code>, or any of the other dozens of build systems holding up a Mt. Everest of code).</p><p>Unfortunately, this is only half of the story.</p><p>What is happening here is not reflection, which dismayed us greatly as we actually learned the language. It is actually the machinations of a separate system that has been built on top of Rust’s actual programming language. A separate shadow world whose job it is to do the immense heavy lifting that makes code like this possible. And that entire shadow world that’s powering the most elegant Rust code starts with a single crate maintained and propelled forward by David Tolnay and his devout helpers, poetically named <code>syn</code>.</p><h2 id="syn"><code>syn</code></h2><p><a href="https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/">The <code>syn</code> crate</a> (said like the first part of the word “syntax” and exactly like the word “sin”) is the Big Mover and Shaker of Rust. When things get unwieldy to express and complicated to keep typing out in C, one falls back to the preprocessor system or code generators. Similarly, Rust programmers fall back to their own token expansion / generation system, termed “macros”. Exactly like the C counterpart, Rust’s macro programming model does not actually understand anything about the program itself. It receives a stream of tokens, similar to the way invoking a function macro in C (e.g., <code>DO_CALL(A, B, 234, str)</code>) gets a list of tokens to interact with. They are allowed to generate a new sequence of tokens (subject to a handful of rules and hygene requirements that C macros do not have). But, the fun doesn’t stop there for Rust macros; they can be supercharged with even more capabilities that allow them to hook into the “custom attribute” and “custom derive” settings, as well as totally repurpose Rust tokens to create their own languages (delimited within the usual <code>my_macro!(…)</code> or <code>my_macro![…]</code> or <code>my_macro!{ … }</code> invocations).</p><p>These enhanced macros — called procedural macros — can do whatever they want by acting as a compiler plugin over that token stream. While C object and function macros are extremely limited in scope and power — despite running on the same conceptual level as Rust macros — Rust macros are so fully-featured that one can reimplement the entire Rust Frontend in their Rust macro feature. Others new to Rust but well-aged in many programming languages — save for the older Lisp veterans — would scoff. If we suggested implementing a C frontend out of token parsing in preprocessor for C, we would be laughed out of the room for even wanting a preprocessor that powerful. But, in this brave new Rust world, not only is Rust’s preprocessor theoretically powerful enough to do that work as an academic on-paper exercise, it is also in-practice exactly that powerful.</p><p><code>syn</code> is the culmination of that very idea. It is a library that parses a stream of Rust tokens into Rust-understood and intimately recognizable constructs such as an <code>syn::Expression</code>, a <code>syn::Type</code>, a <code>syn::AssocType</code>, a <code>syn::DataUnion</code>, and so much more.</p><p>The special <code>#[launch]</code> and <code>#[get(…)]</code> macros from the Rocket example are how <code>syn</code> is deployed. Libraries use these attributes as the hooking points and jumping points for their macros and procedural macros. Then, they dip their hands into <code>syn</code> to parse and handle these Rust constructs in order to generate code. This, effectively, means that every macro and procedural macro is re-doing the work of the Rust frontend (up to its AST generation), and then acting on that in order to generate code for constructs (types, associated items, names, traits, etc.) it recognizes. This is how Rocket knows to generate a <code>main</code> function for us with <code>#[launch]</code>, knows how to generate the boilerplate that connects a fully-received HTTP Request into something that can talk to our <code>hello</code> function, etc. etc.! It is an amazing feat of engineering. Make no mistake, David Tolnay plus the 80+ contributors to this crate are one of several critical pillars of why Rust is a major system’s programming language worth taking seriously today. It bought a serious amount of time for the language designers and the numerous compiler engineers to focus on other parts of Rust, while use cases involving generating code and similar could be wrapped up in (proc) macros.</p><p>As with most engineering approaches born out of necessity, macros using <code>syn</code> to parse Rust source code parsing in a preprocessing language comes with interesting consequences exacerbated by Rust’s programming model. In particular, Rust’s strong ownership rules (not just for resources, but for code concepts) means that macros very quickly hit very particular limits. Sometimes, those limits are billed as advantages, but with our work we have begun to see it as more of a hindrance than a benefit. We will take a slight detour to explain code ownership, specifically in relation to the C model, and expound upon how it relates to compile-time reflection.</p><h2 id="strong-ownership-not-just-for-resources">Strong Ownership: Not Just for Resources</h2><p>One of the things that makes C and C++ brutal for code, in conjunction with a source-text <code>#include</code>-based model of programming, is how ownership becomes very hard to define. Multiple translation units may end up with a function, structure, or similar that have identical fully qualified names and name spaces. How C and C++ handle this is effectively a shrug of the shoulders, combined with a rule called the One Definition Rule. This rule states that multiple translation units that do not opt into certain modifying keywords (e.g., <code>static</code>, anonymous top-level namespaces <code>namespace { … }</code>, or <code>extern</code>) promise that any code with identically-named entities shall have the same content, <code>Or Else™</code>. That “<code>Or Else™</code>” is not always enforced, as its placed under either implicit undefined behavior (C) or as Ill-formed, No Diagnostic Required (IFNDR, C++).</p><p>These days, <em>some</em> compilers can check these assumptions; for example, GCC or Clang with <code>-Wodr</code> AND Link-Time Optimizations/Link-Time Code Generation turned on can warn on some One Definition Rule collisions. But for the most part, if the code from two or more translation units have identical names, compilers just play a quick game of Russian Roulette and eliminate all but one version of the code. It should not matter if there are multiple versions because we promised that all versions will be the same. This sometimes gets violated (because of different translation unit compilations using different macro definitions, or producing odd compile-time values that go into functions to provoke differing behavior), and it results in occasional hilarity as well as brutal, tear-filled 3 AM debugging sessions.</p><p>Rust sidesteps this problem entirely by basing their code concepts not within translation units that get blended into an executable later, but instead with conceptual modules and crates. We will not regale everyone with the details here, but effectively functions, structures, unions, traits, and more all belong to the modules and crates that define them. Code is included through the use of <code>use</code> importations and similar, and this allows strong ownership of code that belongs to one logical entity (the crate, and within a crate, to the module) rather than every single file (translation unit) claiming total control over every single piece of code that gets <code>#include</code>d in. This gets rid of quite a few obvious flaws from C, chief among them the need to manically mark every header-implemented function with <code>inline</code> and then spend billions in compute cycles deduplicating the mess.</p><p>The drawbacks that start showing up, especially in relation to the macro system and generic programming systems in Rust, are about this strong ownership property.</p><h3 id="traits-and-ownership">Traits and Ownership</h3><p>Consider a trait in a given a crate <code>cats</code>, such as:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>0</span><span>	</span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>trait</span><span> </span><span>Purr</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

However, consider a different structure named <code>Puma</code> that exists in another library <code>big_animals</code>. It doesn’t have an implementation of <code>Purr</code> on it, but a <code>Puma</code> is a (big) cat, so we’d like to add one. So, in our own library again, we try to import the <code>Puma</code> structure and add the necessary <code>Purr</code> implementation:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>0</span><span>	</span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>big_animals</span>::<span>Puma</span><span>;</span><span>

</span><span>8</span><span>	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This does not compile. It runs afoul of what’s called the Orphan Rule, which is part of a broader Rust property called coherence. The short definition of the Orphan Rule is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>You cannot provide implementations of a trait for a struct unless you are either the crate that defines the struct, or the crate that defines the trait.</p></blockquote><p>Knowing this, <code>big_animals</code> cannot have someone outside of it add the <code>cats::Purr</code> trait on it, as that runs afoul of both coherence and, specifically, the Orphan Rule. This presents one of the biggest problems that Rocket, rlua, clap, and so many other codebases have to struggle with when they do <code>#[derive(…)]</code> based or Trait-based programming. There are many ways to get around such an issue, but almost every solution requires additional wrappers and special types. For example, for the problem with <code>Puma</code> above, there’s 2 ways to go about this: create a new trait, or create a new type. The latter is the solution that is nominally used, wherein the “new type idiom” is used. It works, fundamentally, like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>0</span><span>	</span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>cats</span>::<span>Purr</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>1</span><span>

</span><span>8</span><span>		</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>9</span><span>	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This is, ostensibly, not very workable if we have to pass a <code>Puma</code> into a function to do some work, or receive a <code>Puma</code> back. In either case, we need to “unpack” (easy enough by doing <code>my_puma_thing.0</code>) or we have to construct a <code>MyPuma</code> every time we get it back (e.g., <code>MyPuma(thing_that_makes_a_regular_puma())</code>). This requires a bit of manual labor, and it introduces some compatibility issues in that there is now a (purely syntactic) barrier between the functionality that someone may want/need versus the data type it is implemented over.</p><h2 id="viral-proliferation">Viral Proliferation</h2><p>Because it is impossible to fully anticipate the myriad of traits that one may need to implement on a <code>struct</code>ure, <code>union</code>, <code>enum</code>eration, or other type in Rust, many crates need to add “features” onto themselves to accommodate external crates. Going through a handful of crates will reveal <code>{name}-serde</code> features or similar addendums sticking off many of them. This is where “baseline” or otherwise important — but nonetheless entirely external/orthogonal — traits are given necessary implementation by the owners of whatever <code>{name}</code> crate. For many of the <code>serde</code> prefixed and suffixed features, they exist just to pull in the foundational serialization crate <code>serde</code> and then provide baseline definitions without the new type/new trait idiom on the types provided by the crate that added the feature. This may be surprising to some folks, but is actually fairly normal for those of us who participated in the C# and .NET ecosystems for a long time.</p><p>That is, C# encounters this same base-level need for its interfaces — and exactly the interfaces defined by a handful of libraries — to be shared all over the ecosystem. Because interfaces are unique to the “assembly” (the closest .NET parallel to a crate), even if they have the same members/methods/properties, one has to implement exactly the interface from that specific assembly. It results in very much the same sort of viral need to continually pull in often times unrelated assemblies and dependencies. It is expressly for the purpose of implementing the interfaces on a given type “properly” so it can be used seamlessly with a given library. Things are generally okay when we’re writing generic functions in C# and working with <code>IEnumerable</code> or a similar interface specifications that come from the standard library, but it gets very dicey when we have to start combining multiple pieces of code that want a function <code>Foo()</code>, and there’s 3 different <code>interface IFoo</code> in the different libraries. There’s a number of ways to solve this problem in Rust, but none are without drawbacks or unfavorable tradeoffs.</p><p>This is where the generic system of C++ becomes much better for end-users and — in some cases — the very librarians writing the code themselves. Even with its objectionable template syntax and intensely depressing usage experience (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a>, as a starter, and deeply nested error explanations with oft-times missing information), it is incredibly easy to take code that is 5, 10, or even 20 years old and make it work seamlessly with other code. The lack of such strong ownership semantics means that templated functions and templated structures can be modified, specialized, and hacked up to cover a wide variety of types that the library author or application developer has no ownership rights to. Function overloads can be added for new data without impacting any existing overload choices. 13 year old gap buffer implementations sitting on GitHub can have the dust blown off of them and made to work with the existing and future Standard Library algorithms with little to no effort. No <code>IEnumerable</code> interfaces need to be added, nor <code>Iterator</code> traits opted into.</p><p>C++ only gets away with this by deeply abusing <code>inline</code>/header-written code, and its lack of code ownership. It toes to the very line what its One Definition Rule means. However, this ultimately leads to generic code written in C++ which provides, both in theory and in significant industry practice, <strong>infinite value</strong> without actually being fully rewritten. This is in stark contrast to interface-based and trait-based generics, where it must be constantly updated or tweaked or opted into to provide the full range of benefits afforded by the generic system. Combined with the ownership rules for Rust-style trait implementations, it must not only be opted into, but has to be wrapped over and over and over again if the original crate author isn’t willing to make a feature or addendum to their library as they may not consider our use case worthwhile or foundational.</p><p>As with most complex Computer Science topics, the true answer is “it depends”.</p><p>There exist a mixed bag of approaches. Many developers use the basic approach with “newtype” and just commit to lots of unwrapping and unboxing. Occasionally, the implementations are so bog-standard that they either rewrite with newtype idioms or just write wrapper functions that call into the “real” functions to do work, hooking them up to the specific implementation. For a small (say, up to even 100) functions and types, such hand-tailored work is not impossible. If the work follows a specific pattern, macros and procedural macros can often wrap up the work. There is still boiler plate to declare, but a lot of that can be somewhat automated since Rust macros are expressly designed to generate and emit code. Much like C macros, however, debugging such expansions and working through any troubles from the created code turns out to be a hassle, though generally the tools are much better than the ones that come with most C compilers.</p><p>Still, these are not the only approaches possible. Some shift the burden entirely to procedural macros and try to take it to its logical maximum, such as with <code>reflect</code>.</p><h2 id="reflect"><code>reflect</code></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/reflect">David Tolnay’s reflect</a>, at the outset, operates in macro / procedural macro space and wants to solve the problem of robustness when using low/mid-level abstractions in <code>syn</code> and friends. That means that all of the above criticisms about <code>#[derive(…)]</code>, custom attributes, and ownership concerns will always apply to whatever comes out of the effort in this space. There will always be some amount of either needing to own the code explicitly so it can be appropriately marked up. Or, an issue with needing to create new types/traits so they can be marked up. Or, trying to replicate enough of <code>rustc</code>’s behavior so that it can look up crates, walk the file system, and attempt to do more of what both <code>cargo</code> and <code>rustc</code> do at (procedural) macro time, which has obvious drawbacks for compilation time and build system sanity.</p><p>The proof of concept and the philosophy do make for a very attractive metaprogramming story; namely, it provides an interface that is superficially similar to Zig’s <code>comptime T: type</code>-style of generic programming. You handle reflected values similar to a way you would handle a <code>type</code> value at <code>comptime</code> in Zig. We do not think everything we do with <code>introwospection</code> will be able to cover all of what <code>dtolnay/reflect</code> — or, indeed, (procedural) macro programming in Rust — can do, but we do aim to take a significant chunk of the use cases present here and instead move them into something the Rust language can handle itself. This leaves the other approach to this problem: run-time registration and reflection.</p><h2 id="bevy_reflect"><code>bevy_reflect</code></h2><p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/">The <code>bevy_reflect</code> crate</a> is much more fully featured and production-ready, focusing entirely on the ability to hold onto, transport, and interact with types and methods at run-time. It has advantages for how it interacts with code in that they provide a fixed set of interfaces that allow folks to register types, functions, and even potential trait information at run-time. It forsakes perfect code generation by no longer being compile-time (and, thusly, giving up a meager amount of performance, binary code size, and disk/RAM space) and leans deeply into a well-defined, deeply polished system.</p><p>With <code>bevy_reflect</code>, we describe the behavior of a type using specific traits and registration functions and root the entire system in a handful of traits — <code>Reflect</code> being one of them — before using copious amounts of <code>downcast</code> and <code>downcast_ref</code> to get the information we want to, at specific junctures in the system. This means we only register what we want to use, and it is not restricted solely to types we explicitly own as well. Even the examples on <code>bevy_reflect</code>’s tutorials are exceptionally cool and very powerful, from modifying existing fields on a struct hidden behind a run-time type description to iterating over a select list of structures that match a certain casting pattern. This reflection solution feels is the closest to a Java or C#-style of reflection built entirely out of a library, and likely feels familiar to folks who have built similar systems out of <code>void*</code> (C) or <code>BaseClass*</code> (in C++).</p><p>Unfortunately, because it goes about this in at run-time, it violates our pretty explicit goal of not making the user pay for things they may not use. Run-time registration that must be cast down and cast up, (slight) run-time cost to the operations being performed, needing to check constantly to ensure things are the type or shape that we would like it to be in; all of these things are both programmatic and performance overhead for our stated goals. Many of these operations are things the language could make safer if it had the ability to look at its own types and functions, so that it did not need constant checking, casting, and <code>unwrap()</code>-ing to get work done.</p><h2 id="the-stdany-module-and-dyn-trait">The <code>std::any::*</code> Module and <code>dyn Trait</code></h2><p><code>std::any::Any</code>, <code>std::any::TypeId</code>, and similar constructs in the <code>std::any</code> module provide ways of handling values through what is effectively a wrapped-up interface. This is further complicated by the Rust language itself, using <code>dyn SomeTrait</code> and similar constructs to allow boxing and virtual table-ing of many entities. This falls in much the same category as <code>bevy_reflect</code> does, as these are run-time powered mechanisms. The focus of this module and for <code>dyn SomeTrait</code> is the ability to add a level of indirection (virtual tables, indirect function calls, and similar techniques) to allow for “hiding” the source of data while allowing a downstream consumer to work with it without strictly typing the interface. Much of this also powers many of the implementation techniques in <code>bevy_reflect</code>, so it’s safe to call this a subset of what <code>bevy_reflect</code> offers to end-users with more general-purpose tools.</p><h2 id="is-that-enough">Is That Enough?</h2><p>Well, not really. As our goal is compile-time, no-overhead introspection on existing program types, we come to a bit of an impasse. While <code>dtolnay/reflect</code> can theoretically provide us with no-overhead introspection, it’s tie-in to the procedural macro system prevents us from using it in the normal Rust language, nor on types we do not have rights to (e.g., outside our program/library crate). It also does not fundamentally improve the generic programming situation in Rust, nor give us better primitives to work with in the language itself.</p><p>Having seen the myriad of approaches, we now turn to our own attempt which strays from both the procedural macro-heavy approach of Tolnay’s <code>reflect</code> and turns away the run-time powers of <code>bevy_reflect</code>. We may not be able to solve every problem that procedural macros or run-time reflection registration can, but we believe that the below examples will illustrate many of the ways in which we can promote a better way of performing compile-time computation with the purpose of looking back on code. We will start with explaining the API and compiler interface itself, then dive into the reasons for design choices, how it avoids some of the pitfalls of alternatives, and the challenges we will have to face down in order to make it happen. We will also discuss shortcuts which may be applied to sidestep the lack of many unstable, missing, and/or incomplete Rust features.</p><p>At its core, <code>introwospection</code> attempts to invert the <code>#[derive(MakeSomeTrait)]</code>-style of code generation and instead substitute it with true compile-time, generic-capable introspection, utilizing information the compiler already has. Here is a basic example of the API in a program crate called <code>cats_exec</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span> 0</span><span>	</span><span>#![feature(introwospection)]</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>The integer constant <code>I</code> for <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;I&gt;</code> is the declaration (source code) index. We are accessing each field explicitly, one at a time. In general, each entity in Rust is folded into a trait which has associated types and associated <code>const</code> items, and the collection of these traits are called <code>Descriptors</code>. All of the information can be carried through <code>const fn</code>s and/or the type system: in this example, we use <code>introwospect_type&lt;…&gt;</code>, which takes a single type argument to display the which will ultimately print:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>0</span>	struct cats_exec::Kitty, with <span>3</span> fields <span>{</span>

<span>4</span>	<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Those not used to Rust will note that — when not annotated by a specific kind of <code>#[repr(…)]</code> attribute — byte offsets do not correspond to a linear sequence within the structure. They can be rearranged at will, which is why the API uses the <code>0</code>/<code>1</code>/…/up-to-<code>::FIELD_COUNT - 1</code> values that correspond to the unique declaration index rather than any other metric. Each <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;I&gt;</code> trait implementation yields the information about that field on the structure. This API also does not allow access to e.g. crate-hidden or private fields. For example, if <code>Kitty</code> is moved out of <code>cats_exec</code> and is instead in a crate named <code>felines</code>, the code will be unable to access “Field 2” (<code>destruction_of_all_curtains_trigger</code>).

</span></code></pre></div><p>This means that every line has to contain the trait cast, to provide compile-time access to a specific, declaration-indexed field on something. It is genuinely a terrible way to program for reflection, being both non-ergonomic and brittle. The question, however, is why is the interface like this in the first place? Can we not simply use a natural collection for fields or enumeration variants or function arguments or any other thing that boils down to “list of types and other associated information”? It turns out that this is a lot harder than it seems without compromising the goals of <code>introwospection</code>. First, let’s start with using arrays and slices.</p><h3 id="whats-wrong-with-t-n-or-t">What’s wrong with <code>[T; N]</code> or <code>[T]</code>?</h3><p>One might ask, why we are not using arrays (or slices) to provide this information in a consistent, easy-to-use manner. The simple answer is that arrays require everything to coalesce to a single type. Doing so would mean that it would be impossible to provide type information in a compile-time, non-type-erased, non-potentially-allocating manner with the e.g. <code>Field_at_I::Type</code>. This means that arrays are unsuitable for the task at hand; we want no erasure to be taking place and no run-time checking of types as is done with <code>bevy_reflect</code>. Alternatively, we would have to wrap every list of field descriptors up into an <code>enum</code> of compiler-generated structures that each contain the necessary <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;I&gt;</code> implementation, but that also imposes a compile-time overhead because one would only be able to access the type within a <code>match</code> clause. This is further inhibiting because <code>match</code> clauses over such types do not allow us to perform different kinds of implementations for different <code>T</code>s within the case arm. The way around this is with something <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute_copy.html">gory like <code>transmute_copy</code></a>, and praying that it optimizes out. Reportedly, power users of Rust have done something like this and achieved success by depending on the compiler optimizing out unused compiler <code>match</code> arms for a given function and directly accessing the proper memory through the <code>transmute_copy</code>, but this once again is relying on the good graces of the compiler. There is no guarantee a Rust compiler will not just, on a whim one day, fumble the code and start producing some of the most gnarly jumps and conditionals we have seen up until now.</p><p>Ultimately, we decided that such an approach was likely to be brittle, and representing lists of types such as function arguments, struct fields, enumeration variants (and the fields on each variant) in this manner was too error prone.</p><h3 id="what-about-t-u-v-r-s--they-are-heterogenous-collections-right">What About <code>(T, U, V, R, S, …)</code>? They are Heterogenous Collections, Right?</h3><p>Another potential approach is providing a tuple of types, from <code>0</code> to <code>Description::FIELD_COUNT - 1</code>. Unfortunately, tuple-based programming is unsophisticated in Rust. To compare, C has no tuples to speak of other than directly creating a structure. C++ has the grungy <code>std::tuple</code>, which is usable — including at compile-time — but deeply costly (to build times) without compiler implementations pouring a LOT of energy into writing heuristics to speed up their access, instantiation, and general usage. Rust has built-in tuples, which is an enormous win for compilation time at instantiation and usage time, but robbed itself of most usability. Accessing a tuple cannot be done programmatically with constant expressions, because the <code>my_tuple.0</code> syntax is a hardcoded, explicit allowance of the syntax that literally requires a number after the <code>.</code>.</p><p>We cannot calculate a <code>const INDEX: usize = /* some computation here */;</code> and then do <code>my_tuple.(INDEX)</code>, <code>my_tuple[INDEX]</code>, <code>my_tuple[std::num::type_num&lt;INDEX&gt;]</code>, or <code>std::tuple::get::&lt;INDEX&gt;(my_tuple)</code>. We honestly don’t care what the syntax would look like, and maybe <code>std::tuple::get::&lt;INDEX&gt;(my_tuple)</code> could be implemented, today, in Rust, but it doesn’t exist. There is no way to program over a tuple other than hardcoding not only every tuple from size 0 to N into a several traits, but then doing the <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk/blob/master/core/src/tuples.rs#L112">combinatoric manual spam to get each value</a>. This contributes to Rust compile-time issues, in the same way that using the excellent <a href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/gustedt/p99">P99</a> library for lots of macro metaprogramming in C contributes to increased compile-times with a high count for the P99 <code>FOR_EACH</code> or similar macros. Even C++ standard libraries would implement <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c1114-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013/">variadic <code>std::function</code> with macros in C++</a>, and they suffered compile time loss until they moved to true variadics and compile-time programmability. It turns out that “fake it until you make it” is universally an expensive thing to do no matter what language architecture we build up for ourselves. Needing to parse 0-to-8, 0-to-12, or 0-to-25 faked up things will always be more expensive than having true variadic and tuple support. The language also does not support operations like <code>.map(…)</code>-ing over a tuple to produce a tuple of different types, though as the code from <code>frunk</code> proves we can ostensibly fake it for ourselves. Most attempted faux-implementations — especially naïve ones that take a “Cons and List” style approach — can result in quadratic time algorithms, further exacerbating compile time costs.</p><p>Given this, we have decided not to rely directly on tuples to fulfill the metaprogramming needs in conjunction with our desired API for compile-time introspection. This is in the interest of keeping compile times as low as possible from the outset, and also in the interest of not saddling the user with a subpar, <code>map</code>-less API that requires external crates or serious workarounds to handle. In general, type-heterogenous programming and support is fairly weak in Rust, which is why we have come up with the following API below that is a lot more manageable. It is not a perfect API and it cannot handle truly generic, type-heterogenous collections without compiler help, but given how the <code>introwospect_type</code>, <code>introwospect</code>, and <code>introwospect_over</code> keywords will be implemented, it should provide us with the maximum amount of flexibility for the jobs we would like to pursue.</p><p>To make things easier, we just have to implement a basic visitor type:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span> 0</span><span>	</span><span>#![feature(introwospection)]</span><span>

They offer a large amount of flexibility and, in conjunction with the <code>introwospect</code> and <code>introwospect_over</code> keywords, allow for easily iterating through the visible fields on <code>struct</code>s, <code>union</code>s, <code>enum</code>s <code>fn</code>s, and other types. This level of compile-time introspection allows us to perform algorithms in a systemic manner over a any type and any field. The visitors that come with the API are as follows. All <code>INDEX</code> names are constant <code>usize</code> expressions that refer to the declaration (source order) index of the entity within whatever context it is applied.</p><ul><li><code>StructDescriptorVisitor</code>: for observing compile-time information through a generically provided <code>StructDescriptor</code>-implementing type parameter describing either a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type.</li><li><code>EnumDescriptorVisitor</code>: for observing compile-time information through a generically provided <code>EnumDescriptor</code>-implementing type parameter describing an <code>enum</code> type. If the enumeration has no variants, then the <code>Variants</code> is <code>NoType</code>. Otherwise, it has from <code>INDEX = 0</code> to <code>INDEX = VARIANT_COUNT - 1</code> implementations of the trait <code>VariantDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code>.</li><li><code>TupleDescriptorVisitor</code>: for observing compile-time information through a generically provided <code>TupleDescriptor</code>-implementing type parameter describing the built-in type <code>(…)</code>. The unit type <code>()</code> is covered by a<code>TupleDescriptor</code> whos <code>Fields</code> is <code>NoType</code> (e.g., there are no fields on the tuple). Otherwise, the <code>Fields</code> has from <code>INDEX = 0</code> to <code>INDEX = FIELD_COUNT - 1</code> implementations of the trait <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code>.</li><li><code>ArrayDescriptorVisitor</code>: for observing compile-time information through a generically provided <code>ArrayDescriptor</code>-implementing type parameter describing the built-in type <code>[T; N]</code>. Uses <code>type ElementType;</code> and <code>const ELEMENT_COUNT: usize;</code> to describe the compile-time size.</li><li><code>SliceDescriptorVisitor</code>: for observing compile-time information through a generically provided <code>SliceDescriptor</code>-implementing type parameter describing the built-in type <code>[T]</code>.

Uses <code>type ReturnType;</code> to describe the return type, and <code>const PARAMETER_COUNT: usize;</code> to describe the number of parameters the function has. If it is greater than 0, the <code>type Parameters</code> has implementations from <code>INDEX = 0</code> to <code>INDEX = PARAMETER_COUNT - 1</code> of <code>ParameterDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</li><li>Two versions for visiting fields at compile-time:<ul><li><code>FieldDescriptorVisitor</code>: for observing compile-time information through a generically provided <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code>-implementing type parameter.

Variants are interesting in that a variant on an enumeration does not represent a type by itself, procuring all sorts of problems for the reflection API as a whole. It sometimes requires bizarre workarounds to grasp at the data optionally contained within a variant. A <code>type Fields;</code> is available on each variant descriptor which has its own <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code> implementations from <code>INDEX = 0</code> to <code>INDEX = FIELD_COUNT - 1</code>, provided the variant descriptor’s <code>FIELD_COUNT</code> is greater than 0. Programmatically, one can iterate over each variant and use the <code>DISCRIMINANT</code> field to check if a given enumeration object has the same variant set, and then use <code>std::introwospection::get_field::&lt;…&gt;(…)</code></li><li><code>VariantDescriptorVisitorAt&lt;INDEX&gt;</code>: identical to <code>VariantDescriptorVisitor</code>, but provides the information for the desired <code>INDEX</code> directly into the <code>*Visitor</code> implementation itself. This allows a different associated type to be chosen for each variant on a <code>enum</code>’s descriptor, enabling heterogenous programming over a visited collection.</li></ul></li><li>Two versions for visiting function parameters at compile-time:<ul><li><code>ParameterDescriptorVisitor</code>: for observing compile-time information through a generically provided <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code>-implementing type parameter.

This allows a different associated type to be chosen for each field on a function descriptor, enabling heterogenous programming over a visited collection.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Each of the highest level <code>*Descriptor</code> types are also paired with an <code>AdtDescriptor</code> trait, which provides the <code>const NAME: &amp;&#39;static str;</code> string name of the type, a <code>const ID: AdtId;</code> identification enumeration of the type for what kind it is, and <code>const ATTRIBUTES: &amp;&#39;static attributes;</code>, which contains the names (and potentially, values) of anything found within a <code>#[introwospect(…)]</code> keyword.</p><p>Up until now, we have sort of hand-waved how a lot of this works. This is for good reason: while we were able to create mockups that achieved basic versions of what we have above using existing Rust Compiler Nightly builds with unstable features, we very swiftly ran up against various problems both theoretical and practical with how this could be implemented or provided by Rust. At each point, we had to workaround various issues until we hit some of our penultimate blockers that have prevented us from having a working version of this in unstable, nightly Rust. We will start from the top with our various keywords and what they are meant to do, in conjunction with the semantics they ought to have if “written out” by hand. Then, we will drill down into the individual challenges — many already alluded to — and hone in on these issues.</p><p><code>introwospect_type</code> is the first keyword. It signals to the compiler that the type fed into it should be reflected upon. The type that comes out is not well-specified to be any particular type, but it will be something that implements one of the above <code>Descriptor</code> types based on what type was fed into it (a structure, union, enumeration, function (pointer), so on and so forth). For example, using an enumeration type <code>CatHours</code> in conjunction with <code>Kitty</code> for a program crate called <code>cat_time</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span> 0</span><span>	</span><span>#![feature(introwospection)]</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>This is a lot of boilerplate. <code>introwospect_type</code> gives us a type that implements the appropriate <code>StructDescriptor</code> (for <code>struct</code>s), <code>EnumDescriptor</code> (for <code>enum</code>s), <code>VariantDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code> for each variant at source-code index <code>INDEX</code>, and <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code> for each field within an <code>enum</code>’s variant or a <code>struct</code> at source-code index <code>INDEX</code>. In some cases, the type given is equivalent to the type itself. At other points, it is just a compiler-generated and un-nameable <code>struct</code> that will be decorated with the appropriate implementations to enable the introspection.</p><p>There’s a few things that should be highlighted about the expected semantics / magic we are employing in this generated code.</p><h2 id="stdmemoffset_of-is-magic"><code>std::mem::offset_of!</code> is Magic™</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/106934"><code>std::mem::offset_of!</code> has just landed for Rust</a> and will eventually need to be stabilized. As of April 25th, 2023, it also does not have plans for how to get the offsets of the fields of a variant within an enumeration. So, the fanciful <code>std::mem::offset_of!(CatHours, LostCountOfThem.when)</code> syntax we are using above is completely fictitious. We doubt that the official Language, Compiler, or Library teams take blog posts as a sincere form of feedback so at some point we will likely have to participate in the future issue that asks for <code>std::mem::offset_of</code> to work on some form of Rust’s enumerations. This could also be fixed by making <code>CatHours::LostCountOfThem</code> a real type in Rust, rather than a magical entity that may only be named specifically within a <code>match</code> clause, directly (see <a href="#enumeration-variants-are-not-nameable-types">further below</a>).</p><h2 id="stdmemdiscriminant_atenumtypesome_usize_index-is-not-real"><code>std::mem::discriminant_at::&lt;EnumType&gt;(some_usize_index)</code> is Not Real</h2><p>This function call is not a real intrinsic available in Rust. It is also awkward to program. Because enumerations in Rust cannot directly speak of a given variant inside itself, it is impossible to make a perfectly safe variant of this for the end-user that does not work off an existing enumeration value. This is why there only exists a form of getting a <code>std::mem::Discrimimant&lt;EnumType&gt;</code> by calling <code>std::mem::Discrimimant&lt;EnumType&gt;(enum_type_object)</code> with an existing <code>enum_type_object</code> that is already one of the existing variants; it is the only way to safely get at an enumeration type’s value without returning an <code>Option</code>.</p><p>For the desired core function to exist in Rust,</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>0</span><span>	</span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>discriminant_at</span><span>&lt;</span><span>EnumType</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>

Consider, briefly, that <code>EnumMeow</code> uses a <code>u8</code> to store the discriminant that tells between all 4 elements. The layout for <code>EnumMeow</code> could place the discriminant at a byte offset of 0. It can then place <code>EnumMeow::B.b</code> at byte offset 4, then place <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> at byte offsets 8 and 16 respectively.

</span></code></pre></div><p>Effectively, we need to create bounds that are composed of <code>0</code> to <code>Self::FIELD_COUNT - 1</code> <code>FieldDescriptor</code>s. The reason these bounds are necessary is so that, in generic code (such as with the <code>*Visitor</code> types in the mid-level API), we have the ability to use these <code>Fields</code>s and <code>Variants</code>s in those methods. Remember, Rust’s Trait system is not like C++ templates, C’s preprocessor, or Rust macros: they require that you specify up-front all of the necessary actions that can be taken on a given input parameter. We are not allowed to “figure it out” later at usage time (C++ templates) or hack the “step before actually doing the language” so much that it spits out something the base language can understand (C preprocessor, Rust macros). For:</p><ul><li><code>type Fields</code> on <code>StructDescriptor</code>s and <code>VariantDescriptor&lt;INDEX&gt;</code>;</li><li><code>type Variants</code> on <code>EnumerationDescriptor</code>;</li><li>and, <code>type Parameters</code> on <code>FunctionDescriptor</code>;</li></ul><p>we have to be able to use some sort of currently-unknown syntax and specification. We are told that the currently-incomplete feature that needs a lot more time and investment called Generic <code>const</code> Expressions (GCEs) will make this possible/plausible in some fashion, but going through the <code>const</code> repository and documents does not make it immediately obvious to us how we would program such a thing using GCEs. Nevertheless, what this does mean is that within the current trait system, it is entirely and completely inexpressible to do the kind of things we want to do for Rust’s compile-time introspection. So, even though we have finished what will be the library definitions of all of these traits and structures in the <code>library/core/src/introwospection.rs</code> source file for our repository, we will need <strong>tons</strong> of additional language improvements to reach our goals.</p><h2 id="variadics-do-not-exist-in-rust">Variadics Do Not Exist in Rust</h2><p>This is one of the biggest issues and causes some of the worst problems when trying to create an API of this caliber. While Rust has a built-in tuple type — far better than its counterpart in many other languages — tuples are not compile-time or generically programmable. As explained in the above section on tuple syntaxes<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Access is hard-coded, and while brilliant folks can <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=6e2d3933122cf82bec5307cd92cd480e">make partial solutions (thanks, Alyssa Haroldsen)</a>, they are not flexible enough to provide the ergonomics necessary for end-users. This creates an on-going tension: if variadics were a real feature, where there was a language construct representing “0 or more” types or “0 or more values” (both logically consistent with tuples) with a way of accessing those types or values, we would be able to program over the fields of a <code>struct</code> or the variants (and its fields) of an <code>enum</code>. But we do not have any concept of “0 or more” of something in Rust, and therefore it is patently impossible to program over what is effectively a list of “0 or more” fields, variants, types, etc. that come with the territory of performing compile-time introspection.</p><p>This is not just a compile-time introspection problem, either: the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/project-portable-simd">Rust SIMD Working Group</a> faced similar issues of “how do I work with 0 or more of the same type” when trying to create typical vector types that matched to hardware SIMD/AVX/RISC-V/PowerPC instruction sets. They had to eventually compromise on some of their original design for this, as well as extract a few concessions from the Rust core language in order to finally achieve the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/struct.Simd.html">current working product of <code>std::simd</code></a> (but with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/trait.SupportedLaneCount.html">notable restrictions, still</a>)<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p><p>This is one of the primary drivers of the <code>introwospect_over</code> keyword that is likely to be introduced with the compiler work associated with these changes. Since we both cannot express the bounds on e.g. <code>type Fields;</code>, and we cannot write an algorithm which works over what is effectively a heterogenous collection without falling down to writing fairly involved tuple-trait-implementation spam, we instead introduced this keyword. It has a 3-piece syntax.

</span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>INDEX</code> values passed into the <code>visit_…_mut</code> go from <code>0</code> to <code>FIELD_COUNT - 1</code>. This allows us to get around the lack of variadic capabilities by just having the compiler expand the list of types out for us and do the function calls we want. <code>introwospect_over</code> also behaves much the same for <code>enum</code>s with their variants, just performing <code>visitor.visit_variant_mut::&lt;&lt;Type as EnumDescriptor&gt;::Variants, 0&gt;()</code> from <code>0</code> up to <code>VARIANT_COUNT - 1</code>. If there are no fields, then nothing is produced in that spot. This is similar to functions, which produce <code>visitor.visit_parameter_mut::&lt;&lt;Type as FunctionDescriptor&gt;::Parameters, 0&gt;()</code>, all the way up to <code>PARAMETER_COUNT - 1</code>.</p><p>Note that the expansion we are performing here is a spiritual equivalence, not an exact or perfect semantic equivalence. <code>type Fields</code>, <code>type Variants</code>, and <code>type Parameters</code> do not have the appropriate trait bounds on it. This regular-looking Rust code is inexpressible in the literal “this is exact compiled source code” sense. But, with <code>introwospect_over</code>, we can commit any action we want to and its perfectly legal because we <strong>are</strong> the compiler. So long as both the bounds are inexpressible and variadic programming is inexpressible in Rust, we will always need a keyword to basically cover the lack of programmatic access to various aspects of Rust.</p><p><code>introwospect(Type, visitor)</code> works in a similar way. Based on what <code>Type</code> is, <code>introwospect</code> takes the following actions:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>0</span><span>	</span><span>/// `union`?

</span></code></pre></div><p>One of the reasons this <strong>also</strong> needs to be a keyword is because there’s no way to express “do this for a <code>union</code>, do that for an <code>enum</code>, do another thing for a <code>function</code>, and do this for a <code>struct</code>” in Rust generic code. So, switching based on what type of entity we are visiting is paramount to ensuring code compiles. If the core language ever adapts a way to do this in an elegant, Rusty way, we would absolutely welcome it.</p><p>The long list of issues above, even with a hacked-in language feature, is not confidence-inspiring in how simple this task will be. When considering reflection — at compile-time — for C++, Reflection Study Group 7 (SG7), despite having not yet finished a full reflection specification suitable for ISO standardization, never really had the problem of “what we are doing is entirely inexpressible in the language”. Templates were so fully featured that one could do reflection in them given the right language primitives since C++03 (2003). The interface would be absolutely horrendous, but the language was effectively ready for compile-time reflection in one weirdly-shaped way or another and has been for 20 years. That C++ does not have it is a result of competing designs and the emergence of <code>constexpr</code>, pushing the boundaries for what is possible in compile-time contexts in C++. And rightly so: template metaprogramming one’s way to compile-time reflection is grody and disgusting, and this comes from a group — us — who have done far too much of it to great success.</p><p>With Rust, the task is far more intimidating. Both the language and the library are wholly incapable of expressing the necessary concepts to do work on these things with normal Rust. The Trait system in Rust is not powerful enough to express necessary constraints in the slightest.</p><p>For example, one can recursively express a <code>Fields</code> type in C++ by creating a template <code>template &lt;typename Type, size_t INDEX&gt; struct FieldDescriptor;</code> that takes the <code>typename Type</code> and a <code>size_t INDEX</code>. One can perform recursion with C++ templates, creating what is effectively a stack of types describing each field by doing <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;Type, INDEX - 1&gt;</code>. The stop condition for that template is writing a specialization — something deeply frowned upon in Rust because of soundness issues — and stopping for <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;Type, 0&gt;</code> to prevent blowing out the compiler’s memory through endless recursion.</p><p>With Rust traits, not only is <code>INDEX - 1</code> not exactly a kosher operation in <code>const</code> generics, but there is no way to write a stop condition for <code>FieldDescriptor&lt;0&gt;</code> to tell it to stop its recursion, meaning it would eventually blow out the compiler’s memory stack or just be flagged as a straight up illegal operation. That means it is impossible to do recursive compile-time programming with type information or integer constant expressions in an even remotely normal way in Rust.</p><p>This creates an enormous number of problems for the Trait-based world of generics that Rust has built up for itself. Because we cannot properly constraint to have exactly all the field descriptors necessary, it means that generic code cannot write predictable, compile-time computation over an actually generic set of elements. Rust even lacks the ability to select for a specific subset of types that match a specific trait, because it will error if you use more than one bounding trait in the collection of implementations for any given trait.</p><p>Things that are trivially expressible in C++, Zig, and other languages become infinitely impossible in Rust’s traits and generics.</p><p>This, unfortunately, is a strong driver of how a lot of the mid-level API can and must work in Rust. Keywords <code>introwospect</code>, <code>introwospect_type</code>, and <code>introwospect_over</code> are all driven by deeply-seated inadequacies in Rust’s core syntaxes and language capabilities, each part a fundamental acknowledgement of a sincere issue that must be worked around in order to achieve the end-goal of proper compile-time reflection. And even when we take shortcuts with things like <code>introwospect_type</code> and <code>introwospect_over</code>, it introduces its own severe issues with the ergonomics of the programming models offered to end-users.</p><h2 id="the-problem-of-visitor-based-programming">The Problem of <code>Visitor</code>-based Programming</h2><p>The reason we describe the <code>introwospect(...)</code> and <code>introwospect_over(...)</code> APIs as “mid level” is because:</p><ol start="0"><li>there is a better way to program for these constructs and doing so with unconditionally linear calls using 0 or more fields results in needing to remember state from previous function calls to early-exit from other function calls;</li><li>and, it really does fit the slang term “mid”, as in subpar quality.</li></ol><p>For example, consider generic structure serialization we made above that was derived from the full serde implementation prior<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.

</span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we have to book-keep that an error has occurred on a prior field and inject that state into this <code>FieldDescriptorVisitor</code> implementation. This is because <code>introwospect_over</code> lays out a list of objects that produces a comma-delimited list, and ultimately every <code>visit_field_mut</code> function for that visitor must return the same type since we put it into an array:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>0</span><span>			</span><span>// … rest of the code here!!

</span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we are saying “this <code>for</code> loop runs at compile time”. It is equivalent to effectively performing a compile-time unrolling of the loop, each iteration of the loop effectively it’s own scoped body within the function. The <code>?</code> usage in here just bails if the serialization fails, without us having to save any intermediate state so that the next function call of a <code>visit_field_mut</code> has to handle it. This is far better than the <code>*DescriptorVisitor</code>-based programming. This is what we would consider a proper “high level” API, that is both high in terms of abstraction level/ease of use, and in terms of quality of the usage experience.</p><p>It allows us to stay in our scope, but grasp compile-time values much better. As stated previously, this syntax is not real. It would make everything much simpler, however, and thus would be worth investigating in the long-term for doing better <code>const</code> programming in Rust. In general, providing more constructs which allow this seamless transition between associated <code>const</code> items, types, and behavior would enable not just compile-time programming use cases, but make code for the SIMD project and several other use cases far more elegant, readable, and tractable.</p><p>There is a lot more that we could talk about insofar as Rust’s strengths and weaknesses for its generic programming.

Implementing the keywords and the rest of the functionality in time for the end of this Grant<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> period — another 2 months and 1 week — seems excessively beyond our capabilities as first-time <code>rustc</code> contributors. Shepherd’s Oasis will also look into aiding Waffle and DrMeepster in pushing and stabilizing <code>std::mem::offset_of!</code> for enumerations, unions, and more to make sure the syntax is solid.</p><p>As part of that discussion, one of the things we would like to address up-front is the perception of increased breakable API surface area. Due to providing more information at compile-time, there exists a chance that folks may:</p><ul><li>rely on compile-time computations that feed into other types (but not the same type, as that would be errored by the cycle checker);</li><li>rely on the ordering of fields for internal and external code;</li><li>and, rely on the number of fields available or accessible from an external crate.</li></ul><p>This is a very real concern, and is especially powerful when dealing with external crates from e.g. <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>. While crate-internal and private data types and functions can always be handled with grace, changes to external crates could have strong ripple effects in day-to-day code. If we were working in the C or C++ ecosystem, this is something we would have to consider very seriously as part of a proposal to add such features to the language. Thankfully, for Rust, this is entirely a non-issue. Unlike C and C++ which still rely on — in all perfect reality, honesty, and fairness — grotesque Perl programs, python scripts, and willful amnesia-inducing autoconf scripts mixed in with makefiles, Rust has a robust package management system built into its very core. <code>cargo.toml</code> has strict semantic versioning, feature specifications, and is paired with a language that was developed in an age where source control and repository control is both ubiquitous and personally catered to by <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, with an enormously responsive community.</p><p>Sage Griffin did not previously co-lead a whole team of the most fearless Ferris-lovers at <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> to blaze a path of glory for the entire Rust ecosystem just to have folks suddenly be scared of change.</p><p>If a crate changes a structure’s public fields, or changes function parameters in a major semantic versioning upgrade, or changes the type of a specific enumeration’s variant, the APIs presented here give you all the power to properly warn/error at compile-time about such changes. And, if you are too scared to make such a change, nothing stops the user from editing their <code>cargo.toml</code> to roll back to an older version if an upgrade is not feasible. We are past the stage where we have to hear horror stories about someone who is building against 25 year old object files because they blew up the only copy of the source code back in the day, and therefore have to maintain exact compatibility with a collection of the world’s worst oldest and worst bundle of static libraries. We have the infrastructure and capability to preserve compatibility locally while pushing for better improvements globally. Most of these tools — from <code>cargo</code> to <code>crates.io</code> — were provided at great burnout and personal cost to elder Rustaceans, battle-hardened software developers, weary SREs, and dedicated computer scientists.</p><p>We strong believe individuals scared of such scenarios should use the tools made available to them for their own personal advantage and comfort.</p><p>We also believe that we have achieved the right shape for the API we want. It is type-based, and all the values exist at compile-time through the use of associated <code>const</code> items. We may also chime into the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/const-eval">team working on <code>const</code> generic expressions and general-purpose Rust <code>const</code>-eval</a> to provide some feedback from time to time as we work on things. We hope that what we wrote here can be useful inspiration for them, and help guide the language to provide APIs and language features that make compile-time programming not just on-par with other languages in their area, but far better than they could ever hope to be.</p><p>We would like to thank the following people, who put up with a lot of our inquiries and, in some cases, got us into this trouble in the first place (this is a <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code> list)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p><ul><li>Manish Goregaokar, for getting us involved in this titanic endeavor in the first place and encouraging us to try for better generic programming and serialization in Rust (<a href="https://manishearth.github.io/">Website</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth">GitHub</a>).</li><li>Miguel Young de la Sota, for also getting us involved in this titanic endeavor in the first place and sowing the seeds of chaotic improvement (<a href="https://mcyoung.xyz/">Website</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mcy">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://art.mcyoung.xyz/">Art</a>).</li><li>Waffle, for helping us get off the ground with building <code>rustc</code> and solving strange errors.
