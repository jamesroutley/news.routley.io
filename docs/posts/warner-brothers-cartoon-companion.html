To begin with, he has seniority over Bugs -- his first cartoon, <i>Porky‚Äôs Duck Hunt </i>(Avery, 1937) predates <i>A Wild Hare </i>(Avery,
1940) by some three years. Equally important, the little black duck has
demonstrated an amazing range, thanks to the fact that he has been used
by a wide variety of Warner Brothers directors. From the wild
‚Äúwhooo-hoo‚Äù hysteria of <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-c.html#robert_clampett"><b>Bob Clampett</b></a> in films such as <i>The Daffy Doc </i>(1938), to the shifty-eyed scheming of <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-j.html#charles_m_jones"><b>Chuck Jones</b></a> best exemplified in the so-called <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-h.html#hunters_trilogy"><b>‚ÄúHunter‚Äôs Trilogy‚Äù</b></a>, ranging through countless superb <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-f.html#friz_freleng"><b>Freleng</b></a>, <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-t.html#frank_tashlin"><b>Tashlin</b></a> and <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-m.html#robert_mckimson"><b>McKimson</b></a> cartoons in-between, and even through some of <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-m.html#norm_mccabe"><b>Norm McCabe‚Äôs</b></a> better shorts, Daffy has
proven to be the most enduring character of the Warner Brothers cartoon studio. <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-a.html#averytex"><b>Avery</b></a>
may have actually created the character, but it was Clampett who made
him unforgettable. Each of Daffy‚Äôs subsequent directors has further
added to the complexity of the character.</SPAN></SPAN></p>

Dalton‚Äôs best-known cartoon with Hardaway is <i>Hare-Um Scare-Um </i>(1939), which features an early prototype of Bugs Bunny.

</SPAN></dt><dd><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">
</SPAN></SPAN><p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">Veteran
journeyman animator who played a long-running role at Warner Brothers,
directing there for a while in the 1940s. Davis originally came to the
studio with <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-t.html#frank_tashlin"><b>Frank Tashlin</b></a> when the latter took over from <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-m.html#norm_mccabe"><b>Norm McCabe</b></a>. Davis had previously been at Columbia Screen Gems, where he co-directed <i>The Little Match Girl </i>(1937)
and worked on the long-running series of cartoons starring Scrappy.
Davis‚Äô first work at Schleisinger‚Äôs was on a number of Tashlin
cartoons. <i>Scrap Happy Daffy </i>(1943) and <i>Brother Brat </i>(1944) are two of the cartoons for which Davis received animation credit.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">When <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-c.html#robert_clampett"><b>Robert Clampett</b></a> left Warner Brothers in 1945, Davis took over his unit,
completing a few cartoons which were already in production -- most notably <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-g.html#goofy_gophers"><b><i>The Goofy Gophers</i></b></a> (1947), for which Clampett had already recorded the dialogue.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">Although
most of his cartoons lack the polished appearance of some of his
colleagues‚Äô contemporaneous efforts, Arthur Davis succeeded in turning
out a good number of very solidly funny cartoons. He was greatly
assisted in this by writers <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-s.html#bill_scott"><b>Bill Scott</b></a> and <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-t.html#lloyd_turner"><b>Lloyd Turner</b></a>.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">The Davis cartoons featuring Daffy Duck were particularly good. The closing gag of <i>What Makes Daffy Duck? </i>(1948) features sign-switching for the changing hunting seasons, and may have inspired the later so-called <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-h.html#hunters_trilogy"><b>‚ÄúHunter‚Äôs Trilogy‚Äú</b></a> of Chuck Jones. Davis‚Äô sole Bugs Bunny cartoon, <i>Bowery Bugs </i>(1949),
takes place in Davis‚Äôs home town of New York, and manages to have Bugs
come across very nicely as a rascally con-artist, duping Steve Brodie
and eventually forcing him to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. Brodie,
who had been a saloon keeper, was a real-life character of gaslight-era
New York who supposedly jumped from the Bridge in one of the most vivid
legends of that city, a legend with which Davis would certainly have
been familiar.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">Davis,
alas, fell victim to the cost-cutting that wracked Hollywood
after the so-called ‚ÄúParamount Decrees‚Äù which broke up the close
integration between production, distribution, and exhibition that large
studios like Warner Brothers had depended upon. Davis, as the junior
man of the four-director rotation, lost his unit, which was broken up.
Davis emerged later as one of top animators in the <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-f.html#friz_freleng"><b>Freleng</b></a> unit throughout the 1950s, and animated for many of the classic Sylvester-Tweety battles.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">With
the coming of the 1960s, and the gradual spreading of director jobs to
top unit men, Davis got to direct one last cartoon at Warner Brothers, <i>Quackodile Tears </i>(1962). After the closure of the Warner Brothers cartoon studio, Davis did some work with <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-m.html#sid_marcus"><b>Sid Marcus</b></a>,
with whom he had worked at Screen Gems and Warner Brothers, as well as
on some of the later Woody Woodpecker cartoons for the Lantz studio.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">Along with <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-f.html#warren_foster"><b>Warren Foster</b></a>, Davis received story credit for <i>Sandy
Claws </i>(Freleng, 1955). Solomon, in discussing <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-m.html#robert_mckimson"><b>Bob McKimson</b></a>,
mentions
the relative lack of study given to his cartoons, noting that only
Davis is studied less. Too bad -- those who do not study the cartoons
of Arthur Davis are missing out on some of the most
consistently funny and underrated cartoons ever made at the studio.</SPAN></SPAN></p>

</SPAN></SPAN><p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">The leading lady of Warner Brothers during the thirties and forties
(one nickname for her was ‚ÄúThe Fifth Warner Brother‚Äù) who
was noted for having stormy relations with production head <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-j.html#jl"><b>Jack Warner</b></a>. Davis nearly won an Oscar in 1934 on a write-in vote for her role as the nasty waitress in <i>Of Human Bondage, </i>and did win for a less consequential role in the tearjerker <i>Dangerous </i>in 1935. She won another Oscar for her role in <i>Jezebel </i> in 1938, and gave a memorable performance in <i>All About Eve </i>(1950).
Davis holds the record for Oscar nominations, according to Katz, with
ten. Davis was best known for playing hard-nosed selfish women in a
number of tearjerkers.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN face="Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman" size="4"><SPAN size="-1">Davis herself is caricatured wonderfully, reprising her role in
<i>The Petrified Forest </i>(1936) with <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-h.html#lesie_howard"><b>Leslie Howard</b></a> in <i>She Was
An Acrobat‚Äôs Daughter </i>(Freleng, 1937), and again quite well in
<i>Hollywood Daffy </i>(Freleng, 1936). Davis is caricatured in
what appears to be her role opposite <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-f.html#errol_flynn"><b>Errol Flynn</b></a> in <i>The Private Life of Elizabeth and Essex </i>in <i>Malibu Beach Party </i>(Freleng, 1940). Bugs does a tearjerker turn in <i>The Big
Snooze </i>(Clampett, 1946), attempting to convince Elmer Fudd not to quit cartoons, pausing briefly to comment to the audience that Bette
Davis was going to hate him for it. Davis is also seen in <i>The
Coo-coo Nut Grove </i>(Freleng, 1936). Daffy attempts to lure Porky
away from the cartoon business by dangling the prospect of being
leading man opposite Davis in <i>You Ought to Be in Pictures </i>(Freleng, 1940). A table for Davis is reserved at Ciro‚Äôs (one of the great Hollywood hotspots of the 30s and 40s) in <i>Hollywood Steps Out </i>(Avery, 1941), next to the one for <a href="http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-s.html#kate_smith"><b>Kate Smith</b></a>.</SPAN></SPAN></p>

<p>Comic strip detective created by Chester Gould who reached the
height of his popularity in the thirties and forties, even to the
extent of appearing in movie serials. The comic strip was famous for
elaborately designed villains, such as Flattop Jones, The Blank, and

when, after causing a little accident to Sir Pantsalot of Dropseat
Manor in <i>Knights Must Fall </i>(Freleng, 1949), he refers to him as ‚ÄúAccordian Head‚Äù.</p>
<p><i>The Great Piggy Bank Robbery </i>(Clampett, 1946) is easily the
most prominent Warner Brothers spoof, with Daffy Duck starring as ‚ÄúDuck
Twacy‚Äù opposite a whole series of goony criminals with names and
physiques like ‚ÄúPickle Puss,‚Äù ‚ÄúNeon Noodle,‚Äù ‚ÄúJukebox Jaw,‚Äù ‚Äú88 Teeth‚Äù
(based on 88 Keyes, a murderous pianist in the comic strip), ‚ÄúDouble
Header,‚Äù ‚ÄúHammerhead,‚Äù ‚ÄúPussycat Puss,‚Äù ‚ÄúWolfman,‚Äù ‚ÄúRubberhead‚Äù (the
one who threatens to
rub Daffy out -- and does so), ‚ÄúPumpkinhead,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Human
Fly,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMouseman‚Äù. One that apparently got cut from the final film
was ‚ÄúThe Nostril,‚Äù who was supposed to say the line ‚ÄúYou mugs stay
here, I gotta blow!‚Äù. In addition, Flattop Jones from the strip makes
an appearance, his head put to punning use as a ‚Äúflat-top‚Äù aircraft
carrier.</p>
<p>Other references to Dick Tracy are seen in <i>Easter Yeggs </i>(McKimson, 1947) with Fudd‚Äôs Dick Tracy hat, <i>Elmer‚Äôs Pet Rabbit </i>(Jones, 1941) with Fudd perusing the comics, and <i>Farm Frolics </i>(Clampett, 1941) with the farm dog also perusing the comics.</p>

known as ‚ÄúSchnozzola‚Äù, Durante had a long career in Vaudeville, then on
