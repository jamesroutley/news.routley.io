<h2>A proof that the Halting Problem is undecidable</h2>

<b>Geoffrey K. Pullum</b></center>
<hr/>
<small>
An earlier version of this poetic proof was published in <i>Mathematics
Magazine</i> (<b>73</b>, no. 4, 319–320) in October 2000. But
despite a refereeing process that took nearly a year, it had an unnoticed
error. I am grateful to Philip Wadler (Informatics, University of
Edinburgh) and Larry Moss (Mathematics, Indiana University) for helping
develop this corrected version.

<p>
Through the kindness of Anuj Dawar, I had the great privilege and
pleasure of reading this aloud at a conference in honour of the memory
of Alan Turing at Cambridge University in June 2012.
(Notice that reading it aloud works best in southern British standard
English: the rhyme of the first two lines of the third stanza call for
a non-rhotic dialect.)  However, one attendee at that conference,
Damiano Mazza of the École Polytechnique, pointed out much
later that my revised version had another minor fault: it referred
to the proof was a <i>reductio</i>, when it really isn&#39;t (it&#39;s a
proof by assuming something in order to show that a contradiction
results). So I altered one line on 7 April 2022.  (I have tried
unsuccessfully to comfort myself over this history of carelessness on
my part with the thought that Turing&#39;s original 1936 paper also had a
few errors; he published a short correction in 1937.)
The corrected version has been reprinted with my permission in a
beautiful textbook by David Liben-Nowell,
<i>Connecting Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science</i>
(Cambridge University Press, 2022), p. 196.

My thanks to the late Dr. Seuss for the style, and to the
pioneering work of Alan Turing for the content, and to Martin
Davis’s nicely understandable simplified presentations of it,
and to Philip Wadler, Larry Moss, and Damiano Mazza for their help.
