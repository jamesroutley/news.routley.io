<p>On Monday, the US Department of Justice&#39;s next monopoly trial against Google started in Virginia—this time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/googles-ad-tech-dominance-spurs-more-antitrust-charges-report-says/">challenging the tech giant&#39;s ad tech dominance</a>.</p>
<p>The trial comes after Google lost two major cases that proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">Google had a monopoly in both general search</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">the Android app store</a>. During her opening statement, DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema—who will be ruling on the case after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/google-sends-doj-unexpected-check-in-attempt-to-avoid-monopoly-jury-trial/">Google cut a check to avoid a jury trial</a>—that &#34;it’s worth saying the quiet part out loud,&#34; AP News<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-ad-tech-virginia-opening-7a19f525287f782609a5316b1fdb08f0"> reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;One monopoly is bad enough,&#34; Wood said. &#34;But a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here.&#34;</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/US-v-Google-Ad-Tech-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, the DOJ argued that Google broke competition in the ad tech space &#34;by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising.&#34;</p>
<p>The result of such &#34;insidious&#34; allegedly anti-competitive behavior is that today Google pockets at least 30 cents &#34;of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through Google’s ad tech tools ... and sometimes far more,&#34; the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Google profits off both advertisers and publishers, &#34;website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more&#34; than &#34;they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools,&#34; the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>On Monday, Wood told Brinkema that Google intentionally put itself in this position to &#34;manipulate the rules of ad auctions to its own benefit,&#34; The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/09/google-antitrust-doj-adtech-monopoly/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Publishers were understandably furious,” Wood said. “The evidence will show that they could do nothing.”</p>
<p>Wood confirmed that the DOJ planned to call several publishers as witnesses in the coming weeks to explain the harms caused. Expected to take the stand will be &#34;executives from companies including USA Today, [Wall Street] Journal parent company News Corp., and the Daily Mail,&#34; the Post reported.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The ad tech trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks, may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced, experts have said.</p>
<p>That&#39;s because during the DOJ&#39;s trial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">proving Google&#39;s monopoly in search</a>, it remained unclear what remedies the DOJ sought. Some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/all-the-possible-ways-to-destroy-googles-monopoly-in-search/">ways to destroy Google&#39;s search monopoly</a> could be &#34;unlikely to create meaningful competition&#34; or hurt Google&#39;s bottom line, experts told Ars, but a more drastic order to spin out its Chrome browser or Android operating system could really impact Google&#39;s revenue. It won&#39;t be until December that the DOJ will even provide a rough outline of proposed remedies in that case, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/google-search-monopoly-case-remedies-come-by-december-2024-09-06/">reported</a>, with the judge not expected to rule until next August.</p>
<p>But the DOJ has been very clear about the remedies needed in the ad tech case, &#34;asking Brinkema to order a divestment of Google’s Ad Manager suite of services, which is responsible for many of the rectangular ads that populate the tops and sides of webpages across the Internet,&#34; the Post reported.</p>
<p>Because the most &#34;obvious&#34; remedy would be to require Google to sell off parts of its ad business, experts told AP News that the ad tech trial &#34;could potentially be more harmful to Google&#34; than the search trial. Perhaps at the furthest extreme, antitrust expert Shubha Ghosh told Ars that &#34;if this case goes against Google as the last one did, it could set the stage for splitting it into separate search and advertising companies.&#34;</p>
<p>In the DOJ&#39;s complaint, prosecutors argued that it &#34;is critical to restore competition in these markets by enjoining Google’s anticompetitive practices, unwinding Google’s anticompetitive acquisitions, and imposing a remedy sufficient both to deny Google the fruits of its illegal conduct and to prevent further harm to competition in the future.&#34;</p>
<p>Ghosh said that undoing Google&#39;s acquisitions could lead to Google no longer representing both advertisers&#39; and sellers&#39; interests in each ad auction—instead requiring Google to either pick a side or perhaps involve a broker.</p>
<p>Although the Post reported that Google has argued that &#34;customers prefer the convenience of a one-stop shop,&#34; the DOJ hopes to prove that Google&#39;s alleged monopoly has shuttered newspapers across the US and threatens to do more harm if left unchecked.</p>
