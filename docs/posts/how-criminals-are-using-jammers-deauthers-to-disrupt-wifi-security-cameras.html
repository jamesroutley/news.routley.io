    <h1>How criminals are using jammers, deauthers to disrupt WiFi security cameras</h1>

        <div><p>(WXYZ) — A new warning is being issued for anyone who uses wireless security cameras like &#34;Ring&#34; to protect their home. </p><p>A Detroit woman said her Ring camera didn&#39;t capture the moment her car was stolen from the front of her house, and one local expert said it&#39;s because crooks are becoming more tech-savvy.</p><p>Earlier this month, the woman said her car was stolen from her driveway, and when she went to review her Ring camera footage, she realized hours were missing.</p><p>Chris Burns, the owner of Techie Gurus, said security cameras that use WiFi to record are more about convenience than security. That&#39;s because WiFi can easily be disrupted, preventing the camera from capturing who is around your home, and criminals are catching on.</p><p>&#34;If you&#39;re relying on wireless as a security thing, you&#39;re looking at it wrong,&#34; Burns said. &#34;Wireless signals are easy to jam or block.&#34;</p><p>Those crooks can use this like a WiFi jamming device, or a deauther, which can be the size of an Apple Watch.</p><p>A deauther will overwhelm a WiFi system, forcing the WiFi camera to stop recording if you stand close enough. The accessory only costs about $10-$50. A jammer on the other hand will cost anywhere between $150 to $1,000.</p><p>They&#39;re also highly illegal, so jammers are more difficult to find, but a powerful jammer can prevent an entire street from recording on WiFI security cameras with the switch of a button.</p><p>A spokesperson from Ring sent a statement saying, &#34;Like any wifi-enabled device, WiFi signal interference may affect Ring device performance. If customers are experiencing issues with connectivity, we encourage them to reach out to Ring Customer Support.&#34;</p><p>How can customers protect themselves?</p><p>&#34;For true security, it should always be hard-wired, it should always be plugged into ethernet or something like that,&#34; Burns said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ring said although they are aware of the problem, it is rare.</p><p>Burns said as technology gets cheaper, it&#39;s likely jammers will become more popular and it&#39;s important to keep people fully-informed.</p></div>
