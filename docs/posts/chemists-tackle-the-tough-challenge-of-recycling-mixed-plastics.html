<p>Plastics are everywhere in our daily lives, but not all plastics are created equal—far from it.

<p>Take, for instance, polyethylene terephthalate, a plastic used to make soda bottles and clothing fibers. Then there&#39;s <a href="https://phys.org/tags/high-density+polyethylene/" rel="tag">high-density polyethylene</a>, from which shampoo bottles, milk jugs and cutting boards are derived. Don&#39;t forget polystyrene for packaging, or low-density polyethylene, which gives us cling wrap and grocery bags.
</p><p>All of these are plastics, which are the most widely used types of polymers—macromolecules made of repeating units of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/small+molecules/" rel="tag">small molecules</a> called monomers. Post-consumer plastics are almost always collected as a mixed stream of waste, and products are often manufactured from two or more types of plastics.
</p><p>The bad news is that these items, though all &#34;plastics,&#34; are chemically and physically incompatible, and there&#39;s no good industrial method for reusing or re-processing them into other useful products. That&#39;s why most of those &#34;recyclables&#34; you&#39;re throwing into bins every week are going to a landfill. Even after careful sorting and separation into individual plastics, mechanical recycling usually yields inferior products, termed down-cycling.
</p><p>Polymer chemists at Colorado State University have long been leaders in finding ways to tackle the environmental problems humans have created with plastics waste. Now, they&#39;ve come up with fundamental new chemistry that seeds a creative solution to the challenge of recycling mixed-use plastics.
</p><p>Led by University Distinguished Professor Eugene Chen in the Department of Chemistry, and Tomislav Rovis and Sanat Kumar, professors at Columbia University (Rovis was formerly a faculty member at CSU), the team has devised a new chemical strategy that delivers specifically designed small molecules called universal dynamic crosslinkers into mixed plastic streams.
</p><p>These crosslinkers transform a former muck of unmixable materials into a viable new set of polymers, which can be turned into new, higher-value, re-processable materials, a process known as upcycling. The work is published in the journal <i>Nature.</i>
</p><h2>Dynamic crosslinkers</h2>
<p>When heated and processed together with the dynamic crosslinkers added in small amounts, the mixed plastics are made compatible with each other through in-situ formation of a new material, called a multiblock copolymer.
</p><p>Kumar likened the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/block+copolymers/" rel="tag">block copolymers</a> to soap molecules, which make water compatible with oily dirt molecules. &#34;In a similar way, these new types of dynamically formed &#39;soaps,&#39; i.e. the block copolymers, compatibilize mixed plastics and make them usable as a new kind of material with useful properties.&#34;
</p><p>This new method of upcycling, which does not involve deconstructing or reconstructing any of the original polymers, introduces a potential solution for recapturing materials and energy endowed in post-consumer mixed plastics that typically end up in landfills.
</p><p>The team designed their crosslinkers and tested them on a variety of plastics, including samples of mixed polyethylene Ziploc bags and polylactide cups without prior purification or removal of additives or dyes, which are typically present in post-consumer plastic products. They combined their experiments with modeling studies to verify that the crosslinkers induce the formation of new multiblock copolymers.
</p><p>&#34;The system is so efficient, it compatibilizes three different polymers into a single new material,&#34; Rovis said.
</p><h2>Multiple use cycles</h2>
<p>The researchers posit that their new strategy could help achieve the ultimate goal of reusing mixed plastic waste over multiple use cycles, Chen said.
</p><p>&#34;A key barrier is cost; we are talking about millions of tons of plastic waste, and you have to consider how many of these dynamic crosslinkers you need, although we currently need only less than 5% of the weight of the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/plastics/" rel="tag">plastics</a> in our upcycling process. Like many fundamental discoveries made in history, practical obstacles exist at the very beginning, but we are very excited about future potential.&#34;
