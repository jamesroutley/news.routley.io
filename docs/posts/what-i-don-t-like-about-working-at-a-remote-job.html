    <h1>What I don’t like about working at a remote job</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Working remotely permanently had been my wish ever since my managers started calling me back into the office. There was no possible way I would suffer through hours of commuting to feel awkward in an office again.</p>
<p>My wish got granted at the beginning of this year when I joined Wave. In the beginning, I was basking in the sparkly allure of freedom. Oh the possibilities! I could work anywhere, at any time as long as I get the work done. What a world!</p>
<p>However, with time came getting used to my situation. Even in the best possible world, your brain is always seeking something better. Although I really, really love remote work (please don’t take it away from me), I’ve noticed some things that make me sad about it. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it feels like I’m living in Groundhog Day everyday. Every single day looks exactly the same</li>
<li>I feel like someone who has just retired. I had all these dreams about what I’d do when I had more time. And now I do. It feels like a retiree trying to finally write his great American novel and not being able to get a single sentence out.</li>
<li>It’s hard to make friends as an adult</li>
<li>I can’t move out bc I have nothing determining my location</li>
<li>I have an unstable schedule</li>
<li>A lot of these problems are discipline problems — it’s hard to build and maintain discipline when you have no one to enforce it for you
<ul>
<li>willpower is a limited resource and you’re spending a lot of willpower for everything when you work at a remote job. Everything is under your control so to live a good normal life, you need to set rules for yourself <em>and</em> enforce these rules yourself:
<ul>
<li>waking up at a decent time — not sleeping too much (bc sleeping a lot makes me depressed)</li>
<li>setting a regular work schedule and working enough</li>
<li>not working too much</li>
<li>exercising everyday</li>
<li>sleeping at the same time everyday
<ul>
<li>when you are forced to come in to the office everyday, you accept the consequences of working after a sleepless night</li>
<li>at a remote job, you know you can just sleep in so you’re much more lenient with yourself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>overall making a daily schedule and sticking to it takes a lot of mental energy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it’s great that people treat us like actual adults but most adults need to be supervised to a certain extent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s extremely hard to be friends with your co-workers. You have to go out of your way to reach out and be available. Friendships don’t happen “organically” like they do in the office</li>
<li>It’s hard to determine how to spend your time in a meaningful way. Should I write on my blog that no one reads, should I practice my stick-figure drawing skills, should I create new projects that no one will use
<ul>
<li>When you have no interesting hobbies, you’re spending a lot of your time dabbling. You don’t have the discipline to force yourself to stick with something you’re not good at and you don’t see any benefit from</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extremely busy jobs looks appealing
<ul>
<li>My partner’s surgery rotation looks so exciting and full and life (and death) even though he wakes up at 4am and ends his day at 7pm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You sit on your ass all day and even walking around so your legs can get some circulation requires discipline</li>
</ul>
<p>I have solutions to a lot of these problems. I just don’t always have the mental strength to actually use the solutions. And the weeks when I slip feel like I&#39;m falling.</p></div></div></div>
