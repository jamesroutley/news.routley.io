<p data-block-key="65r08">I often <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/three-ways-i-exercise-in-my-apartment/">exercise with friends via videocall, where we all follow along with the same online video</a>. Recently a friend asked for recommendations of free YouTube videos for beginners. Here&#39;s what I said:</p><p data-block-key="fm4k2"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/well/move/in-6-minutes-you-can-be-done-with-your-workout.html">This <i>New York Times</i> workout</a> is where I started. It&#39;s a six-minute workout in total, including 3 different exercise videos.</p><p data-block-key="5lgmm">I really like 2 instructors, who both have YouTube playlists to make it easy to find what you want:</p><ol><li data-block-key="3ikh6"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheBodyCoachTV">Joe Wicks, &#34;The Body Coach.&#34;</a> British guy, concentrates on strength and cardio. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6TtFr2Zp_s&amp;list=PLyCLoPd4VxBvH1ZqD6Vp6vD2C2No1cloe&amp;index=6">Here is a 10-minute workout you can do while sitting in a chair.</a> Very beginner-friendly, meant for senior citizens -- sometimes my friends and I have done this one.</li><li data-block-key="fceg8"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JessicaValantPilates">Jessica Valant</a>. American woman, concentrates on Pilates, is also a physical therapist. She usually talks about how to modify moves to make them easier or harder, based on what you can handle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jd-hbwkqUk">Here&#39;s a 12-minute video that focuses on muscle strength, circulation, breathing, and pelvic floor health.</a></li></ol><p data-block-key="4otqe">Wicks and Valant don&#39;t have music in the background. If you want music, Popsugar has good videos that also demonstrate modifications you can do for easier vs harder. I think I remember liking this one, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxLL9Scvmzo">&#34;beginner low-impact cardio&#34; (15 min)</a>.</p><p data-block-key="fpocg">(I forgot to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Yd2YpIDkI">Hybrid Calisthenics videos</a> to my friend, but I think they&#39;re good too. <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/191445/Fitness-is-a-journey-and-we-all-start-somewhere">Relevant MetaFilter discussion.</a>)</p>
