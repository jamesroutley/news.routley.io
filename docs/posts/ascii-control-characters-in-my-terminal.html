    <h1>ASCII control characters in my terminal</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the terminal a lot and yesterday I got curious
about all these &ldquo;control codes&rdquo;, like <code>Ctrl-A</code>, <code>Ctrl-C</code>, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, etc. What&rsquo;s
the deal with all of them?</p>
<h3 id="a-table-of-ascii-control-characters">a table of ASCII control characters</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a table of all 33 ASCII control characters, and what they do on my
machine (on Mac OS), more or less. There are about a million caveats, but I&rsquo;ll talk about
what it means and all the problems with this diagram that I know about.</p>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/ascii.html"><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/ascii-control.png"></a></p>
<p>You can also view it <a href="https://jvns.ca/ascii.html">as an HTML page</a> (I just made it an image so
it would show up in RSS).</p>
<h3 id="different-kinds-of-codes-are-mixed-together">different kinds of codes are mixed together</h3>
<p>The first surprising thing about this diagram to me is that there are 33
control codes, split into (very roughly speaking) these categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Codes that are handled by the operating system&rsquo;s terminal driver, for
example when the OS sees a <code>3</code> (<code>Ctrl-C</code>), it&rsquo;ll send a <code>SIGINT</code> signal to
the current program</li>
<li>Everything else is passed through to the application as-is and the
application can do whatever it wants with them. Some subcategories of
those:
<ul>
<li>Codes that correspond to a literal keypress of a key on your keyboard
(<code>Enter</code>, <code>Tab</code>, <code>Backspace</code>). For example when you press <code>Enter</code>, your
terminal gets sent <code>13</code>.</li>
<li>Codes used by <code>readline</code>: &ldquo;the application can do whatever it wants&rdquo;
often means &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll do more or less what the <code>readline</code> library does,
whether the application actually uses <code>readline</code> or not&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;ve
labelled a bunch of the codes that <code>readline</code> uses</li>
<li>Other codes, for example I think <code>Ctrl-X</code> has no standard meaning in the
terminal in general but emacs uses it very heavily</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real structure to which codes are in which categories, they&rsquo;re all
just kind of randomly scattered because this evolved organically.</p>
<p>(If you&rsquo;re curious about readline, I wrote more about readline in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>, and there are a lot of
<a href="https://github.com/chzyer/readline/blob/master/doc/shortcut.md">cheat sheets out there</a>)</p>
<h3 id="there-are-only-33-control-codes">there are only 33 control codes</h3>
<p>Something else that I find a little surprising is that are only 33 control codes &ndash;
A to Z, plus 7 more (<code>@, [, \, ], ^, _, ?</code>). This means that if you want to
have for example <code>Ctrl-1</code> as a keyboard shortcut in a terminal application,
that&rsquo;s not really meaningful &ndash; on my machine at least <code>Ctrl-1</code> is exactly the
same thing as just pressing <code>1</code>, <code>Ctrl-3</code> is the same as <code>Ctrl-[</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Also <code>Ctrl+Shift+C</code> isn&rsquo;t a control code &ndash; what it does depends on your
terminal emulator. On Linux <code>Ctrl-Shift-X</code> is often used by the terminal
emulator to copy or open a new tab or paste for example, it&rsquo;s not sent to the
TTY at all.</p>
<p>Also I use <code>Ctrl+Left Arrow</code> all the time, but that isn&rsquo;t a control code,
instead it sends an ANSI escape sequence (<code>ctrl-[[1;5D</code>) which is a different
thing which we absolutely do not have space for in this post.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;there are only 33 codes&rdquo; thing is totally different from how keyboard
shortcuts work in a GUI where you can have <code>Ctrl+KEY</code> for any key you want.</p>
<h3 id="the-official-ascii-names-aren-t-very-meaningful-to-me">the official ASCII names aren&rsquo;t very meaningful to me</h3>
<p>Each of these 33 control codes has a name in ASCII (for example <code>3</code> is <code>ETX</code>).
When all of these control codes were originally defined, they weren&rsquo;t being
used for computers or terminals at all, they were used for <a href="https://falsedoor.com/doc/ascii_evolution-of-character-codes.pdf">the telegraph machine</a>.
Telegraph machines aren&rsquo;t the same as UNIX terminals so a lot of the codes were repurposed to mean something else.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t find these ASCII names very useful, because 50% of the time
the name in ASCII has no actual relationship to what that code does on UNIX
systems today. So it feels easier to just ignore the ASCII names completely
instead of trying to figure which ones still match their original meaning.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-hard-to-use-ctrl-m-as-a-keyboard-shortcut">It&rsquo;s hard to use Ctrl-M  as a keyboard shortcut</h3>
<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s a bit weird is that <code>Ctrl-M</code> is literally the same as
<code>Enter</code>, and <code>Ctrl-I</code> is the same as <code>Tab</code>, which makes it hard to use those two as keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>From some quick research, it seems like some folks do still use <code>Ctrl-I</code> and
<code>Ctrl-M</code> as keyboard shortcuts (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2705">here&rsquo;s an example</a>), but to do that
you need to configure your terminal emulator to treat them differently than the
default.</p>
<p>For me the main takeaway is that if I ever write a terminal application I
should avoid <code>Ctrl-I</code> and <code>Ctrl-M</code> as keyboard shortcuts in it.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-identify-what-control-codes-get-sent">how to identify what control codes get sent</h3>
<p>While writing this I needed to do a bunch of experimenting to digure out what
various key combinations did, so I wrote this Python script
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/a2ea09dbfbe03cc75b7bfb381941c742">echo-key.py</a>
that will print them out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a more official way but I appreciated having a script I could
customize.</p>
<h3 id="caveat-on-canonical-vs-noncanonical-mode">caveat: on canonical vs noncanonical mode</h3>
<p>Two of these codes (<code>Ctrl-W</code> and <code>Ctrl-U</code>) are labelled in the table as
&ldquo;handled by the OS&rdquo;, but actually they&rsquo;re not <strong>always</strong> handled by the OS, it
depends on whether the terminal is in &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; mode or in &ldquo;noncanonical mode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html">canonical mode</a>,
programs only get input when you press <code>Enter</code> (and the OS is in charge of deleting characters when you press <code>Backspace</code> or <code>Ctrl-W</code>). But in noncanonical mode the program gets
input immediately when you press a key, and the <code>Ctrl-W</code> and <code>Ctrl-U</code> codes are passed through to the program to handle any way it wants.</p>
<p>Generally in noncanonical mode the program will handle <code>Ctrl-W</code> and <code>Ctrl-U</code>
similarly to how the OS does, but there are some small differences.</p>
<p>Some examples of programs that use canonical mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>probably pretty much any noninteractive program, like <code>grep</code> or <code>cat</code></li>
<li><code>git</code>, I think</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of programs that use noncanonical mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>python3</code>, <code>irb</code> and other REPLs</li>
<li>your shell</li>
<li>any full screen TUI like <code>less</code> or <code>vim</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="caveat-all-of-the-os-terminal-driver-codes-are-configurable-with-stty">caveat: all of the &ldquo;OS terminal driver&rdquo; codes are configurable with <code>stty</code></h3>
<p>I said that <code>Ctrl-C</code> sends <code>SIGINT</code> but technically this is not necessarily
true, if you really want to you can remap all of the codes labelled &ldquo;OS
terminal driver&rdquo;, plus Backspace, using a tool called <code>stty</code>, and you can view
the mappings with <code>stty -a</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the mappings on my machine right now:</p>
<pre><code>$ stty -a
cchars: discard = ^O; dsusp = ^Y; eof = ^D; eol = &lt;undef&gt;;
	eol2 = &lt;undef&gt;; erase = ^?; intr = ^C; kill = ^U; lnext = ^V;
	min = 1; quit = ^\; reprint = ^R; start = ^Q; status = ^T;
	stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; time = 0; werase = ^W;
</code></pre>
<p>I have personally never remapped any of these and I cannot imagine a reason I
would (I think it would be a recipe for confusion and disaster for me), but I
<a href="TODO">asked on Mastodon</a> and people said the most common reasons they used
<code>stty</code> were:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix a broken terminal with <code>stty sane</code></li>
<li>set <code>stty erase ^H</code> to change how Backspace works</li>
<li>set <code>stty ixoff</code></li>
<li>some people even map <code>SIGINT</code> to a different key, like their <code>DELETE</code> key</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="caveat-on-signals">caveat: on signals</h3>
<p>Two signals caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the <code>ISIG</code> terminal mode is turned off, then the OS won&rsquo;t send signals. For example <code>vim</code> turns off <code>ISIG</code></li>
<li>Apparently on BSDs, there&rsquo;s an extra control code (<code>Ctrl-T</code>) which sends <code>SIGINFO</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You can see which terminal modes a program is setting using <code>strace</code> like this,
terminal modes are set with the <code>ioctl</code> system call:</p>
<pre><code>$ strace -tt -o out  vim
$ grep ioctl out | grep SET
</code></pre>
<p>here are the modes <code>vim</code> sets when it starts (<code>ISIG</code> and <code>ICANON</code> are
missing!):</p>
<pre><code>17:43:36.670636 ioctl(0, TCSETS, {c_iflag=IXANY|IMAXBEL|IUTF8,
c_oflag=NL0|CR0|TAB0|BS0|VT0|FF0|OPOST, c_cflag=B38400|CS8|CREAD,
c_lflag=ECHOK|ECHOCTL|ECHOKE|PENDIN, ...}) = 0
</code></pre>
<p>and it resets the modes when it exits:</p>
<pre><code>17:43:38.027284 ioctl(0, TCSETS, {c_iflag=ICRNL|IXANY|IMAXBEL|IUTF8,
c_oflag=NL0|CR0|TAB0|BS0|VT0|FF0|OPOST|ONLCR, c_cflag=B38400|CS8|CREAD,
c_lflag=ISIG|ICANON|ECHO|ECHOE|ECHOK|IEXTEN|ECHOCTL|ECHOKE|PENDIN, ...}) = 0
</code></pre>
<p>I think the specific combination of modes vim is using here might be called
&ldquo;raw mode&rdquo;, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/cfmakeraw">man cfmakeraw</a> talks about
that.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-a-lot-of-conflicts">there are a lot of conflicts</h3>
<p>Related to &ldquo;there are only 33 codes&rdquo;, there are a lot of conflicts where
different parts of the system want to use the same code for different things,
for example by default <code>Ctrl-S</code> will freeze your screen, but if you turn that
off then <code>readline</code> will use <code>Ctrl-S</code> to do a forward search.</p>
<p>Another example is that on my machine sometimes <code>Ctrl-T</code> will send <code>SIGINFO</code>
and sometimes it&rsquo;ll transpose 2 characters and sometimes it&rsquo;ll do something
completely different depending on:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the program has <code>ISIG</code> set</li>
<li>whether the program uses <code>readline</code> / imitates readline&rsquo;s behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="caveat-on-backspace-and-other-backspace">caveat: on &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; and &ldquo;other backspace&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In this diagram I&rsquo;ve labelled code 127 as &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; and 8 as &ldquo;other
backspace&rdquo;. Uh, what?</p>
<p>I think this was the single biggest topic of discussion in the replies on Mastodon &ndash; apparently there&rsquo;s a LOT of history to this and I&rsquo;d never heard of any of it before.</p>
<p>First, here&rsquo;s how it works on my machine:</p>
<ol>
<li>I press the <code>Backspace</code> key</li>
<li>The TTY gets sent the byte <code>127</code>, which is called <code>DEL</code> in ASCII</li>
<li>the OS terminal driver and readline both have <code>127</code> mapped to &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; (so it works both in canonical mode and noncanonical mode)</li>
<li>The previous character gets deleted</li>
</ol>
<p>If I press <code>Ctrl+H</code>, it has the same effect as <code>Backspace</code> if I&rsquo;m using
readline, but in a program without readline support (like <code>cat</code> for instance),
it just prints out <code>^H</code>.</p>
<p>Apparently Step 2 above is different for some folks &ndash; their <code>Backspace</code> key sends
the byte <code>8</code> instead of <code>127</code>, and so if they want Backspace to work then they
need to configure the OS (using <code>stty</code>) to set <code>erase = ^H</code>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#keyboard-configuration">section of the Debian Policy Manual on keyboard configuration</a>
that describes how <code>Delete</code> and <code>Backspace</code> should work according to Debian
policy, which seems very similar to how it works on my Mac today.  My
understanding (via <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@Diziet/113396035847619715">this mastodon post</a>)
is that this policy was written in the 90s because there was a lot of confusion
about what <code>Backspace</code> should do in the 90s and there needed to be a standard
to get everything to work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch more historical terminal stuff here but that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll say for
now.</p>
<p>One thing you might notice is that very few of them have &ldquo;I use this&rdquo; hearts,</p>
<h3 id="there-s-probably-a-lot-more-diversity-in-how-this-works">there&rsquo;s probably a lot more diversity in how this works</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably missed a bunch more ways that &ldquo;how it works on my machine&rdquo; might
be different from how it works on other people&rsquo;s machines, and I&rsquo;ve probably
made some mistakes about how it works on my machine too. But that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve
got for today.</p>
<p>Some more stuff I know that I&rsquo;ve left out: according to <code>stty -a</code> <code>Ctrl-O</code> is
&ldquo;discard&rdquo;, <code>Ctrl-R</code> is &ldquo;reprint&rdquo;, and <code>Ctrl-Y</code> is &ldquo;dsusp&rdquo;. I have no idea how
to make those actually do anything (pressing them does not do anything
obvious), and a lot of the time in practice they seem to just be passed through
to the application anyway so I just labelled <code>Ctrl-R</code> and <code>Ctrl-Y</code> as
<code>readline</code>.</p>
<h3 id="not-all-of-this-is-that-useful-to-know">not all of this is that useful to know</h3>
<p>Also I want to say that I think the contents of this post are kind of interesting
but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re necessarily that <em>useful</em>. I&rsquo;ve used the terminal
pretty successfully every day for the last 20 years without knowing literally
any of this &ndash; I just knew what <code>Ctrl-C</code>, <code>Ctrl-D</code>, <code>Ctrl-Z</code>, <code>Ctrl-R</code>,
<code>Ctrl-L</code> did in practice (plus maybe <code>Ctrl-A</code>, <code>Ctrl-E</code> and <code>Ctrl-W</code>) and did
not worry about the details for the most part, and that was
almost always totally fine except when I was <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/07/20/pseudoterminals/">trying to use xterm.js</a>.</p>
<p>But I had fun learning about it so maybe it&rsquo;ll be interesting to you too.</p>
