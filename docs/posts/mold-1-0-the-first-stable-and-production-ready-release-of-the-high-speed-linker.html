    <h1>Mold 1.0: the first stable and production-ready release of the high-speed linker</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>mold 1.0 is the first stable and production-ready release of the high-speed linker. On Linux-based systems, it should &#34;just work&#34; as a faster drop-in replacement for the default GNU linker for most user-land programs. If you are building a large executable which takes a long time to link, mold is worth a try to see if it can shorten your build time. mold is easy to build and easy to use. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/rui314/mold">README</a>.</p>
<p>mold is created by a person who knows very well as to how the Unix linker should behave, as I&#39;m also the original creator of the current version of the LLVM lld linker.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no fancy new features in 1.0. Actually, 1.0 is very similar to 0.9.6. That being said, we&#39;d like to make it clear by incrementing a major version number that mold for Linux is now stable.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>We are currently working on mold for macOS, and once it&#39;s complete, we&#39;ll release it as mold 2.0. After that, we&#39;ll work on mold for Windows and release it as 3.0.</p>
<p>mold 1.0&#39;s source tree has code for mold for macOS, but that&#39;s pre-alpha. Do not use it unless you know what you are doing.</p>
<h2>Changes since mold 0.9.6</h2>
