    <h1>Windows 11 24H2 hoards 8.63 GB of junk you can&#39;t delete</h1>

<p>Windows 11 24H2 users are finding there is undeletable data that remains on their devices after installing the recently released feature update.</p>

<p>The known issues list has not grown in the days since the rollout on October 15, however, for many users – this writer included – attempts to clean up the detritus after the update has left 8.63 GB of disk space occupied by &#34;Windows Update Cleanup.&#34;</p>
<p>Having file remnants after a Windows update is not unusual, and, according to Microsoft, &#34;Windows keeps copies of all installed updates from Windows Update, even after installing newer versions of updates.&#34; Space taken up by the old versions can be reclaimed – at least that&#39;s the idea.</p>
<p>The Windows Settings application or the delightfully retro Disk Cleanup tool can be used to clear the temporary files from storage.</p>
<p>However, that 8.63 GB of data appears to persist regardless of how often a user attempts to delete it or restarts Windows 11. A scan of Microsoft&#39;s Feedback Hub confirms numerous users are affected.</p>

<p><i>El Reg</i> asked Microsoft if it was aware of the problem and when it would be addressed. The Windows vendor has yet to respond - which is pretty much par for the course these days. However, it likely has something to do with how updates are handled in the brave new world of Windows 11 24H2.</p>
<p>In July, Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/16/microsoft_introduces_checkpoint_cumulative_updates/">said</a> it would implement checkpoint cumulative updates in Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025. The stated goal of this change is to reduce the size of updates, but a consequence is that a checkpoint is needed from which to start. This is likely the reason why that 8.63 GB appears for some users.</p>

    

<p>The problem is that Windows 11 lists those files as old updates that the user can delete, even when the clean-up tools cannot remove the files. It is possible to remove them manually, but doing so could cause issues when the next set of updates arrive.</p>

        

<p>The need for storage is unlikely to change in the near future. However, the way Windows reports its use will itself need to be updated for the sake of all of those users confused about why they cannot reclaim the space that Windows insists they can. ®</p>
