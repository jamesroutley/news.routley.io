<p><span>To provide users with a good service, government organisations usually need to collect data. Lots of data. The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> team publishes patterns and components that let users enter their data in an easy and accessible way. The last thing we want to do is create barriers to users completing a task and force them to find an alternative method of using the service, such as phoning a helpline. </span></p>
<p><span>Numbers are one of the most commonly asked for pieces of data, typically used in dates. We know from user research that some users prefer the large buttoned number keyboard (resembling a telephone keypad) for entering numbers on mobile. Until now, the GOV.UK Design System date input component used the HTML element <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> to provide this number keypad when a user enters dates.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4462"><img loading="lazy" src="https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad.jpg" alt="A large buttoned keypad used on Android devices" width="512" height="351" srcset="https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad.jpg 512w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad-300x206.jpg 300w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad-435x298.jpg 435w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"/><figcaption>Large buttoned, easy to use number keypad on Android</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>However, we recently moved away from <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;input type=&#34;text&#34; inputmode=&#34;numeric&#34; pattern=&#34;[0-9]*&#34;&gt;</code> and published new </span><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#numbers"><span>guidance on how to ask users for numbers</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why type=number is problematic</b></h2>
<p><span>Although we have user research from 2017 that didn’t flag any major issues with <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code>, we identified many usability problems with this input type.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Accessibility</b></h3>
<p><span>We found that <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>cannot be <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/reported-bugs/issues/34">dictated or selected when using Dragon Naturally Speaking</a></span></li>
<li><span>appears as </span><a href="https://github.com/alphagov/reported-bugs/issues/41"><span>unlabeled in NVDA&#39;s element list</span></a></li>
<li><span>appears as a <a href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/9675#issuecomment-499977041">spin button in NVDA&#39;s object navigation, which has an edit field and two buttons inside</a></span> <span>- those buttons are unlabeled, but decrease/increase the value</span></li>
<li><span>is reported as </span><a href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/9675#issuecomment-499977041"><span>unlabeled edit field</span></a><span> when using nvda+tab</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>2. Incrementable numbers</b></h3>
<p>It&#39;s <span>reasonable to assume that <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> can be used for collecting any numeric data: it contains the word “number”, after all. However, a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#when-number-is-not-appropriate">note in the HTML specification</a> states that <code>&lt;input type=”number”&gt;</code> is “not appropriate for input that happens to only consist of numbers but isn&#39;t strictly speaking a number”.</span></p>
<p><span>This means that <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> can only be used for incrementable numbers, such as dates or the number of people in a household. Using <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> for collecting numbers that are not incrementable can cause problems with browsers validating them in that way.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, browsers attempt to round large numbers when incrementing or decrementing (pressing up or down key), and in the case of very large numbers they are converted to exponential notation.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Video: Browsers attempt to round large numbers" width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gn6QYu6ro2Y?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h4>Chrome 79.0: type=number displays large numbers in exponential format if user presses the up or down arrows on their keyboard</h4>
<p><span>Once the number is parsed by the browser as an exponent, as shown above, and possibly by mistake, t</span><span>he </span><span>action cannot be reversed by the user. This could confuse users. </span></p>
<p><span>If users access your site using older versions of Safari, <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> can also be problematic when collecting values of 16 or more digits. In Safari 6, the browser rounds the number when a user leaves the field, so no mistake with up or down keys is required.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Video: Safari 6 rounds the last digit on blur" width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DLsuT-sYLk?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h4>Safari 6 rounds the last digit on blur</h4>
<p><span>Safari 5.1 attempts to make values with at least 16 digits more readable by inserting commas.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Video: Safari 5.1 attempting a more human readable number on blur" width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrZWtCCQquM?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h4>Safari 5.1 attempting a more human readable number on blur</h4>
<h3><b>3. Letters </b></h3>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#number-state-(type=number)"><span>HTML spec</span></a><span> states that when using <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code>, “user agents must not allow the user to set the value to a non-empty string that is not a valid floating-point number”. The web and Android versions of Chrome implement this by silently discarding all letter input except the letter ‘e’.</span></p>
<p>This means <a href="https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/1355"><span>users are not given feedback</span></a><span> on what type of characters </span><span><code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code></span><span> accepts, and assistive technologies don’t alert the user that their input has been silently discarded.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Scrolling </b></h3>
<p><span>Users can accidentally increase or decrease the number using the scroll wheel on the mouse or the scroll gesture on their trackpad. This feature can be useful when collecting countable data but bad if entering data such as passport numbers.</span></p>
<h2><b>The solution</b></h2>
<p><span>Using <code>&lt;input type=&#34;text&#34; inputmode=&#34;numeric&#34; pattern=&#34;[0-9]*&#34;&gt;</code> allows for a degree of separation between how the user enters data (“input mode”), what the browser expects the user input to contain (type equals number), and potentially how it tries to validate it. </span></p>
<p><span>Prior to 2019 there wasn’t enough browser support, especially on mobile devices, for us to feel confident in rolling this out instead of using <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code>. However the <code>inputmode</code> attribute is now supported by all the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices#browsers-to-test-in">mobile browsers we test in</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>We still include the <code>pattern</code> attribute for </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html"><span>backwards compatibility with older iOS devices</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>We’ve now updated the </span><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/date-input/"><span>date input component </span></a><span>and the </span><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/bank-details/"><span>rest of the relevant patterns</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve also published some </span><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#numbers"><span>guidance</span></a><span> to help users to understand how to collect numbers in HTML forms.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we’ve proposed a change to the HTML spec guidance to cross reference <code>inputmode</code> when </span><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#when-number-is-not-appropriate"><span>using <code>&lt;input type=&#34;text&#34;&gt;</code> with content that is only numbers</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>You can take a look at the </span><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/backlog/"><span>GOV.UK Design System backlog</span></a><span> to see what else we’re working on.</span></p>

    <p>This seemed well laid out, simple to read and understand (from my non-technical point of view), and quite crucial from an accessibility view point.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s actually really clever. The sole reason I would prefer to use `type=&#34;number&#34;` would be for the number pad on mobile devices. The `inputmode` is super neat.</p>

    <p>I couldn&#39;t not comment, there are so many things factually wrong with this and the decisions made appear to be rash an ill-informed.</p>
<p>1. The provided links reference Dragon 13, that is around 6 years old. Dragon 15 is currently out. A lot has changed since 2014.</p>
<p>2. A credit card is NOT a number it is a string of digits/numerals: &#34;an arithmetical value, expressed by a word, symbol, or figure, representing a particular quantity and used in counting and making calculations and for showing order in a series or for identification.&#34; Credit card numbers / reference numbers are non-quantifiable.</p>
<p>3. This is confusing, sure, but should we not allow numbers greater than 10 because some people may not know how to count that high? Or binary numbers, because people don&#39;t understand it? 1eee10 is a valid number and is roughly 200.85. Furthermore, I tried your suggested version in chrome:</p>
<p>4. Again, an invalid argument because passport numbers are NOT real numbers.</p>
<p>Closing: `inputmode` is actually quite poorly supported, no support from IE or Chrome. I&#39;d also like to know whether or not `inputmode` and `pattern` are provided any support with Dragon/NVDA</p>

    <p>Hi Brandon,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment.</p>
<p>1. We’ve also replicated the problem in Dragon 15: see <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/reported-bugs/issues/34#issuecomment-579210995" rel="nofollow ugc">comment further down that page</a>.</p>
<p>2. The point made in the blog post is that teams implementing forms might not be clear on differences between types of numeric data to the level of detail that you quote, unless they read the note in the HTML specification that advises against using `&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;` for non-incrementable numbers and possibly do some of their own investigation. Since the HTML input types contain no other obvious candidate for collecting credit card numbers it would not be unreasonable to choose `&lt;input type=“number”&gt;`, especially as it conveniently brings up the large buttoned number keypad on mobile devices.</p>
<p>4. Same as 2. Teams creating forms might not be aware of the HTML specification and choose to use `&lt;input type=“number”&gt;` as out the HTML input types it seems the most suitable.</p>
<p>`inputmode` is supported on all the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices#browsers-to-test-in" rel="nofollow ugc">mobile browsers we test in</a> which means that we can display the large buttoned number keypad for users. `inputmode` is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=inputmode" rel="nofollow ugc">supported by Chrome</a>. IE doesn’t have a mobile browser.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <p>This is fantastic. I&#39;ll have to get it implemented at my startup</p>

    <p>Additionally, when entering some &#34;numbers&#34; such as credit card information you may want to allow the user to add a space i.e. 4544 4444 4444... This doesn&#39;t work with type=number</p>

    <p>Hi Salomao,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment.</p>
<p>`inputmode` brings up the large buttoned number keypad for users on mobile. All the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices#browsers-to-test-in)" rel="nofollow ugc">mobile browsers that we test in</a> now <a href="http://(https://caniuse.com/#search=inputmode" rel="nofollow ugc">support `inputmode`</a>: that’s Safari and Chrome on iOS, and Chrome and Samsung Internet on Android.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <p>&#34;Until now, the GOV.UK Design System date input component used the HTML element &lt;input type=”number”&gt; to provide this number keypad when a user enters dates.&#34;</p>
<p>Why use input type &#39;number&#39; or &#39;text&#39; when a specific date type exists? That informs the browser the exact intent of the field so it can provide a matching user interface.</p>
<p>By using number of text that intent is missing and developers have to add extra labels, upper/lower limts or regexes as described.</p>

    <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment.</p>
<p>There are a number of accessibility and usability problems with the way browsers implement `&lt;input type&#34;date&#34;&gt;`. This article is an interesting read on the topic: <a href="https://www.hassellinclusion.com/blog/input-type-date-ready-for-use/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.hassellinclusion.com/blog/input-type-date-ready-for-use/</a></p>

    <p>I would add that browsers handle and parse decimal separators (, or .) differently  depending on user&#39;s language settings.</p>

    <p>This was a really interesting read. We use gov.uk design advice extensively in our UX team.</p>
<p>We&#39;re a blue chip financial company with public facing apps that often require high value currency inputs. Say we ask a user to enter the value of their house, they may enter &#34;300000&#34; &#34;300,000&#34; &#34;300,000.00&#34; &#34;300.000,00&#34;(German et al) the list goes on. </p>
<p>It&#39;s hotly debated if we should use the number input. The main arguments for is the keypad on mobile and that it helps users with screen readers.</p>
<p>Is there any official advice on currency number inputs? It&#39;s a little surprising there isn&#39;t a dedicated component for this in the gov.uk design system.</p>

    <p>Is it possible to use a opacity=0.0 number input to trigger the keypad, but have each digit/symbol entered pass through to a handler that processes the result and places it in a text box?</p>

    <p>You have to ask yourself if the government is focusing on the wrong areas?</p>
<p>Now I&#39;d rather see government money put towards the creation and maintenance of essential technology&#39;s, rather than making services better for the less than 1%. Who most likely have £1000&#39;s worth of aids such as; people, glasses, hearing aids, voice input etc etc.</p>
<p>My point is, the less than  1% have several alternatives, already catered for by the government. The huge portion  of over 40&#39;s that are now super frustrated with or not even getting repeat prescriptions is a much larger issue. Which could be solved by the same people who are essentially hacking together a super small improvement for screen readers; which will most likely only stay relevant for 1 or 2 years.</p>

    <p>Check the article again. The implications of the issues with input number type are fairly wide-reaching when it concerns numerical accuracy, not just screen readers. This article is like pointing out an issue with a certain engine component and your response is like asking the same team to fix a car.</p>

    <p>There is another reason not to use type=“number”, and that is, unless the number is regarded as valid by the browser then change/input events won’t send out the actual value that the user input. They will instead send out a blank string. This means you cannot run a custom validation library on the user input, and so you are at risk of losing users’ input data because you can’t capture what they have typed.</p>

    <p>Fantastic to finally see Android support this pattern. To get around this in the past we  had to use the &#39;tel&#39; input type to ensure a numeric keypad was displayed on Chrome web browses.</p>
