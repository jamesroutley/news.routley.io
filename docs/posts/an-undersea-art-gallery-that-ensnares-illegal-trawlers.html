    <h1>An undersea art gallery that ensnares illegal trawlers</h1>

It’s unlikely to catch fire and release large quantities of carbon back into the atmosphere at once, for example. But it is vulnerable to other threats. Increased coastal erosion can muddy the waters, making it more difficult for <em>Posidonia</em> to photosynthesize. Cruise ships dropping anchor can cause untold damage. And, of course, bottom-trawlers can ravage thousand-year-old meadows in a matter of minutes. </p><p>On occasion in the 1990s, he said, he took it on himself to police the waters off Talamone. “The coastguard always used to use a big light on their boats, so what did I do? I put one on my boat,” he chuckles. “Think about it, three in the morning, you’re fishing illegally, you see a light coming towards you, what would you do? You&#39;d run away.” And they did, he says, but they’d always come back—until he started sinking his statues. Casa dei Pesci has now placed enough anti-trawling obstacles to reach from Porto Santo Stefano to the Ombrone River—a distance of some 20 nautical miles, or 37 km—meaning that some 137 km<sup>2</sup> of <em>Posidonia</em> meadow and fish habitat are now protected. “It’s small,” says Fanciulli. But it’s still remarkable given the lack of any official backing or funds. </p><p>Although ably assisted by his wife in the kitchen, his daughter at the tables, and a couple of friends, Fanciulli still seems to be doing everything—flipping the fish, pouring the wine, and chatting with his guests about his next initiative: a home for octopuses, made up of a gallery of hand-painted amphora—narrow Roman jars with handles and pointed bottoms. The only time he stops is to give his presentation, showing photos of broken <em>Posidonia</em> stems and the havoc wreaked by bottom trawlers. Seated at long tables, his guests are listening rapt as he tells them: “If you want to eat well, you have to defend the environment. It’s like a war.” </p><hr/><p>Reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 will require innovative solutions at a global scale.
