						<h2>Fully documented source code for Elite on the BBC Micro</h2>

						<p><a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/compare/versions_of_elite.html"><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/general/Elite-BBCMicro.png" alt="BBC Micro Elite screenshot"/><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/general/Elite-BBCMicro.png" alt="BBC Micro Elite screenshot"/><img src="https://payments.posthaven.com/images/general/Elite-Tube.png" alt="BBC Micro 6502 Second Processor Elite screenshot"/></a></p><p>This site contains the original source code for the classic space game Elite on the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained.</p>

						<p>It covers the original <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/cassette/">BBC Micro cassette</a> version, the enhanced <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/disc/">BBC Micro disc</a> version, the super-fast <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/6502sp/">6502 Second Processor</a> version, the flicker-free <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/master/">BBC Master</a> version and the cut-down <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/electron/">Acorn Electron</a> version, all of which were written by Ian Bell and David Braben and published by Acornsoft. It also includes <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/elite-a/">Elite-A</a>, Angus Duggan&#39;s extended version of the original game.</p>

						<p>My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about Elite and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate one of the most iconic games of the 8-bit era.</p>

						<p>Note that the original source code was never released for the BBC Micro disc, BBC Master or Acorn Electron versions, so some of the source code for these versions has been reconstructed from disassembling the original game binaries.</p>

						<h2>If you want to play with the code</h2>

						<p>If you are interested in building a working copy of Elite from the source, then there are six accompanying GitHub repositories, each of which contains fully commented and buildable source code for a specific version of Elite:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/cassette-elite-beebasm">BBC Micro cassette version</a></li>

							<li><a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/disc-elite-beebasm">BBC Micro disc version</a></li>

							<li><a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/6502sp-elite-beebasm">6502 Second Processor version</a></li>

							<li><a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/master-elite-beebasm">BBC Master version</a></li>

							<li><a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/electron-elite-beebasm">Acorn Electron version</a></li>

							<li><a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-a-beebasm">Elite-A</a></li>
						</ul>
            
						<p>These repositories can be <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/about_site/building_elite.html">assembled on modern computers</a> to produce working game discs that can be loaded into a BBC Micro, an Acorn Electron or an emulator. If you want to experiment with the code, this is the place to go.</p>

						<p>Right on, Commanders!</p>
