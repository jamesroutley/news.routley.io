<p>It’s not every day a video codec wins an Emmy. But yesterday, the Television Academy honored the <a href="https://aomedia.org/specifications/av1/">AV1 specification</a> with a <a href="https://theemmys.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Winner_Nominees-76th-Tech-and-Engineering-Emmy.pdf">Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award</a>, recognizing its impact on how the world delivers video content.</p>

<h2>The web needed a new video codec</h2>



<p>Through the mid-2010s, video codecs were an <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/royalty-free-web-video-codecs/">invisible tax on the web</a>, built on a closed licensing system with expensive, unpredictable fees. Most videos online relied on the H.264 codec, which open-source projects like Firefox could only support without paying MPEG LA license fees thanks to Cisco’s <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/video-interoperability-on-the-web-gets-a-boost-from-ciscos-h-264-codec/">open-source OpenH.264 module</a>.</p>



<p>Especially as demand for video grew, the web needed a next-generation codec to make high-quality streaming faster and more reliable. H.265 promised efficiency gains, but there was no guarantee of another OpenH.264-style arrangement. The risk was another fragmented ecosystem where browsers like Firefox couldn’t play large portions of the web’s video.</p>



<h2>Enter AV1</h2>



<p>To solve this, Mozilla joined other technical leaders to form the <a href="https://aomedia.org/">Alliance for Open Media</a> (AOM) in 2015 and started ambitious work on a next-generation codec built from Google’s VP9, Mozilla’s Daala, and Cisco’s Thor.</p>



<p>The result was AV1, released in 2018, which delivered top-tier compression as an open standard under a royalty-free patent policy. It’s now widely deployed across the streaming ecosystem, including hardware decoders and optimized software decoders which allow open-source browsers like Firefox to <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/firefox-brings-you-smooth-video-playback-with-the-worlds-fastest-av1-decoder/">provide</a> state of the art video compression to all users across the web.</p>



<p>AV1 is also the foundation for the image format <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#avif_image">AVIF</a>, which is <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=avif">deployed</a> across browsers and provides excellent compression for still and animated images (AVIF is based on a video codec, after all).</p>



<p>The Emmy award reflects the value of open standards, open-source software, and the sustained work by AOM participants and the broader community fighting for an open web.</p>



<h2>Looking ahead to AV2</h2>



<p>AV1 fixed a structural problem in the ecosystem at the time, but the work isn’t finished. Video demand keeps rising, and the next generation of open codecs must remain competitive.</p>



<p>AOMedia is working on the upcoming release of <a href="https://aomedia.org/press%20releases/AOMedia-Announces-Year-End-Launch-of-Next-Generation-Video-Codec-AV2-on-10th-Anniversary/">AV2</a>. It will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUMwMe_2Dqo&amp;t=751s&amp;themeRefresh=1">feature</a> meaningfully better compression than AV1, much higher efficiency for screen/graphical content, alpha channel support, and more.</p>



<p>As AV2 arrives, our goal remains unchanged: make video on the web open, efficient, and accessible to everyone.</p>
