<p>Starting this month, parking lots in South Korea with more than 80 spaces will be <em>required</em> to install solar canopies and carports. But, unlike similar laws that have been proposed in the US, this new law doesn’t just apply to new construction – existing lots will have to comply as well!</p>



<p>South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced in August that it has prepared an amendment to the Enforcement Decree of the Act on the Promotion of the Development, Use, and Diffusion of New and Renewable Energy to the effect that all publicly- and privately-owned parking lots in the Asian country with room for more than 80 vehicles will be compelled to add solar panels to their lots in a move designed to proactively expand renewable energy and create more solar and construction jobs.</p>



<p>In addition to creating jobs and working to stabilize the local grid with more renewable energy, the proposed solar canopies will offer a number of practical, day-to-day benefits for Korean drivers, as well.</p>



<p>The shaded structures will protect vehicles from heavy rain, snow, and the blistering summer sun — keeping interiors cooler, extending the life of plastics and upholstery, and even helping to preserve battery range in EVs and PHEVs by reducing their AC loads (and, of course, provide charging while the cars are parked).</p>	
	



<p>To their credit, Ministry officials absolutely get it. “Through this mandatory installation,” one unnamed official told <em><a href="https://cm.asiae.co.kr/en/article/2025081311085933266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asia Business Daily</a></em>, “we expect to expand the distribution of eco-friendly renewable energy generation facilities while providing tangible benefits to the public. By utilizing idle land such as parking lots, we can maximize land use efficiency. In addition, installing canopy-type solar panels can provide shade underneath, offering noticeable comfort to people using parking lots during hot weather.”</p>



<p>The new rule was approved in late September, <a href="https://cm.asiae.co.kr/en/article/2025100108130055075#:~:text=The%20Industrial%20Economy,amended%20in%20May." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is expected to go into effect later this month</a>, with new installation projects set to begin immediately.</p>

<p>South Korea is proving that an idea like is practical. Here in the US, we’re proving that out, too – the Northwest Fire District in Arizona partnered with <a href="https://standardsolar.com/project/northwest-fire-district/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Standard Solar</a> to build a conceptually similar, 657 kW solar carport system across 12 parking lots (shown, above) that delivers more than 1.23 <em>million</em> kWh of clean, emissions-free power annually and offsets the equivalent of 185,000 vehicles’ worth of harmful carbon emissions.</p>



<p>That’s just Arizona. <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/08/new-york-city-opens-8500-acres-parking-lots-to-solar-canopies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">In New York</a>, a new initiative to help expand solar into parking lots has more than doubled commercially zoned land where EV charging stations can be sited, “freeing up” an additional 400 million square feet of space throughout the city. </p>



<p>Sun-rich states like <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/24/texas-power-demand-surges-solar-wind-and-storage-carry-the-load/">Texas</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/16/nacfe-study-electric-semi-trucks-can-go-the-distance-today/">New Mexico</a>, and <a href="https://floridaman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a> could also benefit, and even if we’re “just” adding fresh energy sources to municipal parking, dealer lots, and public schools, we could do a lot to reduce the cost of energy generation for the entire community. And, for what it’s worth, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/19/survey-sunday-we-asked-why-you-chose-home-solar-you-answered/">that seems to be right in line with the big reasons why people are choosing to add solar to their homes today</a>.</p>




	<p>What do you guys think – would something like this work in the US, or are we too far gone down the sophomoric, pseudo-libertarian rabbit hole to ever dig our way out? Let us know your take in the comments.</p>
