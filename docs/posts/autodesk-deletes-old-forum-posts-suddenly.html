						<p>Not sure what will happen, but if the discussions in this forum started older than 10 years were to be no longer available, it would be really bad. If that really happens, I&#39;d suggest those who post/learn frequently in this forum move to other alternatives, such as <a href="https://www.theswamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">https://www.theswamp.org/</a>  and stop responding questions here, knowing your efforts will be gone/thrown away!</p>

<p>They should have something equivalent or better available and is embraced by users before cutting existing useful stuff off.  </p>

						<p>It’s insanity! At least from a developer perspective. There are still code samples from 2005 that are still very relevant today.

						<p>I&#39;ve already switched to posting code on GitHub instead of/in addition to posting it here, for that and other reasons I&#39;d rather not discuss here.</p><p>The thing that has me scratching my head, is the criteria that any thread started 10+ years ago is to be <strike>archived</strike> deleted, regardless of how recently it was updated or how relevant its contents are.</p><p>The suggestion that &#39;the team&#39; is going to go through that much old content and identify what&#39;s worth keeping is pure fiction, as if we couldn&#39;t figure out how much work by qualified people would be needed to do that.</p><p>It would seem to appear that legacy products (namedly AutoCAD) is what&#39;s being targeted, as there&#39;s not very much 10-year-old content for products/services being pushed/promoted today.</p><p>The problem is that much of what Autodesk would like you to replace its legacy products with, is already on the verge of becoming obsolete itself.</p><p>It&#39;s not just Autodesk whose very existence is threatened by the rise of AI and AGI. Most vendors of &#39;traditional&#39; software applications are being regarded as endangered species. For Autodesk and its competitors, the emergence of things like DeepMind&#39;s <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Genie2</a> and <a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">WorldLabs&#39; Spatial Intelligence</a> initiative (both of which are being positioned as foundations for end-to-end solutions for all types of design, as well as other things like gaming), will make application software and services as we know them today, totally obsolete.</p>
