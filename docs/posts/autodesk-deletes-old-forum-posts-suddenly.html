						<p>I&#39;ve already switched to posting code on GitHub instead of/in addition to posting it here, for that and other reasons I&#39;d rather not discuss here.</p><p>The thing that has me scratching my head, is the criteria that any thread started 10+ years ago is to be <strike>archived</strike> deleted, regardless of how recently it was updated or how relevant its contents are.</p><p>The suggestion that &#39;the team&#39; is going to go through that much old content and identify what&#39;s worth keeping is pure fiction, as if we couldn&#39;t figure out how much work by qualified people would be needed to do that.</p><p>It would seem to appear that legacy products (namedly AutoCAD) is what&#39;s being targeted, as there&#39;s not very much 10-year-old content for products/services being pushed/promoted today.</p><p>The problem is that much of what Autodesk would like you to replace its legacy products with, is already on the verge of becoming obsolete itself.</p><p>It&#39;s not just Autodesk whose very existence is threatened by the rise of AI and AGI. Most vendors of &#39;traditional&#39; software applications are being regarded as endangered species. For Autodesk and its competitors, the emergence of things like DeepMind&#39;s <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Genie2</a> and <a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">WorldLabs&#39; Spatial Intelligence</a> initiative (both of which are being positioned as foundations for end-to-end solutions for all types of design, as well as other things like gaming), will make application software and services as we know them today, totally obsolete.</p>
