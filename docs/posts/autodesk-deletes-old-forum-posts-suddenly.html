<p>I had fun writing <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2024/01/02/2023-in-review.html">2023, in review</a> and want to keep the trend going for 2024. Most of this year was defined by what felt like continuing to settle in and develop within my new life in Munich. Towards the end of the year circumstances changed and I found myself engulfed in figuring out a hard eject from Munich back to New York. I don’t want to dive into details publicly, but to be clear: everything is okay and the change was for more benign reasons than it may sound.</p>

<p>Anyways, through reading diary entries, photos, Zettelkasten entries and other artifacts I managed to assemble some notable elements from the year that I felt are worth sharing.</p>

<p><strong>New heights for bike touring.</strong> During the warmer months some friends and I made a habit out of going on longer bike rides through Bavaria on the weekends. This culminated in my longest bike trip to date: an overnight ride from Munich to Salzburg (~160km or ~100mi).</p>

<p>Some form of long-distance bike tour has been on my bucket list for years, but it was always more intimidating to do when I lived in NYC due to the bad regional biking infrastructure. It was also an easy thing to deprioritize compared to all of the other wacky things I’d get involved with around the city. It didn’t hurt that almost everything is closed on Sundays and holidays in Bavaria, making a long bike ride a more obvious activity to reach for.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to bring my newfound affinity for bike touring back home with me. I have a long-term goal of biking from Syracuse to NYC along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Trail">Empire Trail</a>.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>I see living abroad in a new light.</strong> For years after my time studying in Spain I romanticized the idea of living in Europe. Everything seemed so obviously better across the pond than what, at the time, I perceived as the US in decline. After spending a couple of years living in Germany I feel like my previous perspective was both overlooking the advantages of living in the US and largely blinded to the things I valued most in life.</p>

<p>On the first: I don’t want to dive into complaining about Munich- it’s a pleasant city that treated me very well. Rather, I want to focus on my realization that the cultural and ethnic diversity of New York is incredibly special. There are <em>very</em> few cities that can rival NYC in terms of concentrating such a large variety of the world’s offerings into one geographic region. I knew this to be true before leaving, but it took living in a place where this wasn’t the case for me to realize how much I cherished living somewhere that was not just accepting of its foreign-born population, but proud of it.</p>

<p>As for what I value in life, perhaps this is obvious to most but I learned that being close to my friends, family, and communities outweighed the benefits of living in a place with a higher quality of life. Germany had so many of the things I thought I valued: great trains<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, ample paid time off, bike lanes aplenty, good health insurance, low crime, easy access to nature, seemingly infinite destinations to explore, etc. Even with all of these positives, I found it difficult to enjoy them knowing that my loved ones were an ocean away. The friends I made in Munich were wonderful and I will miss them dearly, but the necessity of moving on from my family and lifelong friends back home was a pill I was never able to swallow fully.</p>

<p>I have <em>so much more</em> to say on this topic- far too much to fit in a year-wrapped blog post. Eventually I’ll share more, but for now I feel I need more temporal distance to flesh out coherent opinions.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Moving back to New York.</strong> I’m typing this from Puebla, Mexico; here visiting family for the holidays before heading back to New York to start my old-new life again. I really don’t know what this year has in store for me- especially given the impending changes in the political and economic environment of the US/New York.</p>

<p>My gut says instability and chaos is nigh, and as such this is a better time than any to focus on my smaller surroundings rather than constantly getting worked up by world events. Finding ways to de-stress, rebuilding community back in New York, making up for lost time with family/friends, and improving my cooking/baking skills are all on the list. It’s a much tamer set of goals than I’ve set for myself in the past. This comes from a realization that the last decade of my life has been incredibly hectic, largely for self-inflicted causes rather than external ones. Maybe I’m finally getting the pangs of wanting to “settle down” after spending my 20s bouncing around between what feel like entirely different lives.</p>

<p>I’m just tired. Not irreconcilably so, and certainly not to the point where I’ve given up on some of my more strongly held hills-to-die-on<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I’m just recognizing that it’s probably time for the “be everywhere doing everything all the time” life to evolve into something new. 2025 will be a year of figuring out what this something new should look like.</p>

	Homemade bagels!
</p>

<p>I capped off the year by baking my first good batch of bagels. I originally attempted baking bagels as a means of bringing something I felt was a grounding piece of my culture along with me to Germany. Now that I’m moving home I guess I’m just baking them because I enjoy it.</p>
