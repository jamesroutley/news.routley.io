    <h1>The missteps that led to a fatal plane crash at Reagan National Airport</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>As they flew south along the Potomac River on the gusty night of Jan. 29, the crew aboard an Army Black Hawk helicopter attempted to execute a common aviation practice. It would play a role in ending their lives.</p><p>Shortly after the Black Hawk passed over Washington’s most famous array of cherry trees, an air traffic controller at nearby Ronald Reagan National Airport alerted the crew to a regional passenger jet in its vicinity. The crew acknowledged seeing traffic nearby.</p><p>One of the pilots then asked for permission to employ a practice called “visual separation.” That allows a pilot to take control of navigating around other aircraft, rather than relying on the controller for guidance.</p><p>“Visual separation approved,” the controller replied.</p><p>The request to fly under those rules is granted routinely in airspace overseen by controllers. Most of the time, visual separation is executed without note. But when mishandled, it can also create a deadly risk — one that aviation experts have warned about for years.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>On Jan. 29, the Black Hawk crew did not execute visual separation effectively. The pilots either did not detect the specific passenger jet the controller had flagged, or could not pivot to a safer position. Instead, one second before 8:48 p.m., the helicopter slammed into American Airlines Flight 5342, which was carrying 64 people to Washington from Wichita, Kan., killing everyone aboard both aircraft in a fiery explosion that lit the night sky over the river.</p><p>One error did not cause the worst domestic crash in the United States in nearly a quarter-century. Modern aviation is designed to have redundancies and safeguards that prevent a misstep, or even several missteps, from being catastrophic. On Jan. 29, that system collapsed.</p><p>“Multiple layers of safety precautions failed that night,” said Katie Thomson, the Federal Aviation Administration’s deputy administrator under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/dc-crash-40010-gzwf/dc-crash-40010-gzwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/dc-crash-40010-gzwf/dc-crash-40010-gzwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/dc-crash-40010-gzwf/dc-crash-40010-gzwf-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Police and firefighters saluting near a crash site." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/dc-crash-40010-gzwf/dc-crash-40010-gzwf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/dc-crash-40010-gzwf/dc-crash-40010-gzwf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/dc-crash-40010-gzwf/dc-crash-40010-gzwf-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/11/multimedia/dc-crash-40010-gzwf/dc-crash-40010-gzwf-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/c570b7c3-a20c-5325-bc7d-ffb2d6f1b432" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>On Jan. 29, a Black Hawk helicopter collided with American Airlines Flight 5342, which was carrying 64 people to Washington from Wichita, Kan., killing everyone aboard both aircraft.

Yet he did not issue clear, urgent instructions to the Black Hawk to avert the crash, aviation experts say.</p><p>These lapses happened against the backdrop of systemic deficiencies in U.S. aviation. The F.A.A. has struggled for years with low staffing among controllers, and the National Airport tower <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/air-traffic-control-staffing-plane-crash.html" title="">has been no exception</a>. At the time of the crash, for reasons that remain murky, a single controller was working both helicopter traffic and commercial runway traffic — jobs that would typically be done by two controllers.</p><p>The F.A.A. said in a statement that it could not discuss “any aspect” of a continuing investigation led by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, the Army’s director of aviation, said, “I think what we’ll find in the end is there were multiple things that, had any one of them changed, it could have well changed the outcome of that evening<em>.”</em> He, too, deferred detailed questions about the investigation to the N.T.S.B., adding that the Army was conducting its own reviews of the accident.</p><p>Investigators from the N.T.S.B. will issue their final report on the causes of the crash by early 2026.</p><p>In the meantime, data recently analyzed by the board revealed that National Airport was the site of at least one near collision between an airplane and a helicopter each month from 2011 to 2024. Two-thirds of the incidents occurred at night, and more than half may have involved helicopters flying above their maximum designated altitude.</p><p>Given those findings, the F.A.A. recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/dc-plane-crash-ntsb-helicopters.html" title="">banned most helicopter flights</a> along a portion of the route the Black Hawk used.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>And, critically, the F.A.A. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statement-ntsb-recommendations-dca" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has also vastly limited the use of visual separation</a>.</p><p>The maneuver is primarily used by pilots flying helicopters and smaller aircraft, and is used less frequently for commercial jets. When using visual separation, pilots take responsibility for noticing and steering clear of neighboring air traffic if certain conditions, like good visibility, are met. It has long been viewed in the industry as essential to keeping traffic moving.</p><p>But the occasional difficulty for pilots to see and avoid nearby air traffic has also been implicated in at least 40 fatal collisions since 2010, according to the N.T.S.B. It has led to stern safety warnings to pilots from both the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/atb_may_2020.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.A.A.</a> and the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Advocacy/safety-alerts/Documents/SA-058.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">N.T.S.B.</a></p><p>Human error, blind spots not evident from a cockpit and environmental conditions “leave even the most diligent pilot vulnerable to the threat of a midair collision with an unseen aircraft” under this maneuver, the N.T.S.B. wrote in a <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Advocacy/safety-alerts/Documents/SA-058.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">safety bulletin</a> published in 2016.</p><p>The practice of allowing pilots to navigate around traffic on their own “has long been seen as a flawed concept but a necessary one,” said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for both the F.A.A. and the N.T.S.B. “But it has been linked to a number of deadly midair incidents throughout the years.”</p><h2 id="link-32890380">Two Departures, Six Minutes Apart</h2></div></div><div data-testid="VideoBlock-18"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/us/politics/time-lapse-crop-still/time-lapse-crop-still-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" data-testid="cinemagraph_image"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" poster="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/17/us/politics/time-lapse-crop-still/time-lapse-crop-still-verticalTwoByThree735.jpg" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2025/04/10/137496_1_dc-crash-video2_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div></div><figcaption><span data-testid="video-summary">National Airport is one of 57 airports in the United States that has a special-qualification designation from the Federal Aviation Administration, according to an agency document reviewed by The Times.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Kenny Holston/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>At 6:39 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, a CRJ700 regional jet departed Wichita under cool, dry conditions with 60 passengers, two pilots and two flight attendants on board.

A little after 8:30 p.m., an Army helicopter, known in the tower as a “P.A.T.” for priority air transport, made contact with him. </p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-15"><div><p>The controller had worked for the F.A.A. for about a decade in two smaller air-traffic control centers, but had been stationed at National Airport for about two years, according to government employee filings. The controller, whom The Times is not identifying because his name has not been publicly revealed as part of the investigation, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Like his colleagues in the tower, he typically worked one control duty at a time, such as directing just helicopters, or only handling airplanes on taxiways. He worked about seven hours that day, according to a government document reviewed by The Times. The F.A.A. says all controllers get required breaks.</p><p>But after a co-worker left the control hub at 3:40 p.m., some controllers began to assume combined duties. The controller who ended up directing the Black Hawk took over combined duties at roughly 7 p.m., according to the government document. An N.T.S.B. spokesman declined to confirm how long the controller operated in both roles.</p><p>Such a combination was not unusual, and was approved that evening by a tower supervisor, according to a person briefed on the staffing. But the roles were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/plane-crash-washington-dc" title="">not typically combined until traffic slowed</a> many hours later, around 9:30 p.m.</p><p>Though the reasons why the supervisor combined the duties so early are still not clear, the F.A.A. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/air-traffic-control-staffing-plane-crash.html" title="">would later say in an internal report</a> that staffing was “not normal” that evening.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-16"><div><p>By the time both the Army Black Hawk and Flight 5342 were in radio contact with the controller — starting about 8:43 p.m. — five controllers were working different duties in the control hub of the tower. </p><p>In addition to doing two jobs at once, the controller faced another complicating factor that night: He could not watch the helicopter’s movements in real time.</p><p>Doing so would have required the use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/business/washington-crash-tcas.html" title="">an aviation broadcasting system called Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out</a>, or ADS-B Out, which reports an aircraft’s position, altitude and speed roughly every second.</p><p>But the Black Hawk did not operate with the technology because of the confidentiality of the mission for which the crew was practicing. That is because ADS-B Out positions can be obtained by anyone with an internet connection, making the system a potential risk to national security.</p><p>As a result, the controller relied on pings from the helicopter’s transponder to show its changing location, which can take between five and 12 seconds to refresh, according to <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/equipadsb/capabilities/benefits#:~:text=Aircraft%20equipped%20with%20ADS%2DB,altitudes%20than%20current%20ATC%20radars." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">F.A.A. documents</a>.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Aviation experts said that during that gap, the aircraft could change course or elevation, making for a concerning level of uncertainty.</p><p>In a busy airspace, that lapse, said Michael McCormick, a former vice president of the F.A.A. Air Traffic Organization, is “a very long time.”</p><p>General Braman said the fact that ADS-B Out was turned off “played no role in this accident” because the transponder meant that the Black Hawk could be seen on the radar and “was never invisible.”</p><p>Some federal lawmakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/crash-army-helicopter-tracking.html" title="">strongly disagreed</a>.

But commercial pilots train for such maneuvers, and having just passed over Mount Vernon in Virginia, about 10 miles from National Airport, they still had time to make the shift.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-19"><div><p>After a beat, one of the pilots replied. “Yeah, we can do, uh, three-three,” he said.</p><p>The pilots began the process of rerouting the flight to the new runway, which intersected Runway 1 at an acute angle in the middle.</p><p>Runway 33 had an additional quirk: a particularly narrow vertical space between the landing slope for a jet and the maximum altitude at which helicopters using a certain route, called Route 4, could fly.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>At its highest, near the Potomac’s east bank, the vertical distance between a helicopter and an aircraft en route to landing on Runway 33 would be 75 feet, N.T.S.B. investigators said.

Warrant Officer Eaves then read out an altitude of 400 feet.</p><p>The exact time that passed between the statements has not been detailed in N.T.S.B. reports, but records suggest that it was no longer than 39 seconds.

A pilot is meant to see neighboring air traffic, often without assistance from the controller, and avoid it by either hovering in place until the traffic passes or by flying around it in prescribed ways.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-26"><div><p>See-and-avoid flying is commonplace in aviation. At many tiny airports, with no controllers, there is no alternative. In busy airspaces, such as parts of National Airport’s, the helicopter’s altitude limits are too low for controllers to easily assist it in maneuvering around obstacles such as ships or tall buildings, while also keeping it clear of air traffic.</p><p>The F.A.A. said in its statement that “pilots are responsible for keeping themselves safely separated from other aircraft.”</p><p>Nonetheless, even when a helicopter is operating under see-and-avoid rules, if the controller notices it is converging into another aircraft’s path, he or she should — under F.A.A. rules — call out the existence of the nearby traffic and ask the helicopter to affirm that it has the aircraft in sight.</p><p>At that point, the helicopter crew should acknowledge that it sees the traffic and can request visual separation — asking permission to stay clear of the nearby aircraft — which the controller can grant or refuse. Or, if the crew says that it does not see the traffic, the controller will likely direct the helicopter to a safer position.</p><p>One benefit of the see-and-avoid system is that it can lighten the controller’s workload during busy periods. But see and avoid has proved problematic, even fatal, in recent decades.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-27"><div><p>In 2019, two airplanes collided above Ketchikan, Alaska, killing six people and injuring 10 others. Three years later, two helicopters collided above San Diego, but there were no casualties. The N.T.S.B. cited failed see-and-avoid efforts in both cases.</p><p>One risk is that the pilots will miscalculate which way the other aircraft is moving; another is identifying the wrong aircraft.</p><p>John Goglia, a former N.T.S.B. board member, put it plainly: See and avoid assumes that every pilot has sharp vision and can pick out the right aircraft in the direction they have been told to look. But instructions are not always clear, he said. And tools like night-vision goggles can sometimes cloud vision more than clarify it.</p><p>Put two planes in roughly the same patch of sky, and even the most attentive pilot might track the wrong one, Mr. Goglia said.</p><p>During a recent press briefing on the crash, Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, criticized the practice of allowing helicopters to use visual separation in confined airspaces like the one near National Airport.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-28"><div><p>“Having helicopters fly under landing aircraft, and allowing helicopter pilots to say, ‘I’ll maintain visual separation’ — that is not going to happen anymore,” he said. “That is too risky.

At 8:46:48 p.m. the tower cleared a jet for immediate departure off Runway 1.</p><p>Then, the Black Hawk, still southbound, passed Hains Point, a park area along the east side of the Potomac, moving it closer to the airport on the opposite bank.</p><p>At the same time, Flight 5342 began a leftward turn toward Runway 33.
