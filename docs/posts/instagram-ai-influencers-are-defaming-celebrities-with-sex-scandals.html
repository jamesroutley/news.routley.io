<p>AI generated influencers are sharing fake images on Instagram that appear to show them having sex with celebrities like LeBron James, iShowSpeed, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. One AI influencer even shared an image of her in bed with Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro. The images are AI generated but are not disclosed as such, and funnel users to an adult content site where the AI generated influencers sell nude images. </p><p>This recent trend is the latest strategy from the growing business of monetizing AI generated porn by harvesting attention on Instagram with shocking or salacious content. As with previous schemes we’ve covered, the Instagram posts that pretend to show attractive young women in bed with celebrities are created without the celebrities’ consent and are not disclosed as being AI generated, violating two of Instagram’s policies and showing once again that Meta is unable or unwilling to reign in AI generated content on its platform. </p><p>Most of the Reels in this genre that I have seen follow a highly specific formula and started to appear around December 2025. First, we see a still image of an AI-generated influencer next to a celebrity, often in the form of a selfie with both of them looking at the camera. The text on the screen says “How it started.” Then, the video briefly cuts to another still image or videos of the AI generated influencer and the celebrity post coitus, sweaty, with tussled hair and sometimes smeared makeup. Many of these posts use the same handful of audio clips. Since Instagram allows users to browse Reels that use the same audio, clicking on one of these will reveal dozens of examples of similar Reels. </p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTDODMdiC1d/?ref=404media.co"><u>LeBron James</u></a> and adult film star <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS51AdUElNm/?ref=404media.co"><u>Johnny Sins</u></a> are frequent targets of these posts, but I’ve also seen similar Reels with the likeness of Twitch streamer iShowSpeed, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, MMA fighters Jon Jones and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTLOnUukU-6/?ref=404media.co"><u>Connor McGregor</u></a>, soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, and many others, far too many to name them all. The AI influencer accounts obviously don’t care whether it&#39;s believable that these fake women are actually sleeping with celebrities and will include any known person who is likely to earn engagement. Amazingly, one AI influencer applied the same formula to Venezuela’s president Maduro shortly after he was captured by the United States. </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/01/data-src-image-c6a4bd72-a4a8-4960-bdf6-da57238154b5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="463" height="850"/></figure><p>These Instagram Reels frequently have hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of views. A post from one of these AI influencers that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTUCOjYCjwW/?ref=404media.co"><u>shows her in bed with Jon Jones</u></a> has has 7.7 million views. A video showing another AI influencer in a bed with iShowSpeed has 14.5 million views. </p><p>Users who stumble upon one of these videos might be inclined to click on the AI-influencer&#39;s username to check her bio and see if she has an OnlyFans account, as is the case with many adult content creators who promote their work on Instagram. What these users will find is an account bio that doesn’t disclose its AI generated, and a link to Fanvue, an OnlyFans competitor with more permissive policies around AI generated content. On Fanvue, these accounts do disclose that they are “AI-generated or enhanced,” and sell access to nude images and videos. </p><p>Meta did not respond to a request for comment, but removed some of the Reels I flagged. </p><p>Posting provocative AI generated media in order to funnel eyeballs to adult content platforms where AI generated porn can be monetized is now an established business. Sometimes, these AI influencers <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-booming-ai-pimping-industry-3/"><u>steal directly from real adult content creators</u></a> by faceswapping themselves into their existing videos. Once in a while a new “meta” strategy for AI influencers will emerge and dominate the algorithm. For example, last year I wrote about people using AI to create <a href="https://www.404media.co/people-are-using-ai-to-create-influencers-with-down-syndrome-who-sell-nudes/"><u>influencers with down syndrome who sell nudes</u></a>.  </p><p>Some other video formats I’ve seen from AI influencers recently follow the formula I describe in this article, but rather than suggesting the influencer slept with a celebrity, it shows them sleeping with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTVLswbjAvA/?ref=404media.co"><u>entire sports teams</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTU3HCADHic/?ref=404media.co"><u>African tribal chiefs</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTAznwLCOka/?ref=404media.co"><u>Walmart managers</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSwxJGyjEkh/?ref=404media.co"><u>sharing a man with their mom</u></a>.</p><p>Notably, celebrities are better equipped than adult content creators to take on AI accounts that are using their likeness without consent, and last year LeBron James, a frequent target of this latest meta, <a href="https://www.404media.co/lebron-james-lawyers-send-cease-and-desist-to-ai-company-making-pregnant-videos-of-him/"><u>sent a cease-and-desist notice</u></a> to a company that was making AI videos of him and sharing them on Instagram. </p>
