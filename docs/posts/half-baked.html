    <h1>Half Baked</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://seths.blog/2022/05/half-baked/" data-title="Half baked" data-hashtags=""><p>If you care about a creative practice, my guess is that you’ve already seen Peter Jackson’s new Beatles movie. If not, go check it out.</p>



<p>It’s a miracle that the movie exists at all. I mean, four of the most famous creative humans who ever lived, tenuously holding on to a fracturing association, agree to write and record an album in three weeks and <em>record every single interaction on film</em>.</p>



<p>The intimacy of this setting lets us see each of the Beatles as they had decided to become.</p>



<p>Ringo is in the background, happy to be there, supporting the process and causing no trouble.</p>



<p>George is wrestling with his place in the world and his ego. You’ll notice that he rarely plays a song unless he’s sure it’s almost done, and even then, apologizes before sharing it.</p>



<p>John is the fifth hammer. In the first sessions, his creative method is not really on display in the group setting–his song arrives already recorded, on vinyl.</p>



<p>This is a post about Paul.</p>



<p>Paul’s not a genius, neither is John. This isn’t about talent, it’s about skill. And the genius that was the Beatles happens <em>between</em> Paul and John, not inside of either of them.</p>



<p>Paul wants the group to be excited. He wants George to be happier. Most of all, he wants John to like his songs. That’s his fuel.</p>



<p>And Paul’s <a href="https://seths.blog/thepractice">practice</a> is simple: Bring the work forward.</p>



<p>Play a song before it’s ready.</p>



<p>Because in the moment before it’s ready, that’s when it’s ready.</p>



<p>By bringing music that’s half-baked to the table, he takes a risk. It means that George might become critical or mopey. It means that John might not be engaged. It means that the room might not feel it.</p>



<p>But the risk is worth it. Because the half-baked work, shared in a trusting environment, is the fuel for the system that created the works of genius. </p>



<p>Paul needed the movie and the live event in the future to create tension, tension that he knew would be pushing against the group’s need for approval and not-blowing-it. By putting themselves in a corner, he created (at no small cost) the conditions where he could do the work.</p>



<p>And it begins, as it usually does, by having the guts to share something that’s half baked.</p>
