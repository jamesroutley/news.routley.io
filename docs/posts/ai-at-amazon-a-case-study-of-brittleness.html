    <h1>AI at Amazon: A case study of brittleness</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A year ago, Mihail Eric wrote a blog post detailing his experiences working on AI inside Amazon: <a href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/how-alexa-dropped-the-ball-conversational-ai/">How Alexa Dropped the Ball on Being the Top Conversational System on the Planet</a>. It’s a great first-person account, with lots of detail of the issues that kept Amazon from keeping up with its peers in the LLM space. From my perspective, Eric’s post makes a great case study in what resilience engineering researchers refer to as <em>brittleness</em>, which is a term that the researchers use to refer to as a kind of opposite of resilience.</p>



<p>In the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333952644_Basic_Patterns_in_How_Adaptive_Systems_Fail">Basic Patterns in How Adaptive Systems Fail</a>, the researchers David Woods and Matthieu Branlat note that brittle systems tend to suffer from the following three patterns:</p>



<ol>
<li><em>Decompensation</em>: exhausting capacity to adapt as challenges cascade</li>



<li><em>Working at cross-purposes</em>: behavior that is locally adaptive but globally maladaptive</li>



<li><em>Getting stuck in outdated behaviors</em>: the world changes but the system remains stuck in what were previously adaptive strategies (over-relying on past successes)</li>
</ol>



<p>Eric’s post demonstrates how all three of these patterns were evident within Amazon. </p>



<h2>Decompensation</h2>



<blockquote>
<p><em>It would take weeks to get access to any internal data for analysis or experiments</em>… </p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’ve ever seen a service fall over after receiving a spike in external requests, you’ve seen a <em>decompensation</em> system failure. This happens when a system isn’t able to keep up with the demands that are placed upon on it. </p>



<p>In organizations, you can see the decompensation failure pattern emerge when decision-making is very hierarchical: you end up having to wait for the decision request to make its way up to someone who has the authority to make the decision, and then make its way down again. In the meantime, the world isn’t standing still waiting for that decision to be made. </p>



<p>As described in the <strong>Bad Technical Process</strong> section of Eric’s post, Amazon was not able to keep up with the rate at which its competitors were making progress on developing AI technology, even though Amazon had both the talent and the compute resources necessary in order to make progress. The people inside the organization who needed the resources weren’t able to get them in a timely fashion. That slowed down AI development and, consequently, they got lapped by their competitors.</p>



<h2>Working at cross-purposes</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>Alexa’s org structure was decentralized by design meaning there were multiple small teams working on sometimes identical problems across geographic locales. </p>



<p>The consequence was an organization plagued by antagonistic mid-managers that had little interest in collaborating for the greater good of Alexa and only wanted to preserve their own fiefdoms.</p>



<p>My group by design was intended to span projects, whereby we found teams that aligned with our research/product interests and urged them to collaborate on ambitious efforts. The resistance and lack of action we encountered was soul-crushing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Where <em>decompensation</em> is a consequence of poor centralization, <em>working at cross-purposes</em> is a consequence of poor decentralization. In a decentralized organization, the individual units are able to work more quickly, but there’s a risk of <em>alignment</em>: enabling everyone to row faster isn’t going to help if they’re rowing in different directions. </p>



<p>In the <strong>Fragmented Org Structures</strong> section of Eric’s writeup, he goes into vivid, almost painful detail about how Amazon’s decentralized org structure worked against them.</p>



<h2>Getting stuck in outdated behaviors</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>Alexa was viciously customer-focused which I believe is admirable and a principle every company should practice. Within Alexa, this meant that every engineering and science effort had to be aligned to some downstream product.</p>



<p>That did introduce tension for our team because we were supposed to be taking experimental bets for the platform’s future. These bets couldn’t be baked into product without hacks or shortcuts in the typical quarter as was the expectation.</p>



<p>So we had to constantly justify our existence to senior leadership and massage our projects with metrics that could be seen as more customer-facing.</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>This introduced product/science conflict in every weekly meeting to track the project’s progress leading to manager churn every few months and an eventual sunsetting of the effort.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’m generally not a fan of management books, but <a href="https://marshallgoldsmith.com/book-page-what-got-you-here/">What got you here won’t get you there</a> is a pretty good summary of the third failure pattern: when organizations continue to apply approaches that were well-suited to problems in the past but are ill-suited to problems in the present. </p>



<p>In the <strong>Product-Science Misalignment</strong> section of his post, Eric describes how Amazon’s traditional <em>viciously</em> <em>customer-focused</em> approach to development was a poor match for the research-style work that was required for developing AI. Rather than Amazon changing the way they worked in order to facilitate the activities of AI researchers, the researchers had to try to fit themselves into Amazon’s pre-existing product model. Ultimately, that effort failed. </p>



<hr/>



<p>I write mostly about software incidents on this blog, which are <em>high-tempo</em> affairs. But the failure of Amazon to compete effectively in the AI space, despite its head start with Alexa, its internal talent, and its massive set of compute resources, can also be viewed as a kind of incident. As demonstrated in this post, we can observe the same sorts of patterns in failures that occur in the span of months as we can in failures that occur in the span of minutes. How well Amazon is able to learn from this incident remains to be seen. </p>
