    <h1>Becoming the person who does the thing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It can be disorienting when our beliefs shift. The world we helped create no longer exists, and our role in it transforms too.</p>
<p>It can be unsettling, naturally. But that&#39;s kind of the point.</p>
<p>Looking back at times when I held certain beliefs—about how the world works, and what my role in this story is—it can feel less like a mod was installed and more like an entirely new operating system was swapped in.</p>
<p>Up until my late twenties, I could count the number of times I had been to the gym on one hand.</p>
<p>And worse, as a nerd, I was quietly proud of it. Why waste hours a week on something that hardly mattered? I have better things to do. I pitied the jocks who slaved away in the gym chasing vanity. What for? I don&#39;t need that. Who cares?</p>
<p>Like all childish thinking, it contained some truth. Physical fitness is less important than spiritual, emotional, and mental fitness; but it’s still important.</p>
<p>Even Paul, one of history’s most influential figures, with a worldview shaped by the utter centrality of spiritual health, <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1TI.4.8.NIV" target="_blank">said as much</a>.</p>
<p>Your beliefs—and therefore approach to what a healthy life looks like—are foundational. It might sound obvious, but what you believe a &#34;life well lived&#34; looks like has a pretty transformative impact on both what life you end up building and how well lived it looks.</p>
<p>So if we’re a product of our beliefs and our most formative preconceptions are imposed by others, then where’s the hope?</p>
<p>We build, layer upon layer, and the layers laid first—now deeply buried within—are the ones we had the least say in.</p>
<p>We didn&#39;t pick them, but they shape everything we are and do. Bad luck, I guess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we are dynamic beings. Old beliefs can peel off, and new ones take their place. Later layers can somehow seep deeper. Some recent beliefs can even become cornerstones.</p>
<p>For me, something shifted in my late twenties. Growing up I guess you could call it. I don’t remember the exact straw that broke the camel’s back, but a desire for change grew. I started working out.</p>
<p>It began slowly, but I began. Knee press-ups to start, later adding assisted pull-ups.</p>
<p>If anyone was watching, it would have looked stupid. A grown man barely able to push himself off the floor. But I showed up and put in my reps, day by day, week by week, in the privacy of my bedroom.</p>
<p>As the weeks and months passed, my strength grew.</p>
<p>Eventually, I graduated to full press-ups and pull-ups, no mods required.</p>
<p>Every small win reinforced the last and led me further away from who I used to be.</p>
<p>Fast forward almost to a decade and I feel a lot more friction <em>not</em> going to the gym than I do <em>going</em>. Cognitive dissonance is wonderful when it’s on your side, and it pops up whenever my healthy-Fred self-identity and actions diverge.</p>
<p>I&#39;m far from a gym junkie—it hasn&#39;t become my life—but I go every weekday, 20 minutes a day. I arrive, do my workout, and leave, while most people are just getting started.</p>
<p>Our self-identity dictates everything, but it is not set in stone.</p>
<p>Changing our beliefs isn’t easy. Both those about the world around us and the world within. We can&#39;t simply will our way there and snap our fingers. We must journey. As with all great things, it&#39;s a process.</p>
<p>But it is possible. A well-trodden path is ahead for those who wish to walk it.</p>
<p>So how do you? How do you <em>become the person who does the thing</em>?</p>
<p>Earlier this week I spent a couple hours crafting my digital <a href="https://www.fredrivett.com/shelf" target="_blank">/shelf</a>, a place where I can put the things that have impacted me the most up for all to see, so others can take them for themselves should they wish.</p>
<p>On it are these two quotes that have been living rent-free in my head from the beginning. Together, they create a twin-cog flywheel that cannot be stopped:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://seths.blog/2013/07/people-like-us-do-stuff-like-this/" target="_blank">“People like us do things like this”</a>
<cite>Seth Godin</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://jamesclear.com/quotes/every-action-you-take-is-a-vote-for-the-type-of-person-you-wish-to-become" target="_blank">“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become”</a>
<cite>James Clear</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Your actions follow your self-beliefs.</p>
<p>If you identity as a failure, incapable of achievement, unfit, unlovable, destined to play a bit-part role in your own story, then by heck no matter how much willpower you put in to push that boulder up the hill, it will return to its place.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s a way through: every action you take is a vote for who you wish to become. Every day you wake up, look your old identity in the eye and say &#34;thanks for your service, but you&#39;re not needed around here anymore,&#34; step forward and lean in, is a day your new identity is built.</p>
<p>It takes time. You have to actually want it. You have to choose to adopt a new mindset. Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day. But it comes, a little like how <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/08/08/all-at-once/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hazel Grace Lancaster describes falling in love in The Fault In Our Stars</a>: <em>&#34;slowly, and then all at once.&#34;</em></p>
<p>The path is there, should you choose.</p>
<p>Identify where your identity needs to shift. Then take a step. Cast today’s vote. Find your way through.</p>
<p>Do that day by day, then soon enough, your inner world will shift and recalibrate around the new reality you&#39;re co-creating.</p>
<p>Then one day you&#39;ll see it.</p>
<p>People like us really do things like this.</p></div></div>
