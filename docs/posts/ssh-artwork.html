<p dir="auto">Want to find an SSH key with a specific hash visualization pattern? If so, then
this is the tool for you. If not, just don&#39;t make me SSH into your servers with
their ugly-ass keys.</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenSSH 5.1 introduced a visual hash representation of public keys. From its changelog:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=" * Introduce experimental SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualisation to ssh(1)
   and ssh-keygen(1). Visual fingerprinnt display is controlled by a new
   ssh_config(5) option &#34;VisualHostKey&#34;. The intent is to render
   SSH host keys in a visual form that is amenable to easy recall and
   rejection of changed host keys. This technique inspired by the
   graphical hash visualisation schemes known as &#34;random art[*]&#34;, and
   by Dan Kaminsky&#39;s musings at 23C3 in Berlin.

   Fingerprint visualisation in is currently disabled by default, as the
   algorithm used to generate the random art is still subject to change.

<p dir="auto">You can visualize your existing keys with the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ssh-keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"><pre><code>ssh-keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s probably gibberish, as expected from all the randomness involved. My
original key looked like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="+---[RSA 4096]----+
|          **o.ooO|
|         *oo.+.B.|
|        o E*o** =|
|         .o O++=o|
|        S  . =o+ |
|            . o  |
|             . o |
|            oo  =|
|            .o++o|
+----[SHA256]-----+"><pre><code>+---[RSA 4096]----+
|          **o.ooO|
|         *oo.+.B.|
|        o E*o** =|
|         .o O++=o|
|        S  . =o+ |
|            . o  |
|             . o |
|            oo  =|
|            .o++o|
+----[SHA256]-----+
</code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Once visualization is introduced, so is aesthetics. This feature presents a
great opportunity to fight against truly random key generation in order to trade
security for arbitrary human desires.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, I wanted a key that looked like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="+------[RSA]------+
|                 |
|  .OOOO    OOO   |
|  ..OOOO  OOO.   |
|  ...OOOOOOO.    |
|   ...OOSOO.     |
|    ...OEO.      |
|     .....       |
|      ...        |
|                 |
+-----[SHA256]----+"><pre><code>+------[RSA]------+
|                 |
|  .OOOO    OOO   |
|  ..OOOO  OOO.   |
|  ...OOOOOOO.    |
|   ...OOSOO.     |
|    ...OEO.      |
|     .....       |
|      ...        |
|                 |

start the artist creative process with</p>
