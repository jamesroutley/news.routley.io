<p>It’s finally here! <em>Writing a C Compiler</em> goes on sale today on <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/writing-a-c-compiler-build-a-real-programming-language-from-scratch-nora-sandler/18414210">Bookshop.org</a>, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/writing-a-c-compiler-nora-sandler/1141287012">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Compiler-Programming-Language-Scratch/dp/1718500424/">Amazon</a>, and wherever books are sold<sup id="anchor1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. (It’s been available <a href="https://nostarch.com/writing-c-compiler">directly from No Starch Press</a> for a few weeks now!) You can find links to the companion code, errata, and other resources on the book’s <a href="https://norasandler.com/book">web page</a>.</p>

<p>I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who preordered a copy, and especially to the readers who took the time to email me and share their feedback. One of the best parts of writing a project-based book like this hearing how people are making it their own—readers have been writing compilers in everything from Rust to Scheme to C, and a few brave souls are even targeting totally different instruction sets. I can’t wait to see what else this book’s readers build.</p>
