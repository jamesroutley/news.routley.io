    <h1>Stack Overflow&#39;s CEO Doesn&#39;t Understand Stack Overflow</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his
salary depends on his not understanding it!—Upton Sinclair,

</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been <a href="https://jlericson.com/2015/07/21/vacation.html/2015/07/21/vacation.html">on
vacation</a>, so I
haven&#39;t been following <a href="https://jlericson.com/tag/strike.html">the Stack Overflow moderator
strike</a>. Not there has been
much progress. Negotiations stalled for <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/390106/moderation-strike-update-data-dumps-choosing-representatives-gpt-data-and-wh/390704#390704">a variety of
reasons</a>. Meanwhile
Stack Overflow&#39;s CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar, dug the company&#39;s hole a
bit deeper <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stack-overflow-ceo-teases-generative-ai-tools-addresses-moderator-protest/">during an interview with
VentureBeat</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://jlericson.com/2020/02/04/misunderstanding_meta.html">the last time I analyzed an
interview</a>, I assume the
author accurately represented Prashanth. I&#39;d prefer an unedited
transcript because it allows the reader to interpret in the original
context but we must play the hand we are dealt. I will pull out the
quotes and offer my analysis below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s definitely a question around how we leverage [generative AI]
technology to deliver on our mission of helping build technology
through collective knowledge. This intersection between the power of
community on one side and AI on the other side—from my
standpoint, human-generated community content has taken us to this
level, we have a large impact, but there are also so many problems
we can solve by leveraging this technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I jump in, please take a moment to read <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/introducing-stackoverflow-com/">Jeff
Atwood&#39;s</a>
and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/">Joel
Spolsky&#39;s</a>
introductions of Stack Overflow.  Did you
notice what I did? Both describe Stack Overflow as the solution to a
very specific problem: programming knowledge locked up in minds and
forums whence it&#39;s difficult to retrieve. They also explain how they
intend to solve the problem including using their combined audience to
form the core of the community of programmers to answer questions. As
someone who was there at the time, it was easy to envision how the project
might solve the problem even if that was an unlikely outcome.</p>
<p>By contrast Prashanth regularly talks about combining community and AI
without going into detail about how that solves the problem at
hand. Neither does he go into much detail about the problems the
company intends to solve. I suspect one reason is that Prashanth, who
has spent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pchandrasekar/details/experience/">most of his career in
management</a>,
has become something of an <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">architecture
astronaut</a>. As
Joel puts it, &#34;architecture people are solving problems that they
think they can solve, not problems which are <em>useful</em> to solve.&#34; Since
there is overlap between a Q&amp;A site and generative artificial
intelligence, there must be a way of jamming them together.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s another factor. In May I <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/05/17/so_business.html">wrote about Stack Overflow&#39;s
business</a>, which lost $42 million over 6
months and had just laid off 10% of its employees. Since then, <a href="https://prosus-ir.com/results/2023/Prosus-annual-results-2023/pdf/booklet.pdf">the
company&#39;s fiscal year-end results came
out</a>. Despite
growing revenue, it lost $84 million over the year ending on March
31, 2023. In fact Prosus&#39; <em>entire education technology segment</em> lost
money despite growing income:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On an economic-interest basis, Edtech segment revenues grew by 28%
(18%) to US$545m and trading losses increased to US$258m. Growth was
affected by decreased demand in the macroeconomic downturn. Our
portfolio companies have reacted quickly to changing market conditions
and are rationalising their cost structures and investments. At the
same time, our businesses are shifting resources to take advantage of
new AI technologies which promise to transform the industry. By
deploying GenAI technologies, our companies can better personalise the
content and user feedback on their platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.prosus.com/~/media/Files/P/Prosus-CORP/latest-financial-results/results-call-transcript.pdf">most recent earnings
call</a>,
Larry Illg, the CEO of the segment and Prashanth&#39;s boss, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Stack specifically, we think that Gen AI is going to be an
important evolution to how developers work and learn in the future,
helping them to be more efficient and also learn new techniques
while they&#39;re in the flow of work. We think, and the Stack team
believes the developer community can play a crucial role in how AI
evolves and accelerates, ultimately, with the community being
helpful in ensuring the quality of Gen AI offerings. And Stack
itself sees its role as is bringing the power of its developer
community—and it&#39;s important to remember that they have assembled
one of the biggest developer communities in the world—bringing
that community together with the technology power of AI with the
goal of creating highly trusted solutions to technology
problems. And the team is working and launching a variety of AI
solutions and more to come here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might be that the shift to allow AI answers has more to do with
Stack Overflow&#39;s parent company than its CEO. Or maybe Prashanth has
been pushing this as a solution to Stack Overflow&#39;s financial
problems. Either way, it appears the company hopes the community will
cooperate by vetting artificially generated content. It doesn&#39;t appear
they have put much thought into why the community might want to do
this, though it&#39;s important to remember these are comments directed to
investors, not developers.</p>
<p>The call happened on June 27, a month after <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389582/what-is-the-network-policy-regarding-ai-generated-content">the policy allowing AI
content</a>. I
can only speculate, but a reasonable interpretation would be that the
company found it could not solve its financial problems by <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">selling
data</a> and looked for other ways it could
provide something to sell to LLM developers. Given Stack Overflow&#39;s
voting system, it&#39;s natural to wonder if that data could be fed back
into the models. (And even better if Stack Overflow can be paid for
that data.) But you can&#39;t very well do that if machine-generated
content is absolutely disallowed.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s pop the stack back to Prashanth&#39;s interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to do it responsibly and safely and have the right use case
to solve specific user and customer problems. It&#39;s going
to be very, very exciting—I can&#39;t wait for the world to know and
for our community to use the things that we&#39;re about to announce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is clearly referencing Prashanth&#39;s keynote address on July 27
when he&#39;s planning on making an announcement. I
<a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">predicted</a> the announcement would be
adding Prosus&#39; LLM technology to Stack Overflow. That wouldn&#39;t help
with revenue, but it&#39;s the easiest way for Stack Overflow to
demonstrate the potential value of using voting data. In order to
maximize press coverage on the day of the announcement, the company
can only tease without breaking the news early. That&#39;s a pretty
terrible communication strategy for a community, however. Unless your
community trusts you without reservation (and Stack Overflow is
nowhere near that blessed state) the teases will only increase
anxiety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re probably talking about 30 million official developers based on
our own data sets, but that number is probably going to at least
triple because there are so many people that are going to come into
the field of writing code because it&#39;s so much easier to begin to
write a baseline level of quality of code. And I think
the watermark has just sort of gone up in terms of the expectations
for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stack Overflow has <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#users">21 million
users</a>, so that&#39;s not where the
30 million comes from. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+developers+are+in+the+world">quick Google
search</a>
puts the number of developers worldwide at 27 million. Since the world
population stands at <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">8
billion</a>, roughly 3
of every thousand people on Earth are developers. I don&#39;t know if that
sounds like a large or a small number to you, but given there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programmers">no
programmers before
1945</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD340.PDF">not many
more added in the
1950s</a>, the
profession has grown at a goodly rate.</p>
<p><img src="https://jlericson.com/images/arrow_tech.jpg" alt="Display of arrowhead technology at Guernsey State Park, Wyoming."/></p>
<p>In a blog earlier this year, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/?p=21973">Prashanth compared AI to the
introduction of tractors</a> in that
they made the job easier. I pointed out that <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/388401/new-blog-post-from-our-ceo-prashanth-community-is-the-future-of-ai/389224#389224">tractors reduced the
number of
farmers</a>.
Tripling the number of programmers would imply a rather dramatic
change to the world economy. What sort of work would they be doing? As
a lapsed programmer, I do find myself reaching for the old tools to
help a colleague from time to time. But I don&#39;t envision my co-workers
becoming programmers no matter how easy it becomes. If I weren&#39;t
around to ask, they&#39;d reach for other tools or just go without.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you want to definitely be adopting these tools to get more
productive and efficient and learn faster in your role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another way of expressing the well-worn idea: <a href="https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1610984481342771200">&#34;AI will not
replace you. A person using AI
will.&#34;</a>
Remember there used to be an occupation called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)">&#34;computer&#34;</a>. The
people who had those jobs (often women) lost them to devices also
called &#34;computers&#34;. AI enthusiasts aim for a happy medium where the
technology is disruptive enough to demand attention, but tame enough
that everyone who adopts it will prosper.</p>
<p>Since the invention of writing, there were scribes who specialized in
using (and creating) the tools required to make legible marks. They
were hired to take dictation and copy manuscripts. It was technical
and highly-specialized work. With improvements in technology
(including <a href="https://www.bl.uk/history-of-writing/articles/a-brief-history-of-writing-materials-and-technologies">the printing press and mass-produced metal
nibs</a>)
more people could write for themselves and &#34;scribe&#34; took on a
metaphorical meaning for someone who makes a living cranking out the
written word. Technology dramatically increased the production of
writing at the cost of people making a living doing that work.</p>
<p>After using ChatGPT for a few months to <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/03/29/coding_ai.html">help me write
code</a>, I&#39;m not sure
it will have the same impact as metal nibs had on writing. For common
questions, it&#39;s impressive but <a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-miracle-of-chatgpt">blind spots can be easily
found</a>. The
primary advantage of LLMs (their output can be copied and used without
modification) also makes them poor tools for effective learning. They
create <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf">cargo
cults</a> from
their training materials. They sometimes produce useful results if
circumstances are favorable, but provide no help otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision to ban ChatGPT was the “right decision” back in
December, said Chandrasekar. But now, he explained, the company has
slowly been working with the community, doing research and getting
input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the primary spot I wish VentureBeat had provided a
transcript. I think Prashanth has <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/labs/">Stack Overflow
Labs</a> in mind here. If so, the
feedback from the community was largely &#34;please don&#39;t do this&#34;. It&#39;s
hard to see how any of what happened after reversing the ban on
ChatGPT is working <em>with</em> the community. &#34;Against&#34; seems the more
appropriate preposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have gotten feedback on how best to make sure that we will trust
generative AI products, from a Stack Overflow standpoint, and that&#39;s
what we&#39;re going to announce in about a month&#39;s time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fairly vague, but despite the context I suspect the feedback
came from people working with LLMs. It certainly hasn&#39;t come from the
community since their elected moderators were told their judgment was
unreliable. In that light &#34;make sure that we will trust generative AI
products&#34; feels a lot more sinister than it first appears. Perhaps
what Prashanth meant was simply &#34;improve the trustworthiness of
generative AI products&#34;, which once again signals using Stack Overflow
voting to provide feedback to some model or other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[False negatives are] causing a really negative impact because when
a legitimate human being coming on the website wants to ask a
question, we don&#39;t want to shoo them away. We want to share the
question, we want to serve our purpose and mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The decision to create a new AI policy was] not an easy decision by
any means—but we just thought that the cost of dissuading
people from asking a question on Stack Overflow was too high. And it
was happening very alarmingly high rate based on the analysis that
we looked at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can tell, most suspected machine-generated content comes
in the form of an answer, not a question. Nevertheless, incorrectly
flagged content does have a negative impact on the humans that
produced it. I believe, however, the company is <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/26/problem_ai.html">underestimating the
number of answers copied from ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve taken a public position around this subject, saying that we
always want to be open and free with our data with our developer
community. However, large AI companies building models—we
absolutely want to work with them in a more formal way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this might be the company&#39;s public position, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391634/the-companys-commitment-to-the-data-dumps-the-api-and-sede/391640#391640">Prashanth
privately wanted to limit who can access the
data</a>. On
March 28, 2023, he ordered the data dump not be uploaded to
Archive.org. The DBA who turned it off warned that the community would
notice and it did. Rather than having an answer prepared, the company
publicly struggled for an answer. <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">Internal
communication</a> shows most of the company
was as surprised as the rest of us.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is that Stack Overflow&#39;s CEO hasn&#39;t listened to the
people who best understand Stack Overflow. He appears to have a
surface-level grasp of the site, the community and the culture. As a
result, he&#39;s made decisions that harm the value of Stack
Overflow. This isn&#39;t necessarily malicious, but rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">incompetence
of some sort</a>.</p>
<p>Prashanth has already demonstrated skill in selling Stack
Overflow. That was an impressive feat. But nobody can excel at
everything and he hasn&#39;t shown an aptitude for running a
community-centered company. It requires <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391626/historical-policy-on-the-use-of-gpt-generators/391654#391654">much more than platitudes and
boundless
enthusiasm</a>.</p>
