Many other central banks did the same. For over a decade, banks could borrow money for little to nothing. It became the new normal, and the generation that entered Wall St. during this time is now disoriented, for they “do not know a world without cheap money.” </p><p>This story piqued my interest. Whenever people are humbled by the melting away of things they took for granted, now that’s a topic worth exploring.</p><p><span>But this is not just a story about finance or markets. The long period of ‘cheap money’ made for a strange time all around. The 2010s were a decade that “disrupted everything but resolved nothing,” as</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/17/decade-of-perpetual-crisis-2010s-disrupted-everything-but-resolved-nothing" rel=""> Andy Beckett wrote</a><span>, and I tend to agree. The near-zero interest rate regime functioned much like an opiate. It was the water everything swam in, and it made the dysfunction somehow still functional. </span></p><p><span>The disruption bubbling in the background, however, kept accumulating in its many forms: diminishing state capacity, </span><a href="https://novum.substack.com/p/social-recession-by-the-numbers" rel="">social fraying</a><span>, hyper-polarization within political power, trust at all-time low, and actual productivity growth being negative or close to negative in many developed economies.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="">1</a><span> Arguably, the lasting takeaway of the past decade-plus is how the public’s optimism about the future fell apart, especially as expectations about technology grew much more cynical.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" rel="">2</a><span> Sometimes, it seemed like the last vocal optimists left were investors and venture capitalists.</span></p><p><span>It ‘resolved nothing’ — but it also didn’t burst. While markets may have been roaring, some unfortunate long-term developments persisted in the background unabated. Now that we’re possibly turning a page, I can’t help but ask rhetorically: ‘what if it turned out that your entire worldview was only possible because of near-zero interest rates?’</span><a id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" rel="">3</a></p><p><span>The point of this silly question is to consider just how much of an outsized role the Fed now holds. The circumstances produced worldviews that assumed this state of affairs had some permanence.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" rel="">4</a><span> It’s openly accepted now that much of finance capital has become a function of monetary policy. And since finance capital is now more important than ever to economic growth, it stands to reason that the Fed is also more important than ever. It’s Jerome Powell’s world: never before have I seen markets move so erratically in response to a once-boring </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4537703-stock-market-jackson-hole-meltdown-next-steps" rel="">Jackson Hole conference.</a><span> Actually, the first time I ever heard of this event was this year since some acquaintances of mine were trying to ‘trade’ it. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png" width="1456" height="604" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:604,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:210617,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7355c3cd-b120-44a2-97c0-73daa8d86091_2332x968.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Simple data pulled from FRED showing the interest rate set by the Fed. The downward trend since the 1980s is clear, but the real experiment began after 2009. </figcaption></figure></div><p>After the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve instituted a zero or near-zero interest rate regime. The philosophy behind it was simple:</p><blockquote><p><span>The Fed’s “strong and creative measures” would inflate stock prices, which would lead those holding stocks to feel wealthier and more confident, and then they’d spend a little more, and some droplets of this might trickle down to the people that are working in the real economy.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" rel="">5</a></p></blockquote><p><span>The thinking behind this strategy, as </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/other/o_bernanke20101105a.htm" rel="">outlined</a><span> by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke in 2010, is known as the </span><em>wealth effect.</em><span> Henceforth, the Fed’s purpose became more and more intertwined with asset growth. Other central banks followed, sometimes taking even more drastic measures. Four of them in Europe, along with Japan, unconventionally opted for </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/europe-says-goodbye-negative-rates-or-just-au-revoir-2022-09-22/" rel="">negative interest rates</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>All of this has led to weird idiosyncrasies, euphoria, and contradictions. Stocks ballooned, </span><a href="https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/" rel="">tripling in value</a><span> since 2009. Aside from commodities, virtually all assets went up without discretion. Housing became the ultimate speculative asset. Financialization became a way of life. What even is value anymore? </span></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://novum.substack.com/p/what-if-worldview-zero-interest-rates?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://novum.substack.com/p/what-if-worldview-zero-interest-rates?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><ol><li><p><span>Top corporations, especially tech companies, became flushed with an exorbitant amount of cash. This is a departure from the olden days of corporate behavior. They are so insulated that they might as well be institutions — “In recent years, the rise in cash held by U.S. companies has been dramatic, skyrocketing from $1.6 trillion in 2000 to </span><a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/companies-hoarding-cash" rel="">about $5.8 trillion today.</a><span>” </span></p></li><li><p><span>Related to (1), stock buybacks were a defining feature of the 2010s. By the end of it, they reached absurd levels. Between 2009 and 2018, S&amp;P 500 companies spent around 52% of all their profits on buying back their own stocks, some </span><a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/financialization-us-pharma-industry" rel="">$4.3 trillion</a><span>. If we isolate just the 2010s, buybacks </span><a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/finance-as-culture" rel="">doubled</a><span> compared to the previous decade. This development has been linked to structural economic changes, as discussed in this excellent piece by the Institute for New Economic Thinking: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>In their book, </span><em>Predatory Value Extraction, </em><span>William Lazonick and Jang-Sup Shin call the increase in stock buybacks since the early 1980s “the legalized looting of the U.S. business corporation,” while in a forthcoming paper, Lazonick and Ken Jacobson identify Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, adopted by the regulatory agency in 1982 with little public scrutiny, as a “license to loot.” A growing body of research, much of it focusing on particular industries and companies, supports the argument that the financialization of the U.S. business corporation, reflected in massive distributions to shareholders, bears prime responsibility for extreme concentration of income among the richest U.S. households, the erosion of middle-class employment opportunities in the United States, and the loss of U.S. competitiveness in the global economy.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>After a lull in 2020, buybacks have </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/06/22/share-buybacks-sp-500-companies" rel="">come roaring back</a><span> in 2021 and 2022. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Part of the problem is that the buyback splurge often exceeded what was spent on actual, productive research and development. The top pharmaceutical companies represent some of the</span><a href="https://prospect.org/power/pharma-companies-spend-billions-more-on-stock-buybacks-than-developing-drugs/" rel=""> most egregious</a><span> examples.

But let it at least be measured dollar-for-dollar on its social benefit. One cannot help but feel frustrated over the squandered historic opportunity: public funding was anemic during this entire long period of ‘cheap money.’ If you’re going to do it, at least do it right.</p><p><span>The Fed may be hiking rates now, as is Europe for the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/21/european-central-bank-raises-interest-rates-for-first-time-in-11-years" rel="">first time in 11 years</a><span>, but the pathologies that defined 2009-2021 are not leaving us. Those who grew accustomed to this world will not so easily accept the new one. In his book </span><em>Permanent Distortion </em><span>(2022),</span><em> </em><span>Nomi Prins argues that there is no real ‘out’ for this new arrangement. </span></p><p><span>The Gordian knot we find ourselves in now is that </span><em>good economic news </em><span>is </span><em>bad financial news. A </em><span>strong economy means that the Fed will keep hiking rates which is bad for financial assets. Such was the case with the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/business/economy/stocks-jobs-report-inflation.html" rel="">recent strong jobs report</a><span>, which caused markets to crash. If we had an actual recession now, stocks would paradoxically explode upward because the Fed would have to revert back to cheap money. This alone says everything about how the circuits of value within finance capital have grown disconnected from the economic base. </span></p><p>Now that we are supposedly turning a page, the hope is that the dysfunction accumulating in the background can be more thoroughly acknowledged. I already see some indication of this, with outlets covering the decline of sociability more and more. It’s a start. May attention be more appropriately applied now, since the investor is finally forced to temper expectations and be a bit more pessimistic like the rest of us.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
