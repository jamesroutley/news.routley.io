    <h1>Lenovo profits sink 75% as PC demand continues nosedive</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Chinese powerhouse Lenovo is feeling the burn as demand for personal computers continues to melt in a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p>The world&#39;s largest maker of PCs reported revenue of $12.635 billion for <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/lenovo/annual/2023/res.pdf">Q4 of its fiscal 2023</a> ended 31 March, down a brutal 24 percent year-on-year. Pre-tax profit was down 75 percent to $130 million on the back of workforce restructuring charges.</p>
<p>&#34;By the end of this quarter or early next, the inventory digestion will come to an end so that the activation number and the shipment number will be more consistent,&#34; said Lenovo CEO Yanqing Yang.</p>

    

<p>The Intelligent Devices Group – the PC and smart gadget division – was most devastated by shifting buying patterns: revenue fell to $9.79 billion versus $14.69 billion a year earlier, a 33.3 percent decline, and one that may mark a bottoming out of shipments.</p>

        


        

<p>The PC became the essential tool to work, learn, and play during the COVID-19 crisis. Manufacturers quickly sold out of stock within months and struggled to make enough to meet mounting orders. Lenovo&#39;s channel, for example, had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/03/lenovo_on_pcs/">one-third of its normal inventory</a>.</p>
<p>Shipments peaked at 350 million for 2021, and PC makers believed that the total addressable market would remain at those heady heights, but saturation means there has been something of a procurement slowdown, and the channel has shifted from famine to having too much unsold kit.</p>

        

<p>&#34;During the year under review, excess channel inventory intensified business challenges amid falling sell-in demand and currency headwinds. Sell-in activity was compromised by channel inventory clearance,&#34; said Lenovo in a statement.</p>

</ul>
<p>&#34;Nevertheless, Group sell-out data, or actual sales to end users, suggested a more moderate decline in end demand and, simultaneously, greater gain in market share. The Group&#39;s PC business remained number one by market share.&#34;</p>
<p>According to Gartner, PC shipments declined 30 percent to 55.154 million across the industry in calendar Q1, which tracks with Lenovo&#39;s Q4. Vendors used discounts to drive sales.</p>
<p>In its previous quarter, Lenovo reported its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/17/lenovo_q3/">first profit decline in three years</a> and hatched a plan to save $850 million in annual overheads. One of the levers was cutting jobs. During this latest quarter, it recorded a one-time restructuring charge of $249 million.</p>
<p>Lenovo is trying to emphasize other divisions to seek out higher growth in areas including servers and tech services.</p>

        

<p>The Infrastructure Solutions Group grew to $2.2 billion in the latest quarter, up from $1.408 billion, selling servers and the like to SMEs, larger enterprises, and cloud service providers. The Solutions and Services Group, which includes managed services, grew to $6.66 billion for $5.441 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the full year, Lenovo revenues fell to 14 percent to $61.94 billion and it reported a profit before tax of $2.136 billion, down 23 percent. ®</p>
