    <h1>SoundPrint: Telling those of us with auditory sensitivities where not to go</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div dir="auto"><p>Hey folks, </p><p>Before I jump into the post, I wanted to invite you to attend a webinar my colleagues and I at MN-NEAT will be presenting on 2/9/21 from 10:00-12:00 CT — <a href="https://mn-neat.org/events" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Accessible Gaming: Building interdependence and strong communities through accessible PC and console</a>. And now, let’s chat about a cool app!</p><p>It is empowering to have environmental sound data on the places around you. Knowing sound data can help you determine where (or where not) to meet with friends, have a date, and spend your time catching up on work. Having the ability to choose between a coffee shop averaging 40dB and 85dB is a game-changer for people that experience auditory processing or sensory differences.</p><p>In a prior post, we discussed <a href="https://accessible.substack.com/p/vibes-filtering-sound-for-those-who?r=9ees9&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hardware to reduce and filter the sound </a>in noisy environments; now we’ll review an option that can help you choose what environment you may want to put yourself in. With a free mobile app called<em> <a href="https://www.soundprint.co/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SoundPrint</a></em>, anyone with a mobile device is now able to check the average sound level of a location, as well as add a sound level to their current location.</p><p><a href="https://www.griffinot.com/auditory-sensitivity-autism-sensory/#:~:text=Auditory%20overload%20often%20occurs%20when,over%20a%20period%20of%20time." rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Auditory overload</a> could become much less common while out in public.</p><p><em>For those of you who have requested videos for accessibility, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5je86sosxCA&amp;t=121s" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here’s a quick tutorial</a> with subtitles on SoundPrint. For those of you who prefer to read, continue on :)</em></p><h2>Tech specs</h2><p><em>SoundPrint</em> is a mobile app available on both iOS and Android. All that’s needed to operate it is a smartphone with a microphone and an internet connection. </p><p><em>SoundPrint</em> relies on a crowdsourcing model—individual users submit “SoundChecks” using the app.<em> SoundPrint</em> takes the average dB reading and stores it under the user’s location.</p><p><em>SoundPrint</em> is connected to FourSquare, so any local venue listed on FourSquare is also listed on <em>SoundPrint.</em> If a location is not available on <em>SoundPrint</em> yet, any user is able to add it manually. My neighbor has their bedroom publicly listed on the app. (smirk emoji)</p><h2>Searching for spaces</h2><p>The main point of <em>SoundPrint</em> is for a user to be able to find a nearby space that fits the noise level they and their social group needs. In the app, this is done by searching for a local venue based on a significant amount of filters available, and the results are displayed via map or list:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Search within </strong>a specific distance from your current location</p></li><li><p><strong>Order by</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Closest</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Quietest to Loudest</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Loudest to Quietest</strong></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Filter by Sound level.</strong> This is broken up by “Quiet,” “Moderate,” “Loud,” and “‘Very Loud.”</p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49776774-df59-42dd-90c2-52832b64bba2_1600x297.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49776774-df59-42dd-90c2-52832b64bba2_1600x297.jpeg" width="728" height="270" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/49776774-df59-42dd-90c2-52832b64bba2_1600x297.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:270,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Four white boxes with one of SoundPrint&#39;s noise levels in each one.

My wishlist? Automatic sound tracking and having the data available on a public search engine.</p><h3>Automatic sound tracking </h3><p>Remembering (and putting the effort in) for a user to take their phone out, hold it up in the air for fifteen seconds, and submit a SoundCheck every time they go somewhere isn’t super scaleable. Users will get some data that is very reliable, but what could be done with massive amounts of data that is only a bit less reliable because it’s coming from someone’s pocket rather than being held in the air?</p><p>I would love to see <em>SoundPrint</em> have an “opt in” feature that allows users to give permission for <em>SoundPrint</em> to randomly sample the volume of their environment for fifteen seconds at a time and add it to the SoundChecks. </p><p>Of course, people should have the option to opt out of this at any time in an accessible way through the app, pause it, and remove specific SoundChecks. </p><h3>Search Engine Access</h3><p>When we look for somewhere to meet up with people, how do we usually search? Personally, I go on google maps to find places near me.</p><p>Google already has ratings, specialties, hours, dine-in/take-out, average price, how busy they are at the moment, and a plethora of other information on a company’s profile. I would love to see <em>SoundPrint</em> be added to the company profile. If we can tell how busy a restaurant is, we aren’t too far off from being able to tell how noisy it is without manual entry. </p><p>This ease of access feature would empower a lot of people with sensory differences to make decisions on when and where to spend meaningful time out in the world in a way that isn’t overwhelming.</p><h2>Takeaway</h2><p>We have the tools to reduce the sound around us, but for many people it’s even better when there’s less sound in their surroundings. With <em>SoundPrint</em>, people are empowered to make decisions on their own environments, meaning less <a href="https://www.griffinot.com/auditory-sensitivity-autism-sensory/#:~:text=Auditory%20overload%20often%20occurs%20when,over%20a%20period%20of%20time." rel="nofollow ugc noopener">auditory overload</a> while spending time in their communities.</p><p><em>SoundPrint </em>requires a crowdsourced effort at this point to track SoundChecks, but offers the entire community an accurate way to determine the dB levels of venues near them. </p><p>A moonshot for<em> SoundPrint</em> would be the ability for users to opt-in to automatic SoundChecks and for <em>SoundPrint </em>to become a staple of a major search engine’s (preferably Google) company profile.</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
