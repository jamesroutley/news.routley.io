    <h1>Ask HN: Are people still using Pascal?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Pascal, and later on Delphi, was what introduced me to programming 20-something years ago. As with most folks in our generation, I quickly discovered other options, more suitable for that relatively fresh thing called the Web.</p><p>So, i generally considered Pascal a dead language.</p><p>I was surprised to find out the other day that Delphi is not only alive, but thriving in its own way. Its community is as strong and as fervent about using it as it was back then. Even on the open-source front, there is an alternative IDE called Lazarus that offers a similar developer experience at no cost.</p><p>This got me curious. Who is still using Pascal/Delphi in 2023 and what for? Has it matured beyond the desktop app? Has it transitioned into the cloud-native era?</p></div></td></div></div>
