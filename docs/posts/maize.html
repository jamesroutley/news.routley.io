    <p>The grain <em>maize</em> is first found in English as a loanword from Spanish <em>maíz</em> in 1541. Maíz is first attested in Spanish by Christopher Columbus in 1500 as a loanword from Taíno <em>mahis</em>, meaning “maize”. Maize was first domesticated in what is now southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago (compare to wheat 12,000 years ago, rice 9,000 years ago) from wild teosinte.</p>

<em>Ears of wild teosinte, a teosinte-maize hybrid, and maize, from left to right. The teosinte is reddish-brown and has about 24 total kernels. The maize is two and a half times longer and about six times wider than the teosinte.</em></p>

<p>The magnitude of this achievement is made apparent by a side-by-side comparison of wild teosinte, which produces a single ear of corn per plant, with maize. Just as striking is the fact that <em>corn</em>, the generic word for “grain” in most world Englishes, only means “maize” in US English and Canadian English. (<em>Corn</em> and <em>grain</em> are an Old English-Norman French doublet that both descend from the same PIE word, ǵr̥h₂nóm.)</p>

<p>How did that meaning shift happen? Even before the first British colony in North America, we can find people referring to maize as “Indian corn”, the grain that those savages eat. That was its common name for centuries. By 1800, it was common to drop the “Indian” qualifier and just call maize <em>corn</em> in the US.</p>
