    <h1>Recording System Audio Output on a Macbook</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Several times I&#39;ve needed to make a recording of the system audio on my
Macbook. Typical reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&#39;m recording a software demo video, where the software produces audio output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#39;m making a video in which I&#39;m narrating over an existing recording or
  video, so I need to record both my microphone and the existing audio playback
  while I hear it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The interwebs suggested a few ways to approach this, and not everything I tried worked. Here&#39;s
what did!</p>
<h2 id="blackhole"><a href="#blackhole" rel="nofollow">Blackhole</a><a href="#blackhole" title="Permanent link" rel="nofollow">¶</a></h2>
<p>Per the README, <a href="https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole" rel="nofollow">Blackhole</a> is &#34;a modern macOS virtual audio loopback driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency.&#34;</p>
<p>I installed it using the installer, not homebrew.</p>
<h3 id="device-configuration"><a href="#device-configuration" rel="nofollow">Device configuration</a><a href="#device-configuration" title="Permanent link" rel="nofollow">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the tricky part. General instructions are on the <a href="https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/wiki/Multi-Output-Device" rel="nofollow">Multi Output
Device</a> page.</p>
<p>I made two virtual devices, since I wanted to be able to use it with either
headphones or (occasionally) with the built-in speakers.</p>
<p>Here are the settings for my two virtual devices. Note that for headphones I
selected both &#34;External Headphones&#34; AND my USB audio interface (Revelator IO
24). That way, this virtual device works with either the external interface OR
the built-in headphone jack.</p>

</p>

<p>For completeness, here&#39;s how the Blackhole 2ch device looks in audio-midi
setup. I did this a long time ago, but I don&#39;t think I did anything special
besides running the installer:</p>

<p>Whenever you want to record system audio, you must first go into the MacOS
audio settings and select the desired virtual device, like so:</p>

<h3 id="volume-control-annoyance"><a href="#volume-control-annoyance" rel="nofollow">Volume control annoyance!</a><a href="#volume-control-annoyance" title="Permanent link" rel="nofollow">¶</a></h3>
<p>When using one of the virtual output devices, the MacOS volume control is
disabled!</p>
<p>This is a bit annoying; it means you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set output device to (normal) headphone or speaker</li>
<li>Adjust output level</li>
<li>Change output device to the virtual device</li>
</ol>
<p>If you change your mind and want to change the output level, you have to switch
the output device again and repeat the process!</p>
<p>Note that if using an audio interface with its own headphone level control, this becomes
a non-issue. It&#39;s only really a problem when using the built-in speakers or
headphone output jack.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had good results with <a href="https://monosnap.com/" rel="nofollow">Monosnap</a>. It&#39;s relatively easy to set up and
use, and allows embedding my webcam over a screencast.
(I also use it for easily making gifs of no-audio screen recordings - if you find such
a gif on this website, that&#39;s how I made it!)</p>
<p>Steps to record system audio with Monosnap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the mac&#39;s audio output device to the virtual audio device you set up as
  per above instructions.</li>
<li>Click &#34;Record Video&#34; from the monosnap menu bar icon</li>
<li>Click the settings icon next to the red &#34;Record&#34; button</li>
<li>For audio input, select &#34;Blackhole 2ch&#34;</li>
<li>If also recording another source eg microphone, select that as well.
   In the screenshot below, I&#39;m recording both system blackhole and the mac
   internal microphone.</li>
<li>Start recording!</li>
</ol>

<p>One limitation of this approach is you can&#39;t change the mix later.
This is great for quick screencasts without needing to edit and mix.
But if you really hate the balance of eg microphone to system audio - it&#39;s a
do-over.</p>
<p>You could presumably use a more sophisticated program for screen recording and
video editing that supports multiple audio tracks. I haven&#39;t tried that; this
simple setup works great for my needs.</p>

<p>Occasionally I don&#39;t really need video, just audio. For that, this command works well:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>sox -t coreaudio &#34;BlackHole 2ch&#34;  foo.wav</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I hit Ctrl-C when done recording.</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/" rel="nofollow">Sox</a> is easily installed via <code>brew install sox</code>.</p>
