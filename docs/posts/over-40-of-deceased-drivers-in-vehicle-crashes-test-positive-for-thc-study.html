<div><p>CHICAGO  — New study findings show that over 40% of drivers who died in motor vehicle collisions tested positive for active delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their system, with average blood levels far exceeding those considered to cause impairment. The research highlights a significant and persistent public health risk that is unchanged by the legalization of recreational cannabis, the authors said. </p>
<p>The research will be presented at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/conferences-and-meetings/clinical-congress-2025/" target="_blank" title="Clinical Congress 2025">Clinical Congress 2025</a> in Chicago, October 4–7. </p>
<p>Researchers analyzed coroner records from Montgomery County in Ohio from January 2019 to September 2024, focusing on 246 deceased drivers who were tested for THC following a fatal crash. When autopsies are performed, drug screening is typically part of the process. The study period included the state’s legalization of recreational cannabis in 2023. </p>
<p>“I was surprised to see that level,” said lead author Akpofure P. Ekeh, MBBS, FACS, a professor of surgery at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. “An average level of 30.7 ng/mL generally means those people must have consumed marijuana at some time close to driving. This isn’t about residual use; it’s about recent consumption.” </p>
<h3>Key Study Findings </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Prevalence:</strong> 103 drivers (41.9%) overall tested positive for THC, with yearly rates ranging from 25.7% to 48.9%.</li>
<li><strong>No Effect from Legalization:</strong> The rate of drivers who tested positive for THC did not change significantly before or after legalization (42.1% vs. 45.2%), indicating that legal status did not influence the behavior of those who chose to drive after use. </li>
<li><strong>Consistent Over Time:</strong> The high rate of THC positivity showed no significant change over the six-year study period. </li>
</ul>
<p>The study notes that blood THC levels are typically drawn by the coroner within hours of death, providing an accurate snapshot of a driver’s state at the time of the crash. Most states that have set legal limits for driving range from 2 to 5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) — a threshold the average level in this study (30.7 ng/mL) far exceeded. </p>
<p>“The messaging over the last few years has been just the push towards recreational legalization,” Dr. Ekeh noted. “The problem is that from a public health standpoint, there has not been enough emphasis on some of the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.facs.org/for-patients/preparing-for-surgery/marijuana-and-surgery/" target="_blank" title="Marijuana and Surgery">downsides and the dangers</a> that can occur. People should treat smoking marijuana just like they treat alcohol: don’t smoke and drive.” </p>
