    <h1>Is anyone using Fastmail for their business?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi all,<p>My dad and I run our family business that is highly email reliant. We are currently using GoDaddy&#39;s grandfathered unlimited business email plan (yes, I know), and it&#39;s been pretty bulletproof for around 15 years, but we want a modern web interface and more control. We only need email, calendars, and contacts for 5 users, so Fastmail is an option we are considering.</p><p>Is anyone here using Fastmail for their email-heavy business or profession, and if so, what&#39;s your experience been like? Have you felt restricted by Fastmail&#39;s lack of cloud integrations and other services that Google Workplace and and Microsoft 365 have? Any issues with uptime, deliverability, and support, especially given the latter is email only?</p><p>Any feedback is appreciated!</p></td></div></div>
