    <h1>CIA 2010 covert communication websites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p><span><a href="#_3"><span></span></a></span></p><p>This article is about <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/science#cutout-espionage" title="internal link">covert agent communication channel</a> websites used by the <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/science#central-intelligence-agency" title="internal link">CIA</a> in the late 2000s to early 2010s until they were uncovered by target countries. This discovery led to the imprisonment and execution of several assets in <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/continent#iran" title="internal link">Iran</a> and <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/china" title="internal link">China</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#_7"><span></span></a></span></p><p>So <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/ciro-santilli" title="internal link">Ciro Santilli</a> heard about the 2022 article almost a year after publication, he <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/ciro-santilli-s-projects#ciro-santilli-s-naughty-projects" title="internal link">knew he had to try</a> and find some of the domains himself using the newly availabe information! Given that it was reported that there were &#34;more than 350&#34; such websites, it would be really cool if we could uncover more of those websites ourselves beyond the 8 domains reported by Reuters! Notably, being <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/brazil" title="internal link">Brazilian</a>, <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/ciro-santilli" title="internal link">Ciro Santilli</a> is particularly curious about the existence of a Brazilian-focused website one mentioned in the article, as well as in other <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/social-technology#democracy" title="internal link">democracies</a>. WTF the <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/science#central-intelligence-agency" title="internal link">CIA</a> was doing in Brazil in the early 2010s! Wasn&#39;t the <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/brazil#military-dictatorship-in-brazil" title="internal link">Military dictatorship in Brazil</a> enough!</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#_8"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Here&#39;s the list of probable candidates Ciro has found so far using only rudimentary IP range search on <a href="https://viewdns.info">viewdns.info</a> starting from the websites reported by Reuters, more details on methods below. It is nothing compared to the hundreds of websites reported, so there must be key techniques missing, but the fact that there are no <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/google#google-search" title="internal link">Google Search</a> hits for the domains or IPs indicates that these might not have been previously clearly publicly disclosed.</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#_204"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Some selected screensthos:</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#_205"><span></span></a></span></p><div id="_205"><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/">citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/</a> did an investigation and found 885 such websites, but decided not to disclose the list or methods:
</p><blockquote id="_206"><p>Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/website#internet-archive" title="internal link">Internet Archive</a>&#39;s <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/website#wayback-machine" title="internal link">Wayback Machine</a>, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (<a href="https://cirosantilli.com/science#central-intelligence-agency" title="internal link">CIA</a>) used these sites for covert communication.</p><p>The websites included similar <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/programming-language#java-programming-language" title="internal link">Java</a>, <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/programming-language#javascript" title="internal link">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/programming-language#adobe-flash" title="internal link">Adobe Flash</a>, and CGI artifacts that implemented or apparently loaded covert communications apps. In addition, blocks of sequential IP addresses registered to apparently fictitious US companies were used to host some of the websites. All of these flaws would have facilitated discovery by hostile parties.</p><p>The websites, which purported to be news, weather, sports, healthcare, and other legitimate websites, appeared to be localized to at least 29 languages and geared towards at least 36 countries.</p><p>The bulk of the websites that we discovered were active at various periods between 2004 and 2013. We do not believe that the CIA has recently used this communications infrastructure. Nevertheless, a subset of the websites are linked to individuals who may be former and possibly still active intelligence community employees or assets:</p><div><ul id="_211">
<li id="_212">Several are currently abroad</li>
<li id="_213">Another left mainland China in the timeframe of the Chinese crackdown</li>
<li id="_214">Another was subsequently employed by the US State Department</li>
<li id="_215">Another now works at a foreign intelligence contractor</li>
</ul></div><p>Given that we cannot rule out ongoing risks to CIA employees or assets, we are not publishing full technical details regarding our process of mapping out the network at this time. As a first step, we intend to conduct a limited disclosure to US government oversight bodies.</p></blockquote></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#_217"><span></span></a></span></p><p>The websites were used from at least as early as August 2008, as per Gholamreza Hosseini&#39;s account, and the system was only shutdown in 2013 apparently.</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#_218"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Notably, so as to be less suspicious the websites are often in the language of the country for which they were intended, so we can often guess which country they were intended for!</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#_226"><span></span></a></span></p><div id="_226"><p>Reuters directly reported only two domains in writing:</p><div><ul id="_227">
<li id="_228"><p><a href="http://iraniangoals.com">iraniangoals.com</a>. Iranian language <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/art#football" title="internal link">football</a> website. As of 2023, the domain had been bought by Reuteres and redirects to otheir website.</p></li>
<li id="_232"></li>
</ul></div></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#_237"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Also none of those extra ones have any <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/google" title="internal link">Google</a> hits except for huge domain dumps, so maybe this counts as little bit of novel public research.</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#_238"><span></span></a></span></p><div id="_238"><p>The full lits of domains from screenshots is:</p><div><ul id="_239">
<li id="_240"><div id="_243"><p>The website is entitled:
</p><blockquote id="_244">活跃游戏</blockquote><p>
which means &#34;Lively games&#34;, or &#34;active games&#34; as in the domain name itself.</p></div><p>Available in GoDaddy as of 2023.</p></li>
<li id="_247"><p><a href="https://cirosantilli.com/ciro-santilli" title="internal link">Ciro Santilli</a> actually sent him a message to let him know about the <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/science#central-intelligence-agency" title="internal link">CIA</a> thing in case he didn&#39;t, and he replied that he wasn&#39;t aware of it.</p></li>

<li id="_284">natural sounding, sometimes long-ish, English language domain names with 2 or 3 full words</li>
<li id="_285">shallow websites with a few tabs, many external links, sometimes many images, and few internal pages</li>
<li id="_286">common themes include:<div><ul id="_287">

</ul></div></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#_296"><span></span></a></span></p><p>One promising way to find more of those would be with <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/computer#ip-address" title="internal link">IP</a> searches, since it was stated in the Reuter article that the <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/science#central-intelligence-agency" title="internal link">CIA</a> made the terrible mistake of using several contiguous IP blocks for those website.
