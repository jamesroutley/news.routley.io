A study posited that neurotoxic agents used in pesticide fumigation could be a factor in some of the symptoms experienced.</p><p>Early on, there was concern that Russia or another country may have used some form of directed energy to attack Americans.</p><p>Last year, U.S. intelligence agencies said there was no sign a foreign adversary was involved and that most cases appeared to have different causes, from undiagnosed illnesses to environmental factors.</p><p>While that couldn&#39;t rule out some transient injury when symptoms began, researchers said it&#39;s good news that they couldn&#39;t spot long-term markers on brain scans that are typical after trauma or stroke.</p><p>That &#34;should be some reassurance for patients,&#34; said study co-author Louis French, a neuropsychologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in Maryland. &#34;It allows us to focus on the here and now, to getting people back to where they should be.&#34;</p><h2>Balance issues significant for some</h2><p>A subset, about 28 per cent, of Havana syndrome cases were diagnosed with a balance problem called persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, or PPPD. Linked to inner-ear problems as well as severe stress, it results when certain brain networks show no injury but don&#39;t communicate properly. French called it a &#34;maladaptive response,&#34; much like how people who&#39;ve slouched to alleviate back pain can have posture trouble even after the pain is gone.</p><p>The Havana syndrome participants reported more fatigue, posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression.</p><p>Some patients have accused the government of dismissing their ailments. And in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816534" target="_blank">an editorial</a> in the medical journal JAMA on Monday, one scientist called for more research to prepare for the next such health mystery, cautioning that NIH&#39;s study design plus the limits of existing medical technology could have missed some clues.</p><p>&#34;One might suspect that nothing or nothing serious happened with these cases. This would be ill-advised,&#34; wrote Dr. David Relman of Stanford University. In 2022, he was part of a government-appointed panel that couldn&#39;t rule out that a pulsed form of energy could explain a subset of cases.</p><p>The NIH study, which began in 2018 and included more than 80 Havana syndrome patients, wasn&#39;t designed to examine the likelihood of some weapon or other trigger for Havana syndrome symptoms.</p><p>Chan said the findings don&#39;t contradict the intelligence agencies&#39; conclusions. If some &#34;external phenomenon&#34; was behind the symptoms, &#34;it did not result in persistent or detectable pathophysiologic change,&#34; he said.</p></div></div><p>With files from CBC News</p></div></div></div>
