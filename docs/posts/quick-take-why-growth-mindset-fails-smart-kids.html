    <h1>Quick Take: Why &#39;Growth Mindset&#39; Fails Smart Kids</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Feynman’s son Carl was told by his father that he wasn’t special—the growth mindset approach. Carl, who I’ve met through rationalist circles, said it didn’t work because he IS smart, and smart means better perception. He could clearly observe what he could do that other kids couldn’t. No amount of talking convinces someone otherwise of what they can see.</p>

<p>Trying to invalidate that part of a kid’s experience can mess with them.</p>

<p>The better approach: show him people who are as smart or smarter. This is why gifted education exists—not to stroke egos, but to make kids rise higher naturally. Growth comes toward something, not from denial.</p>

<p>Instead of telling a kid to have a growth mindset, let them develop it by meeting people who challenge them. Being told to be a certain way doesn’t work. Being around people who naturally push your limits does.</p>
