    <h1>Ask HN: Why has no one replaced Ticketmaster?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I constantly see people complaining about ticketmaster with scalping, nasty business tactics, broken interfaces, etc. and they get sued left and right after countless big events.</p><p>Yet even with all that, it seems no competitor has been able to reasonably get off the ground and poise a viable alternative. What gives? What&#39;s their moat/why do they have a monopoly?</p></div></div></div>
