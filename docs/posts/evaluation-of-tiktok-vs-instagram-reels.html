Your engineers lock themselves in a war room, and emerge with 10 experiments designed to increase it. Time passes. Your exec team sees more and more time spent watching videos! They clap their hands and treat themselves to a day of golf.</p><p>And yet each time you launch a change that boosts all your metrics, your 16-year old daughter only rolls her eyes more and more…</p><p>The problem: your app is only used by old people. Your user base loves videos full of dad humor and ads for Metamucil – the exact opposite of teenage cool. So experiments that boost cringe content and annoying baby videos, seemingly successfully, increase watch time; clips of high schoolers lip syncing to Dua Lipa decrease it. You’re stuck in the short-term optimization valley of A/B tests.</p><p>What’s a desperate social media CEO to do?</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/610770ea9c21ff57ccb6a6a9/630eed805be96e0a9e7475d4_CleanShot%202022-08-31%20at%2001.10.57%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Trending on Facebook</figcaption></figure><h2>Meta’s Metrics Paradox</h2><p>Meta is facing existential challenges on all fronts – its first ever quarterly revenue decline, a shift to an unknown Metaverse, and the biggest threat of all: <strong>TikTok</strong>. </p><p>Evidence of the thrash in Menlo Park: a few weeks ago, it launched its standard weapon – a copycat redesign to make Instagram more TikTok-like – only to walk it back after user backlash.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/610770ea9c21ff57ccb6a6a9/630eea9309713058e69c188c_f7a.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Kylie Jenner, feared by social media CEO&#39;s everywhere</figcaption></figure><p>What happened?</p><p>Meta has always been incredibly analytical.

They’d degenerate into The Daily Mail if they did. Instead, they send tens of thousands of query-result pairs to large-scale teams of human raters, who score their relevance and quality directly.</p><p>What if News Feeds and discovery engines did the same? If Instagram could easily ask 1000 human raters to personally evaluate two versions of their feed – one with the TikTok inspiration, and one without – would it have launched its TikTok clone?</p><p>We decided to run this experiment ourselves! Human evaluation of AI systems is a flagship application of our platform, and we asked 100 Surgers to compare the content that TikTok and Instagram Reels delivered into their feeds.</p><p>Which app won in the battle of short-form video content, and why? Let’s dive in.</p><h2>Injecting A Human Touch: Evaluation of TikTok vs. Instagram Reels</h2><p>We asked 100 Gen Z Surgers to open up TikTok and Reels.

Here are Surgers explaining in their own words.</p><p><strong>Surger: Jesus F.</strong></p><p><em>I feel like TikTok&#39;s algorithm understands what I like a lot more than Instagram reels. Instagram reels show me a lot of &#39;garbage&#39; content. Lots of old comedy skits with humor that was relevant on Tiktok months or even years ago. </em></p><p><em>As a part of Gen Z, I relate a lot more with TikTok creators in general. Even the ads on Tiktok don&#39;t bother me as much.</em></p><p><em>Instagram Reels is slowly becoming an inside joke for people my age. When I just want to relax and find funny and genuinely enjoyable content, Tiktok is my first choice.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Surger: Emily S.</strong></p><p><em>TikTok showed me content that was related to my interests, humor, and culture/location. Instagram showed me generic popular videos with thousands of likes.</em></p><p><em>Several Instagram videos were performative and annoying - including, for example, ridiculous content of a woman spinning on a pottery wheel or one womanʻs monthly expenses living in the Bay Area ($10,340) with the caption &#34;being alive is expensive&#34; (which is insensitive to people who struggle to make a living).</em></p><p><em>While I have not been on TikTok in about a year, my &#34;for you&#34; page still gave me content that was related to me and my interests. In a ~5-minute span, I liked plenty of videos on TikTok, while I did not like any videos on Instagram.</em></p><p><em>I also laughed out loud at one of the TikToks, which surprised me!</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Surger: Nicholas H.</strong></p><p><em>While both offer quick videos, Instagram Reels lacks substance. There were many reels that were short, but with no plot - no release of tension, explanation, or punchline. They were simply something to watch. Tiktok, in contrast, offers both short and medium-ish format videos that take you on a journey.</em></p><p><em>Instagram reels seem like bad cropped/bad edited versions of tiktoks. Physically scrolling through reels is more difficult and the sensitivity there isn’t as smooth as tiktok. Reels feels like a cheap copy, in all ways.</em></p><p><em>Content creators also have more of an incentive to post to tiktok than reels, where tiktoks go to die.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Surger: Sharon H.</strong></p><p><em>The videos shown to me on Instagram Reels had a boring sameness to them. TikTok videos were more varied.</em></p><p><em>Instagram Reels seem more interested in showing me videos that it perceives as &#34;cool&#34;, which did not interest me at all and felt off-putting. In contrast, TikTok seems more interested in showing me videos that I would actually like.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Surger: Elizabeth M.</strong></p><p><em>Tik Tok has a much better sense of what I&#39;m into! I got a lot of comedy, beauty, dog content, &#39;day in my life&#39;, etc. Those are all the things I would normally look for while on these kinds of apps!</em></p><p><em>Instagram&#39;s content was definitely more generic. There was a lot of celebrity content, etc that seemed to just be content for my demographic (20-30 year old females) instead of &#39;for you&#39;. There were also lots of mom blogs etc, but I&#39;m not a mother.</em></p><p><em>Tik Tok felt more &#39;easygoing&#39;, like the content was light and there to make you laugh, although I did get some news stories.</em></p><p><em>I also felt like the quality (like video quality itself) was higher on Tik Tok. Several of the Insta Reels I got were grainy/blurry.</em></p><p><em>I also saw a lot of reused content on Instagram Reels that I saw on Tik Tok a long time ago.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Surger: Cynthia M.</strong></p><p><em>I spent almost 20 minutes trying to find one video that made me laugh on reels. While on TikTok I found many that were interesting and funny.</em></p><p><em>Reels had a lot of the same unfunny content that I did not enjoy over and over. Most of them were tiktoks from months ago that people were just reposting as reels. I finally found one reel that made me smile just a little before I gave up.</em></p><p><em>Reels does not seem to have the quality videos that TikTok has. I was very bored on it. Just swiping and swiping trying to find something funny. On the other hand TikTok has figured me out and has a plethora of videos that I love, from funny animals to conspiracy and mundane facts to dark humor.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Surger: Georgeia M.</strong></p><p><em>I find that most of the videos on TikTok are funny, or they move me in some way. I don&#39;t laugh all that easily, but TikTok always has something to make me laugh.</em></p><p><em>I find that Instagram is much more commercial. Most of the reels are ads in disguise or influencers promoting themselves. Instagram is simply not as genuine as TikTok.</em></p><p><em>It seems like TikTok now is what Instagram used to be, before it was monetized to the point where very little is genuine on the platform.</em></p><p><em>Clearly TikTok has its share of influencers as well, but most of the videos are from regular people creating content and playing about with it rather than celebrities and companies like Instagram is. I find TikTok more relatable and less fake. </em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Surger: Vicki S.</strong></p><p><em>TikTok was so much more entertaining and just enjoyable entirely as a whole. I laughed and cried and smiled practically non-stop while on TikTok. I actually even lost track of time on it. </em></p><p><em>On Instagram reels I kept trying to see if I had spent enough time yet. It was actually pretty boring, probably because I&#39;ve used TikTok more and so it was more populated with things I&#39;d look at, whereas Instagram seemed to be all travel destination focused or things that looked like ads. There was nothing funny or emotional. Really it was all just basically informational clips. I prefer to use TikTok much more if I have any time to kill.</em></p><h2>Breaking down TikTok’s advantages</h2><p>Let’s break down why TikTok is winning.
