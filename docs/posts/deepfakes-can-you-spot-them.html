    <h1>Deepfakes, can you spot them?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p> At
                Detect Political Fakes, we will show you  a variety of media snippets
                (transcripts, audio, and videos). Half of the media snippets are
                real statements made by Joseph Biden and Donald Trump. The other
                half of the media snippets are fabricated. The media snippets
                that are fabricated are produced using deepfake technology. We
                are asking you to share how confident you are that a media
                snippet is real or fabricated.
                </p><h2> Instructions </h2>
                <p>
                We will show you a variety of media snippets including
                transcripts, audio files, and videos. Sometimes, we include
                subtitles. Sometimes, the video is silent. You can watch the
                videos as many times as you would like. Please share how
                confident you are that the individual really said what we show.
                If you have seen the video before today, please select the
                checkbox that says “I’ve already seen this video.” And remember,
                half of the media snippets that we present are statements that
                the individual actually said.
                </p>
