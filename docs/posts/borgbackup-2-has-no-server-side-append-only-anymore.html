    <h1>BorgBackup 2 has no server-side append-only anymore</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <task-lists disabled="" sortable="">
    <div>
      <p dir="auto">Some features like append-only repositories rely on a server-side component that enforces them (because that shall only be controllable server-side, not client-side).</p>
<p dir="auto">So, that can only work, if such a server-side component exists, which is the case for borg 1.x ssh: repositories (but not for borg 1.x non-ssh: repositories).</p>
<p dir="auto">For borg2, we currently have:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>fs repos</li>
<li>sftp: repos</li>
<li>rclone: repos (enabling many different cloud providers)</li>
<li>s3/b3: repos</li>
<li>ssh: repos using client/server rpc code similar as in borg 1.x</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">So, only for the last method we have a borg server-side process that could enforce some features, but not for any of the other repo types.</p>
<p dir="auto">For append-only the current idea is that this should not be done within borg, but solved by a missing repo object delete permission enforced by the storage.</p>
<p dir="auto">borg create could then use credentials that miss permission to delete, while borg compact would use credentials that include permission to delete.</p>
