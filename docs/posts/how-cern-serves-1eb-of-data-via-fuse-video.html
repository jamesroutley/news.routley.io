    <h1>How CERN serves 1EB of data via FUSE [video]</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				
				
				<div><p>CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, generates vast amounts of data from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). CERN’s Storage and Data Management Group at the IT department is responsible for managing this data, including its long-term archival on tape, distribution across the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), as well as providing secure and convenient forms of data access to more than 30000 users that need it.</p>
<p>In this talk we will give an overview of the open source projects leveraged by CERN to satisfy the storage needs of the  organization, such as CERNBox and EOS, and discuss some of the unique challenges faced by the high-energy physics community in data storage and management. Additionally, we discuss how FUSE is used to allow users to access data securely from anywhere in the world.</p>
