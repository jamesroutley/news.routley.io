    <h1>Microsoft hosts a security summit but no press, public allowed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>op-ed</span> Microsoft will host a security summit next month with CrowdStrike and other &#34;key&#34; endpoint security partners joining the fun — and during which the CrowdStrike-induced outage that borked millions of Windows machines will undoubtedly be a top-line agenda item. </p>
<p>We won&#39;t know for sure, however, because the summit will be held behind closed doors. It won&#39;t be live-streamed, and Redmond has said members of the press aren&#39;t welcome.</p>
<p>&#34;This event will not be open to press, and the company has nothing else to share at this time,&#34; a Microsoft spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>.</p>

    

<p>In announcing the September 10 Windows Endpoint Security Ecosystem Summit to take place at its Redmond, Washington headquarters, Microsoft Corporate VP Aidan Marcuss <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/08/23/microsoft-to-host-windows-endpoint-security-ecosystem-summit-in-september/">said</a> participants will discuss steps that vendors can take to &#34;improve security and resiliency for our joint customers.&#34; </p>

        


        

<p>Marcuss cited the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike_timeline/">July CrowdStrike fiasco</a> and the &#34;important lessons&#34; learned from that disaster. &#34;Our discussions will focus on improving security and safe deployment practices, designing systems for resiliency and working together as a thriving community of partners to best serve customers now, and in the future.&#34;</p>
<p>While he didn&#39;t specify what these measures might involve, we&#39;d bet that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/29/microsoft_crowdstrike_kernel_mode/">booting security vendors</a> off of the Windows kernel is one of them, and it&#39;s likely to be met with a great deal of pushback from providers.</p>

        

<p>In addition to its fellow software manufacturers, Microsoft will also &#34;invite government  representatives to ensure the highest level of transparency to the community&#39;s collaboration to deliver more secure and reliable technology for all.&#34;</p>
<p>US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who has been very <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/24/microsoft_latest_breach_cozy_bear/">critical of Microsoft&#39;s</a> shoddy security performance while raking in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/04/pentagon_doubling_down_on_microsoft/">billions of dollars</a> in government contracts, didn&#39;t get an invite, we&#39;re told.</p>
<p>So…some friendly government officials and security vendors but no press or members of the public ensure &#34;the highest level of transparency&#34; in Microsoft&#39;s book?</p>

        

<p>We shouldn&#39;t be surprised. Redmond follows a very specific playbook following all of its security snafus. Transparency about what happened, along with concrete measures to actually fix the problem, isn&#39;t part of it.</p>

</ul>
<p>Granted, this latest fiasco is a CrowdStrike — not Microsoft — blunder. But the Windows giant is facing mounting criticism of its own security practices following <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/05/microsoft_government_contracts/">years of breaches</a> by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/06/microsoft_stolen_key_analysis/">Chinese</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/08/microsoft_confirms_russian_spies_stole/">Russian</a> nation-state hackers and teenage <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/21/microsoft_lapsus_breach_probe/">Lapsus$ hoodlums</a> alike.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/15/microsoft_brad_smith_congress/">Microsoft president Brad Smith testified</a> before Congress about his company&#39;s repeated security failings. This was in response to a Homeland Security report blasting the IT giant for allowing Beijing-backed cyberspies to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/28/chinese_hackers_stole_60000_state/">steal</a> tens of thousands of sensitive emails from the Microsoft-hosted Exchange Online inboxes of high-ranking US government officials.</p>
<p>In most of these major mishaps, Microsoft rolls out a shiny new security initiative such as its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative</a> after the most recent Cozy Bear attack.</p>
<p>With this, and all of its carefully cultivated wordy efforts, Redmond <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/SFI-updates-5-1-24.pdf">promises transparency and accountability</a>. But at the same time, it pushes back against things like minimum cybersecurity standards for government technology vendors, as Wyden has previously suggested, and independent audits, which also go a long way in trying to prove transparency and openness.</p>
<p>So do open summits, like the one happening next month. Instead of talking about transparent — or security, for that matter — simply doing it would be a welcome change. ®</p>
