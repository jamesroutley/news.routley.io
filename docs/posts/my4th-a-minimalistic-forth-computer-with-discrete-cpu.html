<b>This page is about My4TH.</b> My4TH (pronounced &#34;my fourth&#34;) is my fourth homebuilt
CPU-less computer after MyCPU, MyNOR and TraNOR. I wanted to build the simplest computer
possible, with a discrete CPU using as few gates and components as possible, running
a Forth operating system.</p>

<p>FORTH is an early programming language developed by Charles H. Moore in the late 1960s.
More developed FORTH on an IBM 1130 minicomputer, which had a 16-bit CPU and only 8 KB of RAM.
To keep things simple and reduce memory consumption, he implemented FORTH as a stack-based
virtual machine using the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). But FORTH is much more than just
a programming language. Because FORTH has a built-in interpreter, compiler and disk
I/O support, a computer running FORTH is also called a &#34;Forth system&#34;. My4TH is such
a Forth system. You can develop and debug your Forth programs directly on My4TH.
You can enter your source code with the built-in text editor and store it in the on-board
EEPROM memory. From there you can compile and run it directly on the My4TH board.</p>

<p>My4TH is based on MyNOR, so it also has a very simple 1-bit NOR gate &#34;ALU&#34;.
Because of the simplicity of the hardware, My4TH cannot interpret Forth code directly.
Instead, it implements an interpreter written in native machine code.
To further increase execution speed, My4TH compiles Forth code into machine code
(&#34;Subroutine Threaded Code&#34;) rather than into intermediate byte code.
