<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>Completed &amp; submitted <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/bookmark-analyzer">CS50P final project</a></li>



<li>Published my <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/review-cs50p-introduction-to-programming-with-python/">CS50P course review</a></li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>It was satisfying to complete CS50P today! I had a goal to finish the course by the end of my batch and I did it.</li>



<li>I did way too many takes of my <a href="https://github.com/jamiepalatnik/bookmark-analyzer">final project</a> demo video—finally took a break to eat lunch and used the first take I did after that.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This project is fairly simple, but I think it is a pretty good synthesis of concepts I worked on in the Python course. I may develop it further and make a web version that has more features and options for organizing bookmarks.</li>
