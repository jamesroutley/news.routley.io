No company has made a perfect smartwatch for people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI">us</a>, so we‚Äôre going to make the exact smartwatch we want. Read the <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back">full story on my blog</a>, but it comes down to 5 key features:</p><ul><li>Always on e-paper screen</li><li>Long battery life</li><li>Simple and beautiful design</li><li>Physical buttons</li><li>Hackable</li></ul><p>No smartwatch on the market since Pebble offers this combination of features‚Ä¶until today!</p><hr/><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-2-01_hero_core_2_duo_34_white.png"/></p><h2>Core 2 Duo</h2><p>I think you might recognize this one üòâ It‚Äôs almost exactly a Pebble 2, upgraded with modern chips and new tricks. Duo is short for ‚ÄòDo-over‚Äô.</p><p><em><strong>Similar to Pebble 2, it features</strong></em></p><ul><li>Ultra crisp 1.26‚Äù black and white e-paper display</li><li>Runs 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfaces</li><li>Lightweight polycarbonate frame in two colour options - White or Black</li><li>Water resistant (targeting IPX8)</li><li>Microphone</li><li>Step and sleep tracking</li><li>Standard 22mm watchstrap</li></ul><p><em><strong>Improvements from Pebble</strong></em> <em><strong>2</strong></em></p><ul><li>30 day battery life (up from 7)</li><li>Nordic nRF52840 BLE chip</li><li>Speaker</li><li>Linear resonance actuator (quieter and stronger than vibrating motor)</li><li>More reliable buttons (up to 30% longer lifetime in testing)</li><li>Barometer and compass sensors</li></ul><p>Since this watch will look and feel just like a Pebble 2, you can refamiliarize yourself with it via<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQh1b_srGM4"> videos</a>, or<a href="https://www.starkinsider.com/2016/10/pebble-2-review-smartwatch-perfected.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> reviews</a>. For people interested in hacking on PebbleOS firmware, we‚Äôre offering an optional JTAG connector. I recommend buying 2 units if you want to hack, just in case!</p><p>Pre-order now for $149 on <a href="http://store.repebble.com/">store.rePebble.com</a>. Starts shipping in July.</p><hr/><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-3-f57e25fb-a9f2-4586-b3e4-cae8a5c6b8e2.png"/></p><h2>Core Time 2</h2><p>This is my dream watch. It‚Äôs everything Pebble Time 2 was going to be and more! </p><p><em><strong>Features:</strong></em></p><ul><li>64-colour 1.5‚Äù e-paper display. Same display as Pebble Time 2 - much more room for text and details (53% bigger and 88% more pixels)</li><li>Runs 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfaces</li><li>Metal frame and buttons (Black/White and likely a 3rd colour option as well)</li><li>30 day battery life (estimate)</li><li>Flat glass lens (less glare and reflections than Pebble Time family curved lens)</li><li>Touch screen</li><li>Heart rate monitor</li><li>Water resistant (targeting IPX8)</li><li>Step and sleep tracking</li><li>Linear resonance actuator (vibrator)</li><li>Microphone and speaker</li><li>Standard 22mm watch strap</li></ul><p>The industrial design is closely based on Pebble 2, which I really love. It‚Äôs slightly bigger to accommodate the larger display. Both the frame and buttons are made of metal (most likely CNC milled aluminum). More details, including final colour options, will be shared later this year. </p><p>Pre-order now for $225 on <a href="http://store.repebble.com/">store.rePebble.com</a>.

This enables all the baseline Pebble features like receiving notifications, timeline, watchfaces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking, etc. </p><p>The really fun part is that most of the existing 10,000+ PebbleOS watchfaces and apps will immediately work on these new watches, though some may try to access web services that no longer exist. Browse the full appstore on <a href="https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/watchfaces">apps.rebble.io</a>.</p><p>Existing apps/faces will show up with a border on Core Time 2 until developers update them, since it has a larger display (200x228 vs 144x168 pixels). Read more about on the <a href="https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/blog/2016/10/11/Emery-SDK-Beta/index.html">old Pebble dev blog</a>.</p><p>We will publish a companion mobile app for Android and iOS. My friend and past Pebble colleague, Steve, recently joined us to lead this effort. He‚Äôs joining crc32, long-time <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/mobile-app/actions/runs/13609363513">Cobble</a> developer, who has been working with me since last summer. We‚Äôll also be working on an updated SDK for creating new PebbleOS watchfaces or apps.</p><h2>Availability</h2><p>These watches will be sold exclusively through <a href="http://store.repebble.com/">store.rePebble.com</a>. Due to limited supply of display inventory, both watches will be manufactured in limited quantities. I highly recommend placing a pre-order - we will be manufacturing fewer watches than the number of people who have signed up on rePebble already! A pre-order secures your watch but gives you flexibility if you change your mind - you can get a full refund at any time up until your watch ships. </p><h2>Project Progress</h2><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-6-group_6.png" alt="Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samples"/></p><p>Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samples</p><p>Schedule-wise, <strong>Core 2 Duo</strong> is quite far along. We‚Äôve already produced dozens of Core 2 Duo watches for testing and development. We‚Äôve tested and confirmed our <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HwdTncx.mp4">button improvements</a>. PebbleOS has been compiled for the new architecture and runs on the watch. All firmware development is open source - you can follow the fun on <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebble-firmware/commits/main/">Github</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922">Discord</a>. Our current schedule calls for shipments to begin in July. </p><p>How are we so far along, given that PebbleOS was only open-sourced in January? Two things helped: a) I took a monetary risk and began product development a bit earlier üòâ,¬†and b) we found a supplier who still had inventory of some Pebble 2 components. </p><p><video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-10-outputjdis.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>Core Time 2 display lighting up! </p><p>For <strong>Core Time 2</strong>, we‚Äôve finished component selection, initial industrial and mechanical design, and found sources for long lead time components. Now, we‚Äôre in the middle of creating the first prototypes. </p><p>The grand irony of hardware development is that software development is usually the slowest part of the project. Not this time! We‚Äôre extraordinarily thankful to Google for open sourcing PebbleOS, which gave us a massive boost.</p><p>We‚Äôll share more details (like Core Time 2 frame colour options) later this year, as we get closer to mass production. Our current schedule shows shipments beginning in December. Follow along on this <a href="https://ericmigi.com/">blog</a>, via <a href="https://repebble.com/signup">email</a>, on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericmigi.com">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi">Twitter</a>.</p><h3>Why were these specific specifications selected?</h3><p>Building a smartwatch is an exhausting (üòÇ) exercise of constraint maximization. Think of it as linear algebra - we‚Äôre solving multiple equations with multiple unknown variables. The primary constraint is display selection. This choice governs the size and shape of the physical design, as well as being the component with the most power drain and biggest cost. Other variables are Bluetooth chip (governs: cost, software compatibility, engineering time), factory selection (cost, quality, speed, risk), sensors (power, cost, software), battery (size, battery life, cost) and more!</p><p>Despite what Pebble‚Äôs second Kickstarter branding proclaimed, solving this inherently requires compromise. It‚Äôs a fine line to walk and generally the data is not 100% known upfront, so it inevitably requires some degree of trusting your gut. </p><p><strong>Touchscreen</strong>: we‚Äôre adding a touchscreen to Core Time 2. Why? Very specifically, I want to add the concept of ‚Äòcomplications‚Äô to watchfaces and widgets. Like on Apple Watch, these complications/widgets will show glanceable information like weather, next calendar event, step count, etc. The touch screen adds the ability to tap on the complication and directly open the associated app. This is much faster to use than opening an app via the button menu, and saves your quick launch (long-press on the buttons) for other apps. The touchscreen may be used for other interactions, like swiping to rapidly scroll down a list, but that will be lower priority. </p><p>Core Time 2 will be the first PebbleOS watch to ship with a touchscreen, but not the first that we designed! In 2015, Pebble designed it into a watch called Cutts (or C2) and did some (very) preliminary software development work to integrate a touchscreen into PebbleOS.</p><p><strong>Battery life</strong>: I‚Äôm really excited that battery life will be increased from 7 days to 1 month! This is due to massive improvements in Bluetooth chip power efficiency over the last 10 years. </p><p><strong>Speaker</strong>: we‚Äôre adding this primarily for potential use in apps that benefit from audio output, like a ChatGPT or other AI agent app. It can‚Äôt easily be used for making voice calls, since the watches will not support Bluetooth Classic (required for headset profiles), but theoretically someone could write a custom voice calling client (eg SIP or something).</p><p><strong>Smartstraps</strong>: neither watch will support smartstraps. Sorry. Most people don‚Äôt even remember this feature even existed, which is kinda the answer to why it will not be supported. RIP.</p><h3>You shouldn‚Äôt get one if‚Ä¶</h3><p><strong>You need a perfectly polished smartwatch.</strong> This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions of watches. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you‚Äôd like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun! Every time you look down at your watch, you will smile üôÇ</p><p><strong>You‚Äôre looking for a fitness or sports watch</strong>. That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre making. From what we hear, Garmin watches are great for runners/cyclists/triathletes!   </p><p><strong>You‚Äôre comparing this to an Apple Watch</strong>. There is NO way for a 3rd party smartwatch to compete with Apple Watch. Apple restricts 3rd parties in major ways - read <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones">my blog post</a> for more information. For example, 3rd party watches on iOS cannot send replies to notifications.   </p><p>These watches are not made for everyone. We want to be upfront with you about what to expect. </p><blockquote><p>Watch images above feature impeccably designed watchfaces from <a href="https://ttmm.is/pebble/">TTMM</a>, including one of my all-time favourites - <a href="https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/57812aa56c21044501000ed5?query=ttmm&amp;section=watchfaces">TTMMBRN</a>.
