        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Tekken is a Japanese fighting game that has been around since the late 80’s. It continues to boast a strong community of players and remains competitive with other leading titles on the market. If you’ve never heard of Tekken before, the video below will give you an idea of what it’s like:</p>

<p><strong>Problem being solved:</strong> Many players learning the game have a hard time understanding how to build tactics and develop a gameplan. Many existing guides online teach players the technical aspects of the game, but fail to provide enough context of how certain moves work in gameplay. Fighting moves are usually taught in isolation and not relative to each other. This project aims to help players compare different moves to better understand them.</p>
<p><strong>Target audience:</strong> Beginners who have some familiarity of Tekken and have already chosen a character to specialize in.</p>
<p><strong>Key objective:</strong> To design a physical visual aid for players to use while learning Tekken. Players are equipped to learn one character and develop a better understanding on how to think about fighting games.</p>
