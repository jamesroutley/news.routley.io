<p>We are so happy to announce that after 6 months some 1.5K+ commits, we are ready to show you a preview of Nyxt 3! As always, there&#39;s a lot of new features (bugs), so your feedback is critical!</p>
<p>This is a test release for everyone to try out before the final release. It contains experimental features and some parts are still unfinished. Please feel free to share your feedback on our <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/releases/tag/3-pre-release-1">Download Nyxt 3 Pre-release 1 here.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The auto-config file is now suffixed with the major version number. This means that upgrading Nyxt to a new major version will ignore the previous auto-configuration (which probably wouldn&#39;t work anyways).</li>
<li>UserScript support (such as GreaseMonkey scripts).</li>
<li>New prompt-buffer fuzzy matching algorithm, hopefully offering more relevant results. (Thanks to <span data-cites="BlueFlo0d">@BlueFlo0d</span>!)</li>
<li>New support for the Gopher and Gemini protocols.</li>
<li>Headless mode available through <code>--headless</code> CLI switch. Initfile becomes the script to run in the headless instance on Nyxt.</li>
<li>New <code>save-input-data</code>, <code>set-input-data-from-saved</code> and <code>set-input-data-from-saved-domain</code> commands to record and restore input fields.</li>
<li>Color-picker support when native-dialogs enabled.</li>
<li>Internal pages are now using the Nyxt URL scheme. They support the Lisp protocol to allow evaluating arbitrary Lisp, for instance from a button click. Internal pages also have a URL now, which means they have history support.</li>
<li>New <code>define-internal-scheme</code> helper to define custom schemes.</li>
<li><code>jump-to-heading</code> command now sort and indent the headings in a natural fashion based on their order on the page.</li>
<li>New <code>next-heading</code> and <code>previous-heading</code> commands to jump between neighboring headings.</li>
<li>New <code>match-port</code> URL designator predicate for auto-mode rules.</li>
<li>New <code>toggle-message-buffer</code> and <code>toggle-status-buffer</code> commands.</li>
<li>New <code>bookmark-frequent-visits</code> mode.</li>
<li>New <code>repeat-key</code> command repeating the provided key as many times as you like.</li>
<li>Revamped <code>lisp-repl</code>. Multiple commands can be run at the same time. Results can be referred to via dynamic variables.</li>
<li>The history-tree buffer links are now clickable and navigate the corresponding buffer to the corresponding history entry.</li>
<li>The source code is now shipped together with Nyxt. This enables to inspect the source of most Nyxt functions.</li>
<li>Slynk is a new dependency and SLY users can now connect to a running Nyxt instance with the <code>start-slynk</code> command. (Thanks to <span data-cites="jgart">@jgart</span>!)</li>
<li>Nyxt-native debugger available via <code>toggle-debug-on-error</code>.</li>
<li>Better Lisp values inspection in <code>describe-*</code> commands and <code>lisp-repl</code>, extensible through <code>value-&gt;html</code> method.</li>
<li>Universal <code>describe-*</code> commands describing things in any Nyxt-accessible package. Available via <code>C-h u</code> key prefix.</li>
<li><code>*after-startup-hook*</code> to attach headless mode actions or configuration to.</li>
<li>New <code>nyxt-unstable</code> <code>*features*</code> when built from source on an untagged commit. A feature with the commit is also added.</li>
<li>New <code>theme</code> library.</li>
<li>Input processing is now easier to customize with <code>command-dispatcher</code> and <code>input-skip-dispatcher</code> slots of <code>window</code>.</li>
<li>The core nyxt packages are now locked to prevent against accidental clobbering from the user side.</li>
<li>New <code>ffi-buffer-load-html</code> and <code>ffi-buffer-load-alternate-html</code>. This is useful to set the buffer content without resorting to expensive JavaScript calls.</li>
<li>General purpose helpers can be found in the <code>nyxt/utilities</code> package.</li>
<li>New <code>nxref</code> Spinneret tag for cross-referencing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the complete change list, please consult the built-in <code>changelog</code> command.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy these new features, and that they help make you more productive. Thanks for reading :-)</p>

<h2 id="a-better-lisp-repl">A better Lisp REPL</h2>
<p>The Lisp REPL now offers completion to help you test things on the fly!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/lisp-repl-completion.png"/></p>
<p>Results in the Lisp REPL are intelligently rendered depending on the data structure they are. A list for example is displayed as a list!</p>

<h2 id="better-symbol-search">Better symbol search</h2>
<p>The new <code>describe-any</code> command allows you to find information about anything regardless of whether it is a function, a class, a slot, or otherwise!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/describe-any.png"/></p>
<h2 id="access-to-the-gopherspace">Access to the Gopherspace!</h2>
<p>With support for Gemini and Gopher, Nyxt is capable of accessing and browsing the alternative (small) web!</p>
