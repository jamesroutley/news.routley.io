						<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I was inspired to write this post because I see a lot of confusion about USB-C and Thunderbolt in general, in particular about limitations, such as “Why can I get 4K @ 60 Hz out of a USB-C to HDMI/DP adapter but not out of a USB-C dock that has those same outputs?”, so I figured I’d explain how USB-C and Thunderbolt work in the hopes that it would help make sense of it all.</p>
<p>The USB-C connector is a very interesting and capable design. The focus for our purposes here is that it has 4 pairs of pins that can be used for various types of traffic in various combinations. I’m going to call each of these 4 pairs a “lane” from here on. And since one of the possible uses for these lanes is DisplayPort traffic, another key bit of information to clarify upfront is that DisplayPort is <strong><span>also</span></strong> divided into lanes; it has been from the beginning. A full-bandwidth DisplayPort connection has always been defined as 4 lanes (all carried on a single cable), so when people say DisplayPort 1.2 supports 4K @ 60 Hz, for example, what they technically mean is <strong>4 lanes</strong> of DP 1.2 can support that type of output.</p>
