I share some features from some tools I&#39;ve discovered in my time-tracking journey.</em></p><span id="continue-reading"></span><hr/><p>Recently, I discovered I had a problem. I would make it to the end of my day and feel incredibly underaccomplished. It wasn&#39;t that I hadn&#39;t done anything, it just felt like I could have accomplished more. So I decided to start tracking how much time I spent on my tasks so that I could see just how many hours I was actually investing on things that mattered to me.</p><p>At this point, a part of me knew I <em>should</em> have just taken out the paper and pencil, marking down when I started and stopped a task, and increase complexity from there as my needs grew. But I was already familiar with a tool for this task, and I knew I would want to digitize these records anyway, so I decided to use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior/">timewarrior</a>.</p><p>I don&#39;t recommend fighting time, it always wins. Combative titles aside, this tool is a delight to use. It has wonderful <a href="https://timewarrior.net/docs/">documentation</a> (both online and off), and the commands are pretty simple to use. It doesn&#39;t bother you with a bunch of configuration up-front, just <code>timew start [&lt;tag&gt;...]</code> and you&#39;re tracking time!</p><p>One of the nice things about using a command-line time-tracking tool like this is that you can get all the granularity of &#34;I launched this application and worked inside it for N-minutes&#34; without granting global tracking measures. By invoking your favorite editor via the command-line, you&#39;re already halfway to tracking your usage with it. By setting an alias for the program you want to track to <code>timew start [&lt;tags&gt;...] &amp;&amp; $program_name &amp;&amp; timew stop</code><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> you will now know exactly how long you spend in your editor (or waiting for <code>cargo build</code> to finish).</p><p>But perhaps one of the nicer things about timewarrior is the way it stores the data.</p><p>Timewarrior stores all of the information you generate as easy to parse plain-text, something I feel people take for granted at times. Maybe this sounds familiar, you&#39;ve come to use and enjoy a service or a program and have become somewhat reliant on it, but something changes that makes it less pleasant to use. You try looking for an alternative only to find that you can&#39;t just pick up your information and move, you&#39;d have to start from scratch. Thankfully this is not the case with timewarrior. This is a sample of the data timewarrior generates and places in an easy to find location (<code>~/.timewarrior/data/</code> in my case):</p><pre data-lang="txt"><code data-lang="txt"><span>inc 20231023T182108Z - 20231023T202734Z # code guix learning
</span><span>inc 20231023T202932Z - 20231023T212625Z # break meal
</span><span>inc 20231023T212625Z - 20231023T222221Z # &#34;coding-career-handbook&#34; reading
</span><span>inc 20231023T223352Z - 20231023T231437Z # chores cleaning dishes
</span></code></pre><p>This format is incredibly easy to parse, I have the freedom to do whatever I want with this data, and that&#39;s a <em>very</em> good thing!</p><p>For more on this topic, check out <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WgV6M1LyfNY">this video</a> from <em>No Boilerplate</em>, someone who inspires me quite a lot.</p><p>One of the other things I find myself doing frequently is setting a timer on my phone to limit how much I browse Zulip, or how long I take solving problems on LeetCode. But using my phone for this is liable to distract me at a time when I&#39;m most vulnerable to distraction. I could always buy an egg timer, but that&#39;s something I won&#39;t always have (or think to carry) on me, nor is it practical to use in say, a coffee shop. So again, I turned to the terminal and discovered <a href="https://github.com/trehn/termdown"><code>termdown</code></a>. Again, delightfully simple to use (the hardest part for me was remembering the name!), just <code>termdown &lt;duration&gt;</code> and you have a large format ASCII timer ticking down the minutes/seconds. It also functions as a stopwatch if you give it no duration, a nice bonus!</p><img alt="Time remaining smoothly rendered in ASCII characters. It reads &#39;4m 42s&#39;" src="https://veryth.ink/blog/cli-timetracking/termdown.png"/><blockquote><p>A screenshot of <code>termdown</code> in action</p></blockquote><p>But of course, you can pair this with <code>timew</code> to track your time allowances in a way that is resilient to interruptions. Similarly as above, you would simply invoke <code>timew start [&lt;tag&gt;...]; termdown &lt;duration&gt; &amp;&amp; timew stop</code>. If you interrupt your timer for any reason, the time spent is still recorded, you don&#39;t have to remember to edit anything, you can rest easy!</p><img alt="A graph rendered in the terminal that represents every hour (x-axis) of every day (y-axis) for one week. Various horizontal bars with short labels populate some of the days indicating time tracked" src="https://veryth.ink/blog/cli-timetracking/timew-week.png"/><blockquote><p>An example of the output from <code>timew day</code></p></blockquote><p>When you&#39;ve tracked your day or week, you can look back on how it went in glorious 256-color output with <code>timew [day|week]</code>. It helpfully shows the total time tracked, what is still available, and the total amount of time available to track in the day/week.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> And if you want to export your activity from any range of time to use elsewhere (in JSON), you can easily accomplish that with the <code>export</code> command (e.g. <code>timew export from 2023-10-26 for 24h</code>). If you&#39;re familiar with <a href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq"><code>jq</code></a> you can easily transform this data however you please, right from the command-line!</p><p>I&#39;m happy to have discovered timewarrior because it makes keeping an account of my time easy and the data it generates is portable, and I&#39;ve only begun to scratch the surface! Now that it&#39;s easy to record how I use my time, my next goal is to discover effective ways to consume the data I generate. If you, dear reader, have gone down this rabbit hole before, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to get in touch with me using any of the methods <a href="https://veryth.ink/about#other-places-to-find-me">here</a>. Or if you&#39;re a recurser, ping me in zulip!</p><div id="1"><p><sup>1</sup></p><p>This doesn&#39;t work if your program automatically backgrounds on invocation!</p></div><div id="2"><p><sup>2</sup></p><p>The total amount of time for a day/week doesn&#39;t usually change on its own, this is changed by setting <a href="https://timewarrior.net/docs/workweek/">exclusion zones</a>. I recommend doing this to automatically truncate runaway tasks you may have forgotten to stop. It also has the nice effect of giving you a more realistic target for tracking coverage.</p></div></section><div><nav><ul><li><a href="https://veryth.ink/tags/tools/">tools</a></li><li><a href="https://veryth.ink/tags/cli/">cli</a></li><li><a href="https://veryth.ink/tags/blaggregate/">blaggregate</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></div></div>
