              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-26054">
                When you’re streaming on YouTube, the video player running on your computer retains a buffer of frames ahead and behind of your current position, so you can skip around easily: the
                darker grey part of the timeline shows which parts of the video are stored on – that is, <em>downloaded</em> to – your computer.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              <em>Buffering</em> is when your streaming player gets some number of frames “ahead” of where you’re watching, to give you some protection against connection issues. If your WiFi wobbles
              for a moment, the buffer protects you from the video stopping completely for a few seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
              But for buffering to work, your computer <em>has</em> to retain bits of the video. So in a very real sense, <em>all</em> streaming <em>is</em> downloading! The buffer is the part
              of the stream that’s downloaded onto your computer right now. The question is: what happens to it next?
            </p>
            <h2>
              All streaming <em>is</em> downloading
            </h2>
            <p>
              So that’s the bottom line: if your computer <em>deletes </em>the frames of video it was storing in the buffer, we call that streaming. If it <em>retains</em> them in a file, we
              call that downloading.
            </p>
            <p>
              That definition introduces a philosophical problem. Remember that Vimeo checkbox that lets a creator decide whether people can (i.e. are allowed to) download their videos? <strong>Isn’t
              that somewhat meaningless if <em>all streaming is downloading</em></strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because if the difference between streaming and downloading is whether their device belonging to the person <em>watching</em> the video deletes the media when they’re done. And in
              virtually all cases, that’s done on the honour system.

                This kind of conversation happens, over the HTTP protocol, <em>all the time</em>. Probably most of the time the browser is telling the truth, but there’s no way to know for certain.

            <p>
              When your favourite streaming platform says that it’s only possible to stream, and not download, their media… or when they restrict “downloading” as an option to higher-cost paid plans…
              they’re relying on the assumption that the user’s device can be trusted to delete the media when the user’s done watching it.
            </p>
            <p>
              But a user who owns their own device, their own network, their own screen or speakers has many, many opportunities to not fulfil the promise of deleting media it after they’ve consumed
              it: to retain a “downloaded” copy for their own enjoyment, including:
            </p>

              <li>Intercepting the media as it passes through their network on the way to its destination device
              </li>
              <li>Using client software that’s been configured to stream-and-save, rather than steam-and-delete, the content
              </li>
              <li>Modifying “secure” software (e.g. an official app) so that it retains a saved copy rather than deleting it
              </li>
              <li>Capturing the stream buffer as it’s cached in device memory or on the device’s hard disk
              </li>
              <li>Outputting the resulting media to a different device, e.g. using a HDMI capture device, and saving it there

            <h2>
              Okay, so I oversimplified (before you say “well, actually…”)
            </h2>
            <p>
              It’s not entirely true to say that streaming and downloading are <em>identical</em>, even with the caveat of “…from the server’s perspective”. There are three big exceptions worth
              thinking about:
            </p>
            <h3>
              Exception #1: downloads can come in any order
            </h3>
            <p>
              When you stream some linear media, you <em>expect</em> the server to send the media in strict chronological order. Being able to start watching <em>before the whole file has
              downloaded</em> is a big part of what makes steaming appealing, to the end-user. This means that media <em>intended for streaming</em> tends to be stored in a way that facilitates that
              kind of delivery. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Media designed for streaming will often be stored in linear chronological order in the file, which impacts what kinds of compression are available.
              </li>
              <li>Media designed for streaming will generally use formats that put file metadata at the <em>start</em> of the file, so that it gets delivered first.
              </li>
              <li>Video designed for streaming will often have frequent keyframes so that a client that starts “in the middle” can decode the buffer without downloading too much data.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              No such limitation exists for files intended for downloading. If you’re not planning on watching a video until it’s completely downloaded, the order in which the chunks arrives is
              arbitrary!
            </p>
            <p>
              But these limitations make the set of “files suitable for streaming” a <em>subset</em> of the set of “files suitable for downloading”. It only makes it challenging or impossible to
              stream some media intended for downloading… it doesn’t do anything to prevent downloading of media intended for streaming.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Exception #2: streamed media is more-likely to be transcoded
            </h3>
            <p>
              A server that’s streaming media to a client exists in a sort-of dance: the client keeps the server updated on which “part” of the media it cares about, so the server can jump ahead,
              throttle back, pause sending, etc. and the client’s buffer can be kept filled to the optimal level.
            </p>
            <p>
              This dance also allows for a dynamic change in quality levels. You’ve probably seen this happen: you’re watching a video on YouTube and suddenly the quality “jumps” to something more
              (or less) like a pile of LEGO bricks<sup><a id="footnote-ref-26049-7" name="footnote-ref-26049-7" href="#footnote-26049-7" title="Of course, if you’re watching The LEGO Movie, what you’re seeing might already look like a pile of LEGO bricks.">7</a></sup>. That’s the result of your device realising that the rate
              at which it’s receiving data isn’t well-matched to the connection speed, and asking the server to send a different quality level<sup><a id="footnote-ref-26049-8" name="footnote-ref-26049-8" href="#footnote-26049-8" title="There are other ways in which the client and server may negotiate, too: for example, what encoding formats are supported by your device.">8</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The server can – and some do! – pre-generate and store all of the different formats, but some servers will convert files (and particularly livestreams) <em>on-the-fly</em>, introducing
              a few seconds’ delay in order to deliver the format that’s best-suited to the recipient<sup><a id="footnote-ref-26049-9" name="footnote-ref-26049-9" href="#footnote-26049-9" title="My NAS does live transcoding when Jellyfin streams to devices on my network, and it’s magical!">9</a></sup>. That’s not necessary for downloads, where the
              user will often want the highest-quality version of the media (and if they don’t, they’ll select the quality they want at the outset, before the download begins).
            </p>
            <h3>
              Exception #3: streamed media is more-likely to be encumbered with DRM
            </h3>
            <p>
              And then, of course, there’s DRM.
            </p>
            <p>
              As streaming digital media has become the default way for many people to consume video and audio content, rights holders have engaged in a fundamentally-doomed<sup><a id="footnote-ref-26049-10" name="footnote-ref-26049-10" href="#footnote-26049-10" title="There’s always the analogue hole, remember! Although in practice this isn’t even remotely necessary and most video media gets ripped some-other-way by clever pirate types even where it uses highly-sophisticated DRM strategies, and then ultimately it’s only legitimate users who end up suffering as a result of DRM’s burden. It’s almost as if it’s just, y’know, simply a bad idea in the first place, or something. Who knew?">10</a></sup>
              arms race of implementing copy-protection strategies to attempt to <em>prevent</em> end-users from retaining usable downloaded copies of streamed media.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take HDCP, for example, which e.g. Netflix use for their 4K streams. To download these streams, your device has to be running some decryption code that only works if it can trace a path
              to the screen that it’ll be outputting to that <em>also</em> supports HDCP, and both your device and that screen promise that they’re definitely only going to show it and not make it
              possible to save the video. And then that promise is enforced by Digital Content Protection LLC only granting a decryption key and a license to use it to manufacturers.<sup><a id="footnote-ref-26049-11" name="footnote-ref-26049-11" href="#footnote-26049-11" title="Like all these technologies, HDCP was cracked almost immediately and every subsequent version that’s seen widespread rollout has similarly been broken by clever hacker types. Legitimate, paying users find themselves disadvantaged when their laptop won’t let them use their external monitor to watch a movie, while the bad guys make pirated copies that work fine on anything. I don’t think anybody wins, here.">11</a></sup>

                The real hackers do stuff with software, but people who just want their screens to work properly in spite of HDCP can just buy boxes like this (which I bought for a couple of quid on
                eBay). Obviously you could use something like this and a capture card to allow you to download content that was “protected” to ensure that you could only stream it, I suppose, too.

            <p>
              Anyway, the bottom line is that <strong>all streaming is, by definition, downloading</strong>, and the only significant difference between what people <em>call</em> “streaming” and
              “downloading” is that when “streaming” there’s an expectation that the recipient will delete, and not retain, a copy of the video. And that’s it.
