<p>This was the second run of the conference. 6 hours, 481 attendees, 28 full talks, 10 lightning talks, &gt;1500 messages in chat.</p>
<p>Operationally it was much better than last time - the <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/2025">postmortem</a> was significantly less mortem. It was somewhat less work too, but still a lot of work, and most of the remaining work is wrangling speakers which feels irreducible.</p>
<p>I still feel that it&#39;s not quite the right thing. Regular conferences are already pulled between serving many conflicting goals. Moving the conference online makes it more accessible but kills all the social goals. I still want to do something like this, but I&#39;m not sure if it will be a conference next time, or if I&#39;ll try to factor the different goals into different events.</p>
<h2 id="zest"><a href="https://github.com/jamii/zest">zest</a></h2>
<p>I made a lot of progress, adding namespaces, recursion, destination types, iteration, compile-time evaluation, reflection, printing, and calling into the self-hosted runtime.</p>
<p>The next big blocker is memory management. I already committed to optional typing, interior pointers, and value semantics, which means that no strategies from existing memory-safe languages work for zest. So I&#39;m off into the woods.</p>
<p>I&#39;m enjoying the slow chipping away at the project, and mostly just need to keep reminding myself that it&#39;s about the journey rather than the destination. Because the destination is yet another hobby programming language - it really doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<h2 id="writing">writing</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t write much this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/the-missing-tier-for-query-compilers/">The missing tier for query compilers</a> came out of a research dive. I was wondering whether it made sense to try to write a commercial query compiler as a plugin for some existing database. In the end I convinced myself that there wasn&#39;t enough mileage in it - sqlite wouldn&#39;t benefit enough because of the dynamic type layout in the storage, and postgres would require interop with multiple versions of other plugins.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-rough-survey-of-compilation-recompilation-and-compile-time-evaluation">A rough survey of compilation, recompilation, and compile-time evaluation</a> was looking at prior art for handling recompilation in zest and culminated in the <a href="https://github.com/jamii/zest/blob/2bbd0750f8b66dac50c6559092d9ddec7019590a/docs/decisions/0001-namespaces-and-imports.md">namespace design</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/sql-needed-structure/">SQL needed structure</a> continues a long chain of thought about the role of query languages and how they&#39;ve evolved over the last half-century.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consulting">consulting</h2>
<p>I had two gigs this year.</p>
<p>The first gig was a few weeks reviewing a new query language. I ended up writing 8000 words picking through design tweaks and uncovering performance problems. It was a lot of fun and I got the impression it was useful feedback.</p>
<p>The second gig was a few months of performance engineering in a big go codebase. It was challenging finding a loose end to pull on. I ended up dropping the median latency by ~4x, and the p100 latency somewhat more (the p100 was hard to measure precisely because the workloads were so variable day-to-day). But I felt like I should have been able to do more if my strategy was better. I went down a couple of rabbit-holes too eagerly when there was lower-hanging fruit available, and I barely spent any time coaching the team that was going to be responsible for performance after I left.</p>
<p>This was my second experience of performance engineering in go though, and it left me with some <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/log/0054/#go-value-types">strong opinions</a> about language design to carry over to zest.</p>

<h2 id="jams">jams</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t write much the last year or two. I miss it, but I just haven&#39;t been that excited to write anything. I&#39;ve also been suffering from one-big-project syndrome - most of my thinking time went into zest, but progress is slow and unexciting.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been frustrated by that, but putting more time into zest doesn&#39;t seem to increase the rate at which solutions materialize in my mind. So I think the way forward is to just let it take as long as it needs, and to put other smaller projects in the foreground. More experiments and explainers, like <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/making-live-repls-behave">making live repls behave</a> and <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consistency-in-streaming-systems/">internal consistency in streaming systems</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sponsors">sponsors</h2>
<p>I&#39;m also thinking about how to bring my <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jamii/">sponsors</a> up again. It&#39;s never going to be as lucrative as consulting, but it&#39;s much better aligned with the things that I like doing and that seem worth doing. When I was focusing on it full-time I got over $3k/month which is approaching a livable income, but after a brief stint at tigerbeetle and then focusing on zest it&#39;s dropped to $750/month, and honestly I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s even that high.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have any immediate plans. The first step has to just be getting back into the cadence of small fun projects to share with people. We&#39;ll see were we go from there.</p>
<h2 id="chaos">chaos</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve also been a little boring over the last two years. I didn&#39;t do any weird experiments like <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/2022/#office-hours">holding office hours</a>. I didn&#39;t travel to conferences or start new hobbies. I said no to invites and cold calls. I over-optimized.</p>
<p>The thing about optimizing is that it didn&#39;t really work. I didn&#39;t make more progress on the few things that I focused on, at the exclusion of all else. I just liquesced.</p>
<p>This year I want to do the opposite. More experiments. More travel. Say yes to more offers. Add more chaos to my life. Make more memories.</p>
