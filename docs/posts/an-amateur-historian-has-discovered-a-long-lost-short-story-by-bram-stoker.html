    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>An amateur historian has discovered a long-lost short story by Bram Stoker, published just seven years before his legendary gothic novel Dracula.<!-- --></p><p>Brian Cleary stumbled upon the 134-year-old ghostly tale while browsing the archives of the National Library of Ireland.<!-- --></p><p>Gibbet Hill was originally published in a Dublin newspaper in 1890 - when the Irishman started working on Dracula - but has been undocumented ever since.<!-- --></p><p>Stoker biographer Paul Murray says the story sheds light on his development as an author and was a significant “station on his route to publishing Dracula”.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The ghostly story tells the tale of a sailor murdered by three criminals whose bodies were strung up on a hanging gallows as a warning to passing travellers.<!-- --></p><p>It is set in Gibbet Hill in Surrey, a location also referenced in Charles Dickens’ 1839 novel Nicholas Nickleby.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Cleary made the discovery after taking time off work following a sudden onset of hearing loss in 2021 - during which period he would pass the time at the national library in <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-51053870">Stoker&#39;s native Dublin.<!-- --></a></p><p>In October 2023, the Stoker fan came across an unfamiliar title in an 1890 Christmas supplement of the Daily Express Dublin Edition.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Clearly told the AFP news agency: &#34;I read the words Gibbet Hill and I knew that wasn&#39;t a Bram Stoker story that I had ever heard of in any of the biographies or bibliographies.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>“And I was just astounded, flabbergasted.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;I sat looking at the screen wondering, am I the only living person who had read it?”<!-- --></p><p>He said of the moment he made the discovery: “What on earth do I do with it?”<!-- --></p><p>The library&#39;s director Audrey Whitty said Mr Cleary called her and said: &#34;I’ve found something extraordinary in your newspaper archives - you won’t believe it.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>She added that his &#34;astonishing amateur detective work&#34; was a testament to the library&#39;s archives.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;There are truly world-important discoveries waiting to be found&#34;, she said.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After his initial sleuthing, Mr Cleary contacted biographer Paul Murray - who confirmed there had been no trace of the story for over a century.<!-- --></p><p>He said 1890 was when he was a young writer and made his first notes for Dracula.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a classic Stoker story, the struggle between good and evil, evil which crops up in exotic and unexplained ways,&#34; he added.<!-- --></p><p>Gibbet Hill is being published alongside artwork by the Irish artist Paul McKinley by the Rotunda Foundation - the fundraising arm of Dublin&#39;s Rotunda Hospital for which Mr Cleary worked.<!-- --></p><p>All proceeds will go to the newly formed Charlotte Stoker Fund - named after Bram Stoker’s mother who was a hearing loss campaigner - to fund research on infant hearing loss.<!-- --></p><p>The discovery is also being highlighted in the city&#39;s Bram Stoker festival later this month.<!-- --></p></div></div>
