    <p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>It’s been a busy winter for me so I thought I’d check in with you all to share some things I’ve been up to.</p>

<p>In the melodica realm, <a href="https://mdbq.org/">the Quartet</a>’s re-debut in November was a big success. We had so much fun sharing buzzy music with a full house of friends and nerds. We took some time off over the winter but recently we’re back to work on some very exciting and <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Prelude_and_Fugue_in_E-flat_major%2C_BWV_552_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)">ambitious</a> repertoire. We’re hoping to have an open-invite jam party next month and a proper concert in May.</p>

<p>I’m starting to rebalance my time from melodica back to poetry, but before that I want to share what I’ve found over the past 2ish years of practicing this funny instrument altogether too much. I’ve finally started putting out a short series of videos called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvMa21ktcHs&amp;list=PLZ988hPAEWBFnJdoTfEd0u4hqP8KbrRDA">Melodica in Depth</a>, which goes over advanced melodica techniques I don’t believe are documented elsewhere. And I’m very excited to say that just yesterday I finished recording the complete Bach cello suites on melodica; this will be coming out as both my first studio album and a series of videos this spring which I can’t wait to share!</p>

<p>In the music technology realm, my graphical notation programming library <a href="https://neoscore.org/">Neoscore</a> has been seeing growing interest. In May I’ll be giving a workshop introducing it at the <a href="https://tenorboston23.sites.northeastern.edu/">TENOR conference</a> in Boston, and a couple great composers will be premiering works using it. As someone who’s worked on open source projects for my personal use for a long time, it’s very surreal and gratifying to see other people actually using my work, and even contributing back to it with code and bug reports!</p>

<p>In the poetry realm, I’ve been invited to be a panelist at the <a href="https://www.unboundbookfestival.com/">Unbound Book Festival</a> in Columbia, MO next month. They want me to talk about AI in art, an auspicious topic since they pitched this <em>before</em> ChatGPT came out. Increasingly these days I’m worried about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence">the existential threats of AI</a> and considering whether artists should be taking a firm stance against it. If you have thoughts on this I’d love to talk.</p>

<p>I’ve started a strict regimen of work on my “chancelation” of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>, chancelating one poem-chapter per week. At this rate I should be done in a little over a year. I can’t overstate how spiritually fulfilling it’s been to study this ancient text so deeply. Every day I understand less, and every day the sun is a little brighter. As I sign off, please enjoy this crystallization of chapter 58 I just found:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a ruler is dazed and reserved,</p>

  <p>Disaster is that on which prosperity depends.</p>

  <p>Thus the Sage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Love,
Andrew</p>
