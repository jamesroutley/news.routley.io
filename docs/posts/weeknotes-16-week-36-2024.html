<li>applied for <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2024/aug/19/microgrants-2024/">a rhizome microgrant</a> today! there&#39;s still a little time if you want to.</li>
<li>signed up to do <a href="https://biancapereira.gumroad.com/l/100-days-of-note-taking">100 days of notetaking</a>. you should join me if you also wish that you wrote things down, or you want to have more ideas!!</li>
<li>yes, neither were last week but i think when you aren&#39;t posting these on a regular cadence/are a human weeks often blur into one solid mass without careful attention, so I&#39;m allowing things to flow a little more. anything that happened after last week&#39;s entry is fair game.</li>
<li>did i tell you i&#39;m giving a talk? <a href="https://webdevconf.com/events/2024/">be there or be square</a>, i&#39;ll be talking about building better webs.</li>
<li>i find it wonderful that online friends have started sending me memes about undersea cables. i love them (the friends and the cables).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/oluonline/shark-cables.png" alt="at the top half of the meme, there&#39;s a swimming shark in the sea and the words &#34;he doesn&#39;t know what the internet is&#34;. the bottom half of the meme has a shark biting a subsea cable and says &#34;but he knows what it tastes like&#34;."/></p>
<ul>
<li>sorta back on the chessmaxxing train. at the very least i don&#39;t find chess distressing to contemplate + am trying to get better again. if you want to play i&#39;m oluonline on chess.com and also terrible (hi terrible, i&#39;m dad). i had my first ranked game since being back to it, i play 30 min games, and my opponent told me to hurry up. then my laptop shut down due to forgetting to charge it before getting immersed and i lost for leaving the game. auspicious!</li>
