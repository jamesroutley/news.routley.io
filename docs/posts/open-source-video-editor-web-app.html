    <h1>Show HN: Open-Source Video Editor Web App</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey everyone, for the past like six months I&#39;ve been working on a portfolio project. I got tired of doing easy projects, so I decided to tackle something bigger and more challenging. That&#39;s when I came up with the idea of a video editor. This piece of work is intended to showcase my skills and land me a job, but I like to think when working on projects that my idea is so cool that people will like to use it, and I treat every project like a startup idea. Also I havent seen many open source video editors especially on web so that was one of the points why I decided to make that and not something else, but in the end its learning experience and im not expecting much if at all.</p><p>A bit about the video editor itself:</p><p>-website: <a href="https://omniclip.app/" rel="nofollow">https://omniclip.app/</a></p><p>-its free</p><p>-its open source (MIT Licensed)</p><p>-its using Webcodecs API for quick rendering</p><p>-works fully inside browser, client side, no private data is kept</p><p>-I made some readme with more details, im not expecting contributions but I added bit about it: <a href="https://github.com/aegir-assembly/omni-clip">https://github.com/aegir-assembly/omni-clip</a></p><p>Features:</p><p>-Trimming</p><p>-Splitting</p><p>-Supports - Text, Audio, Video (mp4) and Images</p><p>-Clip editing on preview - rotating, resizing, text styling and more</p><p>-Undo/Redo</p><p>-Render in different resolutions, up to 4k.</p><p>Things to know before using this editor:</p><p>-it is simple editor, but its my main project im working on and improving it.</p><p>-right now it only works with videos 25 fps and more but not less</p><p>-only 4 tracks -- its something I could improve quickly but forgot</p><p>-bug here and there (eg. filmstrip not rendering until timeline scroll moved)</p><p>-its not working on phones yet (drag and drop API problems)</p><p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on it.</p></div></div></div>
