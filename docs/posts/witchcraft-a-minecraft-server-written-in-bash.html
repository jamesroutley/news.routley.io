    <h1>Witchcraft â€“ a Minecraft server, written in Bash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>My thoughts on writing a Minecraft server from scratch (in Bash)</h3>
<p>For the past year or so, I&#39;ve been thinking about writing a Minecraft server in Bash as a thought excercise. I once tried that before with the Classic protocol (the one from 2009), but I quickly realized there wasn&#39;t really a way to properly parse binary data in bash. Take the following code sample:</p>

<p><code>function a() {
	read -n 2 uwu
	echo &#34;$uwu&#34; | xxd
}
</code></p><p>This would read two bytes into a variable, and then pass them to `xxd`, which should show the hexdump of the data.</p>

<small>Picture 1 - bash&#39;s lack of support for nullbytes</small></p><p>Everything&#39;s great, until we pass a nullbyte (0x00). Not only does Bash ignore nullbytes in strings, it also doesn&#39;t present any way to detect that a nullbyte has occured. Considering that the protocol I&#39;m trying to implement is strictly binary, this can severely mangle the data.</p>
