      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hello friends at HN
For the past 3 years we have been arranging our physical textbook series and the first one has been published.<p>You can view sample chapters and see that the book is printed on premium, photo-quality paper here:</p><p><a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/book-1" rel="nofollow">https://japanesecomplete.com/book-1</a></p><p>In true hacker ethos, Japanese Complete was a project started to address a need the founders had and now it’s turning into a tangible product so it is quite exciting for us and we appreciate your continued support.</p><p>All the material in the first book is available with a free online account on our online curriculum, only that it is much more beautifully laid out for convenient look-up in the book.  A much more compelling representation down to the feel of the cover and the weight of the text in your hands like fine silverware.</p><p>Please only get the book if you can afford it,  because as mentioned you can also get the same course material with a starter account at no cost to you.</p><p>We developed a lot of innovations for teaching and acquiring Japanese rapidly and to-remember.  Please ask any (sincere) questions here.</p></td></tr>
