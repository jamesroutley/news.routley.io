<p>
This is the homepage for the home-built computers web-ring.
</p>

<h2>The Charter</h2>
<p>
The ring is open to any computer project featuring a home-built CPU. That CPU
may emulate a commercial design, but it cannot be just an off-the-shelf chip.
</p>
<p>
The design must have been (at least partially) built in &#34;real&#34;
hardware: paper designs and simulations don&#39;t cut it :-)</p>

<h2>Copyrights</h2>
<p>
I often get asked for permission to reproduce data from one or more of the
Ring projects. I merely maintain the ring: all intellectual property remains
with the various project builders. Please contact them directly (email
contacts on this page) if you want to use their content.
</p>

<h2>The Projects</h2>
<p>
Click on any of the images below, to go to that project. From there, you can
navigate back and forth in the ring.</p>



<h3>Join the ring?</h3>
To join the Homebuilt CPUs ring, drop Warren
<a href="mailto:cpuring@tuhs.org">a line</a>,
mentioning your page&#39;s URL. He&#39;ll then add it to the list.
<p>
<i>Note</i>: The ring is chartered for projects that include a home-built
CPU. It can emulate a commercial part, that′s OK. But actually using that
commercial CPU doesn′t rate. Likewise, the project must have been
at least partially built: pure paper designs don′t rate either. 
It can be built using any technology you like, from relays to FPGAs.
