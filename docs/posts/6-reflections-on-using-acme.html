    <h1>6. Reflections on using Acme</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve been using the Acme text editor for over 4 years now. I thought
it might be fun to reflect on it a bit.</p>

<h2>Plan9port not Acme</h2>

<p>It sounds simpler to say I use Acme, but I&#39;m really using
<a href="https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/">plan9port</a>. Plan9port is a graft
of parts of the Plan 9 operating system that lets you enjoy a part of
the Plan 9 experience without actually running Plan 9 on your
computer. Nowadays there are ways to run Plan 9 but it&#39;s more for
enthusiasts than for doing your daily job, I think.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m using plan9port which is a graft of Plan 9 onto (in my case)
macOS and Linux. And for me the centerpiece of this is Acme.</p>

<h2>What is Acme</h2>

<p>Acme is a minimal but powerful text editor. When I say &#34;text editor&#34; I
mean an editor for programming, not a word processor.</p>

<p>Things that make it minimal: all text is monochrome. The color theme
is fixed (to something similar to &#34;solarized light&#34;). There is no way
to show line numbers in your file. There are very few keyboard short
cuts and you cannot customize them. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Things that make it powerful: the built in editing language that lets
you write sed-like commands to modify text in windows. The text-based
file-like API for modifying windows and their contents
programmatically, if you want to. Smooth integration between the text
in your windows and Unix-style filter commands.</p>

<p>I am writing this note in Acme. Right now I have a bunch of paragraphs
that are on one line and I want to line-wrap them. To do this I write
an editor command: <code>Edit ,|fmt</code>. Now I select that text with my mouse
and I middle-click it (Alt-click on my Macbook).</p>

<p>After the middle-click the text in the window has been replaced by a
wrapped copy of itself.</p>

<p>It feels like shell scripting but I&#39;m inside a text editor.</p>

<h2>Acme as a terminal emulator</h2>

<p>Before I started using Acme I was already a fan of programming using a
relatively &#34;dumb&#34; text editor combined with a Unix shell in a terminal
emulator. The usual alternative is to use an Integrated Development
Environment.</p>

<p>Because Acme is so minimal it is very much a &#34;dumb text editor&#34; so you
need a terminal to go with it. Fortunately it comes with one: <code>win</code>.
Win is a program that sits between an Acme window and a shell. When I
type into a <code>win</code> window and press enter, the line I wrote gets fed to
standard input of the shell. The output of the shell gets rendered in
the Acme window.</p>

<p>This makes for a very different terminal experience compared to macOS
Terminal.app or Linux xterm. You can&#39;t use ncurses-based applications
or anything that expects to run in a proper terminal. For example if I
run <code>vim</code> in an Acme <code>win</code> window it prints garbage and it&#39;s unusable.
Another important difference is that a <code>win</code> terminal does not support
ANSI color codes. After all all text in Acme is monochrome. This means
that whenever a program tries to create colored terminal output I see
ANSI garbage: non-printable characters combined with <code>[</code> and numbers.</p>

<p>This is all quite spartan and I make all sorts of efforts with helper
shell scripts and shell functions to disable and suppress colored
output where I can. But the reward is a terminal that integrates very
very well into the editor.</p>
