<p>
On
<strong>August 8th, 2022</strong>
, RedisToGo will be shutting down its managed Redis service. In order to avoid any service interruptions, we recommend beginning a migration plan as soon as possible.
</p>
<h2>HOW DOES THIS IMPACT ME?</h2>
<p>
After
<strong>
August 8th, 2022
</strong>
, RedisToGo instances will be shut off. To avoid application disruption, you will need to migrate your data to another Redis-as-a-Service provider.
</p>
<h2>WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?</h2>
<p>With any deprecation of service, we recognize the need to provide other options as viable replacements.  Our support team is prepared to help you with the following options:</p>
<p>ObjectRocket for Redis offering. You would receive the same level of service on your database instance(s), but the instance(s) would need to reside in one of these locations: N. Virginia (IAD), Dallas (DFW), Chicago (ORD), London (LON)</p>
<p>
Please note, ObjectRocket Redis
<strong>
DOES NOT
</strong>
have a free tier plan available.  More information about the ObjectRocket Redis offering can be found on our website at: <a href="https://www.objectrocket.com/managed-redis/">https://www.objectrocket.com/managed-redis/</a>

<p>If you decide to move to another Redis-as-a-Service provider, you can download a backup of your instance(s) by following the steps listed via this link: <a href="https://redistogo.com/documentation/backup">https://redistogo.com/documentation/backup</a></p>
