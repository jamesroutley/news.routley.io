    <h1>Show HN: The full source code and assets for my custom game engine and game</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I always enjoy reading posts about indie game development and looking at the source code of games other people have built. So for any game I release I naturally I want to do the same.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Mknsri/HockeySlam">https://github.com/Mknsri/HockeySlam</a></p><p>Hockey Slam is a hockey shootout game on Android which I built almost from scratch. Some of the engine features include 3D graphics with PBR materials, a rudimentary physics system, replays, a multithreaded job system and a hot-reload DLL platform for developing on Windows.</p><p>I detailed the creation of the game in it&#39;s own post, but now that time has passed I am releasing the source code and assets under the MIT license. You can still find the making of here: <a href="https://hockeyslam.com/makingof" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://hockeyslam.com/makingof</a></p><p>I&#39;m happy to answer any questions you might have.</p></div></div></div>
