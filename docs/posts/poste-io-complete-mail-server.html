    <h1>Poste.io â€“ Complete Mail Server</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
            SMTP + IMAP + POP3 + Antispam + Antivirus</p>

            <h3><span></span> Fast deployment</h3>
            <p>
                You can have a fully functional mail server installed in a few minutes, mostly waiting for scripts to do the work. The whole package is designed with reasonable defaults to get you up and running quickly, without having to know the internals and without making decisions that could break the email system.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><span></span> Data has its own volume</h3>
            <p>
                User data and configuration is strictly separated from binaries. User database is stored in SQLite database - in file. This makes <strong>Poste.io</strong> fully compatible with external storage. Migration, backups or updates are therefore very easy and mostly consist of files manipulation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><span></span> Security</h3>

            <p><strong>Poste.io</strong> has been built from the ground up with security in mind. Internet history is littered with painful security incidents, so we traded old email client compatibility and insecure authentication methods for features that meet today&#39;s for features that meet modern security requirements.

    </div>

   <p>Installing a full-featured mail server from open source components is no easy task - see diagram. Making the necessary plumbing with easy to use web administration is another challenge.  Installing Poste.io consists of three simple steps and takes only a few minutes to get a full featured, robust email server up and running.
