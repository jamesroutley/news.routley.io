    <h1>Poste.io â€“ Complete Mail Server</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
            SMTP + IMAP + POP3 + Antispam + Antivirus</p>

            <h3><span></span> Fast deployment</h3>
            <p>
                You can have full-featured mailserver installed in couple minutes mostly waiting until script get job
                done. Whole package was designed with sane defaults to start quickly without knowing internals and
                without doing decisions which can break e-mail system.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><span></span> Data has its own volume</h3>
            <p>
                User data and configuration is strictly separated from binaries. User database is stored in SQLite
                database - in file. Therefore <strong>Poste.io</strong> can be fully used with external storages. Migration, backups
                or updates are therefore very easy and mostly consist of files manipulation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><span></span> Security</h3>

            <p><strong>Poste.io</strong> is created since beginning with security in mind. Internet history is full of painful security
                incidents, so we traded old email clients compatibility and insecure authentication methods for features
                which fits modern security requirements.

   <p>Installing full featured mail server from Open Source components is not simple task - see schema. Making the necessary plumbing with easy to use web administration is
        another challenge. Installation of poste.io consists of three easy steps and couple minutes to
        have ready to use full featured robust email server.
