It plays a key role in storytelling by enhancing the film’s depth and contributing to its realism. However, film grain is as elusive as it is beautiful. Its random nature makes it notoriously difficult to compress. Traditional compression algorithms struggle to manage it, often forcing a choice between preserving the grain and reducing file size.</p><p id="b381">In the digital age, noise remains a ubiquitous element in video content. Camera sensor noise introduces its own characteristics, while filmmakers often add intentional grain during post-production to evoke mood or a vintage feel. These elements create a visually rich experience that tests conventional compression methods.</p><p id="177f">We’re giving members globally a transformed streaming experience with the recent rollout of AV1 Film Grain Synthesis (FGS) streams. While FGS has been part of the AV1 standard since its inception, we only enabled it for a limited number of titles during <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-av1-streaming-to-netflix-members-tvs-b7fc88e42320" target="_blank" data-discover="true">our initial launch of the AV1 codec in 2021</a>. Now, we’re enabling this innovative technology at scale, leveraging it to preserve the artistic integrity of film grain while optimizing data efficiency. In this blog post, we’ll explore how FGS revolutionizes video streaming and enhances your viewing experience.</p><p id="3ec2">The AV1 Film Grain Synthesis tool models film grain through two key components, with model parameters estimated before the encoding of the denoised video:</p><p id="fefa"><strong>Film Grain Pattern</strong>: an <em>auto-regressive (AR) model</em> is used to replicate the pattern of film grain. The key parameters are the AR coefficients, which can be estimated from the residual between the source video and the denoised video, essentially capturing the noise. This model captures the spatial correlation between the grain samples, ensuring that the noise characteristics of the original content are accurately preserved. By adjusting the auto-regressive coefficients {ai}, the model can control the grain’s shape, making it appear coarser or finer. With these coefficients, a 64x64 noise template is generated, as illustrated in the animation below. To construct the noise layer during playback, random 32x32 patches are extracted from the 64x64 noise template and added to the decoded video.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><picture><source srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" type="image/webp"/><source data-testid="og" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*uNAjI0TwiFlfclpC 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"/><img alt="" width="700" height="291" loading="lazy" role="presentation"/></picture></div></div><figcaption>Fig. 1 The synthesis process of the 64x64 noise template using the simplest AR kernel with a lag parameter L=1.

Consequently, the film grain strength is adapted to the areas of the picture, closely recreating the look of the original video.

The standard does not mandate a specific method for this step, allowing users to choose their preferred denoiser. Following the denoising, the video is compressed, and the grain’s pattern and intensity are estimated and transmitted alongside the compressed video data. During playback, the film grain is recreated and reintegrated into the video using a block-based method. This approach is optimized for consumer devices, ensuring smooth playback and high-quality visuals. For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the <a href="https://norkin.org/pdf/DCC_2018_AV1_film_grain.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">original paper</a>.</p><p id="e365">By combining these components, the AV1 Film Grain Synthesis tool preserves the artistic integrity of film grain while making the content “easier to compress” by denoising the source video prior to encoding. This process enables high-quality video streaming, even in content with heavy grain, resulting in significant bitrate savings and improved visual quality.</p><p id="d1b0">In our pursuit of premium streaming quality, enabling AV1 Film Grain Synthesis has led to significant bitrate reduction, allowing us to deliver high-quality video with less data while preserving the artistic integrity of film grain. Below, we showcase visual examples highlighting the improved quality and reduced bitrate, using a frame from the Netflix title <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80996324" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>They Cloned Tyrone</em></a>:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="2e2e">The visual comparison highlights a significant bitrate reduction of approximately 66%, with regular AV1 encoding at 8274 kbps compared to AV1 with FGS at 2804 kbps. In this example, which features strong film grain, it may be observed that the regular version exhibits distorted noise with a discrete cosine transform (DCT)-like pattern. In contrast, the FGS version preserves the integrity of the film grain at a lower bitrate.</p><p id="0d0a">Additionally, synthesized noise effectively masks compression artifacts, resulting in a more visually appealing experience. In this comparison below, both the regular AV1 stream and the AV1 FGS stream without synthesized noise (equivalent to compressing the denoised video) show compression artifacts. In contrast, the AV1 FGS stream with grain synthesis (rightmost figure) improves visual quality through contrast masking in human visual systems. The added film grain, a form of mask, effectively conceals some compression artifacts.</p></div></div><div><div><p id="5092">Currently, we lack a dedicated quality model for film grain synthesis. The noise appearing at different pixel locations between the source and decoded video poses challenges for pixelwise comparison methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">PSNR</a> or <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" href="https://netflixtechblog.com/toward-a-practical-perceptual-video-quality-metric-653f208b9652" target="_blank" data-discover="true">VMAF</a>, leading to penalized quality scores. Despite this, our internal assessment highlights the improvements in visual quality and the value of these advancements.</p><p id="2281">To evaluate the impact of AV1 Film Grain Synthesis, we selected approximately 300 titles from the Netflix catalog, each with varying levels of graininess. The bar chart below illustrates a 36% reduction in average bitrate for resolutions of 1080p and above when AV1 film grain synthesis is enabled, highlighting its efficacy in optimizing data usage. For resolutions below 1080p, the reduction in bitrate is relatively small, reaching only a 10% decrease, likely because noise is filtered out during the downscaling process. Furthermore, enabling the film grain synthesis coding tool consistently introduces syntax overhead to the bitstream.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><picture><source srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" type="image/webp"/><source data-testid="og" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*fVfNc9DIh878py8G 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"/><img alt="" width="700" height="296" loading="eager" role="presentation"/></picture></div></div><figcaption>Fig. 3: Comparison of average values across resolution categories between regular AV1 streams (without film grain synthesis) and AV1 streams with film grain synthesis enabled.</figcaption></figure><p id="1e09">Finally, we conducted A/B testing prior to rollout to understand the overall streaming impact of enabling AV1 Film Grain Synthesis.
