<p>What is it?  Again, I’m working through my time at RC backward, but the most relevant part of this one is - its mostly shaders, creating roughly 4 different flavors/frequencies of noise, mostly simplex.  The background is a displaced grid of rhombuses, and I was surprised to find out that simplex noise has weird discontinuities if you quantize it in the x and y dimension, so I just used a sum of sines instead, per Bruce Hill’s <a href="https://blog.bruce-hill.com/hill-noise">hill-noise<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>.</p>
<p>The code is really messy but it’s <a href="https://github.com/rwhaling/blue_noises">here<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>.  The border is composed of a high-frequency noise that’s added in a lower amplitude to the whole image, I find that it adds a “metallic” physicality to the visuals that I really like?  Without it they look “plasticy” - someone told me it reminded them of Austin Powers.</p>
<p>The foreground hexagon is composed of canvas line drawing.  I’m iterating over the x axis of the screen one pixel at a time, deciding whether to draw a vertical line of some length, and then drawing that to a canvas - and then I take that canvas, display it with more noise, and then use that texture to look up which of two gradients to use for the final display step.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading Ramsey Nasser’s <a href="https://nas.sr/text/livecoding-scanlines-on-the-gpu/">post on his video synth, DiMattina<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>, and the Rutt-Etra video synth that inspired it, and realizing that this technique of displacing and coloring line drawings with WebGL has a really vast amount of depth in it.</p>
<p>There is a (probably very buggy/unpolished) version of this online if someone wants to play with it or try a few different color palettes: <a href="https://whaling.dev/blue_noises/">https://whaling.dev/blue_noises/<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></p>
<p>The IG version of this has music from an ORCA patch similar to <a href="https://blog.whal.ing/blog/lissajous_two" data-slug="blog/lissajous_two">lissajous_two</a>.  I’ll probably make some posts about my ORCA technique on its own soon, I think that is outside the scope of this post.</p>
<p>I’ve “performed” this piece twice live, once at RC’s Demo-palooza, and once at a <a href="https://livecode.nyc/">livecode.nyc<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> meetup.  A few notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>This one looks really good on a big screen</li>
<li>When I perform this, I find myself very slowly going through a pretty large hyperparameter space and changes colors periodically as I go.</li>
<li>People suggested a live twitch-stream or other way to deliver a longer video form, which would be a new thing for me, and an interesting problem to solve.</li>
<li>Someone at the livecode meetup even suggested a “twitch plays pokemon” style of interactivity, which is an even more fascinating engineering problem haha</li>
