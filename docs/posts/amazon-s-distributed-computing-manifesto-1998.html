document from the early days of Amazon that transformed the architecture
of Amazon’s ecommerce platform. It highlights the challenges we were
facing at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and hints at where we were
headed.</em></p><p>When it comes to the ecommerce side of Amazon, architectural information
was rarely shared with the public. So, when I was invited by Amazon in
2004 to give a talk about my distributed systems research, I almost
didn’t go. I was thinking: <em>web servers and a database, how hard can
that be?</em> But I’m happy that I did, because what I encountered blew my
mind. The scale and diversity of their operation was unlike anything I
had ever seen, Amazon’s architecture was at least a decade ahead of what
I had encountered at other companies. It was more than just a
high-performance website, we are talking about everything from
high-volume transaction processing to machine learning, security,
robotics, binning millions of products – anything that you could find
in a distributed systems textbook was happening at Amazon, and it was
happening at unbelievable scale. When they offered me a job, I couldn’t
resist. Now, after almost 18 years as their CTO, I am still blown away
on a daily basis by the inventiveness of our engineers and the systems
they have built.</p><p><strong>To invent and simplify</strong></p><p>A continuous challenge when operating at unparalleled scale, when you
are decades ahead of anyone else, and growing by an order of magnitude
every few years, is that there is no textbook you can rely on, nor is
there any commercial software you can buy. It meant that Amazon’s
engineers had to invent their way into the future. And with every few
orders of magnitude of growth the current architecture would start to
show cracks in reliability and performance, and engineers would start to
spend more time with virtual duct tape and WD40 than building
new innovative products. At each of these inflection points, engineers
would invent their way into a new architectural structure to be ready
for the next orders of magnitude growth. Architectures that nobody had
built before.</p><p>Over the next two decades, Amazon would move from a monolith to a
service-oriented architecture, to microservices, then to microservices
running over a shared infrastructure platform. All of this was being
done before terms like <em>service-oriented architecture</em> existed. Along
the way we learned a lot of lessons about operating at internet scale.</p><p>During my <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/keynotes/?trk=www.google.com#werner">keynote at AWS
re:Invent</a>
in a couple of weeks, I plan to talk about how the concepts in this document
started to shaped what we see in microservices and event driven
architectures. Also, in the coming months, I will write a series of
posts that dive deep into specific sections of the Distributed Computing
Manifesto.</p><p><strong>A very brief history of system architecture at Amazon</strong></p><p>Before we go deep into the weeds of Amazon’s architectural history, it
helps to understand a little bit about where we were 25 years ago.
Amazon was moving at a rapid pace, building and launching products every
few months, innovations that we take for granted today: 1-click buying,
self-service ordering, instant refunds, recommendations, similarities,
search-inside-the-book, associates selling, and third-party products.
The list goes on. And these were just the customer-facing innovations,
we’re not even scratching the surface of what was happening behind the
scenes.</p><p>Amazon started off with a traditional two-tier architecture: a
monolithic, stateless application
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obidos_(software)">Obidos</a>) that was
used to serve pages and a whole battery of databases that grew with
every new set of product categories, products inside those categories,
customers, and countries that Amazon launched in. These databases were a
shared resource, and eventually became the bottleneck for the pace that
we wanted to innovate.</p><p>Back in 1998, a collective of senior Amazon
engineers started to lay the groundwork for a radical overhaul of
Amazon’s architecture to support the next generation of customer centric
innovation. A core point was separating the presentation layer, business
logic and data, while ensuring that reliability, scale, performance and
security met an incredibly high bar and keeping costs under control.
Their proposal was called the <em>Distributed Computing Manifesto</em>.</p><p>I am sharing this now to give you a glimpse at how advanced the thinking
of Amazon’s engineering team was in the late nineties. They consistently
invented themselves out of trouble, scaling a monolith into what we
would now call a service-oriented architecture, which was necessary to
support the rapid innovation that has become synonymous with Amazon. One
of our Leadership Principles is <em>to invent and simplify</em> – our
engineers really live by that moto.</p><p><strong>Things change…</strong></p><p>One thing to keep in mind as you read this document is that it
represents the thinking of almost 25 years ago. We have come a long way
since — our business requirements have evolved and our systems have
changed significantly. You may read things that sound unbelievably
simple or common, you may read things that you disagree with, but in the
late nineties these ideas were transformative. I hope you enjoy reading
it as much as I still do.</p><p>The full text of the Distributed Computing Manifesto is available below.
