    <h1>Remembering Bob Lee</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I want to draw attention to Bob Lee, a well-respected technologist and prototype hacker, always curious and sharing lots of interesting technical developments. He was a great role model for how Engineers should be respected in an executive capacity as he advanced his career from &#39;Software&#39; to &#39;Product&#39;. His efforts contributed to technology used by millions. What happened to him is tragic and wrong; he deserved better. Thank you, I&#39;ll miss you &#39;crazybob&#39;.</p><p>Please share your stories featuring Bob Lee, who I&#39;m sure would like to be remembered for his contributions rather than as a victim of this unfortunate awful event.</p></div></div></div>
