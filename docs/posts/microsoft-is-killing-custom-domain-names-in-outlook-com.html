    <h1>Microsoft is killing custom domain names in Outlook.com</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- A generated by theme -->  <!-- end A --><p>One of the features premium Outlook.com users have access to is the ability to host a custom domain name on Outlook.com and therefore to have personalized email addresses on there.</p><p>Microsoft notes:</p><p><em>As a benefit of your Microsoft 365 Family or Microsoft 365 Personal subscription, you can create a personalized email address that’s associated with your Outlook.com mailbox. For example, yourname@example.com. </em></p><p>Unfortunately, it appears this feature is going away, according to a message Microsoft has been sending out to subscribers.</p><p>It states:</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.bigtechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/custom-domans-microsoft.png" alt="" width="738" height="517" srcset="https://www.bigtechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/custom-domans-microsoft.png 738w, https://www.bigtechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/custom-domans-microsoft-300x210.png 300w, https://www.bigtechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/custom-domans-microsoft-696x488.png 696w, https://www.bigtechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/custom-domans-microsoft-600x420.png 600w, https://www.bigtechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/custom-domans-microsoft-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px"/></p><p><em><strong>• Personalized email addresses in Outlook.com</strong></em></p><p>Fortunately the change will not affect existing users, and it appears current subscribers have around 4 weeks to add their own custom domain before they will no longer be unable to, as availability is being removed on the 30th November.</p><p>Microsoft said:</p><p><em>If you already have a personalized email address set up, you will not be impacted by this change, and you can continue using it without any disruption in service. After November 30, 2023, if you choose to remove your existing personalized email address, you will be unable to add it back.</em></p><p>If you want to take advantage of the feature before Microsoft withdraws it, read how at Microsoft’s FAQ <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-a-personalized-email-address-in-microsoft-365-75416a58-b225-4c02-8c07-8979403b427b">here</a>.</p> <!-- A generated by theme -->  <!-- end A --></div></div>
