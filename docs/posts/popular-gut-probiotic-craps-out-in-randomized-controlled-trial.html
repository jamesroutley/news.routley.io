          <p>Any striking marketing claims in companies&#39; ads about the gut benefits of a popular probiotic may be full of, well, the same thing that has their target audience backed up.</p>
<p>In a randomized controlled trial, the probiotic <em>Bifidobacterium animalis</em> subsp. <em>lactis</em>—used in many probiotic products, including Dannon&#39;s Activia yogurts—did nothing to improve bowel health in people with constipation, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2824333">data from a randomized triple-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial</a> published Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.</p>
<p>The study adds to a mixed and mostly unconvincing body of scientific literature on the bowel benefits of the bacterium, substrains of which are sometimes sold with faux scientific-sounding names in products. Dannon, for instance, previously marketed its substrain, DN-173 010, as &#34;Bifidus regularis.&#34;</p>
<h2>Digested data</h2>
<p>For the new study, researchers in China recruited 228 middle-aged adults, 85 percent of whom were women. The participants, all from Shanghai, were considered healthy based on medical testing and records, except for reporting <a href="https://www.justintimemedicine.com/curriculum/1913">functional constipation</a>. This is a condition defined by having two or more signs of difficulty evacuating the bowels, such as frequent straining and having rock-like stool. For the study, the researchers included the additional criterion that participants have three or fewer complete, spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week.</p>
<p>The participants were randomized to take either a placebo (117 participants) or the probiotic (112 participants) every day for eight weeks. Both groups got packets of sweetened powder that participants added to a glass of water taken before breakfast each morning. In addition to a sweetener, the daily probiotic packets contained freeze-dried <em>Bifidobacterium animalis</em> subsp. <em>lactis</em> substrain HN019, which is used in some commercial probiotic products. The first dose had a concentration of 7 × 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (CFUs), then participants shifted to a daily dose of 4.69 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFUs. Many probiotic products have doses of <em>B. lactis</em> in ranges from 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 17 × 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>
