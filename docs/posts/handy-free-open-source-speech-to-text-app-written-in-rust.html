CJ: Hello, I&#39;m CJ and I want to show you Handy. Handy is an
                    open source speech-to-text application that you can run on
                    your own computer. Simply press a keyboard shortcut, speak,
                    and release, and Handy will paste whatever you said into the
                    text field you&#39;re typing into.
</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6="">
Let&#39;s take a look at the settings menu for Handy, and it&#39;s
                    really simple. You have a push-to-talk mode that you can
                    enable, this is enabled by default so you press and hold the
                    keys or alternatively you can turn it off so the
                    transcription starts when you press the key combination and
                    it stops when you press it again. And you can also change
                    what key binding you would like to use for the
                    transcription.
</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6="">
So now it&#39;s mapped to Ctrl-Z and if I turn this off, when I
                    hit control Z, when you look up in the top corner of my Mac
                    here, this little transcription icon lights up. And when I
                    click it again, it turns off and transcribes the audio.
                    There&#39;s nothing to paste into. So it just does nothing here.
</p><p data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6="">So sit back, relax, and let Handy give you a hand.</p></div></div>
