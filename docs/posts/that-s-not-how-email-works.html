              I have a credit card with HSBC<sup><a id="footnote-ref-27343-1" name="footnote-ref-27343-1" href="#footnote-27343-1" title="You know, the bank with virtue-signalling multiculturalism that we used to joke about.">1</a></sup>.

              Not long ago I received a letter from them telling me that emails to me were being “returned undelivered” and they needed me to update the email address on my account.

            <p>
              I logged into my account, per the instructions in the letter, and discovered <strong>my correct email address already right there</strong>, much to my… lack of surprise<sup><a id="footnote-ref-27343-3" name="footnote-ref-27343-3" href="#footnote-27343-3" title="After all, I’d been reading their emails!">3</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I kicked off a live chat via their app, with an agent called Ankitha. Over the course of a drawn-out hour-long conversation, they repeatedly told to tell me <em>how</em> to update my
              email address (which was never my question). Eventually, when they understood that <em>my email address was already correct</em>, then they concluded the call, saying (emphasis mine):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I can understand your frustration, but <strong>if the bank has sent the letter, you will have to update the e-mail address</strong>.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This is the point at which a normal person would probably just change the email address in their online banking to a “spare” email address.
            </p>
            <p>
              But aside from the fact that I’d rather not<sup><a id="footnote-ref-27343-4" name="footnote-ref-27343-4" href="#footnote-27343-4" title="After all, as I’ll stress again: the email address HSBC have for me, and are using, is already correct.">4</a></sup>, by this point I’d caught the scent of a deeper underlying issue.
              After all, didn’t I have <a href="https://danq.me/2021/11/16/email-tracking-and-paperless-banking/">a conversation a <em>little</em> like this one but with a different bank</a>, about four years

              who told me that <strong>if my email address is already correct then I can ignore their letter</strong>.

            <p>
              I suggested that perhaps their letter template might need updating so it doesn’t say “action required” if action is <em>not</em> required. Or that perhaps what they mean to say is

              I dissected HSBC’s latest email to me: it was of the “your latest statement is available” variety. Deep within the email, down at the bottom, is this code:

            <p>
              What you’re seeing are two <em>tracking pixels</em>: tiny 1×1 pixel images, usually transparent or white-on-white to make them even-more invisible, used to surreptitiously track when
              somebody reads an email. When you open an email from HSBC – potentially <em>every</em> time you open an email from them – your email client connects to those web addresses to get
              the necessary images. The code at the end of each identifies the email they were contained within, which in turn can be linked back to the recipient.
            </p>
            <p>
              You know how invasive a read-receipt feels? Tracking pixels are like those… but turned up to eleven. While a read-receipt only says “the recipient read this email” (usually only after
              the recipient gives consent for it to do so), a tracking pixel can often track <em>when</em> and <em>how often</em> you refer to an email<sup><a id="footnote-ref-27343-6" name="footnote-ref-27343-6" href="#footnote-27343-6" title="A tracking pixel can also collect additional personal information about you, such as your IP address at the time that you opened the email, which might disclose your location.">6</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I re-read a year-old email from HSBC, they’re saying that they want to know about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              But it gets worse. Because HSBC are using <code>http://</code>, rather than <code>https://</code> URLs for their tracking pixels, they’re also saying that every time you read an email
              from them, they’d like <em>everybody on the same network as you</em> to be able to know that you did so, too. If you’re at my house, on my WiFi, and you open an email from HSBC, not
              only might HSBC know about it, but <em>I</em> might know about it too.
            </p>
            <p>
              An easily-avoidable security failure there, HSBC… which isn’t the kind of thing one hopes to hear about a bank!
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_27353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27353">

            <p>
              But… tracking pixels don’t actually work. At least, they doesn’t work <em>on me</em>. Like many privacy-conscious individuals, my devices are configured to block tracking pixels (and a
              variety of other instruments of surveillance capitalism) right out of the gate.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that even though I <em>do</em> read most of the non-spam email that lands in my Inbox, the sender <em>doesn’t get to know that I did</em> so unless I choose to tell them.
              This is the way that email was <em>designed</em> to work, and is the only way that a sender can be confident that it <em>will</em> work.
            </p>
            <p>
              But we’re in the Darkest Timeline. <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56071437">Tracking pixels have become so endemic</a> that HSBC have clearly come to the opinion
              that if they can’t track when I open their emails, I must not be receiving their emails</strong>. So they wrote me a letter to tell me that my emails have been “returned
              undelivered” (which seems to be an outright lie).
            </p>
            <p>
              Surveillance capitalism has become so ubiquitous that it’s become transparent. Transparent like the invisible spies at the bottom of your bank’s emails.

              So in summary, with only a little speculation:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Surveillance capitalism became widespread</strong> enough that HSBC came to assume that tracking pixels have bulletproof reliability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>HSBC started using tracking pixels</strong> them to check whether emails are being received (even though that’s not what they do when they <em>are</em> reliable, which
                they’re not).
                <ul>
                  <li>(Oh, and their tracking pixels are badly-implemented, if they worked they’d “leak” data to other people on my network<sup><a id="footnote-ref-27343-7" name="footnote-ref-27343-7" href="#footnote-27343-7" title="It could be even worse still, actually! A sophisticated attacker could “inject” images into the bottom of a HSBC email; those images could, for example, be pictures of text saying things like “You need to urgently call HSBC on [attacker’s phone number].” This would allow a scammer to hijack a legitimate HSBC email by injecting their own content into the bottom of it. Seriously, HSBC, you ought to fix this.">7</a></sup>.)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Eventually, HSBC assumed their tracking was bulletproof.</strong> Because HSBC couldn’t track how often, when, and where I was reading their emails… they posted me a letter to
                tell me I needed to change my email address.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>
              What do I think HSBC should do?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Instead of sending me a misleading letter about undelivered emails, perhaps a better approach for HSBC could be:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>At an absolute minimum</strong><strong>, stop using unencrypted connections for tracking pixels</strong>. I do not want to open a bank email on a cafe’s public WiFi and have
                <em>everybody in the cafe</em> potentially know who I bank with… and that I just opened an email from them! I certainly don’t want attackers injecting content into the bottom of
                legitimate emails.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stop assuming that if somebody blocks your attempts to spy on them via your emails, it means they’re not getting your emails</strong>. It doesn’t mean that. It’s never meant
                that. There are all kinds of reasons that your tracking pixels might not work, and they’re not even all privacy-related reasons!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Or, better yet: just stop trying to surveil your customers’ email habits in the first place?</strong> You already sit on a wealth of personal and financial information which
                you can, and probably do, data-mine for your own benefit. Can you at least <em>try</em> to pay lip service to <a href="https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/our-approach/risk-and-responsibility/pdfs/240715-hsbc-principles-for-the-ethical-use-of-data-and-ai.pdf">your own published principles on the
                ethical use of data</a> and, if I may quote them, “use only that data which is appropriate for the purpose” and “embed privacy considerations into design and approval processes”.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>If you need to check that an email address is valid, do <em>that</em>, not an unreliable proxy for it</strong>. Instead of this letter, you could have sent an email that
                said “We need to check that you’re receiving our emails. Please click this link to confirm that you are.” This not only achieves informed consent for your tracking, but it can be
                more-secure too because you can authenticate the user during the process.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Also, to quote your own principles once more: when you make a mistake like assuming your spying is a flawless way to detect the validity of email addresses, perhaps you should “be
              transparent with our customers and other stakeholders about how we use their data”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wouldn’t that be better than writing to a customer to say that their emails are being returned undelivered (when they’re not)… and then having your staff tell them that having received
              such an email they have no choice but to change the email address they use (which is then disputed by your <em>other</em> staff)?
