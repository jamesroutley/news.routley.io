	<p>2021-08-30 | Herzogenaurach/Friedrichshafen</p> <ul> <li>“Bike-by-wire” technology offers potential for new business areas in the field of micromobility</li> <li>Free Drive further demonstrates the company&#39;s status as preferred mobility partner in the field of electrified drives</li> <li>Robust system provides maximum flexibility in the vehicle architecture with even less wear</li> </ul>   <p>Networked, flexible, sustainable, and environmentally friendly: New mobility trends are placing high demands on products and technology. Schaeffler adopts an holistic approach to movement and offers solutions to meet all customer requirements, including those in the field of micromobility. At Eurobike 2021 in Friedrichshafen, the automotive and industrial supplier will be presenting the new “bike-by-wire” system, Free Drive, as an innovative solution for bicycles. The chainless drive system is a joint development with two-wheel electric drive specialist Heinzmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG, which dispenses with the mechanical connection between the generator and motor, thus enabling completely new bicycle architectures and pedal configurations combined with an even lower requirement for wear parts. “Schaeffler is the preferred partner for mobility solutions of the future and is demonstrating this status once again with the innovative Free Drive for e-bikes,” says Matthias Zink, CEO Automotive Technologies, Schaeffler AG. “The development is proof of our transformation into a leading supplier of electrified drives. Our decades of expertise in the field of vehicle mechatronics, which we are now also transferring to the two-wheel segment, have assisted us in this development. The e-bike market is growing steadily and offers Schaeffler, as e-mobility partner, further business potential.” Schaeffler already has many years of experience in the e-bike segment and most recently presented the mechatronic automatic gearshift system VELOMATIC in 2016.</p>  <p><strong>One system for all applications</strong></p>  <p>“Regardless of whether the system is used in 2-, 3-, or 4-wheel applications, the absence of a mechanical connection between the generator and motor means that Free Drive can provide maximum flexibility in the bicycle architecture and a freely configurable pedaling sensation, which is tailored to the requirements of the bicycle and the needs of the rider, while ensuring minimal wear,” says Dr. Jochen Schröder, President of the E-Mobility Division. The compact dimensions of the Free Drive system permit a standard distance of 138 millimeters between the two pedals. The Free Drive system can be specified for various applications, irrespective of the manufacturer. For fleet operators, Free Drive offers an ergonomic, low-maintenance, and robust system with low operating and maintenance costs, as wear parts and peripheral chain equipment are not required. Dr. Jochen Schröder: “With the expansion of the portfolio in the bicycle segment, Schaeffler is not only stepping up its commitment to the fast-growing e-bike market but is also substantiating its own claim to help shape future movement with a pioneering spirit.” </p>  <p>Visit Schaeffler at the Eurobike from September 1 - 4, 2021, at the booth of cooperation partner Heinzmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG in Hall A6-208.</p>  <p>Experience Free Drive for yourself – test drives will be available on the open-air site (booth FG-0/101). </p>
