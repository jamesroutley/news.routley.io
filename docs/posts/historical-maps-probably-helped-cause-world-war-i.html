It is said to prove a point about the globalization of tea: words for tea that sound like </span><em>chai </em><span>reflect a historical spread via overland routes, the argument goes, while words like </span><em>tea </em><span>are a legacy of maritime trade. A 2018 </span><a href="https://qz.com/1176962/map-how-the-word-tea-spread-over-land-and-sea-to-conquer-the-world" rel="">viral article</a><span> by the data journalist Nikhil Sonad in </span><em>Quartz</em><span> first put this idea on the world’s radar. Sonad observed that the Chinese character for tea (茶) is pronounced </span><em>chá</em><span> in some varieties of Chinese, like Mandarin — but in the Min Nan dialect spoken in the coastal province of Fujian, it’s pronounced </span><em>te</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>Maps like this are a big part of why I became a historian. I probably spent more time looking through the volumes of Colin McEvedy’s </span><em>Penguin Atlas of History </em><span>series than any other book when I was a kid (scans of the medieval volume are </span><a href="http://projects.mcah.columbia.edu/courses/medmil/pages/non-mma-pages/maps/penguin.html" rel="">here</a><span>). There’s something beguiling about the thought that a simple arrangement of lines might explain the world — like seeing human history as an enormous game of </span><em>Civilization 6. </em><span>But of course, that’s also the </span><em>problem</em><span> with using maps as a way of understanding history. If you’re not careful, they go from being helpful tools to misleading simplifications. </span></p><p><span>Because, </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-not-to-be-fooled-by-viral-charts" rel="">like economic charts</a><span> that go viral, many popular maps about history happen to be wrong.  </span></p><p><span>As much as I like the map above, for instance, it’s worth pointing out that the coverage of Africa is a mess. It puts the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the “tea” category, for instance. And it’s true that French (</span><em>thé</em><span>) is one</span><em> </em><span>of the DRC’s official languages. But another national language is Lingala, in which the word for tea is “chai.” As for Mozambique and Angola, Portuguese is the official language in both countries, and tea in Portuguese is </span><em>chá.</em></p><p><span>Keeping that in mind, return to the map above and take note of Portugal and Brazil. The map can now be deployed to prove an entirely different argument. Maybe this is not a map about Min Nan and Mandarin. It’s a map about the </span><em>Portuguese empire</em><span>. An empire that, not coincidentally, played a central role in globalizing tea (something I wrote about </span><a href="https://github.com/benjaminbreen/PDFs/blob/master/%22Empires%20on%20Drugs%22%20proofs.pdf" rel="">here</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>Last month, Anton Howes </span><a href="https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-does-history-have" rel="">wrote</a><span> about historians and our weakness for storytelling. I think many maps have a similar dangerous allure. They smooth over chronology and ignore the reality of overwhelming complexity that confronts anyone who has tried to answer a question by visiting a historical archive.</span></p><p><span>And then there are the </span><em>really </em><span>bad</span><em> </em><span>historical maps. Though my title is debatable, I believe that there really are maps — </span><em>several </em><span>maps, in fact— which can be pointed to as causal agents in World War I. </span></p><p><span>The rest of this post is about one specific example: the map of troop movements at the ancient Battle of Cannae (216 BCE) that inspired German military planners in the years just before 1914. But before that, I wanted to mention another set of candidates. These are the maps of territorial claims drawn up by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_irredentist_claims_or_disputes" rel="">irredentist</a><span> and nationalist groups before the war, whether they were yearning for self-determination or for imperial land-grabs. There can be little doubt that maps deploying skewed history to argue for a redrawing of borders played a role in both Balkan nationalism and in the naval arms race between the German and British empires. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg" width="890" height="720" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:720,&#34;width&#34;:890,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;German claims in Africa (1917)&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;German claims in Africa (1917)&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="German claims in Africa (1917)" title="German claims in Africa (1917)" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95aa871d-cebe-4028-80f3-686d4a2483e3_890x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Putative German claims in Africa amounted to nearly half the continent (</span><a href="https://perspectivesonafrica.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/“mittelafrika”-the-german-dream-of-an-african-empire-1884-1918/" rel="">source</a><span>).</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>For the rest of this post, however, I’ll be talking about a much smaller-scale map: the map of Hannibal’s double envelopment of Roman troops at the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae" rel="">Battle of Cannae</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>In her book </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guns_of_August" rel="">The Guns of August</a></em><span>, Barbara Tuchman argues that the memory of Cannae, which was passed down through a succession of military histories until it became a virtual obsession of strategists in the 19th century, helped push the world into an unimaginable catastrophe. </span></p><p>It did so by offering up a model of a “battle of annihilation” that Germany’s war planners believed they could unleash on France. At the head of these planers was General von Schlieffen, the Chief of the German General Staff. The map of Cannae haunted Schlieffen’s dreams. </p><p>As Tuchman writes:</p><blockquote><p>To achieve decisive victory, Schlieffen fixed upon a strategy derived from Hannibal and the Battle of Cannae. The dead general who mesmerized Schlieffen had been dead a very long time. Two thousand years had passed since Hannibal’s classic double envelopment of the Romans at Cannae. Field gun and machine gun had replaced bow and arrow and slingshot, Schlieffen wrote, “but the principles of strategy remain unchanged. The enemy&#39;s front is not the objective. The essential thing is to crush the enemy&#39;s flanks... and complete the extermination by attack upon his rear.” Under Schlieffen, envelopment became the fetish and frontal attack the anathema of the German General Staff.</p></blockquote><p><span>I highly recommend Tuchman’s book, which, while imperfect as scholarship, is brilliant as historical writing. But if you’re in a hurry, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae#%22Cannae_model%22" rel="">Wikipedia has a decent summary</a><span> of the implications of the various maps of the supposed Cannae “pincer” attack for twentieth century history. </span></p><p><span>And if, by contrast, you have an enormous amount of time to spend on this topic, you can read the book Schlieffen wrote himself. It’s called simply </span><em>Cannae</em><span>.

It was a direct model for Germany’s invasion of Belgium and France. Schlieffen grandly proclaimed: </p><blockquote><p>A battle of annihilation can be carried out today according to the same plan devised by Hannibal in long forgotten times. </p></blockquote><p><span>As the geographer J.B. Harley once </span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Historical_Evidence_and_Argument/Ql0z2YT3pX4C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=maps%20as%20a%20cause%20of%20nationalism%20harley&amp;pg=PA197&amp;printsec=frontcover" rel="">warned</a><span>, “[a] map says to you, ‘Read me carefully, follow me closely, doubt me not.’” Doubt never seemed to enter the minds of these military strategists of pre-war Germany. It did not seem to trouble them, for instance, that they were drawing world-changing lessons from a map of a battle of two thousand years earlier about which surprisingly little is known. </span></p><p><span>As the historian Martin Samuels </span><a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1524/mgzs.1990.47.1.7/html?lang=en" rel="">pointed out</a><span> in his article “the Reality of Cannae,” there is no archaeological evidence for the battle. Nor are there first-hand sources of any kind. Everything we know derives from accounts written </span><em>sixty years or more </em><span>after Cannae itself. Suffice to say, when Samuels dug into these sources, he found as many questions as answers. The detailed maps of movements at Cannae that decorated military strategy manuals for hundreds of years, in other words, were largely fanciful.  Samuels calls Cannae “the most quoted and least understood battle” in history.</span></p><p>The simplicity of a historical map — the clear labels, the sharp edges, and above all the reduction of thousands or millions of people into abstract symbols — is a big part of why they’re so beguiling.
