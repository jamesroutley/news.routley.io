    <h1>History of Hacker News Search from 2007 to 2024</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>We at Trieve are going to be launching a search engine for HackerNews with some additional features soon and thought it would be worth studying the history of HN search before finalizing things. Here’s what we found!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Did the research using our own HN search engine! :)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I was happy looking at these old HN posts and seeing that so many of the comment/post’ers from the early days of HN
were, or eventually became, founders of YC companies.</p>

<h3 id="1-search-news-yc-bigheadlabs-on-march-17-2007">1. Search News YC (bigheadlabs) on March 17, 2007</h3>
<p>Written and shared by Jason Yan, Founder/CTO of Disqus (S07) (aka <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jasonyan">jsonyan</a>), on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4780">March 17, 2007</a>. Can still be viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070707020143/http://nycs.bigheadlabs.com/">here on the internet archive</a>.</p>

<p>I assume there was some indexing logic being done on the DJango server that Jason used.</p>
<h3 id="2-ycsearchcom-on-june-27-2007">2. ycsearch.com on June 27, 2007</h3>
<p>Quickly hacked together by Keven Lin (YC S07) (aka <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=keven">keven</a>) on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31012">June 27, 2007</a>.</p>
<p>I could not find a screenshot on Internet Archive, but Keven explained he built it with <a href="https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/">cse.google.com</a>.</p>

<p>In the text of the original post (see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1309589">here</a>), cosmok explains that he built it using Yahoo’s search API.</p>

<p>I surmise from the comment on the post that the motivation here was ycsearch being limited in terms of HN-specific filters and the bigheadlabs one being un-maintained.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.trieve.ai/blog/history-of-hnsearch/searchyc.com.webp" alt="search-yc-screenshot"/></p>
<p>Judging from the last <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35959">paulg comment on this thread</a> it seems like, similar to ycsearch, it was built using <a href="https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/">cse.google.com</a>.</p>
<p>The HN community seemed to get a lot of value out of it as in a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2605959">HN thread posted when it went down on June 1 of 2011</a> there are multiple users explaining how important it was to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>iheartmemcache</strong>: This service is a major component of this community; as such, I’ll host this on whatever metal you need. My contact information is in my profile. Ping me on G-talk and we can have this sorted out by the morning (if you’re in PST).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>bkrausz</strong>: What kind of traffic does SearchYC get? Is a $40/mo Linode not sufficient? I would gladly pay that (or be content with some Google ads in the right bar). Hell, I’d even maintain the site…it’s a great service.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>g123g</strong>: Hopfully you will be able to bring it back soon. <span>SearchYC.com</span> is the best way to search the treasure trove that HN has become.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth mentioning that HNSearch (mentioned further below) was up by this point in time. Judging by comments on the shutdown post it seems like traffic was somewhat split:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>swombat</strong>: What’s wrong with <a href="http://www.hnsearch.com">http://www.hnsearch.com</a> ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>evangineer</strong>: Just got zero hits on a search that I know there is at least one result for. Same search worked fine on <span>searchyc.com</span> a few days ago.</p>

<h2 id="second-gen---octopartthriftdb-powered-hnsearch--2011-2014">Second Gen - Octopart/ThriftDB-powered HNSearch | 2011-2014</h2>
<p>The official launch of HNSearch was posted by Paul Graham, founder of Y-Combinator itself (aka <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pg">pg</a>), and Andres Morey, founder of Octopart (W07) (aka <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andres">andres</a>), separately on June 4, 2011. Andres posted it as an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2619892">API contest here</a> to build the best thing on top of the HNSearch API where the winner would get a 27-inch Dell monitor. PG posted it as an official announcement on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2619736">HN here</a> which linked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110618105517/http://ycombinator.com/newsnews.html">ycombinator.com in a now only archive-available page</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.trieve.ai/blog/history-of-hnsearch/hnsearch-api-contest.webp" alt="octopart/thriftdb-search-screenshot"/></p>
<p>Building search for HN has certainly been a trial for us and we felt validated seeing that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35959">PG first mentioned the Octopart guys using ThriftDB to make this in 2007 4yrs before it released</a>.</p>
<p>I think the best part of HNSearch was that third-party applications were built on top of it. It seems, judging by the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7404972">HNSearch shutdown post</a>, that it was well-loved by HN users and also well-replaced by Algolia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>clamprecht</strong>: Can someone outline the benefits of the new one over the old one? When I first tried the new one, the UI was severely lacking. I saw the fixed a few things, but I haven’t evaluated it again.
I don’t always use the HN search engine, but when I do, it’s usually very helpful. I’d hate to lose that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>swah</strong>I noticed the new one is much faster..</p>

<h2 id="third-gen---algolia-powered-search--2014-current">Third Gen - Algolia powered search | 2014-current</h2>
<p>The first HN post I was able to find mentioning Algolia HN search was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7126301">Ask HN: What do you think about our last HN Search update? on Jan 26, 2014</a> posted by Julian Lemoine, founder/CTO of Algolia (W14) aka <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jlemoine">jlemoine</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.trieve.ai/blog/history-of-hnsearch/algolia-hn-search.webp" alt="algolia-hn-search-screenshot"/></p>
<p>Algolia’s ability to get HN search up so quickly is really impressive. If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/commits/master/?after=e27760e09840a6fa3efc592649fceb89237e4c2f+1119">Github repo</a> it seems like they started in Sep 2013 and released in Jan 2014.</p>
<p>We also took about 6 months to get everything up having <a href="https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve-hn-discovery/commits/main/?after=0163ad22215a28a3492fc86f0d50e4a9bd338f3b+139">started in Feb 2024 and releasing in Aug 2024</a>. I can say now, with firsthand experience, that timeline is not easy to operate on. Especially given certain devtooling was less mature in 2013.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7126301">Algolia asked the community for feedback post-launch in 2014</a> and implemented several improvements including <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37881130">additional filter types and improved indexing speed in late 2023</a>. We think it’s incredibly accurate for keyword search and has all the filters and options that we would want.</p>
