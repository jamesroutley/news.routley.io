              <p>This website makes it seem like this “public” dataset is for the community to use, but it is instead a for-profit money maker for Google Cloud and you can lose tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Last week I ran a script on BigQuery for historical HTTP Archive data and was billed $14,000 by Google Cloud with zero warning whatsoever, and they won’t remove the fee.</p>
<p>This official website should be updated to warn people Google is apparently now hosting this dataset to make money.  I don’t think that was the original mission, but that’s what it is today, there’s basically zero customer support, and you can lose $14k in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Academics, especially grad students, need to be aware of this before they give a credit card number to Google.  In fact, I’d caution against using this dataset whatsoever with this new business model attached.</p>
