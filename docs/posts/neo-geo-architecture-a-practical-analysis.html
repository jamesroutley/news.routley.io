This begs the question: how capable was it and how did it compare with the rest?</p><p>In this entry, we’ll take a look at the result of one company (SNK) setting budget restrictions aside and shipping a product meant to please both arcade owners and rich households.</p><h3 id="models-and-variants">Models and variants</h3><p>The Neo Geo is exceptional in the sense it was designed for two markets at the same time: the arcade and the home. Consequently, SNK produced a single architecture which was sold in the form of <strong>two variants</strong>, each taking into account a particular market:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Multi Video System</strong> or ‘MVS’ is the form tailored for arcade centres. Its I/O follows the ‘JAMMA’ specification (with some deviations <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:general-jamma" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup>), facilitating its integration with arcade cabinets. Alongside, its specialised motherboard provides extra circuitry for handling coin-based payments. Be as it may, throughout its lifetime, SNK ended up shipping tons of revisions, some of which can fit up to six game cartridges at once <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:general-mvs_boards" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>.</li><li>The <strong>Advanced Entertainment System</strong> or ‘AES’ is the simplified design for homes. While smaller and with reduced I/O, it doesn’t compromise its fundamental capabilities.</li></ul><p>I suppose I should also mention the <strong>Neo Geo CD</strong>, which is the successor of the AES variant carrying the obvious adoption of the CD-ROM for game distribution. Just like its previous forms, there were multiple revisions of this model.</p><p>In any case, for this analysis, I’ll be focusing on the AES variant, as that’s the one I’ve got with me. I will, nevertheless, make deserved references to the MVS when it comes to bonus functionality.</p><hr/><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>The system features a <strong>dual-processor</strong> configuration composed of a <strong>Motorola 68000</strong> and a <strong>Zilog Z80</strong> CPU, two big icons of 80s electronics. The 68000 is tasked with executing the <strong>main program</strong> (also known as <em>the game</em>) while the Z80 is relegated to <strong>sound management</strong> <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-z80" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup>. You may recall identical roles within the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/">Mega Drive/Genesis</a>, but that’s where the similarities stop, as the chip variants and layouts are somewhat divergent.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/cpu/photo.6851a5b6bd9787ed87569156db90ca3258a5809446821e8ed201a0af3c482155.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/cpu/_huc4fc50fccbeb0a7e6cbcd6ca3ef8dda6_73819_51497fd4d1bac52f5f0bf7056f78da88.webp 500w,

Additionally, the specific chip fitted is the <strong>68HC000</strong>, a variant distinguished by its composition of CMOS gates (as opposed to the previous and less-efficient NMOS process).</p><p>If you want to know what’s inside the 68000 and the Z80, I have done previous analyses in the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#cpu">Mega Drive/Genesis</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#cpu">Master System</a> articles, respectively. Thus, for the Neo Geo’s study, I will focus on their new uses.</p><h3 id="a-multitude-of-support-chips">A multitude of support chips</h3><p>The most notable difference between the Neo Geo and any home console of the same generation is that, during the design of the former, SNK wasn’t constrained by the budget limitations of the average household. In doing so, the motherboard features an extraordinary amount of integrated controllers that not only remove many bottlenecks of the CPUs but also expand their capabilities.</p><p>The list of chips is tedious, but the most confusing part is that throughout revisions SNK re-designed the chipset, either by unifying multiple chips or splitting them. So, for now, let me tell you that the motherboard contains the following groups of ‘accelerators’:</p><ul><li><strong>68k Controllers</strong>: To seamlessly switch between vector tables. I explain this area in the next paragraphs.</li><li><strong>Z80 Controllers</strong>: To alleviate the memory addressing limitations.</li><li><strong>I/O Arbiters</strong>: To delegate all I/O operations, saving cycles in the way.</li><li><strong>Video Display Controller</strong>: To perform all graphics operations. This will be discussed in a dedicated section called ‘Graphics’.</li><li><strong>Cabinet controllers</strong>: For the arcade variant only (the ‘MVS’). These handle the coin slot, provide a scoreboard and perform system diagnostics.</li><li><strong>Home controllers</strong>: Likewise but only found on the home variant (the ‘AES’). In this group, we find a video encoder that generates TV-compliant video signals.</li></ul><p>From now on, I’ll use these titles to refer to any group throughout the article. In some cases, I will also name specific chips within the groups to denote special importance.</p><h3 id="sophisticated-io-handling">Sophisticated I/O handling</h3><p>Let me introduce you to a noble capability of the 68000 which I didn’t cover until now: the <strong>vectorised interrupt table</strong>. Earlier CPUs like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#cpu">6502</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#cpu">Z80</a> had a constrained design to handle I/O communication. Whenever an external device wanted the attention of the CPU, the former had to send an interrupt request which, in turn, the CPU had to run a software routine to process it. The amount of information during the request was very limited, meaning the CPUs needed to spend extra cycles to investigate ‘who’ triggered the interrupt and ‘why’ was the CPU interrupted.</p><p>To be fair, CPUs like the Z80 provided extra circuitry to allow the peripheral to tell the CPU which instruction to execute next. Nevertheless, this wasn’t widely adopted.</p><p>The 68000 improved this technique by treating interrupts as <strong>exceptions</strong>. Peripherals are required to identify themselves once they interrupt the CPU <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-68k_int" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>. Then, the latter uses the identifier to compose a memory address, which in turn points to a tailored software routine. All in all, this enables programmers to handle I/O communication efficiently, as they can now catalog their dedicated interrupt handlers in a memory area called <strong>autovector table</strong>, and the CPU will execute each automatically.</p><p>The Neo Geo takes advantage of this design with the addition of a controller chip called the <strong>NEO-E0</strong>. Essentially, both the Neo Geo’s Operating System and the game implement a dedicated exception table, this is because the OS’ table focuses on hardware interfacing and the game’s one is used during normal execution. However, the 68000 is only aware of one at a time. So, the NEO-E0 provides automatic <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#going-beyond-existing-capabilities">bank switching</a> that makes the 68000 read from the right table at all times.</p><h3 id="inter-process-communication">Inter-process communication</h3><p>Whenever there’s a system featuring a dual-processor layout, there must be a way for both CPUs to communicate. In this console, SNK implemented inter-process communication (IPC) with the use of an <strong>I/O arbiter</strong> chip. The latter exposes a single 8-bit register, which the 68000 can write to <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-68k_z80" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/cpu/ipc.71e2646bd337fcb84894961309627f8029af828cf35c9efd7e0a465a8120dc81.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="717" height="194" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/cpu/ipc.71e2646bd337fcb84894961309627f8029af828cf35c9efd7e0a465a8120dc81.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Representation of the IPC channel between the 68000 and the Z80.</figcaption></figure><p>Once the register is updated, the arbiter will send a non-maskable interrupt to the Z80. From then on, the Z80 may read the value (mapped at a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#accessing-the-rest-of-the-components">port</a>) and react accordingly. This includes writing back to that register, so the 68000 receives new data. However, for some reason, the 68000 will not be interrupted (so it will need to do some sort of polling).</p><p>The specific I/O arbiter chip has changed throughout different motherboard revisions. It was first implemented with the ‘PRO-B0’ chip and then replaced with the ‘NEO-C1’.</p><h3 id="anti-unpleasantries">Anti-unpleasantries</h3><p>Speaking of interruptions, something that arcade cabinets can’t afford is requiring constant maintenance.</p><p>We are no strangers to games suddenly freezing due to a software bug. The fix is no mystery either: just power cycle and start the game again. Now, imagine if this would happen to an arcade cabinet. Unless the owner happens to be near, the broken cabinet would only be losing money.</p><p>The Neo Geo - having inherited the requirements of coin-slot machines - provides an ‘auto-repair’ process by bundling a <strong>Watchdog program</strong>. This is found in the I/O arbiter chip <sup id="bibref:6"><a href="#bib:cpu-watchdog" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></sup>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/dragon.8e4da57be74f31f712a3a41b109979a45c92b9e4a0517f6eb55bb5c603dfc0f5.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="304" height="224" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/dragon.8e4da57be74f31f712a3a41b109979a45c92b9e4a0517f6eb55bb5c603dfc0f5.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Arcade cabinets can’t afford to be continuously serviced. They’re already busy trying to lure players.</figcaption></figure><p>The system works as follows: games are required to periodically notify the watchdog of its presence (by writing to a particular register). In the unfortunate event the Watchdog doesn’t receive a ping after a certain amount of time, it will assume the program froze and proceed to reset the system.</p><p>Thanks to this, MVS owners didn’t need to keep an eye on their cabinets. Meanwhile, those lucky kids who could afford an AES system didn’t even have to move from their luxury sofa whenever their games crashed.</p><p>If it wasn’t enough, MVS motherboards complement this system by fitting an extra microcontroller, the <strong>NEO-F0</strong>. This drives the <strong>coin lockout</strong> mechanism, preventing users from wasting coins on failed systems <sup id="bibref:7"><a href="#bib:cpu-coin_lockout" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></sup>, among other things.</p><h3 id="memory-available">Memory available</h3><p>Memory is scattered across the motherboard and the game cartridge (which, by the way, is massive in size). Remember this is an expensive system, so memory bandwidth and capacity were top priorities.</p><p>In the case of general-purpose memory, there are <strong>64 KB of RAM</strong> available to the 68000. Meanwhile, the Z80 is provided with <strong>2 KB</strong>.</p><p>MVS models additionally include another <strong>64 KB</strong>. It’s plugged into a battery and meant to store game scores, so there’s no use for general purposes, however.</p><p>Curiously enough, this system doesn’t feature any sort of <strong>Direct Memory Access</strong> (DMA) to speed up memory transfers. I presume it’s not a requirement considering the amount of dedicated buses.</p><hr/><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>The Neo Geo is the pinnacle of tile-based graphics, its richness of colours is comparable to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/sega-saturn/#graphics">frame-buffers-based systems</a> (which only became affordable four years later). Be as it may, when it comes to effects, the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/#graphics">Super Nintendo</a> has managed to do more with less.</p><h3 id="design">Design</h3><p>The graphics subsystem revolves around the typical <strong>Video Display Controller</strong> (VDC) model, but this time is surrounded by a considerable number of components. The result is a console that can display an immense amount of sprites, and such is the number that the iconic <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#tab-5-2-background-layer">background layers</a> are no longer relevant. This makes sense as backgrounds were originally devised to tackle the limited number of sprites.</p><figure><ul><li id="tab-1-1-metal-slug-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-metal-slug">Metal Slug</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-golf-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-golf">Golf</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-drift-out-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-drift-out">Drift Out</a></li><li id="tab-1-4-fighting-link"><a href="#tab-1-4-fighting">Fighting</a></li><li id="tab-1-5-windjammers-link"><a href="#tab-1-5-windjammers">Windjammers</a></li></ul><figure id="tab-1-1-metal-slug"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/metalslug3.8f099cb4f34e7b009d73cfdf21a793ef16812a667ea9f72e71e915a4265e0a34.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="304" height="224" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/metalslug3.8f099cb4f34e7b009d73cfdf21a793ef16812a667ea9f72e71e915a4265e0a34.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Metal Slug 3 (2000).</figcaption></figure><figure id="tab-1-2-golf"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/turfmast.58d3413239eccce1c8fb511be5c632b85bf87cc9b58b1314edf00df7ec153677.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="304" height="224" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/turfmast.58d3413239eccce1c8fb511be5c632b85bf87cc9b58b1314edf00df7ec153677.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Neo Turf Masters (1996).</figcaption></figure><figure id="tab-1-3-drift-out"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/neodrift.c6b09e0b8c295c189d2e8688b2ce817c9912bf71e6e716185b4f7dad25e80b9f.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="304" height="224" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/neodrift.c6b09e0b8c295c189d2e8688b2ce817c9912bf71e6e716185b4f7dad25e80b9f.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Neo Drift Out (1996).</figcaption></figure><figure id="tab-1-4-fighting"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/artoffight.6a9c4fbdfba07a5ab4b78aae87485ada0fa584277ce8a339c11bc20035e14273.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="304" height="224" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/artoffight.6a9c4fbdfba07a5ab4b78aae87485ada0fa584277ce8a339c11bc20035e14273.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior (1996).</figcaption></figure><figure id="tab-1-5-windjammers"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/windjammers.a2dddbeafed5c273af635c694a2de338c121429f308027d90b76010c98373941.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="304" height="224" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/games/windjammers.a2dddbeafed5c273af635c694a2de338c121429f308027d90b76010c98373941.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Windjammers (1993).</figcaption></figure><figcaption>Example of Neo Geo games.</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, the console broadcasts a frame in compliance with NTSC and PAL signals (the choice depends on the region).

You already know it as the main CPU. Its main role is to fill the VRAM and Palette RAM; and set up the VDC (using a set of exposed registers).</li><li>The <strong>Video Display Processor</strong> (VDC): Based on the information stored on multiple memory chips, it generates scan lines and sends them to ‘Palette RAM’, which will, in turn, generate the required color pixels.<ul><li>The physical appearance of the VDC will vary depending on the motherboard model. For instance, the first revision housed three chips (the ‘LSPC-A0’, ‘NEO-B0’ and ‘NEO-C0’), whereas later ones use a combination of the ‘LSPC-A2’ and the ‘NEO-B1’.</li></ul></li><li>The <strong>Video DAC</strong>: Converts the color stream received from ‘Palette RAM’ into a video signal.</li></ul><p>Don’t worry if the previous explanation is too dense.

In both cases, each pixel is encoded using <strong>4 bits</strong> (in other words, 4 bpp), meaning it can select up to <strong>15 colours plus transparency</strong>.</p><p>In terms of colour composition, Palette RAM allows storing <strong>256 colour palettes</strong> <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:graphics-palettes" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>.

Yet, in the case of the Neo Geo, the tiles used for sprites are exceptionally <strong>16 x 16 pixels</strong> wide. With that in mind, the VDC can compose sprites made of <strong>16 x 16 pixels</strong> (1 x 1 tiles) to <strong>16 x 512 pixels</strong> (1 x 32 tiles). The reason for providing strangely tall compositions is because any sprite can also be <strong>combined horizontally</strong> by ‘attaching’ them to the previous one (though they still count as separate sprites). Overall, there’s a limit of <strong>96 sprites per scan-line</strong> and <strong>381 per frame</strong> <sup id="bibref:13"><a href="#bib:graphics-sprites" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></sup>, a large number compared to its competitors.</p><p>In terms of effects, sprites can be <strong>flipped</strong> and/or <strong>shrank</strong>.

With the latter, the console stores the rendered scan lines in the aforementioned buffer, instead of beaming them directly to the screen. Since the VDC incorporates enough memory for two scan lines, this allows the VDC to render one scan line while displaying the other one, thereby enabling games to update graphics during <strong>active display</strong> (aside from <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/#tab-3-5-result">H-Blank</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#tab-5-5-result">V-Blank</a>).</p><p>Truth to be told, the VDC will still be accessing VRAM at the same time, so the CPU must wait between 12 and 16 cycles <sup id="bibref:16"><a href="#bib:graphics-vram" role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></sup> (depending on the operation) before accessing VRAM again, otherwise the next operation will be ignored (hence the use of two VRAM variants).</p></div></div></div><h4 id="broadcasting-the-frame">Broadcasting the frame</h4><p>To broadcast the rendered scan lines, the process varies depending on the console variant (AES or MVS).</p><p>The home model adds a video encoder to generate the composite and RGB signals.

Bootlegged hardware was made from a combination of off-the-shelf and reverse-engineered chips, aiming to sell a cheaper alternative to SNK’s hardware.</p><p>Thus, on one side, you’ve got SNK trying to fend off bootleggers. On the other, game studios were enforcing that their code only ran on a genuine console and cartridge.</p><h3 id="combating-fake-consoles">Combating fake consoles</h3><p>Neither SNK nor game studios favoured running on bootlegged hardware (whether it’s a Neo Geo clone or a bootleg cartridge). Hence, many games bundled routines that fiddle with very particular areas of the motherboard (i.e. status flags, the real-time clock, the Watchdog, etc.) in an attempt to spot any defects from clone boards <sup id="bibref:30"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-slot_checks" role="doc-biblioref">[30]</a></sup>. Whenever any of these checks failed, the game would display a warning message and refuse to proceed.</p><h3 id="fighting-fake-cartridges">Fighting fake cartridges</h3><p>Considering cartridges housed an exceptional amount of integrated circuits, games implemented creative measures to combat piracy.</p><p>Starting with the common techniques, the System ROM contains a portion of data called <strong>Security Code</strong> that is compared side-by-side with the cartridge’s P ROM during boot <sup id="bibref:31"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-security_code" role="doc-biblioref">[31]</a></sup>. The bootloader will proceed only if both areas match.</p><p>Additionally, games like <em>Fatal Fury 2</em> also fiddle with its companion ‘PRO-CT0’ chip (a multiplexer for the CHA Board) to make sure the program is residing in an official cartridge <sup id="bibref:32"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-fatal_fury" role="doc-biblioref">[32]</a></sup>. Otherwise, it assumes it’s been cloned, triggering many anti-piracy <strong>unpleasantries</strong> (such as making the opponent invincible).</p><p>Later on, newer entries also stored <strong>encrypted data</strong> in C ROM, designed to be seamlessly decrypted by the ‘NEO-CMC’ (found on the CHA Board) <sup id="bibref:33"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-neo_cmc" role="doc-biblioref">[33]</a></sup>. This chip contained a set of unusual XOR functions to deobfuscate the graphics data before it reached the VDC <sup id="bibref:34"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-mame_cmc" role="doc-biblioref">[34]</a></sup>.</p><p>For extreme measures, games like ‘Metal Slug X’ bundled specialised ICs in their PROG board that complicated things further <sup id="bibref:35"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-progeop" role="doc-biblioref">[35]</a></sup>. They behaved similarly to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#anti-piracy-and-region-lock">Nintendo’s CIC system</a>, requiring constant game-chip communication.</p><p>All in all, this tells you that the anti-piracy battle was just another cat-and-mouse game. However, in this case, SNK was trying to get both home and arcade owners away from cheaper knock-offs.</p><h3 id="post-market-utilities">Post-market utilities</h3><p>Once the lifecycle of this console reached an end, a new phase emerged: <strong>Homebrew</strong> (running homemade software and/or hardware). At the time of this writing (June 2024), the most common practices are <strong>hardware modifications</strong>, <strong>firmware replacement</strong> and <strong>Flashcarts</strong>.</p><p>Thanks to its enthusiastic community, there are many online resources available that teach how to correct and/or modify MVS and AES hardware. These include converting MVS models to work outside cabinets (the so-called <strong>consolisation</strong>) while others focus on tackling deficiencies in particular models. For instance, the AES model I own had its video encoder bypassed, improving the quality of the RGB output.</p><p>On the firmware side, there have been developments like the ‘UNIVERSE BIOS’/UniBIOS. This is the equivalent of a <strong>custom firmware</strong> made to replace the original System ROM. Behind the scenes, the UniBIOS is made of an MVS’ System ROM modified to provide the additional abilities <sup id="bibref:36"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-unibios" role="doc-biblioref">[36]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>Swap between ‘MVS’ and ‘AES’ mode. This is very useful for AES systems as games have a hardcoded number of coins/lives, and switching to MVS mode enables to increase this amount arbitrarily.</li><li>Change the region. Some games are censored depending on the region they run on.</li><li>Activate cheats.</li></ul><p>Finally, to run arbitrary code in this console, stores are selling third-party flashcarts which can reprogram itself to replicate any past CHA and PROG boards. Due to their complexity, they’re not exactly affordable, but that’s another product Neo Geo owners have available nowadays.</p><hr/><h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s all folks</h2><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/myneogeo.d1bf2737369e3a6e8367ff114dcaad9770118a3983c6d0e93dd88eeed88d930e.webp"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/neogeo/_hu16a54698d487d616763510c1ee36c1cc_71934_e71f39921debaa40fbf07928c3ab12f9.webp 500w,
