    <h1>Ask HN: Why don&#39;t PCs have better entropy sources?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>After reading the thread &#34;Problems emerge for a unified /dev/*random&#34; (1) I was wondering why PCs don&#39;t have a bunch of sensors available to draw entropy from.<p>Is this assumption correct, that adding a magnetometer, accelerometer, simple GPS, etc to a motherboard would improve its entropy gathering? Or is there a mathematical/cryptographical rule that makes the addition of such sensors useless?</p><p>Do smartphones have better entropy gathering abilities? It seems like phones would be able to seed a RNG based on input from a variety of sensors that would all be very different between even phones in the same room. Looking at a GPS Android app like Satstat (2) it feels like there&#39;s a huge amount of variability to draw from.</p><p>If such sensors would add better entropy, would it really cost that much to add them to PC motherboards?</p><p>----</p><p>(1) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30848973" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30848973</a></p><p>(2) <a href="https://mvglasow.gitlab.io/satstat/" rel="nofollow">https://mvglasow.gitlab.io/satstat/</a> &amp; <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.vonglasow.michael.satstat/" rel="nofollow">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.vonglasow.michael.satsta...</a></p></div></div>
