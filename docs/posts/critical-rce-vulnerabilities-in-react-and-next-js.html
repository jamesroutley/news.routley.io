    <h1>Critical RCE Vulnerabilities in React and Next.js</h1>

Assigned CVE-2025-55182 (React) and CVE-2025-66478 (Next.js), this flaw allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on the server due to insecure deserialization. The vulnerability exists in the default configuration of affected applications, meaning standard deployments are immediately at risk. Due to the high severity and the ease of exploitation, immediate patching is required.</p><p>To maintain ecosystem safety while patches are applied, we are currently withholding specific details; the details provided here are intended solely to assist defenders in prioritizing remediation and understanding the risk. We will be updating this blog with additional information as it comes to light.</p><p><strong>CVE-2025-55182</strong> is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the <code>react-server</code> package used by React Server Components (RSC).</p><p><strong>CVE-2025-66478</strong> is the corresponding RCE vulnerability in Next.js, which inherits the same underlying flaw through its implementation of the RSC “Flight” protocol.</p><p>The vulnerability fundamentally resides in the react-server package and its handling of the RSC &#34;Flight&#34; protocol. It is characterized as a logical deserialization vulnerability where the server processes RSC payloads in an unsafe manner. When a server receives a specially crafted, malformed payload, it fails to validate the structure correctly. This allows attacker-controlled data to influence server-side execution logic, resulting in the execution of privileged JavaScript code.</p><p>In our experimentation, exploitation of this vulnerability had high fidelity, with a near 100% success rate and can be leveraged to a full remote code execution. The attack vector is unauthenticated and remote, requiring only a specially crafted HTTP request to the target server. It affects the default configuration of popular frameworks.</p><p>According to Wiz data, 39% of cloud environments have instances vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182 and/or CVE-2025-66478.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Vulnerable product</th><th>Patched release</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>React: 19.0, 19.1, 19.2</span></td><td><span>19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Next.js: 14.3.0-canary, 15.x,   and 16.x (App Router)</span></td><td><span> 14.3.0-canary.88, 15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6,   15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Any framework or library bundling the react-server implementation is likely affected.
