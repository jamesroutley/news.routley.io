<p>Apple is finalizing an agreement with OpenAI to bring some of its technology to the iPhone this year, according to a new <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-develops-ai-voice-assistant-as-it-chases-google-apple?offer=rtsu-engagement-24&amp;utm_campaign=RTSU+-+OpenAI+AI+ass&amp;utm_content=4159&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=2797&amp;rc=x5svxc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>.</em> With this deal, the report explains that Apple will be able to offer “a popular chatbot” powered by ChatGPT as part of its AI-focused features in iOS 18.</p>



<p>While Apple is also <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/17/gemini-apple-iphone-talks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in talks with Google</a> about an AI partnership, tonight’s report says Apple has “closed in on an agreement with OpenAI.”</p>



<p>“An OpenAI accord would let Apple offer a popular chatbot as part of a flurry of new AI features that it’s planning to announce next month,” the report explains. More specific details about how these features and integrations might work remain unclear for now.</p>



<p>From Mark Gurman at <em>Bloomberg</em>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The two sides have been finalizing terms for a pact to use ChatGPT features in Apple’s iOS 18, the next iPhone operating system, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. Apple also has held talks with Alphabet Inc.’s Google about licensing that company’s Gemini chatbot. Those discussions haven’t led to an agreement, but are ongoing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report cautions that there’s still “no guarantee” that a deal between Apple and OpenAI “will be announced imminently.” </p>



<p>A report on Thursday emphasized that iOS 18’s AI features will be powered (in part) by Apple data centers with Apple Silicon processors. The majority of iOS 18’s AI features, however, will be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/21/gurman-ios-18-ai-features-on-device/">powered entirely on-device</a>, allowing Apple to tout privacy and speed benefits.</p>



<p>Apple is slated to announce iOS 18 and its new AI features at WWDC, which kicks off with a special <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/26/wwdc-2024-official-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">event on June 10.</a></p>



<p>OpenAI is set to make its own, separate announcement during an event on Monday. <em>The Information</em> has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-develops-ai-voice-assistant-as-it-chases-google-apple?offer=rtsu-engagement-24&amp;utm_campaign=RTSU+-+OpenAI+AI+ass&amp;utm_content=4159&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=2797&amp;rc=x5svxc">reported</a> that one feature in development at OpenAI is an AI voice assistant to compete with Siri and Google Assistant. </p>
