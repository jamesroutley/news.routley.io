    <h1>My negative views on Rust (2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><strong>2023-10-13:</strong> Edited based on feedback, but preserves
the same content.</p>
<p>This is a little summary of my current thoughts on Rust. I wonder
whether I’ll look back in five years and see if my views have
changed.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>So that Gentle Reader knows that I’m not entirely biased against the
language, there are obviously positive things to appreciate about
it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust’s macros are very good. They act like Lisp’s macros, unlike
Haskell’s.</li>
<li>The fact that Rust has type-classes (“traits”) and sum types
(“enums”) and pattern matching is very attractive. Making orphans
package-wide rather than module-wide is a very good decision.</li>
<li>I like its treatment of records.</li>
<li>Its standard library does a few things well, like handling strings
as UTF-8.</li>
<li>Distinguishing mutability has its advantages, it’s easy to see that
a function is “morally” pure–if not actually pure–and that’s good for
reading.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unsafe-and-panic">Unsafe and panic</h2>
<p>The use of unsafe is a little disturbing, because many libraries
feature it, and people are tempted to use it on private work projects to
quickly get around the language’s limitations. But it’s not much
different to using an FFI. I don’t see this is a big downside.</p>
<p><code>panic</code> is a little more bothersome, because Rust
libraries go to great pains (with many syntactic tricks like
<code>?</code> and auto-conversions from smaller error types to larger
ones) to handle errors explicitly, but then panics unwind the stack to
the top of the process, and panics inside a panic don’t run destructors,
etc. The overall effect is that, like <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/three-questions-of-lang-design/">my
three questions of language design</a>, the answer to “how you handle
errors” is “at least two, incompatible ways.”</p>
<h2 id="take-sugar">Take Sugar?</h2>
<p>Rust’s use of magical sugar constructs, where the compiler will
automatically insert dereferences and copies and drops for you has an
initial appealing “it’s all simple underneath” quality to it, but in
practice this leads to bad compile errors: The worst kind of compile
error is the one where the compiler is complaining about something that
it generated for you, rather than something you explicitly wrote.</p>
<p>This can be compared with Haskell’s use of monads, that provide
syntactic sugar. The more magic you introduce, the harder it is for
newbies to learn and to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="fetishization-of-efficient-memory-representation">Fetishization
of Efficient Memory Representation</h2>
<p>I’ve watched people on calls that are a couple years into Rust spend
20 minutes attempting to understand why their perfectly reasonable code
doesn’t fit into Rust’s tight memory restrictions.</p>
<p>I’ve also been Rust-splained, by people with white in their hair,
with an air of misty-eyed revelation, that once you “get” Rust’s memory
model of the stack and the heap,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that things just all fit
together wonderfully. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s a
theme.</p>
<p>This touches on another topic I’d like to write about elsewhere: the
difference between practice and theory and how users of languages like
Rust and Haskell that make big promises and require big sacrifices don’t
seem to distinguish the difference. <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/reasoning-violently/">It’s not the
technology that’s working poorly, it’s that you’re using it
wrongly.</a></p>
<p>In practice, people just want to be able to write a tree-like type
without having to play Chess against the compiler. I predict that
tracing garbage collectors will become popular in Rust eventually.</p>
<p>This is both Rust’s main goal–be like C, no garbage collection,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but safe–and also its main downside.
People waste time on trivialities that will never make a difference.</p>
<h2 id="the-rewrite-fallacy">The Rewrite Fallacy</h2>
<p>I see a lot of “we rewrote X in Rust and it got faster” posts. I
think that if you rewrite anything from scratch with performance in
mind, you’ll see a significant performance improvement. I’m suspicious
of how much Rust itself is needed versus the developers having some
performance discipline.</p>
<h2 id="complexity">Complexity</h2>
<p>Rust has arrived at the complexity of Haskell and C++, each year
requiring more knowledge to keep up with the latest and greatest. Go was
designed as the antidote to this kind of endlessly increasing language
surface area. Endless libraries re-treading existing patterns (web
services, parsers, etc.) in Rust. As a long-term Haskeller, I’ve done
more than 15 years of riding a hamster wheel like that. It is fun for a
while, but at some point I grew tired of it. This aspect of Rust puts me
off. I don’t need another <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/tamagotchi-tooling/">tamagotchi</a>.</p>

<p>All new language communities are nice. When things don’t matter much,
people have no reason to get mad.</p>
<p>As soon as people have a stake in something, that’s when things heat
up and tempers come out. You get a stake in a programming language by
writing a lot of code in it, or by building a business on it. When you
have a stake in how a language works, you’re highly sensitive to changes
that will make you do more work than needed, or will limit your
goals.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this play out for Haskell. Around 2007, when I started with
Haskell, the community was friendly as anything, evangelic, open. People
praised it for this. Everyone just felt blessed to be able to use this
exciting language. Today, it’s more like any other community. What
happened? People started using Haskell for real, that’s all.</p>
<p>Rust is going through the same thing, much more rapidly. Is it a
reason to avoid Rust? No. But a “nice” community isn’t a reason to join
an upcoming language, either.</p>
<p>Since I wrote this, people are already trying to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36122270">fork Rust</a>
because they’re not happy with the governance of it. This doesn’t mean
anything deep other than that people are using Rust now, as stated
above, and the “friendly, welcoming” starts to become mixed with more
diverse moods and motivations.</p>
<h2 id="async-is-highly-problematic">Async is highly problematic</h2>
<p>Rust’s choice to exclude a runtime/scheduler blessed and built-in to
the language means they had to develop alternative strategies in the
language itself. This is not turning out well.</p>
<p><a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">Coloured
Functions</a> is a powerful metaphor for the incompatibility between
async and synchronous functions and the awkward situations that mixing
them introduces. Some blog posts have attempted to downplay the
situation by focusing on technical aspects of specific syntactic forms.
That doesn’t really matter, though, because the reality is much simpler:
Async code is easier to use when dependencies are in an async form.</p>
<p>People will choose libraries that are async over libraries that are
not. However, maintainers that have written good, maintained code, are
also resistant to adopt async.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One conversation I’ve overhead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Person 1: Another difference between diesel and sqlx is that diesel
is not async yet and from looking at the issues it doesn’t seem to be
priority yet.</p>
<p>Person 2: That sounds like a major issue</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating of the
pudding. Async introduces <a href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/399">long, heated
discussions.</a></p>
<p>The problem for Rust is that its users want a runtime, but want the
option of not having one. The result is a mess. When combined with
iterators, I think understanding such code is quite difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, I think Go, Erlang and Haskell are the better choice here
for general purpose use. A tracing garbage collector and green threads
make programmers more productive for general purpose programming (not
systems programming). Which brings me to the next section.</p>
<h2 id="as-a-general-purpose-language">As a general purpose
language</h2>
<p>I feel like Rust is self-defined as a “systems” language, but it’s
being used to write web apps and command-line tools and all sorts of
things.</p>
<p>This is a little disappointing, but also predictable: the more
successful your language, the more people will use your language for
things it wasn’t intended for.</p>
<p>This post still offends <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html">many who have tied Rust
to their identity</a>, but that’s their problem, not mine.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-if-any">Conclusions, if any</h2>
<p>I won’t be using Rust for any of my own personal projects for the
above stated reasons. But it was used at my job at the time of writing,
so I felt the need to express myself about it.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t mind using it as a replacement for single-threaded C
if I just use the standard library, that might be fun, although I don’t
do any embedded work, so I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>
<p>I think that the excellent tooling and dev team for Rust, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ3w_jec1v8">subsidized by Big
Tech</a>, pulls the wool over people’s eyes and convinces them that this
is a good language that is simple and worth investing in. There’s danger
in that type of thinking.</p>
