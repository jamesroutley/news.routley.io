    <h1>Fix the unit test and open a giant hole everywhere</h1>
    
    
<p>
Several years back, I was doing my thing in a corporate environment, 
working on a project with some friends.  By virtue of being in a very 
large company, we had quite the assortment of libraries which could be 
brought in to do stuff.  Given that we had a &#34;would be nice&#34; item on our 
feature list that involved doing something with the filesystem, I went 
looking for a matching feature, and it turned into a security dumpster 
fire.  Here&#39;s what happened.
</p>
<p>
Our program was going down a road where it might need to create a series 
of paths.  This is where you have &#34;/my/path&#34; and you need a couple of 
directories nested underneath it, so you end up with 
&#34;/my/path/project/staging&#34; and &#34;/my/path/project/prod&#34; and things like 
that.
</p>
<p>
When you&#39;re in that situation, you can&#39;t just mkdir() the final path.  
It won&#39;t work.  You have to start from the top and work your way down.  
The ones which already exist will probably fail with -EEXIST, so 
sometimes it makes more sense to look at what&#39;s there, work your way 
down, and then start the mkdir calls when you find that point.
</p>
<p>
So, you can either do this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>mkdir(&#34;/my&#34;) : -EEXIST<br/>
</li>
<li>mkdir(&#34;/my/path&#34;) : -EEXIST<br/>
</li>
<li>mkdir(&#34;/my/path/project&#34;) : this one works fine<br/>
</li>
<li>mkdir(&#34;/my/path/project/staging&#34;) : this works fine too<br/>
</li>
<li>mkdir(&#34;/my/path/project/prod&#34;) : and this one is also okay</li>
</ol>
<p>
Or, you can do something more like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>lstat(&#34;/my&#34;) : works, and is a directory, carry on<br/>
</li>
<li>lstat(&#34;/my/path&#34;) : works, is a directory, carry on<br/>
</li>
<li>lstat(&#34;/my/path/project&#39;&#34;) : -ENOENT, okay, switch to calling mkdir!<br/>
</li>
<li>mkdir(&#34;/my/path/project&#34;) : this succeeds</li>
</ol>
<p>
... and so on down the line.  You get the idea.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, this is the kind of thing that takes a little work to 
get right, and once someone does that, it would be nice to share it with 
the rest of the company.  For that reason, I went looking into the 
&#34;common&#34; part of our code base to see what we had in terms of &#34;directory 
creation utilities&#34;.  Maybe we&#39;d have something which did this already!
</p>
<p>
What I found was... disturbing.  I found a function that claimed to 
create directories, but it wasn&#39;t just a simple passthrough to the usual
C library mkdir() function.  It also didn&#39;t do anything like the above.  
It basically did this (in pseudocode):
</p>
<pre class="terminal">void create_a_directory(path) {
  system(&#34;mkdir -p &#34; + path);
}
</pre>
<p>
Yep, that&#39;s right, it was kicking off a subprocess to run 
<em>the mkdir program,</em>
that is, the thing that&#39;s probably sitting in your /bin directory right 
now if you are using something vaguely Unixy right now.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re on a Mac running Monterey, it&#39;s this thing:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  134144 Dec  7 15:39 /bin/mkdir
</pre>
<p>
Why would someone change this function to do this?  Well, the &#34;-p&#34; 
switch is the magic part.  The actual &#39;mkdir&#39; command-line tool supports 
that to &#34;create intermediate directories as required&#34;.  It handles all 
of that stuff I mentioned earlier, and you can see why someone might 
want to &#34;leverage&#34; that.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, in doing this, it created an enormous security hole, too.  
The C system() call runs subcommands *through a shell*, and whatever you 
pass to the shell is subject to all kinds of fun shell expansion rules.
</p>
<p>
These shell expansion rules include a semicolon to split commands.  This 
means if you can get a semicolon and another command in there, it will 
happily run it right after the &#34;mkdir -p /whatever&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Worse, since this was changed in a common function that all kinds of 
programs at the company used, it meant that
<em>anything that created a directory in that language</em>
(with that library) was now vulnerable to this kind of injection.
</p>
<p>
Imagine it.  At some point, you write something that creates temporary 
paths based on a username or something like this.  You call your 
company&#39;s common directory thing, and it just calls mkdir() which takes 
a path and nothing more.  If someone passes in some username like 
&#34;foo;touch you.are.owned&#34;, that just becomes part of the directory 
name.  Really.  It&#39;s just a goofy name on the filesystem, and nothing 
bad happens.
</p>
<p>
Then, one day years later, someone changes that common tool to system() 
out to something, and now it creates a directory called &#34;foo&#34; and then 
creates an empty file called &#34;you.are.owned&#34;.  It&#39;s trivial to change 
it to do something far nastier at that point, like opening a shell to 
somewhere else, exfiltrating data, or whatever.  Your program is now 
wide open to this kind of attack and you&#39;ve changed nothing.
</p>
<p>
I guess it should not surprise you that we had to undo this, and then 
had to get everyone who used this function to recompile and ship a new 
version of their stuff.  That was &#34;fun&#34;.
</p>
<p>
So finally, you&#39;re probably wondering why this happened, and why someone 
would change a function that called a C library function into something 
that ran a $(*^&amp;$( subprocess.  Ah, well, that&#39;s easy.  Someone had a 
unit test that called that directory creation function with a 
complicated path that had several elements.  Sometimes, not all of the 
intermediate directories existed, and then it would fail.  They knew 
that &#34;mkdir -p&#34; is what they&#39;d do by hand, but they needed the program 
to do it for them.  They changed the common library, checked it in, 
reran their unit test, and now it started passing, so they were done.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s how it happens: a tiny little change flings the door wide open.
Someone solves their own local problem and misses the bigger picture.
</p>
<p>
May your holidays be free from this kind of fixing.
