    <h1>Raspberry Pi/PlatformIO conflict blocks support for Pico-Arduino toolchain</h1>

          <blockquote>
<p dir="auto">To ensure the smooth operation of our business and to continue investing in innovative solutions for embedded development, we charge licensing fees to silicon vendors seeking access to our ecosystem. This approach enables us to sustainably scale the PlatformIO business. It is critical to emphasize that leveraging the PlatformIO community as a means to avoid these licensing fees is not a viable strategy. Please note that any attempts by commercial entities to integrate their packages without adhering to our licensing requirements will not be approved, as clearly outlined on our pricing page (<a href="https://registry.platformio.org/pricing" rel="nofollow">https://registry.platformio.org/pricing</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I think some of the confusion here is due to seemingly contradicting terminology in various places, if your ecosystem is only open to hardware vendors that have commercial licensing agreements with PlatformIO that would appear to contradict statements such as this on your homepage <a href="https://platformio.org/" rel="nofollow">&#34;A place where Developers and Teams have true Freedom(Use favorite OS, IDE, Hardware and Software tools)! No more vendor lock-in!&#34;</a> which implies developers are free to use and contribute support for new vendor hardware platforms to the open source areas of PlatformIO regardless of whether or not a hardware vendor has made a licensing agreement with PlatformIO.</p>
<p dir="auto">If I&#39;m understanding the situation correctly you might want to clarify somewhere that PlatformIO is only supported with hardware produced by hardware vendors that have licensing agreements with PlatformIO and that developers need to choose amongst those supported hardware platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s also unclear what would happen if a hardware vendor were to say stop paying recurring licensing fees/terminate a licensing agreement with PlatformIO or go out of business. Would that mean that PlatformIO would also drop support for the hardware platform as soon as the hardware vendor stopped paying for PlatformIO support?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">At PlatformIO Labs, we firmly believe in upholding the principles of transparency and fairness within the open-source ecosystem. While many silicon vendors often consider open-source communities as entities they can freely benefit from, it is important to recognize that open source does not equate to &#34;free.&#34; We have adopted an open-core business model at PlatformIO Labs, which means that most solutions for embedded developers are licensed under the highly permissive Apache 2.0 license. Our intention is to provide access to professional embedded software without charging developers directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Isn&#39;t an open-core business model just one where the closed source components of a project have license fees/restrictions while the open source components on their own do not(aside from any of the usual open source license requirements for a particular component)? It seems odd to use open-core business model as a reason for gatekeeping external contributions to the open source components of a project like in this case.</p>
<p dir="auto">Many companies build non-opensource applications that run on top of the Linux kernel, however it would be unusual if vendors or community contributors were required to pay licensing fees to say the Linux Foundation or some other organization simply in order to be allowed to submit patches adding new hardware support to the upstream Linux kernel.</p>
<p dir="auto">A policy such as that would make a project like Linux much less likely to be used in general as that would discourage usage/contributions by hardware vendors and thus in turn would discourage usage of the kernel by software developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Thank you once again for bringing this matter to our attention. We appreciate your support in upholding the integrity of the PlatformIO community and ensuring fair and transparent practices within the open-source ecosystem <g-emoji alias="pray" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f64f.png">üôè</g-emoji></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">As a matter of transparency I think it would be a good idea to add some more detailed vendor hardware license cost information to the pricing page (<a href="https://registry.platformio.org/pricing" rel="nofollow">https://registry.platformio.org/pricing</a>) as it&#39;s not clear at all what it costs for a vendor to add support for a new hardware to PlatformIO.</p>
