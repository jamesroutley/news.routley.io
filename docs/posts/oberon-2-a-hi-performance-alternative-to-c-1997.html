<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>



Oberon is a highly efficient, general-purpose programming language, descendant of Pascal and

         Modula-2.  It  is simpler yet more powerful than its predecessors.  Oberon  programs are structured,

         modular and type-safe.  Object-oriented programming is supported through the type extension mech-

         anism, single inheritance, procedural variables, type-bound methods, data hiding and encapsulation,

         and  garbage collection.  Both  standalone and integrated Oberon compilers are available for most

         types of popular computer platforms.

</p><h2>1.  Oberon:  the new Pascal</h2>



Oberon [1] is a modern, general-purpose programming  language which has all the essential features of other popular

    object-oriented programming languages, such as classes, inheritance, methods and messages.  At  the same time,

    &#34;Oberon&#34; is also the name of an extensible operating system [2]

written in Oberon programming language.  Both,

    the  language and the system, were developed by Prof. Niklaus Wirth and collaborators at Eidgenössische  Technische

    Hochschule (ETH) in Züurich.  As  a legitimate heir in the Pascal family, designed by the same person who also designed

    Pascal and Modula-2, Oberon is both an old and new programming language.  It relies on three decades of experience

    and development.  At  the same time, Oberon is simpler yet more powerful than its predecessors Pascal and Modula-2.
