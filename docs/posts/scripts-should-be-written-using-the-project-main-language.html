    <h1>Scripts should be written using the project main language</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is an <a>hot-take</a> Iâ€™ve been feeling for a long time.</p><p>Almost all projects Iâ€™ve worked on have scripts we wrote to automate a <strong>repetitive process</strong>. Consecutively, the majority of the scripts became obsolete and unmaintainable after some weeks because we either didnâ€™t need them anymore or they have become too <strong>complex</strong> to be looked at. Afterward, these scripts are either refactored or they stay forever in the <em>scripts graveyard</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freitzzz/cinderela/master/blog/general/clipart/tombstone-128.png" alt="A clipart styled tombstone labeled with RIP"/><figcaption><p>Never forget to pay your respects for all the scripts we left to rot ðŸ«¡ (<a href="https://clipart-library.com/clipart/rTjKGajec.htm">Source</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>I think one of the major reasons that led to this outcome is that we wrote the scripts in <code>Bash</code> or <code>Python</code>. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m a big fan of the two, but I feel like teams can <strong>win</strong> more if they write scripts using the <strong>main</strong> language their project is developed with. From the start, <em>time</em> and <em>effort</em> required to write them is reduced since:</p><ul><li>The learning curve is <strong>minimal</strong> since you already know the corners of the language</li><li>Internal language APIs can be leveraged, which drastically changes the <strong>mental model</strong> to write the script (for the better)</li><li>Scripts feel more <strong>natural</strong> and eventually <strong>maintainability</strong> increases. Team members are <strong>familiarized</strong> with the language!</li><li>Development machines <strong>compatibility</strong> increases. Windows users can finally run all scripts. ðŸ¤­</li></ul><p>The downside of going in this direction is the main language <strong>runtime</strong> support. Not every language is multi-paradigm or was designed to support scripting. For example, writing scripts on <code>JVM</code> languages would require additional effort to build a <strong>toolchain</strong> that compiles and runs files on the fly, with a short start time. But if you work on a web frontend project (<code>JavaScript</code>), the power is in your hands.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is up to teams to talk and establish an <strong>agreement</strong> on which language fits best their needs and <strong>standardize</strong> their scripting language. If they can use the main language, awesome. If they canâ€™t, a higher-level scripting language with native support (e.g., <code>Python</code>) should be adopted, since it provides the means to increase maintainability in the long run.</p></div></div>
