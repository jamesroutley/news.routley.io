<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy-focused browser DuckDuckGo is <a href="https://x.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1944766326381089118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rolling out</a> a new setting that lets users filter out AI images in search results. The company says it’s launching the feature in response to feedback from users who said AI images can get in the way of finding what they’re looking for. </p>

<p>Users can access the new setting by conducting a search on DuckDuckGo and heading to the Images tab. From there, they will see a new dropdown menu titled “AI images.” Users can then choose whether or not they want to see AI content by selecting “show” or “hide.”</p>







<p>Users can also turn on the filter in their search settings by tapping the “Hide AI-Generated Images” option.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo’s new feature comes as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/ai-generated-slop-slowly-killing-internet-nobody-trying-to-stop-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internet is being flooded</a> with AI “slop,” which refers to low-quality media content made using generative AI technology. </p>

<p>“The filter relies on manually curated open-source blocklists, including the ‘nuclear’ list, provided by uBlockOrigin and uBlacklist Huge AI Blocklist,” DuckDuckGo said in a <a href="https://x.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1944766326381089118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a>. “While it won’t catch 100% of AI-generated results, it will greatly reduce the number of AI-generated images you see.”</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo says it plans on adding additional filters in the future, but didn’t provide specifics. </p>

<p>It’s worth noting that DuckDuckGo’s example for the new feature depicts an image search for a baby peacock, likely in reference to Google facing <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/articles/google-ai-slop-invasion-feels-130000513.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy last year</a> for showing more AI-generated images of baby peacocks rather than real-life images when conducting an image search for the bird. </p>
