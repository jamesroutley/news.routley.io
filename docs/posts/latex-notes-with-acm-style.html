    <h1>LaTeX notes with ACM style</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-3lgtpi4n="">  <p>Having recently (albeit unsuccessfully) submitted a paper to an <a href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> conference, I came to really like the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Primary Article Template</a>. It feels modern, it’s the right kind of opinionated-with-good-defaults for my brain, and it’s <a href="https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/acmart/acmart.pdf">reasonably well documented</a>. Developing this kind of stuff is the kind of thing professional societies ought to be doing. Thanks, the ACM!</p>
<p>However, it’s <em>not</em> particularly compatible with the bog-standard article style that is the standard way to start stuff from scratch in LaTeX. And if you want to start a clean document to think in or to share a quick note, the ACM template is adding a lot of visual and cognitive nonsense. (No, ACM, I don’t want to look at an ISBN and DOI right now, and this has neither a conference nor journal name, it’s going in an email.)</p>
<p>So here, for my personal reference as much as anything else, is a LaTeX document that works in Overleaf in 2024 that manipulates the <code>acmart</code> template in what feels, to me, like a reasonable and minimal way.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>\documentclass</span><span>[acmsmall,screen]{</span><span>acmart</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>%% Extra classes and definitions here</span></span>

<span></span>

<span></span>
<span><span>% Uncomment for bibliography</span></span>
<span><span>% \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}</span></span>
<span><span>% \bibliography{main}</span></span>
<span><span>\end</span><span>{document}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>By misusing <code>acmConference</code> options and not declaring authors, every page ends up with a header saying “Draft, Author Name, Today’s Date.” By misusing the <code>\acmYear</code> option, a seemingly-mandatory line at the bottom of the front page says something reasonable about the draft status. (Deleting this leaves an awkward period.) Everything else seems like a reasonable and documented use of the ACM package, so it should work for drafting stuff that you eventually want to include in an <code>acmart</code> document, or pulling stuff out of an <code>acmart</code> document for review or editing.</p>
