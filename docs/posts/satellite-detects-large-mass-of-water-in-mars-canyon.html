This is very much like Earth&#39;s permafrost regions, where water ice permanently persists under dry soil because of the constant low temperatures.&#34; </p><p>The instrument&#39;s unique observational capabilities allowed the team to detect water that remained hidden before, Malakhov said. This could be water ice or water that is attached to minerals within the soil. But the scientists believe the presence of ice is more likely because the minerals at this location contain little water.</p><p>There are higher temperatures near the equator on Mars, so the researchers believe there must be some special blend of conditions that allow the water to remain and be replenished. </p><div><div><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/15/world/perseverance-rover-mars-findings-scn/index.html"><img alt="Perseverance rover makes &amp;#39;completely unexpected&amp;#39; volcanic discovery on Mars" data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211215134242-jezero-crater-041821-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211215134242-jezero-crater-041821-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211215134242-jezero-crater-041821-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211215134242-jezero-crater-041821-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211215134242-jezero-crater-041821-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211215134242-jezero-crater-041821-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/211215134242-jezero-crater-041821-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></a></div></div></div><p>&#34;This finding is an amazing first step, but we need more observations to know for sure what form of water we&#39;re dealing with,&#34; said study coauthor HÃ¥kan Svedhem, a former project scientist for the orbiter, in a statement.</p><p>&#34;The finding demonstrates the unrivalled abilities of TGO&#39;s instruments in enabling us to &#39;see&#39; below Mars&#39; surface -- and reveals a large, not-too-deep, easily exploitable reservoir of water in this region of Mars.&#34;</p><p>Future missions to Mars will land at lower latitudes.
