<p data-block-key="29qfy">A couple years ago, through Ask a Manager comment threads (<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/188260/neuroatypicality-in-the-workplace">some links</a>), I learned about <a href="https://askjan.org/">the Job Accommodation Network</a> which has <a href="https://askjan.org/a-to-z.cfm">a giant organized list of accommodations an employer could make</a>, sorted &#34;by disability, by limitation, by work-related function, by topic, and by accommodation&#34;.</p><p data-block-key="5thhb">For example, if you manage an autistic person, JAN can suggest <a href="https://askjan.org/disabilities/Autism-Spectrum.cfm#ideas">accommodation ideas (including products to buy and strategies to implement)</a> so you can talk about them with your employee and jointly consider them.</p><p data-block-key="2d1h0">Or, if you&#39;re <a href="https://askjan.org/disabilities/Fragrance-Sensitivity.cfm">sensitive to fragrances</a>, JAN can suggest accommodations you could request, such as a <a href="https://askjan.org/solutions/Powered-Air-Purifying-Respirator-PAPR.cfm">Powered Air Purifying Respirator</a> -- including specific vendors and models, with links to buy.</p><p data-block-key="bpoo4">Or, if you are having trouble with a particular limitation, even if you don&#39;t have a specific diagnosed disability, you can use the <a href="https://askjan.org/a-to-z.cfm#box-by-limitation2">By Limitation tab</a> to look up issues you&#39;ve noticed and start trying out ideas for addressing them -- at work, at home, and elsewhere. And <a href="https://askjan.org/info-by-role.cfm#for-individuals">JAN helps you effectively request accommodations at work</a>.</p><p data-block-key="fd33f">Or, if you want to make your community group more generally accessible, you can check out the <a href="https://askjan.org/a-to-z.cfm#box-by-work-related-function3">By Work RelatedÂ Function tab</a> to look up relevant tasks and consider accommodations you can make available.</p><p data-block-key="a3m37">And if you aren&#39;t aiming to do anything at all, it&#39;s still fascinating to click around the site and find out that <a href="https://askjan.org/solutions/Odor-Absorption.cfm?csSearch=3972484_1">odor-absorbing underwear</a> and <a href="https://askjan.org/solutions/Simulated-Skylights-and-Windows.cfm?csSearch=3972485_1">simulated windows</a> and <a href="https://askjan.org/publications/consultants-corner/vol05iss01.cfm">a support person at work</a> are possible!</p><p data-block-key="eu0qa">What a lovely and utopian project, to help us learn and think of ways to help each other do stuff.</p>
