    <h1>AI cheats: Why you didn&#39;t notice your teammate was cheating</h1>

<p>For the past few years, cheats have evolved rapidly. First came memory reading aimbots, then colorbots, and now AI aim assist. Cheats have escaped the host PC. How does it affect the players and anti-cheats?</p>

<p>That&#39;s me, or the handle that I use online. I&#39;ve been in the video game hacking scene on and off for what seems like forever. I don&#39;t know the exact point when I stumbled upon it, but I was making my first cheats on my Android phone when I was 12.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have a PC at the time, so I sat on my bed with a rooted phone in my hands that had GameGuardian installed. I remember writing a trainer with Lua for a game called Growtopia. I&#39;ve since gotten a PC and programmed a few more cheats. Most notably Unibot, an open-source colorbot. <a href="#unibot">[1]</a></p>

<h2>Colorbots, why they work... or don’t</h2>
<p>Colorbots read the enemy positions from the screen. They scan every pixel and filter based on enemy colors. It works for games that have colored enemy highlights or outlines.</p>
<p>Their flaw is that they don&#39;t work in every game, and they can merge multiple enemies into a single target if they are too close together. This can lock the cheater’s aim between enemies, unable to shoot either.</p>

<p>Colorbots became popular as the first cheats to achieve aimbot without memory reading. Colorbots are quite hard to detect. You can essentially just plug in a capture card to your PC and pass the images to another PC that the cheat runs on.</p>
<p>The aimbot input can be sent along with your normal mouse input through an Arduino or a KMBox. Just plug the KMBox to your PC and connect both the cheat PC and your mouse to it.</p>

</div>
<h2>AI cheats are essentially advanced colorbots</h2>
<p>Colorbots don&#39;t work on all games, because not all games have distinct enemy colors. This is where AI comes in. Developers train AI models to detect enemies, then distribute these models to users. This makes a single cheat work on every game imaginable.</p>
<p>So, the host PC only has a capture card and a &#34;mouse&#34; plugged into it, and the second PC runs the cheat. The anti-cheat has no idea, and...</p>
<h2>You have no idea</h2>
<p>You probably won’t notice the cheat while spectating, because cheat developers are intentionally nerfing their cheats to evade detection. Anti-cheats have made cheats more expensive, time-consuming, and less effective.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s cheats cost more but do less. Now a typical cheater needs an extra PC, external hardware, and $5-500 monthly payments just to bypass a decent anti-cheat.</p>
<p>After all that, they are still at a risk of getting banned. Cheaters must reflash their BIOS, wipe their PCs, reinstall Windows, and create a new account to play again. That&#39;s not something I&#39;d like to do once a few weeks.</p>

<p>So you being unable to spot a slight aim assist while spectating is normal. Of course you&#39;ll notice the aim assist if the player is insanely bad and has the aimbot configured wrong, but that&#39;s just plain stupidity being witnessed.</p>

    [1] Unibot is an open-source colorbot I made late 2023. It was not the first of its kind but it made waves within the cheating community. It was the first user-friendly, modifiable colorbot compatible with games like Valorant, Overwatch, and Roblox.
</p><p>...yes Roblox. It has many FPS games that people play. Bad Business and Rivals are my favorites, but most people seemed to use Unibot for Arsenal. Unibot had a config file that you could use to change the important values. It was the first time users would not have to touch code to make the cheat work on their favourite game.</p>
<p>Unibot is still available on my GitHub. If you’re interested, check out the <a href="https://github.com/vike256/Unibot/wiki/Guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Wiki</a>. The documentation is quite good for a game cheat.</p>
