    <h1>John Carmack and John Romero reunited to talk DOOM on its 30th Anniversary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the launch of Doom, id Software co-founders John Carmack and John Romero <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432">reunited to talk about the legendary FPS</a>. The discussion was moderated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://linktr.ee/davidlcraddock" target="_blank" data-url="https://linktr.ee/davidlcraddock">David Craddock</a> (The FPS Documentary, Long Live Mortal Kombat), with interview questions from Craddock and the Twitch chat.</p><p>The conversation was understandably warm and celebratory, but I was also surprised at how critical the two were of their own work. Carmack alluded to &#34;flashier&#34; (and potentially technically riskier) graphical effects he wishes he had built into Doom&#39;s engine, and he noted that he thinks the more grounded, military sci-fi aesthetic of Episode One has aged better than the abstract hellscapes later in the game.</p><p>Romero, meanwhile, contrasted Doom with the id games before and after, arguing it represented a technical &#34;sweet spot&#34; before Quake and full 3D acceleration started to seriously complicate development and limit how many enemies they could fit on screen. The developer praised Doom&#39;s engine for allowing more complex maps than Wolfenstein though, ruefully remarking that &#34;Making levels for Wolfenstein had to be the most boring level design job ever.&#34;</p><p>The two also fondly reminisced about the technical limitations of the time. Carmack remarked that, although he thought id could &#34;just sell [Doom] in a brown paper bag&#34; off its quality alone, he was glad they went the extra mile with its iconic box art and marketing. Both devs expressed an appreciation for &#39;90s PC big box packaging and accompanying &#34;feelies&#34; like cloth maps, and I&#39;m 100% with them on that.</p><p>As far as development stories, I was struck by Romero&#39;s recollection of getting multiplayer working for the first time shortly before Doom&#39;s release: &#34;I went into my office—I was making E1M7 at the time—I&#39;m looking out the window and I&#39;m seeing two characters fighting, rockets are flying up at a high window and someone is plasma gunning the other guy.</p><p>And I&#39;m like, this is going to be the coolest fucking game the planet has ever seen, I can&#39;t wait to play that.&#34;</p><iframe width="620" height="378" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2000693432&amp;parent=www.pcgamer.com"></iframe><p>&#34;I&#39;ve said before that I&#39;m not a very sentimental person, that I don&#39;t spend a lot of time reminiscing about the good old days,&#34; Carmack confided as a means of farewell, &#34;But they were really quite good. I&#39;m very proud of the things that we built back then and that they have this legacy that&#39;s lasted to this day.&#34;</p><p>Romero echoed the sentiment, thanking Carmack for the years they spent working together, and also extending his appreciation to the players who keep coming back to Doom: &#34;I want to thank everybody in the Doom community for keeping this game alive. And really, just thank you for playing our games everybody.&#34;</p><p>You can check out the conversation in its entirety on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432">John Romero&#39;s Twitch channel</a>, and it&#39;s also a perfect time to dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://romero.com/sigil" target="_blank" data-url="https://romero.com/sigil">Sigil 2</a>, the sequel to Romero&#39;s 2019 Doom megawad and subject of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gamer-magazines-latest-issue-on-sale-now-sigil-ii-and-dooms-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gamer-magazines-latest-issue-on-sale-now-sigil-ii-and-dooms-30th-anniversary//">PC Gamer&#39;s latest print cover story</a>.
