<p>AT&amp;T&#39;s contract with VMware may be one of the firm&#39;s bigger accounts. A 1,050 percent price hike would be another level, however, even for a company the size of AT&amp;T. Per Johnson&#39;s email, AT&amp;T and Broadcom have had a &#34;strategic relationship&#34; for over a decade.</p>
<p>The email reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>… AT&amp;T has decided to pursue a legal strategy along with a disciplined plan to invest to migrate away, all of which will quickly become public. I truly wish we had another option. Unfortunately, this decision will impact the future of our overall relationship and how we manage spend in other Broadcom areas.</p></blockquote>
<h2>AT&amp;T on potentially migrating off VMware</h2>
<p>In her email, Johnson points to migration costs as impacting how much AT&amp;T is willing to pay for VMware.</p>
<p>According to the message, projected costs for moving AT&amp;T off of VMware are $40 million to $50 million. AT&amp;T is said to use VMware-based VMs for customer services operations and for operations management efficiency. Per AT&amp;T’s email, migration “has a very quick payback&#34; and &#34;strong&#34; internal rate of return, &#34;especially given the high licensing costs proposed.&#34;</p>
<p>On September 20,<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/att-sues-broadcom-for-refusing-to-renew-perpetual-license-support/"> Broadcom requested</a> that AT&amp;T&#39;s request to block Broadcom from discontinuing VMware support be denied. In legal documents [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/att_broadcom.pdf">PDF</a>], Broadcom said that AT&amp;T is planning to ditch VMware and that AT&amp;T could have spent &#34;the last several months or even years” making the transition.</p>
<p>In an affidavit filed on September 27 [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ATT_Johnson_affidavit.pdf">PDF</a>], Johnson stated that her email to Tan does not suggest that migration “would be easy, quick, or inexpensive” and that “none of those would be accurate statements.&#34;</p>
