    <h1>How do other animals see the world?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Seeing through one eye or many, in technicolour or black and white, few animals experience the world as we do.</p>

<p>By analysing the properties of animals&#39; visual systems, we can model what the world would look like through their eyes.</p>

<p>Each cone type contains a pigment sensitive to particular wavelengths of light. The range of colours an animal sees depends on the combination of colour-sensitive pigments in their eye and the processing by the brain.</p>
<p>With fewer cone types, dogs can&#39;t distinguish between as many colours as we can.</p>

<p>Other cells in our eyes, called rod cells, help us see in dim light. But because rod cells only have a single light-sensitive pigment, at night we see in shades of grey.</p>
<p>Geckos, on the other hand, have excellent colour vision at night - a useful advantage for a nocturnal hunter. Their eyes have evolved to be up to 350 times more sensitive to colour at night than ours.</p>

<p>Pinhole eyes are the shape of a deep cup and have a narrow opening, but no lens. They are just one of an enormous variety of eyes owned by molluscs - animals such as slugs, snails, oysters and octopuses - which demonstrate different steps in eye evolution.</p>
<p>Although giant clams are sensitive to three different colours of light, they are unable to combine the information - instead, they see colourful but undefined images. However, their eyes are able to detect nearby movement, so that the clams can take action either by squirting a jet of water to startle a potential predator or by closing their shell.</p>

<p>Their biggest pair of eyes face forward and give the spider high-resolution vision. The other, smaller eyes are used for peripheral vision and detecting motion.</p>
<p>Jumping spiders can see a broader spectrum of colours than we can. They even have pigments sensitive to ultraviolet light, so they are able to see more details in this flower&#39;s petals than we can.</p>
