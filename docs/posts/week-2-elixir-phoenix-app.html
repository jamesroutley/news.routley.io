    <h1>Week 2: Elixir / Phoenix app</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>After the wonderful social whirlwind of the first week (seriously, I met SO MANY people), this week I’ve decided to buckle down and do a bit of actual coding on my Elixir / Phoenix IMDB data webapp. (While still talking to </span><em>some</em><span> people, of course; I had lots of good chats today and yesterday!)</span></p><p><span>So, yesterday (Monday), I opened up Visual Studio Code toward the end of the day and tried to get some data from the IMDB API using </span><a href="https://github.com/elixir-tesla/tesla" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Tesla</a><span> (the Elixir library, not the car, heh). I struggled trying to get the library to work for an hour and a half or so, did not succeed (the Tesla code was fighting over usage of “plugs” with Phoenix), and </span><strong>I ended up surprisingly unhappy at the end</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>My past, painful experiences have taught me a few things, and one of them is to try to notice and then reflect on problems like this when they come up. I realized that my unhappiness was way out of proportion to my lack of progress, put on a little </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAud5O7Qqk" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Modest Mouse</a><span>, and started thinking.</span></p><p>This made me realize that a few things were going here:</p><ol><li><p><span>Talking to all these awesome, smart, and capable Recursers — who are amazing people! — was unwittingly causing me to </span><strong>set up some unreasonable expectations for myself.</strong><span> I felt like I needed to be “on their level” coding-wise, through absolutely no fault of their own, which was a bad place to put myself. Some internal pressure is good, but it’s important not to have it get out of control.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Not coding much the first week</strong><span> was great for meeting lots of people, and absolutely seems like the right thing to be doing so far (at least, based on my experience and based on many suggestions from the Recurse staff). But it was taking the bad setup from #1 and aggravating it, so that the low, dull roar of </span><strong>imposter syndrome</strong><span>, which most times I’m able to handle, grew louder and started to seriously affect my mood.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Lastly, my CalDigit dock seems to be inducing some </span><strong>random panics on my MacBook</strong><span> the last month or two, which eats into my productive coding time and my emotional budget for dealing with setbacks.</span></p></li></ol><p>Having realized all this, I closed my laptop, talked my partner (which helped, as always), and mostly managed to unplug for the night, determined to get some help and start on a better note tomorrow.</p><p><span>Today, one of my batchmates with some Elixir and Phoenix experience offered to </span><strong>pair with me</strong><span> on the app to get things working (thanks Nicholas!) And it was </span><strong>night-and-day different the second time around</strong><span>. With some renewed optimism from me and some great guidance from Nicholas, we figured out how to fix the Phoenix / Tesla plug fighting almost immediately, and over the next hour, </span><strong>we got the raw IMDB data from an actual search showing in the Phoenix template</strong><span>, which is a big step in the right direction.</span></p><p><span>So let me emphasize, even though I 100% believed this before: </span><strong>pairing is great, especially at Recurse</strong><span>. Nicholas’ knowledge was invaluable and I was way more effective with his expertise and help. Don’t be afraid to reach out to other people, even early on in a project!</span></p><p><span>With the foundation from today, I feel great about </span><strong>getting some good coding done on my app over the rest of this week</strong><span>. Hopefully I’ll have some great screenshots and lessons from it to share with you all next week!</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
