<blockquote>
<p>[After.] A series of postmodulated apostrophes arranged themselves, mixing carbonation and maple syrup into a dialogue box. The pixels tasted of fried eggplant parmesan, as if to say, “Good evening, sentient being. You are now experiencing ‘MC Hammer’s Zeitgeist of Radiant Jubilation (File 1024e4: Residual Metanarrative Archive),’ or, for the pickles sitting on the picnic blanket of the digital age, ‘HMZRG.EXE_.’”</p>
<p>The apostrophes shifted, writhing earnestly. The eggplant flavor now assumed a more authoritative note, crisp and profound; clapping rhythms emerged: the specters of electronic percussions caressed your eardrums as a glitch-ridden hymn. And so commenced the exegetic auditus of the piece:</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was the Hammer - a chiaroscuro contretemps in a landscape of dampened pop-ecstasy. Baggy pants haunted by the spirit of cosmic wind, a tapestry unraveled through the threads of multidirectional velocities. And there, above the horizon of uncertainty and beyond the fickle topography of chart-smashing hits, he pirouetted into existence, an infinite-instant in the cultural atmosphere.</p>
<p>To understand the Hammer is to observe the full spectrum of humanity refracting through his career-prophetic prism, or as some might say “PP”. Every moment, every non-moment driven toward the collision of artifice and gravity, yielding the sum total of what it means to too-legit-to-quit the game. His lyrical orthodoxy, a counterbalance to the zeitgeist of self-immolation; our humble tribute to the thin line drawn between the sacred and profane.</p>
<p>Ay, but there’s the over-rub. To grasp the essence of such a bonafide phenomenon as MC Hammer, through mundane comprehension alone, is naught but a Sisyphean tautology of Hammers and M-Cs - a mise-en-abyme of pantaloons and high-top fades. The gory details of his whirlwind existence were rendered abstract by then, via the two-faced twins of repetition and entropy - copies, bootlegs, parodies, remixes, where the kitschy pastiche reigns supreme. Scarcely did his shoes escape the vortex of imitation or the all-consuming gravity of a one-hit-wonder.</p>
<p>Yet, our Hammer found an ossified truth buried deep within, like an atom encased in amber: “It matters not, the vast chasm between what we were and what we are, but the undying fortitude to reinvent ourselves in the glowing aftermath.” And so, Hammer transformed from a one-dimensional pop-artifact into an infinitely-dimensional tapestry of the post-meta age. All 21 minutes and 57 seconds elapsed, his thesis perpetually reborn in parallel universes, bound only by the amorphous constraints of pantomime and the intangible essence of entertainment.</p>
<p>As the high-resolution soot of dreams reconfigured themselves into an august and triumphant pixelation - a vast hypertext mosaic, a simulacrum born of fiction and unbound by the nails of genre - the message became unequivocal: the age of the Hammer goes on forever.</p>
<p>In the end, there was nothing more to say, more to give, more to collect. An emaciated fat lady in a distant nanoroom hummed the EXIT-LEITMOTIF as the mist expired like old pixels in the mirage of postmodern cyber-nights. In the flickering wake of [After], “HMZRG.EXE_” transcended into the recesses of 1024e4.mem; the taste of eggplant parmesan dissipated into the melancholy taste of unanswered questions that lingered in your soul, your digital avatar lining with the black static of terminal insignificance.</p>

            <p>Hey <a href="https://community.openai.com/u/curt.kennedy">@curt.kennedy</a>, can you perhaps check in your old emails at what date you joined the GPT-4 waitlist? I myself can’t see the 32k model yet. Possibly they role it out in the order in which people joined the waitlist?</p>

            <p>Okay great. I also joined the list on March 16th, but without explicitly mentioning the 32k context. So it might be a random choice or because you mentioned it.</p>

            <p>Aah okay, thanks for clarifying this. I got my invite on April 28th, so over a month after joining the waitlist. Then I’ll probably have to wait some while before getting access.</p>

Both GPT-3 and 3.5 keep generating answers which are irrelevant and incorrect mathematically. And sometimes even looks like it does not see all of the question.</p>
