    <p>Recently I found an interesting <strong>Turing machine program</strong>. When started on a blank tape, it runs for more than <strong>10<sup>1565</sup> steps</strong> before halting. Here it is<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/tm-shape/tm-poster.png" alt="img"/></p>

<p>What’s special is that this is, as far as anyone knows, the longest that a Turing machine program of <strong>eight instructions</strong> can run.</p>

<p>Now, this might sound familiar to you if you’ve heard of the <strong>Busy Beaver game</strong>. The goal of that game is to find the longest running Turing machine of a given length. However, program length has traditionally been measured by number of <strong>states</strong> and <strong>colors</strong>, rather than total number of <strong>instructions</strong>. So we say, for example, that a program is 5-state 2-color (5x2), or 2-state 4-color (2x4), etc. We call a program’s particular number of states and colors its <strong><em>shape</em></strong>.</p>

<p>A fully specified N-state K-color halting program has <em>NK - 1</em> instructions (<em>-1</em> because reaching an undefined instruction is what it means to halt), and so <em>NxK</em> programs have the <strong>same number of instructions</strong> as <em>KxN</em>. It is therefore natural to wonder whether there might be some relationship between the two classes, or whether there might be a way to convert an <em>NxK</em> program to <em>KxN</em> form, or whether the two categories ought to be somehow grouped together.</p>

<p>There is a point of view that says this approach is <strong>nonsensical</strong> because it ignores the real <strong>semantic difference</strong> between states and colors. In fact states and colors correspond to <strong>fundamental control flow constructs</strong>, namely <strong>jumping</strong> and <strong>branching</strong>. An <em>NxK</em> program has <em>N</em> jump targets, each of which executes a <em>K</em>-way branch.</p>

<p>For example, consider the <em>4x2</em> Busy Beaver champion program, discovered by <strong>Allen Brady in 1964</strong>, and the <em>2x4</em> champion, discovered by <strong><a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/05/14/adjacent-tms.html">Shawn and Terry Ligocki in 2005</a></strong>:</p>

<p>The difference in shape between these programs is <strong>visually manifest</strong>, and it becomes especially pronounced when they are <strong>transliterated into C</strong>:</p>

<p>There is no apriori reason to believe that it should be possible to somehow convert back and forth between jump targets and switches, and so we might say that it is <strong>ridiculous</strong> to compare <em>NxK</em> programs with <em>KxN</em>. They are <strong>apples and oranges</strong>.</p>

<p>But wait, not so fast. Actually there <em>is</em> a way to <strong>commensurate</strong> <em>NxK</em> and <em>KxN</em> programs: simply interpret them both as <strong><em>max(N,K) x max(N,K)</em></strong> programs! To use the examples above, this means interpeting 4x2 and 2x4 programs as woefully underspecified 4x4 programs that happen not to avail themselves of all available states and colors:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">    +-----+-----+-----+-----+        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |        |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |
+---+-----+-----+-----+-----+    +---+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| A | 1RB | 1LB | --- | --- |    | A | 1RB | 2LA | 1RA | 1RA |
+---+-----+-----+-----+-----+    +---+-----+-----+-----+-----+

+---+-----+-----+-----+-----+    +---+-----+-----+-----+-----+

+---+-----+-----+-----+-----+    +---+-----+-----+-----+-----+

+---+-----+-----+-----+-----+    +---+-----+-----+-----+-----+</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we have a <strong>straightforward apples-to-apples comparison</strong> between two 4x4 programs each with seven instructions defined. And the results are stark: the 4x2 champ runs for <strong>106 steps</strong> before halting, while the 2x4 champ runs for <strong>3,932,963 steps</strong>. Wow! This suggests that, in some sense, <strong>colors are more powerful than states</strong>.</p>

<p>But is it really so simple? Notice that these traditional shape-based programs appear <strong>artificially constrained</strong> in this new context. Neither of them use the diagonal, for example, and they both have a <strong>boxy look</strong>. Are there any 7-instruction programs that run longer? If so, what are their shapes? In general, what about N-instruction programs?</p>

<p>This question is known as <strong><a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Instruction-Limited_Busy_Beaver">Instruction-Limited Busy Beaver</a></strong>, or <strong>BBi(n)</strong> for short. It was first proposed by pseudonymous Internet denizen <strong>MrBrain</strong> in July 2025. Brain and Shawn were quickly able to establish some definitive early values:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>n</th>
      <th>BBi(n)</th>
      <th>Shape</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>2x2</td>
      <td>BB(2,2)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>3x2</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>37</td>
      <td>2x3</td>
      <td>BB(2,3)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>123</td>
      <td>2x4</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>3932963</td>
      <td>2x4</td>
      <td>BB(2,4)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These early results were <strong>somewhat disappointing</strong>. The hope was that BBi search would turn up some exotic new program shapes. Instead, it confirmed only what was already believed: that colors are more powerful than states. So much more powerful, it would seem, that states were really just a drag, and that the best strategy was to <strong>minimize state use entirely</strong>.</p>

<p>So I was very pleased when on <em>26 July 2025</em> I found a <strong>new BBi(8) champ</strong>. Not just because of the thrill of discovery, but also because the program had an <strong>unexpected shape: 3x4</strong>. States may have some use after all! And thus this entry was added to the results table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>n</th>
      <th>BBi(n)</th>
      <th>Shape</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>10<sup>1565</sup> &lt;</td>
      <td>3x4</td>
      <td>🎉</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
