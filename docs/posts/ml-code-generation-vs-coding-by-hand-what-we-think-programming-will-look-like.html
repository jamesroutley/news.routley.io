    <h1>ML code generation vs. coding by hand: what we think programming will look like</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>We are working on a config language / DSL for building web apps that integrates with React &amp; Node.js. A number of times we&#39;ve been asked ‚Äú<em>Why are you bothering creating a new language for web app development? Isn‚Äôt Github Copilot* soon going to be generating all the code for developers anyhow?</em>‚Äù.</p><p>This is on our take on the situation and what we think things might look like in the future.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="why-ml-code-generation"></a>Why (ML) code generation?<a href="#why-ml-code-generation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In order to make development faster, we came up with IDE autocompletion - e.g. if you are using React and start typing <code>componentDid</code>, IDE will automatically offer to complete it to <code>componentDidMount()</code> or <code>componentDidLoad()</code>. Besides saving keystrokes, maybe even more valuable is being able to see what methods/properties are available to us within a current scope. IDE being aware of the project structure and code hierarchy also makes refactoring much easier.</p><p><strong>Although that‚Äôs already great, how do we take it to the next level?</strong> Traditional IDE support is based on rules written by humans and if we e.g. wanted to make IDE capable of implementing common functions for us, there would be just too many of them to catalogize and maintain by hand.</p><p>If there was only a way for a computer to analyze all the code we‚Äôve written so far and learn by itself how to autocomplete our code and what to do about humanity in general, instead of us doing all the hard work ...</p><p>Delicious and moist cake aside, we actually have this working! Thanks to the latest advances in machine learning, IDEs can now do some really cool things like proposing the full implementation of a function, based on its name and the accompanying comments:</p><div><figure><img alt="Copilot example - text sentiment" src="https://wasp-lang.dev/img/copilot-example-sentiment.gif"/><figcaption>GitHub Copilot generating a whole function body based on its signature and the comments on top of it.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This is pretty amazing! The example above is powered by <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Copilot</a> - it‚Äôs essentially a neural network trained on a huge amount of publicly available code. I will not get into the technical details of how it works under the hood, but there are <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/ai-review-github-copilot-d43afde51a5a#:~:text=They%20fine%2Dtuned%20the%20Codex,code%20it&#39;s%20been%20trained%20on." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lots</a> <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2021/07/19/copilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of great</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">articles</a> covering the science behind it.</p><p><strong>Seeing this, questions arise - what does this mean for the future of programming</strong>? Is this just IDE autocompletion on steroids or something more? Do we need to keep bothering with manually writing code, if we can just type in the comments what we want and that‚Äôs it?</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="who-maintains-the-code-once-its-generated"></a>Who maintains the code once it‚Äôs generated?<a href="#who-maintains-the-code-once-its-generated" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When thinking about how ML code generation affects the overall development process, there is one thing to consider that often doesn‚Äôt immediately spring to mind when looking at the impressive Copilot examples.</p><div><p><h5><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</h5></p><p>For the purposes of this post, I will not delve into the questions of code quality, <a href="https://www.theinsaneapp.com/2021/09/github-copilot-generated-40-percent-insecure-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security</a>, <a href="https://fosspost.org/github-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal &amp; privacy issues</a>, pricing, and others of similar character that are often brought up in these early days of ML code generation. Let‚Äôs just assume all this is sorted out and see what happens next.</p></div><p><strong>The question is - what happens with the code once it is generated? Who is responsible for it and who will maintain and refactor it in the future?</strong></p><div><figure><img alt="Devs still need to maintain generated code" src="https://wasp-lang.dev/img/always-has-been-copilot.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Although ML code generation helps with getting the initial code written, it cannot do much beyond that - if that code is to be maintained and changed in the future (and if anyone uses the product, it is), the developer still needs to fully own and understand it.</p><p>Imagine all we had was an assembly language, but IDE completion worked really well for it, and you could say ‚Äúimplement a function that sorts an array, ascending‚Äù and it would produce the required code perfectly. Would that still be something you‚Äôd like to return to in the future once you need to change your sort to descending üòÖ¬†? </p><p>In other words, it means Copilot and similar solutions do not reduce the code complexity nor the amount of knowledge required to build features, they just help write the initial code faster, and bring the knowledge/examples closer to the code (which is really helpful). If a developer accepts the generated code blindly, they are just creating tech debt and pushing it forward.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" id="meet-the-big-a---abstraction-"></a>Meet the big A - Abstraction üëÜ<a href="#meet-the-big-a---abstraction-" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>If Github Copilot and others cannot solve all our troubles of learning how to code and understanding in detail how session management via JWT works, what can? </p><p>Abstraction - that‚Äôs how programmers have been dealing with the code repetition and reducing complexity for decades - by creating libraries, frameworks, and languages. It is how we advanced from vanilla JS and direct DOM manipulation to jQuery and finally to UI libraries such as React and Vue.</p><p>Introducing abstractions inevitably means giving up on a certain amount of power and flexibility (e.g. when summing numbers in Python you don‚Äôt get to exactly specify which CPU registers are going to be used for it), but the point is that, if done right, you don‚Äôt need nor want such power in the majority of the cases.</p><div><figure><img alt="Abstraction equals less responsibility" src="https://wasp-lang.dev/img/uncle-ben-great-power.jpg"/><figcaption>What Uncle Ben actually meant: avoiding responsibility is the main benefit of abstraction! (Peter totally missed the point, unfortunately, and became Spiderman instead of learning how to code)</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>The only way not to be responsible for a piece of code is that it doesn‚Äôt exist in the first place</strong>. </p><p>Because as soon as pixels on the screen change their color it‚Äôs something you have to worry about, and that is why the main benefit of all frameworks, languages, etc. is <em>less code</em> == <em>less decisions</em> == <em>less responsibility.</em></p><p>The only way to have less code is to make less decisions and provide fewer details to the computer on how to do a certain task - ideally, we‚Äôd just state what we want and we wouldn‚Äôt even care about how it is done, as long as it‚Äôs within the time/memory/cost boundaries we have (so we might need to state those as well).</p><p>Let‚Äôs take a look at the very common (and everyone‚Äôs favorite) feature in the world of web apps - authentication (yaay ‚ò†Ô∏è¬†üî´)!
