The following recipes are taken from an old Roman cookbook<p>

      MARCUS GAVIUS APICIUS: DE RE COQUINARIA</p><p>

The book I have is edited and translated from Latin by Robert Maier.
My humble person only translated the German translations into English.
I hope the recipes are still rather near to the originals...</p><p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p><p>

First I have to introduce you to some native <a name="1">Roman ingredients</a>, such as:</p><p>

-- Caroenum: Boiled must (you have to boil the new wine or grape juice
until it is only half the amount you started with). </p><p>

-- Defritum: Either thick fIg syrup, or must that&#39;s boiled until you
have only a third of the amount with which you started.</p><p> 

-- Liebstoeckl: I didn&#39;t find an English translation.  In Latin it&#39;s
called &#39;levisticum officinale&#39;.  It&#39;s an umbelliferous plant with
yellowish flowers.  Its dried roots are used as spice.  It seems to be a
kind of celery. </p><p>

-- Liquamen: a salty fish sauce. Most of the time you can replace it by
salt. </p><p>

-- Passum: Very sweet wine sauce, made by boiling the must (new wine or
grape juice) to thicken it. (maybe add honey? - just my guess) </p><p>

-- Poleiminze: A kind of mint that&#39;s growing in inundated areas. Just
replace it by ordinary mint. </p><p>

-- Saturei: I didn&#39;t find an English translation.  In Latin it&#39;s called
&#39;satureia hortensis&#39;.  It&#39;s a violet or white flowered kind of labiate
plants which grows mainly in Southern Europe.  It&#39;s used as a spice
plant, especially for bean dishes.</p><p> 

-- Silphium: Its other names are &#39;Laser&#39; or &#39;ferula asa foetida&#39;.  I&#39;ve
noticed that it&#39;s also called &#39;hing&#39; in the Indian cuisine.  It is an
onion and garlic substitute and should be used rather sparingly because
of its very strong taste and smell. </p><p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p><p>

And here are some useful <a name="2">conversions</a>, taken from the
FAQ maintained by mara@kauri.vuw.ac.nz (great job!)</p><pre>5ml        =  1 tsp
15ml       =  1 tblsp
28.3g      =  1 ounce ( ==&gt; 100g = 3.5 ounces )  
454g       =  1 pound ( ==&gt; 1kg = 2.2 pound )

And now let&#39;s come to the meals.  All of those are calculated for 4
servings! <p>

Unfortunately the exact cooking temperatures and times haven&#39;t been
handed down in all cases. You have to rely on your gut feeling. But I
hope you enjoy all of it nonetheless!</p><p>

2 tblsp  anise seeds

It&#39;s better to make the must rolls with yeast dough, because then they
can be kept longer, and they are not so hard. To make the yeast dough,
add 40g yeast to the flour + grape juice, leave it a while until you
continue like above.
