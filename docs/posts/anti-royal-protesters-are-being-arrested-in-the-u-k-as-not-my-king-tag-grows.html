        <p>&#34;Not my king.&#34; </p><p>&#34;He is and there is nothing you can do about it.&#34; </p><p>That <a href="https://twitter.com/jmzz_55/status/1568542095173894145">exchange</a> between two commenters on Twitter encapsulates the current friction in the United Kingdom, where King Charles III&#39;s ascension to the throne has sparked anti-royalist protests.</p><p>In dramatic ways, the dynamic is playing out in real life: police have made a series of arrests against people protesting the monarchy in recent days, raising questions about the right to freedom of speech as the U.K. proclaims a new head of state to replace the late Queen Elizabeth II. </p><h3>Police in Scotland allege breaches of peace</h3><p>In widely seen photos, a woman holding a sign reading &#34;Abolish monarchy&#34; and &#34;F*** imperialism&#34; was arrested on Sunday at St. Giles&#39; Cathedral in Edinburgh, where the queen&#39;s body is to lie at rest until Tuesday.</p><p>&#34;Let her go! It&#39;s free speech!&#34; one man shouted, according to <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/crime/queen-elizabeth-ii-edinburgh-woman-arrested-after-protest-breaks-out-on-royal-mile-3839377">The Scotsman </a>newspaper. Others yelled back, &#34;Have some respect.&#34;</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/statuses/1569270901685862403">Twitter</a></p><hr/><h3>Protester says he didn&#39;t disrespect the late queen</h3><p>The most high-profile case comes from Oxford, where author and activist Symon Hill <a href="https://twitter.com/SymonHill/status/1568961085809516547">says he was arrested</a> for protesting Charles&#39; ascension, in what he called &#34;an outrageous assault on democracy.&#34;</p><p>Hill said he objected only to Charles being proclaimed king, and that he didn&#39;t do anything to disrespect Elizabeth or disrupt those mourning her.</p><p>&#34;It was only when they declared Charles to be &#39;King Charles III&#39; that I called out &#39;Who elected him?&#39;&#34; Hill said <a href="https://bright-green.org/2022/09/11/i-was-arrested-after-asking-who-elected-him-at-the-proclamation-of-king-charles/">as he related</a>  his experience. &#34;I doubt most of the people in the crowd even heard me. Two or three people near me told me to shut up.&#34;</p><h3>The U.K. adopted new laws on protests this year</h3><p>Hill said police initially told him he was arrested under the U.K.&#39;s recently toughened laws on protests, a change that came after advocacy groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter mounted large and/or disruptive protests in recent years.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-factsheets/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-noise-related-provisions-factsheet">new law</a> allows police to act in cases which they deem to be &#34;unjustifiably noisy protests that may have a significant impact on others&#34; or seriously disrupt an organization&#39;s activities.</p><p>The arrests highlight individuals&#39; troubles with the authorities — but large groups have also chosen or been forced to change their plans due to Elizabeth&#39;s death.  </p><p>Extinction Rebellion had for months planned to hold a large protest in London this past weekend, dubbed the Festival of Resistance. But after the queen died, the group <a href="https://extinctionrebellion.uk/2022/09/08/statement-on-cancellation-of-festival-of-resistance-this-weekend/">postponed its plan</a>, saying that &#34;occupying a Royal Park at this time would not be practical.&#34;</p><p>Groups such as <a href="https://twitter.com/RepublicStaff">Republic</a> — in the U.K., to be a Republican means to support the end of monarchy — are amplifying calls for change, sharing comments from people who are comparing the crackdown on protests in the U.K. to the actions of authoritarian regimes. </p><p>Republic said on Monday that it&#39;s contacting police agencies to ask about the rules for demonstrators, adding that it intends to organize protests around Charles&#39; coronation &#34;and will expect those protests to be allowed to go ahead peacefully.&#34;</p>
