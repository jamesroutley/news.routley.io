While there are a few different ways we might do this, the most widely studied technique would involve injecting <a href="https://www.freethink.com/series/guardians-of-the-apocalypse/solar-geoengineering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reflective aerosol particles</a> into the upper atmosphere.</p><figure><div><p><iframe title="Geoengineering: Our Last Defense Against Climate Change" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ms3B1UaVhc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></figure><p>Once those aerosols were released, though, we wouldn’t have a straightforward way to recapture them if the plan didn’t work or had unforeseen negative consequences.</p><p>​​“Even our understanding of the climate change that we’re causing unintentionally right now still has limitations, especially when it comes to impacts further into the future,” Linda Schneider, an international climate policy expert, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/the-planet-wide-problem-that-is-solar-geoengineering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Discover Magazine</a>. </p><p>“Our understanding of what would happen if we were to intentionally manipulate the climate at a global scale is even less,” she continued.</p><p><strong>Bubble block</strong>: Instead of injecting particles into Earth’s atmosphere to cool the planet, an interdisciplinary team of MIT researchers proposes we take solar geoengineering to space.</p><p>Specifically, the group is investigating what might happen if we positioned a shield made of bubbles at Lagrangian Point 1 — a point in space where the gravitational pulls of the Earth and the sun form a sort of equilibrium that would keep the shield in orbit there indefinitely.</p><blockquote><p>“Most geoengineering proposals are earth-bound … Space-based solutions would be safer.”</p><cite>Carlo Ratti</cite></blockquote><p>The proposed shield would be about the size of Brazil, and the bubbles for it could be manufactured and deployed in space, possibly out of silicon — the group has already experimented with creating these “space bubbles” in the lab.</p><p>“In our preliminary experiments, we succeeded at inflating a thin-film bubble at a pressure of 0.0028 atm, and maintaining it at around -50°C (to approximate space conditions of zero pressure and near-zero temperature),” they said in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gk415yke8shtb84/AADfZbzC8xISX-lTmEkJJ7V2a?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="704" src="https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg" alt="solar geoengineering space bubbles" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg 1200w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=768,451 768w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=320,188 320w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=600,352 600w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=1000,587 1000w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=330,194 330w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=540,317 540w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=850,499 850w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=175,103 175w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=275,161 275w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=400,235 400w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=360,211 360w, https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?resize=500,293 500w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 766px) calc(100vw - 40px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(62.5vw - 40px), (max-width: 1366px) calc(60vw - 40px), (max-width: 1536px) calc(50vw - 40px), 740px" data-lazy-src="https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solar-geoengineering-space-bubbles-3.jpg?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/><p><figcaption>The proposed raft of “space bubbles” would reflect solar radiation away from Earth.
