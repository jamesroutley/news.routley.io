    <p>I’ve been coding entirely with Claude Code for the past two months. At first it was exhilarating. I was speeding through tasks. I was committing like mad.</p>
<p>Now, as I’ve built up a fairly substantial app, it’s slowed to a crawl. Ironically, the app I’m building lets me parallelize many instances of Claude Code at once.</p>
<p>Often, I’ll have 5 instances running while I’m thinking about new features.</p>
<p>The slowness comes in when I actually need to review all the PRs. One by one, I have to apply them locally. One by one, I have to step through the console logs. One by one, I have to tell Claude to fix the issues it created.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s faster. I’m committing an incredible amount of code these days—more than I ever have.</p>
<p>It also feels incredibly, maddeningly slow. Once you’ve felt that first boost of speed with Claude Code, you want every coding task to feel like that. <a href="https://steipete.me/posts/just-one-more-prompt">It’s addictive.</a></p>
<p>Instead, as you build, you still have to serve as Claude’s QA engineer.</p>
<p>Maybe one day we’ll solve that. But I’m skeptical it will be in the form of a CLAUDE.md. I can barely get Claude to consistently follow the bare set of rules I have, much less ensure it performs a complex integration test for a web app.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll keep pulling PRs locally, adding more git hooks to enforce code quality, and zooming through coding tasks—only to realize ChatGPT and Claude hallucinated library features and I now have to rip out Clerk and implement GitHub OAuth from scratch.</p>
