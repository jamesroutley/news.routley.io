    <h1>Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro hearing health features</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Apple announced a trio of major new hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 in September, including clinical-grade hearing aid functionality, a hearing test, and more robust hearing protection. All three will roll out next week with the release of iOS 18.1, and they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24241960/apple-airpods-pro-2-otc-hearing-aid-health-industry">could mark a watershed moment</a> for hearing health awareness. Apple is about to instantly turn the world’s most popular earbuds into an over-the-counter hearing aid.</p><p>That also means we’re about to enter an era where we’ll need to get comfortable with people wearing earbuds at all times. There’s a perception that leaving your earbuds in while talking with other people is rude. Transparency mode in many of today’s earbuds sounds totally natural and lifelike, yet I still constantly remove my buds to show someone they’ve got my undivided attention. That way of thinking has to change when popular earbuds start pulling double duty as hearing aids. It’s a powerful way to reduce the stigma that’s all too common with hearing aids, but this shift will take time.</p><p>Over the last several days, I’ve been able to preview Apple’s hearing health features. At times, the experience has been emotionally intense. I’m someone who grew up with a Discman and iPod basically attached to my hip, and I’ve been to countless concerts over the decades. I also haven’t seen an audiologist since 2018 or so. That’s anything but unusual; Apple says 80 percent of adults in the US haven’t had their hearing checked in at least five years. Putting a test right on your iPhone is a great way to improve that trend.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Hands-on photos of Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><p><figcaption><em>The AirPods Pro 2 are transforming into something much more than wireless earbuds.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p><h3>Prevention: hearing protection</h3></p><p>Did you know there are people who’ve already been <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-used-airpods-pro-instead-of-ear-plugs-at-a-concert-heres-what-happened">replacing earplugs with the AirPods Pro</a> at concerts? Until this fall, Apple had never endorsed such a use case or advertised its earbuds as hearing protection devices. The company knew people were doing it but kept quiet on the subject. </p><p>That’s now changed. With iOS 18.1 and the soon-to-be-released AirPods firmware update, the AirPods Pro 2 will offer hearing protection at all times across noise cancellation, transparency, and adaptive audio modes. There’s no “concert mode” or a specific setting to toggle. You can think of this as an expansion of the loud sound reduction option that was already in place. Hearing protection is on by default, and Apple says “an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm” helps to preserve the natural sound of concerts and other live events.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A chart that shows the effectiveness of Apple’s hearing protection in the AirPods Pro 2." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><div><figcaption><em>This chart shows the effectiveness of Apple’s hearing protection across the different sound modes of the AirPods Pro 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Apple</cite></p></div></div></div><p>Which listening mode you’ll use for concerts comes down to personal preference. I’ve found adaptive audio works well since it lets you customize whether you prefer more noise cancellation or more passthrough. But even in full transparency mode, some level of hearing protection is active. The more noise cancellation that’s applied, the longer you can remain in relatively loud environments. </p><p>There are limits to what the AirPods Pro 2 can handle; Apple’s hearing protection isn’t cut out for extremely loud, sudden noises like gunfire, fireworks, or a jackhammer. Sustained noises over 110dBA are also too much for the earbuds. Some clubs and concerts can definitely exceed that threshold, so be aware.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo of a person wearing Apple’s AirPods Pro 2." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><p><figcaption><em>The AirPods Pro aren’t as discreet as some hearing aids, but their popularity and ubiquity could help reduce stigma.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p><h3>Awareness: the Apple hearing test</h3></p><p>You’ll need a quiet space when taking Apple’s hearing test. Before getting started, your iPhone will do a quick analysis of ear tip fit and environmental noise to ensure you’re good to go. All of these hearing health features are calibrated for Apple’s stock silicone tips, so if you’re using aftermarket third-party tips (including foam), there’s no guarantee you’ll get the optimal experience. Once the test begins, you just tap the screen whenever you hear any of the three-beep tone sequences. </p><p>There are a few key things to know about Apple’s hearing test. For one, it’s designed so that you can’t predict or game it. The test can play any frequency at any time, so no two are the same. Apple tests your left ear first, and here’s something I wish I’d known going in: it’s <em>completely normal</em> to hear nothing at all for several seconds at a time. It was in those moments, when five, six, or even 10 seconds would pass without an obvious tone sequence, where I’d start feeling pretty anxious. </p><p>My best advice is to avoid wondering if you <em>should</em> be hearing something at a given moment and instead just focus on the tones as they come. Some can be incredibly faint. There are visual cues that let you know the test is still moving along even during silence — the most obvious one being a large circle that animates onscreen throughout the process. (You’ll also notice a progress dial for each ear that fills as you take it.) </p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A screenshot of Apple hearing test results." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><div><figcaption><em>My left ear has a bit more hearing loss than my right.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div></div></div><p>I took the test twice several days apart, and my results for both ears fall under “little to no hearing loss.” Having recently turned 40, I’ll take that. The ranges are as follows:</p><div><ul><li>Little to no loss: up to 25dBHL</li><li>Mild loss: 26–40dBHL</li><li>Moderate loss: 41–60dBHL</li><li>Severe loss: 61–80dBHL</li><li>Profound loss: above 80dBHL</li></ul></div><p>I also learned that my left ear has definitely lost a bit more over the years than my right, which is something I’ve never noticed in daily life. The slight difference between my two tests is exactly the margin that Apple expects for people who take it multiple times. Results are stored in the Health app, where you can export individual tests (or all of them) as a PDF. Here’s how one of mine charts out: </p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A screenshot of Apple hearing test chart data." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><div><figcaption><em>Hearing test results can easily be accessed from the Health app.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div></div></div><p>You can also import charts from tests you’ve taken with a hearing professional. This data is what’s used to configure the hearing aid feature. </p><p>Apple’s hearing test only takes about five minutes, but it felt like a <em>long</em> five minutes for me and everyone else I’ve let try it. Again, that’s probably because it’s been too long since many of us have done this. The second time wasn’t nearly as stressful. I can definitely see the hearing test having a viral moment on TikTok and other social media, which seems like a great thing for awareness all around. Hearing loss is incredibly common: 1.5 billion people around the world are living with some extent of it, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p><h3>Assistance: AirPods as hearing aids</h3></p><p>For those 18 years and older with mild to moderate hearing loss, the AirPods Pro 2 can now serve as a clinical-grade hearing aid. Once enabled, you can also toggle on a “Media Assist” setting that uses your hearing test results to optimize the sound of music, phone calls, and video content. </p><p>Within the settings menu, you can use sliders to fine-tune the hearing aid feature’s amplification, tone, and balance. These options are also accessible via Control Center on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Much like you can slide a finger on the AirPods Pro 2 stem to adjust volume, you can use that same gesture to control amplification when the hearing aid mode is active. You can only use the hearing aid feature when in transparency mode. Apple’s instructions for the hearing aid feature advise that it takes time — in some cases, weeks — for customers to get fully accustomed to the sound. </p><p>Jerry Saltz, the art critic at <em>New York </em>Magazine (and someone with diagnosed hearing loss), took Apple’s hearing test at our Manhattan office and was impressed in his brief time trying out the hearing aid feature. But no one has had access to it long enough for an in-depth assessment. I’m sure there’ll be detailed comparisons between the AirPods Pro 2 and existing OTC devices in the near future once iOS 18.1 is widely available.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo showing the hearing aid setting on an iPhone in a crowded bar." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><p><figcaption><em>You can make hearing aid adjustments from the iOS settings menu.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Being able to use Apple’s $250 earbuds as a hearing aid is a huge deal for those who can benefit from this capability. That’s substantially less expensive than over-the-counter hearing aids from <a href="https://www.jabraenhance.com/product">Jabra</a>, <a href="https://hearing.electronics.sony.com/lp2_hearingaids">Sony</a>, and other brands. But the AirPods won’t be right for everyone. People with more severe hearing loss will still need to seek out other solutions (including those pricier products). And the main tradeoff with the AirPods Pro 2 is battery life: they can last for around six hours with the hearing aid engaged, which doesn’t match what you’ll get from many OTC and prescription hearing aids. </p><p>But this is a big milestone — and it seems inevitable that Samsung, Google, and other tech heavyweights will follow Apple’s lead fairly quickly. I’m all for that, even if it feels strange that hearing aid functionality has become the latest aspect of ecosystem lock-in. We spent a long time bemoaning the loss of the headphone jack. With advancements like this, and earbuds helping to improve so many people’s quality of life, we’re finally starting to see a worthwhile payoff. </p><p><em>Photography by Chris Welch / The Verge</em></p></div></div>
