    <h1>How insurance risk is transformed into investable assets</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Insurance risk involves the sale of insurance policies to policyholders, the receipt of premium and the payment of claims. If claims &amp; associated expenses are less than premium received, an <b>Underwriting Profit</b> is made. If claims are greater than premium, an <b>Underwriting Loss</b> occurs. In essence, investing in insurance risk is like partnering with an insurer ‚Äî you share in the results of the portfolio, keeping a slice of the underwriting profit if claims come in below premiums, or sustaining a loss if they come in above.</p><p><h2>Most Insurance Is Not Fully Collateralized</h2></p><p>This brings us to the concept of <b>collateralization</b>. An everyday example of collateral involves your mortgage. When you take out a loan from the bank to buy a house, you&#39;re putting up the house itself as collateral for the loan to secure it - meaning, if you fail to pay back the loan, the bank can foreclose and sell the house to cover the loan.</p><p>The key observation about insurance risk is the <b>possibility for insurers to pay out more money in claims than they take in via policy premiums</b>. When you purchase a policy from an insurance company, you‚Äôre implicitly trusting that the insurance company will be able to pay you out in the event of a claim, even if it means they‚Äôre operating at a loss. Insurance companies have <b>a balance sheet</b> (basically, an amount of assets or money) which <b>acts as collateral </b> against the chance that they must pay out more than they take in.</p><p>The amount of money held by the insurance company for this purpose is known as insurance <b>capital &amp; surplus</b>. Since this amount of capital is less than the total sum of all policy limits, we can say the policies are <b>partially collateralized</b>.</p><p><h3>Visualizing How Insurance Losses Are Distributed</h3></p><p>The chart below illustrates this concept with a probability distribution. The <span>blue curve</span> shows the likelihood of different loss levels. It peaks around 60-70% of premium but has a long tail extending to extreme scenarios.</p><p>The insurance company in this example <b>holds capital equal to 175% of premium collected</b>, giving them total resources of 275% of premium (100% premium + 175% capital) to pay claims in extreme years.</p><p>The <span>green dashed line</span> shows the <b>return on capital</b> from underwriting activities. When losses are less than premium collected (<span>green zone</span>), the insurer keeps the difference as profit. Once losses exceed the break-even point at 100%, the insurer must use their capital reserves to pay claims (<span>red zone</span>). Think of it like making an &#34;investment&#34; with the premium you collected, but getting such a negative return that <b>you have to reach into your wallet to cover the losses</b> (<span>red line</span>).</p><div><div><div><h4>Chart Legend:</h4><div><div><div><p><span><strong>Blue Curve:</strong> Probability of different loss levels</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Orange Line:</strong> Premium remaining (profit zone)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Red Line:</strong> Capital required (loss zone)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Green Line:</strong> Return on capital at loss level</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span><strong>Green Zone:</strong> Profit (Loss &lt; Premium)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Red Zone:</strong> Loss (Loss &gt; Premium)</span></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Purple Zone:</strong> Insolvency (Loss &gt; Capital)</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Key Insight</h3><p>Notice how potential returns can fall well below -100%, meaning losses can exceed the original premium collected. In the purple <b>insolvency</b> zone beyond 275%, even the capital reserves are exhausted - this is why insurers need substantial capital cushions and why regulators closely monitor capital adequacy.</p></div></div></div></div></div><p><h2>Some Retail Investments Are Partially Collateralized</h2></p><p>Retail brokerages offer <b>margin accounts</b> to those customers that have sufficient assets to support it - much like the insurance company capital - and reserve the right to make a margin call if those trader‚Äôs reserves fall below minimum requirements. In extreme cases, it‚Äôs even possible for a trader to end up in a position where the brokerage could not sell collateral quickly enough and they‚Äôre left with a negative balance which must be filled with assets from elsewhere.</p><p>In the same way, <b>insurers must maintain capital to meet extreme claims</b>. Both systems rely on partial collateralization: enough to cover most outcomes, but not the absolute maximum.</p><p>Therein lies a critical implication: <b>The entire balance sheet of the insurance company is available and backing each individual policy</b>. This is similar to your margin account, as if your account balance (collateral) goes below zero, you&#39;ll have to pull from assets outside to cover the debt.</p><p>This is one of the fundamental reasons why regulators restrict retail investors from direct insurance risk investments. A strong knowledge base of how the risk works is needed to understand you&#39;re not just exposed to losing your investment, but other assets as well. For history buffs, I recommend reading  Andrew Duguld&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3JSzzMk">On the Brink: How a Crisis Transformed Lloyd&#39;s of London</a><span>1</span>for a fascinating first-hand account of the <b>Names</b> at Lloyd&#39;s. These individuals once pledged their entire personal wealth to back insurance syndicates, sometimes with catastrophic consequences.</p><p><h2>Insurance Risk Investments For Retail Are Almost Always Fully Collateralized</h2></p><p>So what have we learned from this comparison? Three points stand out:</p><div><ol><li><span>1</span><span>Insurance risk is exposed to losses exceeding the premium received</span></li><li><span>2</span><span>Collateral needs to be set aside in case of these outsized losses to ensure trust in the insurance product</span></li><li><span>3</span><span>Outside (especially Retail) Investors would be best to limit their exposer to losses beyond their investment</span></li></ol></div><p>The challenge, then, is clear: <b>how can retail investors access insurance risk without facing the danger of unlimited losses</b>? The solution has been to design <b>fully collateralized structures</b> as vehicles that capture underwriting profits while capping potential losses at your invested amount. One of the most intuitive examples comes from adapting <b>reinsurance structures</b> into a format investors can access.</p><p><h2>Case Study: CAT Bonds</h2></p><p><b>Catastrophe Bonds</b>, or &#34;CAT Bonds&#34;, are the most widely known form of investable insurance risk. If we ignore the insurance implications of it for a second, CAT Bonds are just like any other corporate bond: they are issued by a firm, pay a coupon, have a maturity date and have an associated risk of default (not being paid back principal).</p><p>The difference here is the risk of default of a <b>CAT bond is tied in someway to insurance losses</b>. If a qualifying insurance event happens, the principal is kept by the insurance company to pay those claims, effectively defaulting the bond. They are referred to as &#34;Catastrophe&#34; bonds simply because they are <b>most often tied to large, catastrophic events</b> such as Hurricanes, Earthquakes, or even Cyber events.</p><p>CAT Bonds can be thought of as <b>an insurance policy bought by the insurance company itself</b>. They are, in fact, usually a compliment to the insurance company&#39;s full reinsurance program. Here, however, the insurance company isn&#39;t buying a policy from another insurance company, but rather <b>outside capital markets on a fully collateralized basis</b>.</p><p>Let&#39;s form our own very basic CAT bond. We&#39;re <b>Risksure - a Florida based insurance company </b> - and we write a lot of homeowners policies in the sunshine state. We&#39;d like to take out the following CAT bond:</p><div><div><ul><h6>CAT Bond: Gator Re Ltd. üêä</h6><li><span><strong>Sponsor<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Risksure Re</span></li><li><span><strong>Bond Size (Limit)<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->$100M</span></li><li><span><strong>Attachment Point (Deductible)<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->$500M (Risksure covers the first $500M of losses)</span></li><li><span><strong>Issuance Date<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Jan 1, 2026</span></li><li><span><strong>Maturity Date<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Dec 31, 2026</span></li><li><span><strong>Coupon (Premium)<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->9% annually, rate paid quarterly on current collateral balance</span></li><li><span><strong>Terms<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->If a hurricane strikes Florida in 2026 and Risksure‚Äôs losses exceed $500M, investors‚Äô principal is used to cover those excess losses, up to $100M. This is known as a <b>per occurrence limit</b>.</span></li></ul></div></div><p>To issue this Bond, Risksure Re would collect $100M of principal from outside investors, thus <b>fully collateralizing the insurance risk</b>. In return, Risksure Re would pay $9M of premium for the bond, and should no hurricane event occur, pay back the $100M of principal at maturity.</p><p>This type of structure is common in reinsurance and known as an <b>excess of loss structure</b>. The <i>layer</i> of coverage can be visualized as follows:</p><div><div><div><div><div><h3>How It Works</h3><p>If a Category 3+ hurricane causes Risksure&#39;s losses to exceed $500M, the CAT bond investors&#39; $100M principal is used to cover losses between $500M-$600M. Investors receive a 9% coupon ($9M annually) for taking this risk.</p></div></div></div></div></div><p><h2>Investment Returns for Gator Re Ltd. üêä</h2></p><p>There are two components of return for the investors in our CAT Bond:</p><div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Risk Return<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Compensation for taking on the insurance risk, paid for by the 9% coupon</span></li><li><span><strong>Risk Free Return<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->Compensation for tying up capital, in the form of interest income on the collateral sitting in the bank, say by investing it in 4% T-bonds.</span></li></ul></div></div><p>It&#39;s clear that we this structure, the investors are taking on insurance risk exposure. However, in this case, the <b>&#34;buyer&#34; of the insurance policy</b> (the insurance company itself) does not need to worry that the <b>insurer</b> (the outside investors) will not be able pay claims if the large event happens, because the <b>entire value of the policy limit</b> ($100M limit) is set aside and can&#39;t be touched.</p><p>We can now examine and visualize a few potential outcomes for the buyers of the CAT bond:</p><div><div><ul><li><span><strong>No Hurricane<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- --> Capital providers get back $9M Risk Income + $4M Risk-free Income = $13M along with their original $100M of investment, <b>a 13% return.</b></span></li><li><span><strong>A Partial Loss<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- --> Risksure suffers $525M of loss from a covered hurricane. Risksure pays the first $500M. They then use $25M of the paid in capital from the CAT bond to pay for the remaining claims. Assuming mid-year trigger, capital providers will receive back the remaining $75M, plus the $7.78M Risk Income (two coupons paid plus two partial coupons), plus reduced RF income due to the used capital, $3.5M, for a total of $86.28M. <b>This is a negative 13.72% return.</b></span></li><li><span><strong>A Full Loss<!-- -->:</strong> <!-- -->A massive hurricane hits Florida and Risksure pays out $1B in losses, far above the exhaustion point of $600M for this CAT bond. The entirety of the $100M principle and risk free income goes towards paying Risksure&#39;s policyholder claims. Investors received $4.5M in coupons before trigger and no principle, <b>for a loss of 95.5%.</b></span></li></ul></div></div><p>Keen observers will notice that we&#39;ve <b>successfully transformed the insurance risk</b> into a <b>limited liability product</b> - you can no longer owe additional capital beyond your original investment. However, it&#39;s clear that investing in insurance risk in this manner should be treated as a compliment to other investment strategies. Bear markets for equities might return -30% to -50%, but crucially, they retain the potential to recover those losses over time. CAT bonds offer no such recovery potential - once triggered, that capital is permanently lost. That said, the <b>stated probability of default for these bonds is typically 1-3%</b>, meaning the 5-9% excess returns above risk-free rates are designed to compensate for this low-probability but high-severity risk.</p><p><h2>A Final Note: Why Isn&#39;t Insurance Fully Collateralized?</h2></p><p>A natural question arises through this analysis: <b>why aren&#39;t insurance companies forced to hold enough money to cover all potential loss scenarios</b>? The short answer is <b>efficiency</b>. The less capital you have to hold, the larger your returns on capital will be. This can be illustrated with simple math. Say you hold $10M in capital and expect a profit of $500K on underwriting business. Expected return is $500K/$10M = 5%. But let&#39;s say now you only have to hold $5M in capital - your return on capital has now jumped to $500K/$5M = 10%. By holding fully collateralized layers, <b>CAT bonds are trading capital efficiency for payment certainty.</b></p><p>Referring back to the chart at the beginning of the article, those extremely remote loss scenarios have exceedingly low likelihood of happening for a sufficiently large and diverse insurance company. Each insurance company has a team of actuaries and risk modelers dedicated to ensuring the ongoing solvency of the company. Regulators setup frameworks to validate and set guidelines for the amount of capital a company needs to hold. With all that said, <b>insurance companies can and do fail</b>, at which point regulators can swoop in to protect policyholders.</p><p>This is why under collateralized insurance &#34;works&#34; - there are many checks and balances along the way to align incentives. It&#39;s also why giving outside investors access to insurance risk is such a challenge; with out those protections in place, guardrails (such as full collateralization) have to be setup such that insurance policies can be sure their claims will be paid.</p></article></div>
