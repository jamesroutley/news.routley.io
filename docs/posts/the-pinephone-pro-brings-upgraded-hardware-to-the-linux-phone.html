<p>Pine64 is launching a major hardware upgrade in its quest to build a Linux smartphone. After the launch of the original <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/the-pinephone-starts-shipping-a-linux-powered-smartphone-for-150/">PinePhone</a> in 2019, the organization is now taking preorders for the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephonepro/">PinePhone Pro</a>, a new smartphone it&#39;s calling &#34;the fastest mainline Linux smartphone on the market.&#34; The phone was announced in October, and you can now secure a unit. The MSRP is $599, but it&#39;s up for preorder now at an introductory price of $399.</p>
<p>Since Pine64 wants to make an open source Linux smartphone, its choice of hardware components is limited. Most big chip companies like Qualcomm or Samsung don&#39;t want to share open drivers or schematics, and you saw that with the original PinePhone, which was based on a 40 nm Cortex A53 SoC made by Allwinner. The PinePhone Pro is upgrading things with a Rockchip RK3399 SoC. The chip sports two Cortex A72 CPUs and four Cortex A53 CPUs, and Pine64 says it worked with Rockchip to get the chip &#34;binned and voltage locked for optimal performance with sustainable power and thermal limits.&#34; Pine64 doesn&#39;t cite a process node, but <a href="https://en.t-firefly.com/Product/Rk3399/spec.html">other companies</a> list the RK3399 at 28 nm. If that&#39;s true and you&#39;re looking for something roughly comparable in Qualcomm&#39;s lineup, the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-650-mobile-platform">Snapdragon 618/650</a> (a mid-range chip from 2016) would seem to fit the bill.</p>
<p>The phone has a 6-inch, 1440×720 LCD, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of eMMC storage, and a 3,000 mAh battery. There&#39;s a USB-C port with 15 W charging, a headphone jack, a 13MP main camera, and an 8MP front camera. The back cover pops off, and inside the phone, you&#39;ll find a removable battery (whoa!), a microSD slot, pogo pins, and a series of privacy DIP switches that let you kill the modem, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, microphone, rear camera, front camera, and headphones.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-3.jpg" data-height="1080" data-width="1920" alt="The PinePhone Pro is &#34;the fastest mainline Linux smartphone on the market."><img alt="The PinePhone Pro is &#34;the fastest mainline Linux smartphone on the market." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-3-980x551.jpg" width="980" height="551"/></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-3.jpg" data-height="1080" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The PinePhone Pro is &#34;the fastest mainline Linux smartphone on the market.</p><p>Pine64</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pogo pins support a variety of attachable backs, which are compatible with both the original PinePhone and the PinePhone Pro. For instance, there&#39;s no built-in biometrics, but Pine64 sells a $25 back panel with a <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-pinephone-pro-fingerprint-reader-add-on-case/">capacitive fingerprint reader</a>. There is no <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-pinephone-pro-wireless-charging-add-on-case/">wireless charging</a>, but you can get a back panel that adds the feature for $10. The wildest option is a <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-pinephone-pro-keyboard-case/">$50 keyboard case</a> with a 6,000 mAh battery. This turns the phone into a mini-laptop with individual plastic keycaps that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx6B_OL4OJ4">look like</a> they have more travel than many laptop keyboards. The big downside to this replaceable back strategy is that you have to pick between options. You can&#39;t have wireless charging <em>and</em> a fingerprint reader, for instance.</p>
<p>As for the software you&#39;ll be running on this thing, that&#39;s up to you. This is a phone for the Linux enthusiast who is willing to deal with some rough edges. It ships with Manjaro Arm and the Plasma Mobile interface, which Pine64 calls &#34;pre-beta.&#34; You really can&#39;t be any more honest than the &#34;who is it for?&#34; disclaimer on the main PinePhone Pro page, which says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contemporary mobile Linux operating systems have a way to go before they can be considered true alternatives to Android or iOS. While mobile Linux isn’t in a state that could satisfy most mainstream electronics consumers, we recognize that a sizable portion of our community is ready to make the jump to a Linux-only smartphone today. The PinePhone Pro has the raw horsepower to be your daily driver, granted you’re ready to accept the current software limitations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pine64 says it will keep making the original PinePhone, which is still available for the dirt-cheap price of $150. The Pro model starts shipping on January 24.</p>
