    <h1>Twenty years maintaining the WiX Toolset</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body=""> <p>As I <a href="https://www.firegiant.com/blog/2024/4/5/looking-back-at-twenty-years-in-the-wix-toolset/">noted on the FireGiant blog</a>, twenty years is a long time in software years. It’s pretty crazy to think that I’ve worked on WiX longer for over half of my life and more than all the other projects combined. I mean, it’s 20 years Open Source but I the ideas behind WiX started in 1998 and I started coding in 1999. So, if you count fingers on keyboard, it’s been a 25 year project for me.</p>
<p>And there are still so many cool things to do, I can’t tell you when it’ll end. No time soon for sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s a line that I really liked but didn’t quite make the cut for the blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my twelve years at Microsoft I worked on Microsoft Office, Service Definition Initiative (aka: BIG), Windows Vista, Windows Marketplace, Live Mesh, and Visual Studio. Only half of those still exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It made me smile that both WiX <em>and</em> FireGiant have outlasted all but the biggest products that I worked on at Microsoft. Not bad. And I’m no Ray Ozzie.</p>
<p>Keep coding, you know I am (for another 25+ years, probably).</p> </div></div>
