    <h1>How smart do you have to be to get a degree?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>It sure looks like the education system is melting down, doesn’t it? Just look at this:</p><p>Are schools failing us? Are we getting dumber?</p><p>What if I told you that the population mean was 100 throughout the entirety of the series in this image? Well, it really is.</p><p>The only thing that changed was that education increased. As education increased, some of the more intelligent people who would have attained lower levels of educational attainment moved up to the higher ones, bringing both groups down in the process. This is the “Will Rogers Phenomenon,” best encapsulated by the whimsical line “When the Okies left Oklahoma and moved to California, they raised the intelligence level in both states!”</p><p><span>The Will Rogers phenomenon is a real thing that shows up all the time. For example, during the Great Migration, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1690826540366319616" rel="">African American migrants who left the South had more European admixture than those who stayed behind, but less European admixture than those already living in the North</a><span>. You might have seen this recently:</span></p><p>We can see the Will Rogers phenomenon at work in this instance because the overall slope was -0.015 standard deviations per year. For those with less than twelve years of education the slope was -0.039, whereas for high school graduates, the slope was -0.041. For those attending college the slope was -0.034 versus -0.027 for people who had some college but didn’t graduate; the slope was -0.019 for college graduates, -0.018 for those currently in graduate or professional school, and -0.024 for those with graduate or professional degrees.</p><p>The overall slope is less than the slope for any individual level of education because people are sorting across the levels in exactly the way I suggested.</p><p>So, are we getting dumber? Unfortunately, this wouldn’t show it. If the authors ever release or return to the data to analyze whether the changes are measurement invariant and how they appear after post-stratification, then we can know. Until then, we’ll be left guessing.</p><p><span>Many of you have probably seen or heard about a paper entitled “</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240215055832/https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/2munr/providers/osfstorage/65c722b01a30ef0e5ac33dbe?action=download&amp;direct&amp;version=2" rel="">On average, undergraduate students’ intelligence is merely average.</a><span>” Shortly after the paper’s abstract went live online, it accumulated an Altmetric score of over 1,600, over 50,000 total views at its journal, and more than 2,000 posts on Twitter.</span></p><p>The paper described how, over the past century, tertiary education has gone from a cognitively elite affair to a decidedly average one. In the distant past, those who attended university had very high IQs; nowadays, they’re only slightly above-average.

They also asked why they hadn’t been refunded the article processing charge of $3,295. A few days later, they received the reply that “The reason for the decision is: The manuscript could not be sufficiently revised by the authors to address the concerns by the reviewers or editors during the review process.”</p><p>This is not a very clear explanation.</p><p>One explanation I might consider acceptable is that the samples in that chart aren’t representative of the broader undergraduate populations. But this isn’t a good enough explanation for two reasons. Firstly, we have a strong prior on this finding.</p><p><span>Consider the known and substantial increase in educational attainment over time. This increase in educational attainment has been accompanied by </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69526-6" rel="">an increase in its heritability</a><span>:</span></p><p>Increased heritability means increased equality, as it implies the environments we come from matter less than they once did.</p><p><span>The thing connecting educational heritability to equal opportunity is </span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.23.4.95" rel="">declining selectivity</a><span>:</span><span> if there’s an ability threshold for entering university, the importance of sibling differences for educational attainment are magnified near it. As the threshold falls, siblings whose antecedent traits are correlated can allow them to become more correlated in terms of the thing that varies over that threshold which is, in this case, educational attainment. But this also means that, now, the lower-ability siblings goes to school when they wouldn’t have before.</span></p><p>This may sound like it should increase the variance due to the nonshared environment, but as we can see in the video above, the variance that really plummeted lately was from the shared environment. This all fits together because parents can help kids to achieve a higher level of educational attainment than their endowments would typically allow. Moreover, they tend to invest disproportionately in lower-performing siblings. Consider the following:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292120301239" rel="">Nicoletti and Tonei (2020)</a><span> found that parents reinforce the high socioemotional skills of their children by spending more time socializing with them, and they compensate for a child’s low cognitive skills by increasing the time those children spend in learning activities.</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/722834" rel="">Terskaya (2023)</a><span> found that parents seem to be averse to inequality within the family. As a result, they seem to work to attenuate the downsides of a child’s disability on their educational attainment by investing more in disabled than nondisabled children.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/rest_a_01326/115639/Sibling-Differences-in-Genetic-Propensity-for" rel="">Sanz-de-Galdeano and Terskaya (2023)</a><span> found parents of non-twin siblings seem to be averse to inequality: even without knowing about their kids’ genetic endowments directly, they seem to invest more in the child with the lower polygenic score for educational attainment. However, they do not seem to display this tendency for dizygotic twin siblings.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Consistent with these findings, </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289609000877" rel="">Johnson, Deary and Iacono (2009)</a><span> found greater shared environmental variance in educational attainment at low IQs. Similarly, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240215064444/https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/d93ax/providers/osfstorage/6499d6c56c098109b57d1936?action=download&amp;direct&amp;version=3" rel="">Beauchamp et al. (2023)</a><span> found evidence for an effect of family socioeconomic status on the educational attainment of Korean adoptees and evidence for a negative genetic interaction between family socioeconomic status and educational attainment polygenic scores for measured IQ scores. That means that family socioeconomic status partially compensated for poor genetic endowments, but at high levels of genetic endowment, there was no effect of family socioeconomic status. </span><a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3837136/v1" rel="">Many</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1650662695899746305" rel="">other</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929721002780#" rel="">results</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/nature-of-nurture-using-a-virtualparent-design-to-test-parenting-effects-on-childrens-educational-attainment-in-genotyped-families/EA86B33A8224E231EE99B802691634FC" rel="">in many</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/social-competence-in-parents-increases-childrens-educational-attainment-replicable-geneticallymediated-effects-of-parenting-revealed-by-nontransmitted-dna/A3686F6B876F33BA210EEB178864A8C8" rel="">studies</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01796-2" rel="">are</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0494-1" rel="">similar</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The decline in selectivity has had predictable effects that have been clearly observed on several occasions.

North Rhine-Westphalia shifted from G9 to G8 in 2012 and plans to return to G9 starting in 2026. In Rhineland-Palatinate, only some schools were ever transitioned to G8, and they only started doing so in 2016. Some states had briefer contact with G9. For example, Saxony-Anhalt had G8 from 1949 to 2000, switched to G9, and then switched back to G8 in 2007.</p><p><span>Bergold et al. investigated the effects of this reform in two studies. The first involved comparing students tracked into G8 (</span><em>n</em><span> = 81) and G9 (80) at different ages in a school in North Rhine-Westphalia. The G9 students were tracked in 2004 and the G8 students were tracked in 2005, allowing both to be assessed at the same grade level in 2010. At the time of assessment, the G9 students averaged 16.39 (σ = 0.49) and the G8 students averaged 15.16 years old (0.37).</span></p><p><span>Using the Berlin Intelligence Structure Test, it was found that the G8 cohort averaged 0.59 </span><em>d</em><span> below the G9 cohort—almost nine whole IQ points! That is an unbelievably huge amount of change for having one year less education. The difference was confounded with age, but the authors looked and found that correcting for age didn’t do much, reducing the gap from 0.59 to 0.51 </span><em>d</em><span>, or from almost nine to almost eight IQ points.</span></p><p><span>I don’t believe the age correction was credible. After all, the Millennium Cohort Study is available to us, and it shows a major birth month effect similar to this one, which is </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230403083244/https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ability-grouping-and-the-month-of-birth-effect-T-Campbell-March-2013-FINAL.pdf" rel="">entirely an age in cohort effect</a><span> that can be explained by an interaction, but not by linearly residualizing for age. Bergold et al. cited a study from 1995 to argue against testing for an interaction. I can’t access that study, so I don’t know how credibly it addressed the issue, but I do know the problem shows up in data that everyone can access, so why not at least test it?</span></p><p><span>With Bergold et al.’s tiny sample, correction might not have been worthwhile anyway. </span><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/03/15/need16/" rel="">Interactions require a lot of power to test</a><span>, so sometimes you just won’t be able to answer your questions with small samples, and there was certainly no way to take out more meaningful fixed effects with the limitations they had to work with. The second part of the article may have been a bit better though.</span></p><p><span>In Bergold et al.’s second study, they compared two G9 cohorts (total </span><em>n</em><span> = 204) sampled in 2007-08 and two G8 cohorts (244) tested in 2012-13 using the Intelligence Structure Test 2000 Revised, in schools in North Rhine-Westphalia. A colleague was given the data and they tested it and confirmed the authors’ findings directionally: after correcting for age and sex and restricting the means of the verbal and numerical group factors, the earlier G9 group had 0.34 </span><em>d</em><span> higher </span><em>g</em><span>—German students were evidently five IQ points less intelligent when tested a mere five years apart!</span></p><p><span>If we go with the authors’ suggested estimate of 0.72 </span><em>d </em><span>lower </span><em>g</em><span>, we’d be forced to concede that it seems within five years, the German mean for Gymnasium students had fallen by the equivalent of the German-Greek gap, or about two-thirds of the gap between White and African Americans. That’s </span><em>enormous</em><span>.</span></p><p>But it’s also probably not real.</p><p><span>Remember: when we expand the pool of those receiving educations, we reduce the intellectual advantage associated with education. The standards for entering Gymnasien declined and the enrollment in them increased in this period, across reform and non-reform states. The G8 reform either prompted or (more likely) coincided with increased enrollment. In the </span><em>Fachserie 11, Reihe 1: Allgemeinbildende Schulen – Schuljahr 2009/2010</em><span>, 28% of precollegiate students were listed as being enrolled in Gymnasium. Based on the </span><em>Statistiches Jahrbuchs</em><span> for 2009, 2012, and 2013, it seems the increase over the period was on the order of 50% nationally; as Bergold et al. noted: “In 2012/2013, for instance, 44.5% of the students in the German secondary school system attended the Gymnasium.”</span></p><p><span>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that so many people criticized the school system around the time of the reform from the angle that Abitur</span><span> taking and Gymnasium entry had become too widespread and easy. The reform apparently just coincided with widespread concern over declining standards. Given</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240215205148/https://www.datenportal.bmbf.de/portal/de/Tabelle-2.5.85.html" rel=""> the average proportion eligible to study at university in 2007/2008 was some 20% lower than the proportion in 2012/2013</a><span>, we should probably not believe the point estimates from this study represent the effects of G8/G9 attendance but, rather, that they reflect the effects of selection much like the selection into education observed elsewhere. Similarly, </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/12/1/9" rel="">the recent estimate that German university students became 4.68 to 5.17 IQ points less intelligent between 2012 and 2022</a><span> should be treated the same way.</span></p><p><span>The studies purporting to show that German Gymnasium and university students have become substantially less intelligent over time due to a reform whose influence wasn’t isolated</span><span> or the pernicious anti-Flynn effect are not credible. They suffer from serious potential selection issues.</span><span> Thankfully, economists love dealing with selection issues, and they have.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537116302287" rel="">Dahmann (2017)</a><span> used two cohorts to investigate the G8 reform’s effect. These two cohorts are really great for several reasons. The most important thing is that both are readily downloadable (if you’re European. Sorry non-Europeans!). The samples are also large enough, nationally representative, they contain extensive background details about participants, and they have good measures. The first is the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP); the second is the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS).</span></p><p>The SOEP had the same cognitive test used in Bergold et al.’s second study. That’s useful! We know the psychometric characteristics of that battery were good, and we can confirm the same thing in the SOEP. In this cohort, the group being analyzed were individuals observed in the 2006 through 2013 waves who attended Gymnasium. As a result, there were 723 students in the sample, of whom 288 were affected by the reform. Additionally, pre-reform socioeconomic and demographic variables including migration background, sex, age, teacher recommendations after elementary school, parental education, work status, occupation, and family structure were all controlled for.</p><p>The NEPS used a lengthy cognitive test covering mathematics, perceptual speed, and reasoning. Mathematics was measured with a standard achievement test, perceptual speed was measured with a picture symbol test, and reasoning was measured with the Raven’s matrices. Migration background and sex could be controlled in addition to socioeconomic status variables like books in the home, and both parental education and occupation. School characteristics including size, share of students with migration backgrounds, and stress factors induced by the reform were also controlled for. The NEPS sample included 2,128 students sampled in 2013, of whom 1,113 were affected by the reform.</p><p>Estimation with the SOEP dataset involves comparing individuals who entered school in a given state in given time periods where they would be affected or not affected by the reform, with all the aforementioned controls and additional state and year of birth dummies. Estimation with the NEPS dataset involves comparing individuals in different states in the same school years, who ended up in those school years because of the timing of the reform. So the comparison will be between individuals who did an additional year of schooling versus those who had more intense schooling for one less year.</p><p><span>Because I have access to both datasets, I will show the original estimates in addition to estimates for a single-factor latent </span><em>g</em><span>, noting that I could constrain the effects on latent </span><em>g</em><span> to 0 to improve fit. Effects are rescaled into the IQ metric.

The most important thing to note is that there’s no evidence that the G8 reform hurt weaker students. The second is that it speaks to how, even if the G8 reform worsens inequality in student learning, that’s OK! On average, the reform was still beneficial, but </span><em>if </em><span>some people fall behind as a result, they’ll still have that extra year to repeat a grade and as a result, the worst outcome for them would be ending up where G9 students would have been anyway in terms of age progression.</span></p><p><span>With each of these results—from the SOEP, NEPS, and PISA—in hand, I believe we can confidently reject the results of Bergold et al.’s analysis and suggest quite confidently that they were driven by selection that they didn’t account for. With the SOEP and PISA results, we see that when it comes to measured achievement, the reform is probably slightly beneficial. The NEPS result suggests that, if there’s a duration effect, it’s at least balanced by the intensity effect, resulting in no net effect on student learning, much less intelligence. The well-controlled evidence all seems to agree: shortening school lengths in Germany was not harmful. We shouldn’t fear it, nor should we believe poorly controlled results showing </span><em>massive </em><span>declines in actual student intelligence in the first place.</span></p><p>Ontario, Canada adopted a G8-like reform, where they reduced high school durations from five to four years in length. This has been widely panned as a failure.</p><p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/caje.12066" rel="">Krashinsky</a><span> found that four-year high school graduates aged 18.25-19.25 had mean university management course GPAs of 2.39 versus five-year graduates’ 2.72. In the age range 18.5-19, the means were 2.27 and 2.80. </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/caje.12019" rel="">Morin</a><span> used a much larger sample and grades from many more courses and found generally nonsignificant differences, but still observed a deficit favoring the five-year graduates, to the tune of 2.3 points on a 100-point scale.</span></p><p>These effects of reducing high school duration were consistent in direction, but they were very modest and not altogether concerning. Regardless, we should still take them seriously. To that end, I think the German results could be informative about the Ontarian ones.</p><p>The G8 reform maintained the curriculum while reducing the time in school, but the Ontario reform simply reduced the length of school and cut back on the curriculum to make room. As a result, they failed to raise the intensity of education to compensate for reduced time in it. The seemingly balanced impact in Germany might be ascribed to the necessarily increased intensity of education of their reform, and Ontario could take notice of that critical distinction.</p><p>There may be more diverse impacts of reducing school lengths.</p><p><span>Using the NEPS, </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.816358/full" rel="">Hübner et al.</a><span> found suggestive evidence of effects on achievement-related fear and school-related stress differences between boys and girls. Both effects were so small they wouldn’t survive correction for multiple comparisons.</span></p><p><a href="https://archive.md/9HzM7" rel="">Schwerter, Netz &amp; Hübner</a><span> found suggestive evidence that reform exposure led to fewer hours attending university classes and on self-study, with larger time gaps between school completion and entering high school (i.e., more gap time). Each effect was marginal and ignorable aside from the roughly 1-to-2-month increase in gap times. </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13803611.2019.1683043" rel="">Stöver</a><span> also found that the reform negatively impacted immediate higher education transition rates, but every other transition was positively impacted.</span></p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221106033421/https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.502945.de/diw_econ_bull_2015-18.pdf" rel="">Huebener</a><span> (not relation to the Hübner mentioned above, presumably) recorded that the G8 reform was associated with ten months less time in school, just shy of the anticipated twelve month reduction, due in part to grade repetition rates increasing by 3.08%, or about a fifth in relative terms. Consistent with girls being the more studious sex, boys experienced an increase of 3.78% versus 2.40% for girls. This finding, however, does not show that there were necessarily more failures, as the increase was largest in the final, </span><em>Oberstufe</em><span>, year that students might wish to voluntarily retake to “change their specialist subject choices or to improve their grade point average, for example.” The rates of graduating with an Abitur were also not found to be affected, so the biggest impact was really just students graduating at a younger age.</span></p><p>These and other findings don’t actually seem like they make for a strong case against reducing school lengths.</p><p><span>This is no small issue; these findings matter. Reducing school length means giving people back time as young adults to start their careers, to form relationships, and—critically—to get married and start families. </span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/fertility-in-an-ideal-world" rel="">I’ve suggested before that more available time as an adult might be a way of fighting the tempo effect on fertility</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Economists have repeatedly brought up this issue and noted that </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240102101320/https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/7599/1/RR-05-002.pdf" rel="">the case for reducing time in school to recover people’s youth seems to be good</a><span>. But, if we must have a certain quantity of school as a matter of human capital development, there are other options than holding people back from starting their adult lives. As the German experience shows us, increasing intensity seems capable of balancing the effect of time in education, so why not simply extend school days? In the process, we’d be able to incapacitate youths for longer—combatting the sharp ascent of the age-crime curve—and to fit in more schooling in fewer years, if we really wanted that.</span></p><p>Consider this diagram of Austrian life cycles between 1971 and 2001:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png" width="887" height="568" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:568,&#34;width&#34;:887,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:75425,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e19a808-7ec4-4ca0-9b39-27e86fcd7105_887x568.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>People are spending more of their lives retired, and that’s good.
