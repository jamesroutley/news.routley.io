    <p>You sit at the tip of a branch as the last light touches the trees. The pink and salmon colored clouds form in clusters of beauty and contrast against the darkening blue canvas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you calibrating your position on this wobbling Earth?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you contemplating existence?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You sit at the tip of a branch as the shallows of night rise to your toes. The air around you hints of coolness to come.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you sink deeper into this meditation?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you feel the weight of your body pressing into your feet and into this tiny branch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You sit at the tip of a branch as the last bit of light passes over the horizon. The sky remains painted as silhouettes take hold. Yours, caressed by color.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you breathe out with a stillness?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the faintness of emerging stars pull at your very being?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you sense the magnetic poles of awareness and nothingness in this increasing darkness?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the rhythm of your heart faintly talk to this tree as you drift and blend into the sky?</p>
</blockquote>

The crow faces to the left and up and the tree appears to be birch-like and is also silhouetted. The image is vignetted and has a cloudy texture. "/><br/></p>
