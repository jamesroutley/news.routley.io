      <span>Abstract:</span>  During the last two years there has been a plethora of large generative
models such as ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion that have been published.
Concretely, these models are able to perform tasks such as being a general
question and answering system or automatically creating artistic images that
are revolutionizing several sectors. Consequently, the implications that these
generative models have in the industry and society are enormous, as several job
positions may be transformed. For example, Generative AI is capable of
transforming effectively and creatively texts to images, like the DALLE-2
model; text to 3D images, like the Dreamfusion model; images to text, like the
Flamingo model; texts to video, like the Phenaki model; texts to audio, like
the AudioLM model; texts to other texts, like ChatGPT; texts to code, like the
Codex model; texts to scientific texts, like the Galactica model or even create
algorithms like AlphaTensor. This work consists on an attempt to describe in a
concise way the main models are sectors that are affected by generative AI and
to provide a taxonomy of the main generative models published recently.
