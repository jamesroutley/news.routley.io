		When resolution increases the portion of parameter space that doesn&#39;t make the artifact
		worse (<em>acceptance volume</em>) collapses. Verification latency and rate–distortion
		combine into a precision tax that scales superlinearly with perceived quality.</em></p> <p>When I make something good, I often spend most of my time making thousands of
	high-precision edits on an artifact that I thought should have been finished hours ago.
	Previously, I called this &#39;last-mile edits&#39;, but that was the wrong mental image.</p> <p>&#34;Last mile&#34; implies executing a known plan with diminishing returns but &#34;last mile&#34; at one
	level just becomes &#34;early exploration&#34; at higher resolution at the next level. Instead of
	treating exploration (idea) and exploitation (execution) as temporally separated phases,
	they nest recursively. That nested search is where the effort goes.</p> <p>Once you commit to D minor, this scene, that argument structure you&#39;ve constrained the
	search space and now you search again within it.</p> <p>Take some of my quicker five-minute, gestural sketches below. You&#39;d think they break this
	nested search dynamic but with a closer look it becomes clear that I just front-loaded my
	taxes by caching motor heuristics.</p> <figure id="figure-1"><!--[!--><!--]--> <p><img src="https://markusstrasser.org/media/art/sketches-masonry.jpg" alt="Five-minute gestural sketches showing practiced circular strokes and face-like abstractions"/></p> <!--[--><figcaption><a href="#figure-1">Figure
				1</a>: <!--[-->A closer look shows the same set of practiced, comfortable gestures that click with my hand shape. They gravitate toward broad, confident circular strokes and shorter straight lines, just short enough to keep them stable. I&#39;m executing cached heuristics, not exploring. I revert to face-like abstractions and focus on having the center hold. I do not like when *The Center Does Not Hold*.<!--]--></figcaption><!--]--></figure><!----> <p>Domains and modalities differ in how wide and forgiving their basins are and how quickly
	you can verify the edit (<em>feedback latency</em>). Music timing has a narrow basin at the
	micro-level (<em>±20 ms can kill a groove</em>) but can be more forgiving higher up: key
	and pitch changes can be interchangeable without loss of quality, not often though. Prose
	has a wide basin (many phrasings work). Abstract, contemporary art has extremely wide
	basin, so much so that nobody with any self-respect even bothers anymore. Renaissance
	paintings have more constraints and less distortion tolerance.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Modality</th><th>Basin</th><th>Verifier</th><th>Speed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Text (prose)</td><td>Wide</td><td>Human read</td><td>Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Code</td><td>Wide (design) / Narrow (syntax)</td><td>Compiler/tests</td><td>ms-seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Music timing</td><td>Narrow</td><td>Ear–body</td><td>~20-40ms</td></tr><tr><td>Line drawing</td><td>Narrow</td><td>Eye–hand</td><td>~100ms</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Let&#39;s take the following optimization landscape and assume it&#39;s for the process of writing
	a song. To make it simpler, let&#39;s constrain like this: We&#39;ve written the lyrics and picked
	a BPM of 80.</p> <p>The wider, more forgiving hill corresponds to choosing C major on the macro level, but
	there might be a higher, sharper peak in E minor that&#39;s trickier—i.e., it demands more
	precision edits.</p> <figure id="figure-2"><!--[!--><!--]--> <p><img src="https://markusstrasser.org/media/essays/creative-work-landscapes/logseq-screenshot.png" alt="3D optimization landscape with Z-axis representing quality"/></p> <!--[--><figcaption><a href="#figure-2">Figure

This is where almost all generative AI outputs live and the oxygen is still plenty. Near a sharp peak, the <strong>acceptance volume<span><sup>a</sup></span> <span data-side="right" role="complementary" data-type="aside"><span>a</span> <!---->We call it acceptance volume, but in the 3D example above, it’d be the area of a tiny slice of the hill.<!----><!----></span><!----><!----> shrinks rapidly</strong> and you can’t reliably see micro-improvements without averaging more evidence or trials. The controller (often the hand) makes many tiny corrections after some latency. Rinse and repeat until the piece sits on a hard-to-vary peak.</p> <p>That&#39;s why effort seems like it scales superlinearly as perceived quality rises. Judging
	the intermediate artifact takes more time and most edits (the search) make it worse.
	Geometrically bad edits become more likely and land you lower in the landscape.</p> <p>Craft, then, is the slog of closing ever-less-perceivable gaps.</p> <h2 id="faqs"><a href="#faqs">FAQs</a></h2> <p><strong>Don&#39;t bands sometimes record a banger song in an hour together?</strong></p> <p>The tower-climbing happened during practice (*muscle memory*), not recording.
