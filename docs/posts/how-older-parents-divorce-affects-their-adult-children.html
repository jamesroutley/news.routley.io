    <h1>How older parents divorce affects their adult children</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>&#34;Many times I&#39;ve heard adult children say, &#39;it felt like the rock that was my family […] my support network system that I grew up with […] was sucked into an earthquake fault&#39;&#34;, says Carol Hughes, a marriage and family therapist based in southern California and the co-author of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/ca/home-will-never-be-the-same-again-9781538135310/">Home Will Never Be the Same Again: A Guide for Adult Children of Grey Divorce</a>. &#34;All of a sudden, their parents are divorcing, and they feel like the bottom has fallen out of their lives,&#34; she adds.</p><p>Reflecting on the memories shared with their family, adult children may wonder: &#34;Was it all smoke and mirrors? Were they ever really happy?&#34;, Hughes says. Some of her clients have ended relationships and engagements because of their parents&#39; divorce, or questioned their identity and self-esteem, she says. </p><p>&#34;A parental divorce can be a difficult experience for any individual […] no matter the age, no matter the marriage duration. The experience [or] transition is simply different,&#34; says Joleen Greenwood, a professor of sociology at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania, in the US. </p><p>Adult children may for example feel obliged to help the parent they see as having &#34;wronged&#34; – for example siding with them, providing emotional and social support, or even supporting them with legal advice, she says. </p><p>When Greenwood <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280170862_Effects_of_a_Mid-_to_Late-Life_Parental_Divorce_on_Adult_Children">interviewed</a> 40 adult children of divorce (ACD), a common theme that emerged was the feeling of being stuck between two sides: &#34;Parents may see [their children] as peers, equals, or confidants and &#39;put them in the middle&#39;,&#34; she says. &#34;This is not saying that some parents do not do this with children under the age of 18, but it&#39;s more likely when the adult children are 18 or older.&#34; Daughters, in particular, are more <a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jomf.12936">likely</a> to provide emotional support than sons, research shows. </p></div></div></div>
