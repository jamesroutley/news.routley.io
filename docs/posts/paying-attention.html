    <h1>Paying Attention</h1>

    <p>In any area of life, there is so much to be noticed by simply paying attention.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve become a much better cook by paying attention to what I&#39;m doing, and what the results of my actions are. Now I don&#39;t overcook my eggs anymore, and they&#39;re delicious every time.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve become a better baker because I&#39;ve learned how to feel what the dough is doing, and give it what it needs.</p>
<p>Watching my dog play with other dogs at the park, and letting him navigate his social interactions has made me a better dog parent, because I&#39;m less worried about whether something bad will happen.</p>
<p>When my daughter is playing with a new toy, I want to watch her figure it out. When she&#39;s eating and learning how to chew and swallow, I observe what foods she struggles with. When she cries, I know whether she&#39;s in pain, tired, or just being silly because I&#39;ve learned the differences. This makes me a better dad, and it makes me more in-tune to what her needs are.</p>
<p>In her book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42771901-how-to-do-nothing">How To Do Nothing</a> Jenny Odell writes about the term &#34;attention economy&#34;, and how there are innumerable technological forces competing for our focus. Most of these aren&#39;t a net positive. In an act of intentional capitalist defiance, she started going to a park near her house to sit and observe, to see what she could see. She writes about how she began to identify the different bird songs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What amazed me and humbled me about bird-watching was the way  it changed the granularity of my perception, which had been pretty &#34;low-res&#34;. At first, I just noticed birdsong more. Of course it had been there all along, but now that I was paying attention to it, I realized that it was almost everywhere, all day, all the time. And then, one by one, I started learning each song and associating it with a bird, so now that when I walk into the Rose Garden, I inadvertently acknowledge them in my head as though they were people: &#34;Hi, raven, robin, song sparrow, chickadee, goldfinch, towhee, hawk, nuthatch...&#34; and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this quote from that chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To hear is the physical means that enables perception. To listen is to give attention to what is perceived both acoustically and psychologically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can apply this practice to virtually any area of life, and be surprised by how much richness and depth there is in a place that was previously completely flat.</p>
<p>This is, in essence, the primary purpose of meditation. To notice what&#39;s already there, and enable yourself to focus on it for longer and longer periods of time. Applying this meditation inward is a profound practice, around which an entire philosophy (religion? ask the scholars about that one) has formed.</p>
<p>I do this very imperfectly, because it&#39;s honestly really hard. However, if I am able to remind myself of this perspective, there&#39;s never an excuse for me to be bored. All I have to do is stop and look or listen, and I will become engrossed in something.</p>
