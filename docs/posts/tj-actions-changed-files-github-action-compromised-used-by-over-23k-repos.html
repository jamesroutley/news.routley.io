    <h1>Tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action Compromised – used by over 23K repos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-blog-post=""><h2>Introduction</h2><p>We are actively investigating a critical security incident involving the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action. While our investigation is ongoing, we want to alert users so they can take immediate corrective actions. We will keep this post updated as we learn more. <a href="https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner" target="_blank">StepSecurity Harden-Runner</a> detected this issue through anomaly detection when an unexpected endpoint appeared in the network traffic. Based on our analysis, the incident started around 9:00 AM March 14th, 2025 Pacific Time (PT) / 4:00 PM March 14th, 2025 UTC. If you need any help investigating this issue, please contact us at support@stepsecurity.io</p><p>Update 1: Most versions of tj-actions/changed-files are compromised.</p><p>Update 2: We have detected multiple public repositories have leaked secrets in build logs. As these build logs are public, anyone can steal these secrets. If you maintain any public repositories that use this Action, please review the recovery steps immediately.</p><p>Update 3: GitHub has removed the tj-actions/changed-files Action. GitHub Actions workflows can no longer use this Action.</p><h2>Summary of the incident</h2><p>‍</p><p>Our Harden-Runner solution flagged this issue when an unexpected endpoint appeared in the workflow’s network traffic. This anomaly was caught by Harden-Runner’s behavior-monitoring capability.</p><p>The compromised Action now executes a malicious Python script that dumps CI/CD secrets from the Runner Worker process. Most of the existing Action release tags have been updated to refer to the malicious commit mentioned below. Note: All these tags now point to the same malicious commit hash:<code>0e58ed8671d6b60d0890c21b07f8835ace038e67</code>, indicating the retroactive compromise of multiple versions.”</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>$ git tag -l | </span><span>while</span><span> read -r tag ; </span><span>do</span><span> git show --format=</span><span>&#34;$tag: %H&#34;</span><span> --no-patch $tag ; done | sort -k2

For example, the following GitHub search URL shows all instances of this Action in the Actions GitHub organization:</p><h3>Review GitHub Actions workflow run logs</h3><p>You should review logs for the recent executions of the Action and see if it has leaked secrets. Below is an example of how leaked secrets appear in build logs.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/67d4cca074c5030ca60fd281_Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%205.39.11%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>This step is especially important for public repositories since their logs are publicly accessible.</p><h3>For StepSecurity Enterprise Customers</h3><p>The following steps are applicable only for StepSecurity enterprise customers. If you are not an existing enterprise customer, you can start our 14 day free trial by installing <a href="https://github.com/apps/stepsecurity-actions-security" target="_blank">the StepSecurity GitHub App</a> to complete the following recovery step.</p><h4>Review Actions Inventory</h4><p>You can use the Actions inventory feature to discover all GitHub Actions workflows that are using tj-actions/changed-files.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/67d4b492687d43d10aaaf409_Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%203.57.53%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/67d4bca8432050339dc719fd_Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%204.32.37%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h4>StepSecurity Maintained changed-files Action</h4><p>We offer <a href="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/actions/stepsecurity-actions">secure drop-in replacements</a> for risky third-party Actions as part of our enterprise tier.

Once onboarded, our enterprise customers can use the StepSecurity Maintained version of <em>tj-actions/changed-files </em>instead of the compromised versions.</p><h4>Review Harden-Runner Findings</h4><p>You can see if your workflows have called &#34;gist.githubusercontent.com&#34; by visiting &#34;All Destinations&#34; in your StepSecurity dashboard. If this endpoint appears in the list, review the workflow runs that called this endpoint.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/67d4c1ab432050339dcae2dd_Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%204.54.05%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>We have reported this issue to GitHub and opened an issue in the affected repository:</p><p>The GitHub issue is no longer accessible as the repository has been deleted.</p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51664">an official CVE</a> has been published.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as more information becomes available.</p><p>For real-time security monitoring and proactive anomaly detection in GitHub Actions workflows, consider using <a href="https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner" target="_blank">Harden-Runner </a>to detect and mitigate such threats.</p></div></div></div>
