<p>This is the Web site for <em>Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation</em>, often referred to by its initials as PLAI (pronounce it like “play”). Over the years well over fifty academic institutions (that I know of) have used PLAI.</p>

<p>PLAI is designed for upper-level courses that introduce the main ideas of programming languages. In the US, it is designed for students in their second- through fourth-years of college, as well as starting graduate students. However, PLAI has been used with students much younger, including in a few select high school classes.</p>



<p>The third edition is out as of 2022-12-08! The first public release is version 3.2.0. There are two PDF versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.plai.org/3/2/PLAI%20Version%203.2.0%20electronic.pdf">electronic-friendly edition</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.plai.org/3/2/PLAI%20Version%203.2.0%20printing.pdf">print-friendly edition</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The only difference is that the Table of Contents in the former has hyperlinks and in the latter has page numbers. Unfortunately, cross-references within the latter document are still hyperlinks, and will hence likely be useless. Sorry.</p>

<p><em>Is the book free?</em></p>

<p>Yes, the book is available free-of-cost under a CC BY-NC-SA license. If there is demand, I may set up a print-on-demand site where you can pay for a paper copy.</p>

<p><em>What changed?</em></p>

<p>Many, many things. Please read the Preface.</p>

<p><em>Did I miss 3.1?</em></p>

<p>There was an internal version at Brown in 2021. Since I hope to update this annually, I figured it’s easier for the public version numbers to track the year. Therefore, I’m retroactively dubbing that internal version 3.1. You didn’t miss anything.</p>

<p><em>How often do you intend to release versions?</em></p>

<p>Approximately one a year. While it’s attractive to authors to push new versions on a regular basis, treating <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Books-as-Software/">books like software</a>, that can be very disruptive to users.</p>

<p><em>So why 3.2.0, not just 3.2?</em></p>

<p>Because I may make some small changes in the coming weeks, in time for the (US) Spring 2023 semester. That may result in 3.2.1.</p>

<p><em>Does that mean…</em></p>

<p>Yes, it means we’re counting major versions from 1, minor versions by year, and sub-minor versions from 0. If you find this appealing, you probably also like “scripting languages”, and you’ll like some chapters of the book; if you find it appalling, you’ll like other chapters.</p>

<p><em>How do I notify you of problems?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/">first edition</a> was written between 2000 and 2007.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/">second edition</a> was written in 2012. It has much of the same content as the first edition. The major changes include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Switching to a statically typed (and type-inferred) language.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Over the years, teaching the material had taught me newer and better ways of presenting some of the content. These changes were reflected in the prose.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Low-level rewriting of the prose in several places.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Reducing a bit of the content, in part because it was not entirely compatible with the typed language.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Accompanied by an <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/OnLine/">online course</a>, with videos.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am absolutely flattered that the second edition of the book has been translated into Chinese by volunteers. You can
  <a href="https://github.com/lotuc/PLAI-cn">find it on GitHub</a>.
  The translators are <a href="https://github.com/lotuc">Lotuc</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~czhu/">Chongkai Zhu / 朱崇恺</a>.
  I’m immensely grateful to them.</p>

  <li>
    <p>A phylogenetic branch, <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/"><em>Programming and Programming Languages</em></a> (PAPL), was constructed between 2013 and 2020:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The first half of PAPL is suited for an accelerated introduction to computer science.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The second half of PAPL is a further revision of PLAI’s second edition.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A major difference is that PAPL is completely written in <a href="https://www.pyret.org/">Pyret</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>PAPL is co-authored with <a href="https://jpolitz.github.io/">Joe Politz</a> and <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/benjamin-lerner/">Ben Lerner</a>, two amazing co-authors.</p>
