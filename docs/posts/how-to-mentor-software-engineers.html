    <h1>How to Mentor Software Engineers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>A friend and fellow staff+ engineer posted a question to a peer group Slack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone here have suggestions on how best to mentor software engineers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time, I said a few things about <em>randical candor</em> and <em>actionable
feedback</em>, but the question stuck with me. I mentor people, but I’ve never
thought formally about what it is or how I do it.  <strong>Like a lot of soft skills,
we’re rarely taught how to mentor</strong> – most of us are left to figure it out on
our own.</p>
<div>
<p><em><strong>Mentoring, coaching, or sponsoring?</strong></em></p>
<p>Mentoring and coaching <em>activities</em> look similar, but the <em>impetus</em> is
different.  In mentoring relationships, usually the mentee sets the agenda.
In a coaching relationship, usually the coach sets the agenda.  Coaching also
tends to be more formal and more transactional.  (People hire coaches, not
mentors.)</p>
<p>Sponsorship is very different.  A sponsor uses their authority and influence
to create opportunities and recognition to advance someone’s career.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, a mentor might also act as a coach or sponsor.</p>
</div>
<p>One way to think about the distinction is whether there are direct
consequences to following or ignoring advice.  <strong>Mentors advise; coaches
assess.</strong> This is one reason why people often seek mentors outside the
management chain.  It’s hard to trust a manager to separate these two roles.
Senior individual contributors – while they may also coach – are often
better positioned to provide consequence-free advice.</p>
<p>When I thought about ways I’ve mentored people, the first things that sprung
to mind were actually coaching roles – situations where it was my
<em>responsibility</em> to help someone improve.</p>
<p><strong>Code review is a pervasive example of coaching being confused with
mentoring.</strong> Code review is part of the job.  Every time I review someone’s
code, I might find opportunities for teachable moments.  Yes, I’m helping
someone improve their skills to advance their career, but that’s not the same
as <em>mentoring</em>.</p>

<p>When people have come to me for advice, whether formally or informally, and
whether once or twice or regularly over a period of time, the kind of
conversations we’ve had are quite different from my coaching conversations.
When someone comes to me, they’re usually asking bigger question not tied to
our day-to-day work.</p>
<p>I’ve found that these conversations fall into three broad categories,
ranging from the strategic to the tactical:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals</strong> - figuring out what they really want</li>
<li><strong>Situations</strong> - handling the unfamiliar or difficult</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong> - getting promoted</li>
</ul>
<p>In all three areas, I think that <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radical
candor</a>  – caring personally
<em>while</em> challenging directly – is essential to effective mentoring.  You have
to have someone’s best interest in mind <em>and</em> you have to be willing to help
them see uncomfortable truths.  If that’s not in your personality or you don’t
feel that way towards a prospective mentee, the best thing you can do for them
is to send them elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="to-mentor-goals-ask-questions">To mentor goals, ask questions.<a href="#to-mentor-goals-ask-questions" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>Mentoring about goals is tricky because the best goals come from within.
Telling someone what they should want isn’t as powerful as helping them
discover it for themself.  Goals are most meaningful when they are deeply
understood.</p>
<p>To help someone understand their goals, ask questions that help them reflect
on their current situation, consider potential futures, and chart a course
from one to other.</p>
<p>In the simplest form, it’s the <em>“where do you see yourself in five years?&#34;</em>
question, but that’s a big leap for most people to take in a way that’s
authentic and not what they think they ought to say or what the mentor wants
to hear.  Instead, <strong>probe for how well they understand their current situation</strong>.
What’s going well?  What’s not going well?  What about your role do you enjoy
the most?  What’s most frustrating?  If you could change one thing, what would
it be and why?</p>
<p>Only then is a mentee ready to think with specificity about a future in
contrast to the present.  Maybe that’s <em>“do more of what I like and less of
what I hate”</em>.  Or maybe that’s <em>“overcome the things that are hard”</em>.  Everyone
is different.  A mentor can help ground aspirations with current reality so
that the mentee can find the path that they can believe in and realistically
follow.</p>
<h3 id="to-mentor-situations-tell-stories">To mentor situations, tell stories.<a href="#to-mentor-situations-tell-stories" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>It’s hard to benefit from experience if you don’t have it yet. Some people
read histories, stories, case studies, and so on to learn from the experiences
of others.  Other’s don’t.  Mentors are a great source of lessons from the
past because what they have to say is personalized to the challenges facing a
mentee.  And, unlike a book, the mentor can answer questions and provide more
context if needed.</p>
<p>Faced with the question <em>“what should I do?&#34;</em>, a mentor should resist the urge
to recommend and should look for an opportunity to tell a personal story
instead.  Why answer indirectly with a story?</p>
<p>First, <strong>sharing a related experience reassures a mentee that they’re not
alone</strong> – that someone else has faced a similar challenge.  Second, stories
engage the listener’s brain, helping them focus more completely on what
they’re being told rather than their own problems.  Third, stories let a
mentee consider a situation through an abstraction – when they aren’t the
protagonist of their own, immediate problem, they have a chance to see a
situation more objectively and consider different perspectives.  Finally, it
preserves their agency and sense of control. A story is a teaching tool –
<em>“this worked for me”</em> – but you leave the decisions up to them.</p>
<p><strong>Be honest if you haven’t experienced a situation personally.</strong>  In that
case, let them take the lead without being prescriptive.  You can still be
sounding board for their ideas and help them wargame an approach to what
they’re dealing with.  Even without a story to guide them, having someone in
their corner is valuable support.</p>
<p>Similarly, be careful if you’re speaking from a position of privilege that
your mentee doesn’t share.  What worked for you might not work for someone
else.  You should still share your experiences, but share with awareness and
candor about the difference.</p>
<h3 id="to-mentor-skills-observe-them-in-action">To mentor skills, observe them in action.<a href="#to-mentor-skills-observe-them-in-action" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>Mentoring skills has the most overlap with coaching.  In a mentoring context,
you’re doing it because they’ve asked you and not because it’s your job, but
what you do is fundamentally the same.</p>
<p>First, you have to observe the mentee’s activities or output.  For coding
skills, code review or pair programming would work.  For communication skills,
sit it on a meeting they expect to actively participate in or watch them
practice a presentation.  For technical writing, read what they’ve written.</p>
<p><strong>The most important thing you can do is provide actionable feedback</strong>.
This means being specific about your observations of their work.  It also
means providing direction about what they could have done differently or what they
need to learn or practice in order to improve.  If your mentee doesn’t know
what to do next, your feedback wasn’t actionable.</p>
<p>Sometimes a mentee has a specific skill they want to level up.  Other times,
they’re looking for more general guidance, usually with a eye towards
promotion. I wrote about using <a href="https://xdg.me/growth-conversations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career ladders for growth
conversations</a> in the context of
managers, but as a mentor you can offer it to a mentee as a tool for self
assessment to guide where they think you can help them the most.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you see someone that you think has potential, but they’re not where
they ought to be and they aren’t seeking advice.  You could approach them
– tell them you think they have potential and offer to mentor them.</p>
<p>If your company has a formal mentoring program, you could sign up.  If they
don’t, you could invite people to come to you.  That doesn’t have to be a
formal declaration “<em>hey, if anyone wants to work with me as a mentor, let me
know</em>”.  It could be as simple as announcing office hours for anyone who wants
to talk and seeing what happens.</p>
<h3 id="start-with-listening">Start with listening.<a href="#start-with-listening" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h3>
<p>There’s one take away I’d like you have: mentoring is about listening.  Resist
the temptation to offer unsolicited advice.  Listen to what they’re asking
about.  Goals?  Situations?  Or skills?  Then listen (or observe) before
sharing your questions, stories, or feedback.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you’ve read this far, you may realize that nothing I’ve said is specific
to software engineering.  Mentoring is a general skill; your experience makes
it industry-specific.</strong></em></p>
