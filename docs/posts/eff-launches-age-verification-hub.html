    <h1>EFF launches Age Verification Hub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span data-contrast="auto">SAN FRANCISCO—With ill-advised and dangerous age verification laws proliferating across the United States and around the world, creating surveillance and censorship regimes that will be used to harm both youth and adults, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has launched </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">a new resource hub</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that will sort through the mess and help people fight back.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To mark the hub&#39;s launch, EFF will host a Reddit AMA (“Ask Me Anything”) next week and a free </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/livestream-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">livestreamed panel discussion</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> on January 15 highlighting the dangers of these misguided laws.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“These restrictive mandates strike at the foundation of the free and open internet,” said EFF Activist Molly Buckley. “While they are wrapped in the legitimate concern about children&#39;s safety, they operate as tools of censorship, used to block people young and old from viewing or sharing information that the government deems ‘harmful’ or ‘offensive.’ They also create surveillance systems that critically undermine online privacy, and chill access to vital online communities and resources. Our new resource hub is a one-stop shop for information that people can use to fight back and redirect lawmakers to things that will actually help young people, like a comprehensive privacy law.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Half of U.S. states have enacted some sort of online age verification law. At the federal level, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee last week held a hearing on “Legislative Solutions to Protect Children and Teens Online.” While many of the 19 bills on that hearing’s agenda involve age verification, none would truly protect children and teens. Instead, they threaten to make it harder to access content </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/thousands-young-people-told-us-why-kids-online-safety-act-will-be-harmful-minors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">that can be crucial, even lifesaving, for some kids</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s not just in the U.S.  Effective this week, </span><a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">a new Australian law</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> requires social media platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We all want young people to be safe online. However, age verification is not the panacea that regulators and corporations claim it to be; in fact, it could undermine the safety of many.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Age verification laws generally require online services to check, estimate, or verify all users’ ages—often through invasive tools like government ID checks, biometric scans, or other dubious “age estimation” methods—before granting them access to certain online content or services. These methods are often inaccurate and always privacy-invasive, demanding that users hand over sensitive and immutable personal information that links their offline identity to their online activity. Once that valuable data is collected, it can easily be leaked, hacked, or misused. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
