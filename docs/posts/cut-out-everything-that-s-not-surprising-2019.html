<p>
This is my advice to anyone writing something for the public — especially a talk on stage.
</p><p>
People listen to a talk, or read an article, because they want to learn something new.
</p><p>
They want a little “oh wow” moment.
“I never thought of it that way before.”
</p><p>
<strong>
People only really learn when they’re surprised.
</strong>
If they’re not surprised, then what you told them just fits in with what they already know.
No minds were changed.
No new perspective.
Just more information.
</p><p>
So my main advice to anyone preparing to give a talk on stage is to cut out everything from your talk that’s not surprising.
(Nobody has ever complained that a talk was too short.)
</p><p>
<strong>
Use this rule in all your public writing.
</strong>
If you already found something surprising in what you’re presenting, then remove everything else.
If you haven’t found something surprising about it yet, keep looking until you do.
