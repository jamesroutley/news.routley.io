      <div><p>I had the privilege of leading PlanGrid to $100M in ARR before I stepped down as CEO and passed the baton to Autodesk Construction. I’ve had years to dissect the mistakes I have made in my first startup, and I’ve now taken my lessons learned to TigerEye.</p><p>Regardless of what industry you build for, or where you are at in your startup’s growth towards a $100M journey, there are many things that will likely fail. This post breaks down PlanGrid’s key failure points and what I’ve learned from them. If these reflections help even one founder make one less mistake, I would consider this post worthwhile. </p></div>
