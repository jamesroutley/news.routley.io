    <h1>Compilers for Free with Weval</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><a href="https://cfallin.org/">Chris Fallin</a> came and gave a talk to the Northeastern
<a href="https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Programming Research Laboratory</a>
last month. He talked about his work on a new project called
<a href="https://github.com/cfallin/weval">weval</a>, a WebAssembly partial evaluator (and
then helped me write this post!).</p>

<p>Partial evaluation is neat. In short, it’s all about taking an existing
program, modifying it to hold some of its inputs as constants, and then letting
the compiler/optimizer go hog wild on it. The result is still a program—not a
value—and it’s usually faster than the original program.</p>

<p>The usual small example is the power function. If you have a function that takes
two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>x^y</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>power</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>y</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you partially evaluate this function with respect to <code>y</code> at <code>y = 5</code>, you get
a new function that takes one argument, <code>x</code>, and returns <code>x^5</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>power_5</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, to you, this might not look that different from the original function. But
to an optimizer, it is a new world of opportunity. The optimizer can unroll the
loop and remove the conditional:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>power_5</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>weval does that for entire WebAssembly modules. WebAssembly modules that are
normally much bigger than a small <code>power</code> function. You might want to use it
if, for example, your WebAssembly module is an interpreter. Imagine a world
where you have compiled a runtime such as SpiderMonkey or CPython to
WebAssembly. You could then run your Python or JavaScript programs on the
WebAssembly runtime, but they would be slower than if you had compiled them
directly to WebAssembly. And even if you compiled the JS/Python directly to
Wasm, it would probably be slow unless your compiler did some fancy static
analysis. This is where weval comes in.</p>

<h2 id="enter-weval">Enter weval</h2>

<p>SpiderMonkey and CPython are both huge. Instead, we’re going to do a little
demo of a tiny interpreter that I wrote with Chris. Our interpreter doesn’t do
much—local variables, an accumulator, arithmetic, and branching. But it’s
enough to show off the performance boosts that come with weval.</p>

with a <code>switch</code>. It’s not the fastest design<sup id="fnref:computed-goto" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:computed-goto" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but that’s okay.</p>

<p>Using this bytecode, we can write a simple program that adds up all the numbers
from 1 to 100 million:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
  <span>loopc</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>

  <span>LOAD_IMMEDIATE</span><span>,</span> <span>100000000</span><span>,</span>
  <span>STORE_LOCAL</span><span>,</span> <span>loopc</span><span>,</span>

  <span>// loop:</span>
  <span>// result += loopc</span>
  <span>ADD</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>,</span> <span>loopc</span><span>,</span>

  <span>DEC</span><span>,</span>
  <span>STORE_LOCAL</span><span>,</span> <span>loopc</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// if loopc != 0, jump to loop</span>
  <span>JMPNZ</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span>

  <span>// print result</span>
  <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>&#34;Result: &#34;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>LOAD_LOCAL</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>,</span>
  <span>PRINTI</span><span>,</span>
  <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>&#34;</span><span>\n</span><span>&#34;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can compile this interpreter program with any C or C++ compiler, feed the
interpreter the bytecode, and it will print the result after about 350ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>c++ <span>-O2</span> peval.cc <span>-o</span> peval.out
<span>$</span><span> </span>./peval.out
<span>Result: 5000000050000000
</span><span>$</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But let’s assume you want to sandbox this program with WebAssembly. Thankfully,
there’s this project called <a href="https://github.com/webAssembly/wasi-sdk">wasi-sdk</a>
that provides near drop-in replacements for Clang that target WebAssembly. We
can compile the interpreter with wasi-sdk and run it with <code>wasmtime</code> or any
other WebAssembly runtime that provides a WASI polyfill<sup id="fnref:polyfill" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:polyfill" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This runs
in about 530ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang++ <span>-O2</span> peval.cc <span>-o</span> peval.normal.wasm
<span>$</span><span> </span>wasmtime peval.normal.wasm
<span>Result: 5000000050000000
</span><span>$</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But really what we wanted all along was to deploy the program—not the
interpreter too, <em>just</em> the program—in the sandbox. We can do that by
smushing the bytecode and the interpreter together with weval. This runs in
about 40ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang++ <span>-O2</span> <span>-DDO_WEVAL</span> <span>-I</span> include peval.cc <span>-o</span> peval.wasm
<span>$</span><span> </span>weval weval <span>-i</span> peval.wasm <span>-o</span> peval.wevaled.wasm <span>-w</span>
<span>$</span><span> </span>wasmtime peval.wevaled.wasm
<span>Result: 5000000050000000
</span><span>$</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>First of all: let’s step back. We had an interpreter written in C++ that took
350ms to run. We made it a little slower (530ms) by compiling it to
WebAssembly. Then we got a <strong>8.5x speedup</strong> by using weval. That’s nuts. That’s
probably close to what we would get if we hand-wrote a little compiler for our
bytecode machine, but I did not have to write a compiler.</p>

<p>You might notice that I added some sneaky flags like <code>-DDO_WEVAL</code> and <code>-I
include</code> in there. What’s going on?</p>

<h2 id="specializing-the-interpreter">Specializing the interpreter</h2>

<p><strong>Big picture:</strong> give the interpreter function access to constant bytecode.</p>

<p>Well, while weval works <em>correctly</em> on any combination of WebAssembly module
and its input, it works <em>best</em> when you give it a little help and tell it what
data is constant. In order to do that, we pre-initialize the WebAssembly module
using a project called <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wizer">wizer</a>. It
gives you, the programmer, hooks to set up some memory before turning the
running state back into a WebAssembly module. Let’s look at a diagram of the
situation as it is right now:</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>This is too many levels of nesting</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Right now, at run-time, the interpreter loads the bytecode and runs it. The
bytecode is not known ahead of time, so the interpreter has to be general.</p>

<p>In order to specialize the interpreter, we do three steps <em>at WebAssembly
module initialization time</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Load the bytecode</li>
  <li>Create a specialized version of the interpreter function with constant
arguments</li>
  <li>Run constant propagation and other compiler passes on the function</li>
</ol>

<p>In this example, we know the bytecode is constant. We can tell weval this by
using one of its helper intrinsics. In this case, we create a copy of the
<code>Execute</code> function with constant arguments (the <code>program</code>). Now we have two
functions: <code>Execute</code> and <code>ExecuteSpecialized</code>. All of this happens in the
<code>init</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span> <span>IsSpecialized</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>uword</span> <span>Execute</span><span>(</span><span>uword</span> <span>*</span><span>program</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#ifdef DO_WEVAL

<span>}</span>

<span>WIZER_INIT</span><span>(</span><span>init</span><span>);</span>
<span>WEVAL_DEFINE_GLOBALS</span><span>();</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ExecuteSpecialized</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ExecuteSpecialized</span><span>(</span><span>nullptr</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Execute</span><span>&lt;</span><span>false</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that the code has been loaded and marked constant, the picture looks more
like this:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>While the code is constant, weval isn’t magic. It won’t modify control flow, by
default, except simplifying branches that become constant (it doesn’t even know
what an interpreter is!).</p>

<p>In order to start making <code>ExecuteSpecialized</code> faster, we have to drop little
hints into the interpreter for weval to pick up. We want to actually specialize
the control flow—make the control flow in the bytecode become control flow in
the new function itself—so we tell weval about the PC to let it expand out
the code.</p>

<h2 id="modifying-the-interpreter">Modifying the interpreter</h2>

<p><strong>Big picture:</strong> unroll the loop by specializing on the program counter.</p>

<p>We can start off by telling weval what variable to use as a <em>specialization
context</em>. In this case, since we know that the bytecode is constant, we can
specialize on the <code>pc</code>—the program counter. This lets weval completely unroll
the interpreter loop.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>uword</span> <span>Execute</span><span>(</span><span>uword</span> <span>*</span><span>program</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>op</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// ...</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>weval</span><span>::</span><span>update_context</span><span>(</span><span>pc</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running weval on the bundled module, and letting weval unroll the loop,
the picture looks like this:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>This means that from this point forward, we have used weval to turn our
interpreter into a compiler. There are only two optimizations so
far—unrolling the loop and constant propagation—but they are very
effective. The result is a fully WebAssembly module with no interpreter and no
bytecode.</p>

<p>Weval’s compiler passes are not magic. They are the same passes that any
compiler would run on your code. They can unroll the interpreter loop and turn
bytecode into straight-line WebAssembly code. But that code still has local
variable writes push and local variable reads and all the other overhead of the
interpreter. So there’s more to be done…</p>

<h2 id="but-what-if-we-modified-it-more">But what if we modified it more?</h2>

<p><strong>Big picture:</strong> unroll interpreter local variables into WebAssembly local
variables by telling weval where they are.</p>

<p>Memory can be hard to reason about in a compiler. Weval isn’t a whole program
optimizing compiler and might not be able to prove that a memory location (in
this case, the locals array) never escapes or aliases something else. But we,
the interpreter authors, know that. So we can add more hints.</p>

<p>Right now, <code>LOCAL_AT</code> and <code>LOCAL_AT_PUT</code> are macros that read and write to the
locals array:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define LOCAL_AT(idx) (locals[idx])
#define LOCAL_AT_PUT(idx, val) (locals[idx] = val)

<p>That’s all well and good for the interpreter, but it’s not great for the
compiled code. What we really want is to give weval the ability to reason about
each memory location—each local index—separately as an SSA value.</p>

<p>In order to do that, we use weval intrinsics: <code>weval_read_reg</code> and
<code>weval_write_reg</code>. For maximum flexibility, we have a couple of macros that
switch between the two:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#ifdef DO_WEVAL
#define LOCAL_AT(idx) (IsSpecialized ? weval_read_reg(idx) : locals[idx])
#define LOCAL_AT_PUT(idx, val)                                                 \
  if (IsSpecialized) {                                                         \
    weval_write_reg(idx, val);                                                 \
  } else {                                                                     \
    locals[idx] = val;                                                         \
  }
#else
#define LOCAL_AT(idx) (locals[idx])
#define LOCAL_AT_PUT(idx, val) (locals[idx] = val)
#endif
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, weval can reason about each local variable separately and they get
eventually compiled to normal WebAssembly locals.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>The big idea here is that it’s possible to incrementally unravel an interpreter
into a compiler by specializing on constant data and then doing normal compiler
passes. The more you can specialize at build-time, the faster the resulting
generated code will be.</p>

<p>Check out the code in my <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/weval">already old fork of
weval</a>. It includes surprise benchmarks of
Wasm JITs in different JS runtimes, too!</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>Chris gave some more detail about how weval works in <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/weval_slides.pdf">this
talk</a> (PDF), including a description of how the
interpreter function is actually combined with the bytecode. The main idea is
to use the PC values as a “context” in a context-sensitive dataflow analysis,
so regular constant propagation will see the PC value and opcode for just one
interpreter loop iteration, rather than the union of all of them (as a static
analysis normally would). There are a bunch of fiddly details to make it work
well, and Chris also plans to write a blog post covering weval and its
application to SpiderMonkey soon.</p>

<p>Also, our interpreter is tiny and not very interesting on its own. It’s only
useful to explain some weval concepts to you. But the same principles apply to
much larger interpreters, too! There’s SpiderMonkey, yes, and the same could
also probably be done for CPython, the main Python runtime. CPython even has
support for being compiled to WebAssembly already!</p>

<p>Imagine compiling Python directly down to WebAssembly… maybe coming soon?</p>

<h2 id="wilder-ideas">Wilder ideas</h2>

<p>CPython already has support for vectorcall function pointers. This is a way to
add a JIT compiler in a portable way. We could also maybe use this to turn
weval into a Wasm JIT for CPython.</p>

that takes a library approach.</p>
