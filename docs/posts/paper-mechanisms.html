	<p><span>A hexaflexagon is a paper toy, an advertising display device, a “storytelling contraption,” and an interactive demonstration of geometry that requires physical activation in order to be “read.” Through the actions of bending, twisting or rotating, these paper gadgets reveal sequential, looping frames—providing an addic- tive format to tell stories and jokes, to reveal nested information, to create art or simply to provide a satisfy- ing outlet for nervous energy. <a href="https://cutfoldtemplates.com/templates/how_article.pdf" target="_blank">More information here in an article for <em>How Magazine</em></a>.</span></p>

	<p><span>The Miura fold (ミウラ折り Miura-ori) is a method of folding a flat surface such as a sheet of paper into a smaller area. The fold is named for its inventor, Japanese astrophysicist Koryo Miura.[1]
	
	The crease patterns of the Miura fold form a tessellation of the surface by parallelograms. In one direction, the creases lie along straight lines, with each parallelogram forming the mirror reflection of its neighbor across each crease. In the other direction, the creases zigzag, and each parallelogram is the translation of its neighbor across the crease. Each of the zigzag paths of creases consists solely of mountain folds or of valley folds, with mountains alternating with valleys from one zigzag path to the next. Each of the straight paths of creases alternates between mountain and valley folds.[2]
	
	The Miura fold is a form of rigid origami, meaning that the fold can be carried out by a continuous motion in which, at each step, each parallelogram is completely flat. This property allows it to be used to fold surfaces made of rigid materials. For instance, large solar panel arrays for space satellites in the Japanese space program have been Miura folded before launch and then spread out in space.[3][4] A folded Miura fold can be packed into a compact shape, its thickness reflecting only the thickness of the folded material. Folded material can be unpacked in one motion by pulling on its opposite ends, and likewise folded by pushing the two ends together. In the solar array application, this property reduces the number of motors required to unfold this shape, reducing weight and complexity. (Wikipedia)</span></p>

<p><span>The classic, bisected X waterbomb crease pattern is one of the most frequently-employed base patterns in origami. The raising-and-lowering (and collapsing-and-spreading) geometry of the waterbomb is being investigated as an alternative method for tuning different types of antennas. In these tests, paper is printed with dipole and square loop conductive elements and—as the paper moves—is used to tune antennas, sensors, and reflectors. This fold pattern has proven an effective structure in offering a way to sensitively control the resonant tuning of such components.  This modified version inverts every other diamond.</span></p>

		<p><span>Folding patterns which produce very different types (and directions) of movement may be sequenced together in a single sheet. Combining patterns in this manner offers the potential for secondary functions to be nested within a primary pattern’s function. In this example, the hinging action of the miura-ori raises and lowers the tier of cubes. In turn, the uncollapsable cubes function as a spacer—halting the miura-ori fold’s path to a completely collapsed state. The cube’s width define both the time and the distance of this interval.</span></p>

<p><span>A square twist folding pattern consists of the crossed intersection of two perpendicular pleats. When deployed (by pulling L/R or up/down), the structure expands outward in all directions, as the pleats elevate and rotate their square tops. The modular unit that comprises this tessellation is a square paper “switch”—a bistable structure that snaps open or closed. The square twist is extremely challenging to fold. The discovery and development of this pattern was captured in Ron Resch’s “Paper and Stick Film.”</span></p>
