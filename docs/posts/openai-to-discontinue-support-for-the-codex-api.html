    <h1>OpenAI to discontinue support for the Codex API</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Just received this email, can&#39;t find a blog post yet?</p><p>On March 23rd, we will discontinue support for the Codex API. All customers will have to transition to a different model. Codex was initially introduced as a free limited beta in 2021, and has maintained that status to date. Given the advancements of our newest GPT-3.5 models for coding tasks, we will no longer be supporting Codex and encourage all customers to transition to GPT-3.5-Turbo.
