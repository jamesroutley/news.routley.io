    <h1>Research on whether reading fiction makes you nicer</h1>

				<p>The headlines about the benefits of reading just keep coming. If you spend enough time online, you know reading purportedly <a href="https://lithub.com/why-reading-can-make-you-a-better-entrepreneur-and-other-headlines-about-reading/">makes you a better entrepreneur, happier, less stressed, and “more human.”</a> It also apparently makes you more socially adept: the idea is that fiction reveals truths about human interactions and interiority, which readers internalize and apply to their lives. Sure!</p>
<p>Though many of these links are merely anecdotal—“How reading <em>Long Day’s Journey Into Night </em>made me a better dad” and the like—several scientific studies have established a link between reading fiction and understanding other people. <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2013/10/reading-literary-but-not-pop-fiction.html" target="_blank">A 2013 study</a> showed that reading a few pages of literary fiction improved participants’ immediate ability to discern people’s emotions from pictures of their eyes and faces, and those participants sometimes performed better on a Theory of Mind test where participants used visual and verbal cues to determine what someone was thinking or wanting. <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2006/10/reading-novels-linked-with-increased.html" target="_blank">A 2006 study</a> found that readers who knew more names of novelists demonstrated more social awareness.</p>
<p>But there’s been controversy over these studies’ legitimacy. The 2006 study only proves correlation, not causation; the 2013 study’s methodology <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/10/empathy-gap-dont-believe-that-widely-reported-study-in-science-about-literary-fiction-and-social-intelligence.html" target="_blank">was criticized in print</a>. Researchers David Dodell-Feder and Diana I. Tamir set out to check the validity of existing research on the topic. They <a href="https://labsites.rochester.edu/scplab/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dodell-Feder-JEPG-inpress.pdf" target="_blank">ran a meta-analysis</a> on fourteen studies to check whether fiction reading <em>causally </em>improves social cognition—and they discovered that reading fiction has a small, statistically significant impact on social-cognitive performance. In other words, reading fiction makes you <em>a little </em>nicer and more socially aware.</p>

<p>Dodell-Feder and Tamir noted that the nature of the link between fiction and social awareness is still not fully clear; they recommended that future research investigate fiction’s impact on real-world and day-to-day social functioning. But in the meantime, keep reading that literary fiction and nailing that small talk. Let’s create that feedback loop.</p>
