    <p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>In February, Scour scoured <strong>224,806</strong> posts from <strong>2,140</strong> sources looking for great content for you. It&#39;s not the most important addition, but you can find these stats on the <a href="https://scour.ing/about">home page</a>.</p>
<p>Now, on to more useful features. Thanks everyone for your <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing">feedback and suggestions</a>! Here&#39;s what&#39;s new this month:</p>
<h2 id="recommended-interests-and-feeds">Recommended Interests and Feeds</h2><p>Adding interests and feeds can be a little tedious. Now, Scour gives you recommendations for both.</p>
<p>On your <a href="https://scour.ing/interests">Interests</a> page, you&#39;ll find a list of recommended topics. These are AI-generated and I&#39;m still tweaking it, so I&#39;d love to hear what you think of the suggestions. (This isn&#39;t quite the <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/11">&#34;more of this&#34;</a> that Laurynas asked for, but that idea prompted me to get moving on this feature.)</p>
<p>You can also find recommended feeds on your <a href="https://scour.ing/feeds">Feeds</a> page. These are the sources that had the most relevant content for you over the last month. (This was previously in the Browse section, but that might not have been obvious. Thanks to <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/24">justmoon</a> for the suggestion to move it over.)</p>
<h2 id="language-filter">Language Filter</h2><p>Scour now uses a model to determine the language of each article and will filter out posts in languages you don&#39;t speak. If you understand languages other than English, you can add them in your <a href="https://scour.ing/settings">settings</a>. (Thanks <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/19">Cairinmichie</a> for the suggestion!)</p>
<h2 id="source-diversity">Source Diversity</h2><p>Scour wouldn&#39;t be all that useful if it just told you to go read a single newspaper or only showed you content from Hacker News. Now, it automatically tries to diversify the domains and feeds it shows you content from. (Thanks to <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/14">Allen</a> for the feedback!)</p>
<h2 id="other-updates">Other Updates</h2><ul>
<li>The user experience should be a bit smoother across the site, thanks to HTMX. For example, you can now edit your interests and deleting an interest or feed won&#39;t jump you back up to the top of the page. (Thanks justmoon and Zack for the feedback.)</li>
<li>If you forget your password, you can now reset it via email. Also, the password field on the sign-up form should now prompt password managers to suggest a new password. (Thanks to an <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/18">anonymous user</a> and <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/21">Cairinmichie</a> for these suggestions!)</li>
<li>User feeds are available as JSON Feeds at <code>/@username/feed.json</code>, in addition to the RSS and Atom formats. (Thanks to <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/22">Aarontharker1972</a> for the suggestion!)</li>
<li>You can export your feeds from Scour to import them to another RSS reader using the standard OPML format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy scouring ‚Äî and <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing">keep the feedback coming</a>!</p>

<p>P.S. For any Rust programmers, I also wrote a blog post on <a href="https://emschwartz.me/pinning-down-future-is-not-send-errors/">Pinning Down &#34;Future Is Not Send&#34; Errors</a>.</p>
