<p><strong>At the origins of the Personal Computer: the Olivetti Programma 101 (1965)</strong></p>
<p>These days, Italy is not particularly renowned for its consumer electronics products; yet, there was a time, in the ’60s, when an Italian company was reputed to be the “European response” to American computer manufacturers; that company was <strong>Olivetti</strong>.</p>
<p>The company was founded in Ivrea, Northern Italy, in the early 20th century as a typewriter maker; but, in the late ’50s, under the direction of <strong>Adriano Olivetti</strong> and his son <strong>Roberto</strong>, it became one of the first European companies to regularly produce electronic calculators and computers, often characterized by innovative design and engineering solutions.</p>
<p><strong>The first human-centered computer</strong></p>
<p>This idea was utterly revolutionary since, at the time, computers were massive mainframes sealed in airtight rooms and operated by an elite of specialized technicians in white coats. Just before revealing the “dream machine”, a Programma 101 advertisement recited: <em>“Welcome to the world of tomorrow. You are about to take a journey out of this world into the world of the future”</em>, another one was showing a businessman and a handsome woman in a swimsuit (his secretary, perhaps) working on a Perottina right at the side of a pool…</p>

<p><strong>The development stage</strong></p>
<p>The early story of the Programma is somewhat romantic. Olivetti had just sold its electronics division to General Electric, which wasn’t interested in an “Italian computer” at all.</p>

<p>When we look at the specifications and capabilities of the machine, today, it is hard to think it was a real computer.</p>
<p>The P101 didn’t have a monitor or the like, it used a small paper tape printer as a visualization device, instead. A revolutionary innovation made by Olivetti was to replace the fridge-size magnetic tape mass memory devices typical of coeval mainframes with a <strong>programmable magnetic card reader/recorder</strong>.</p>

<p>The machine didn’t have a microprocessor or integrated circuits; like most computers of the time, its electronics were exclusively based on transistors, diodes, capacitors, and the like, grouped into larger functional “micro-units” (a patented technology specially developed by Olivetti for the Programma 101).</p>

<p><strong>The design of the Programma 101 body<br/>
</strong>The design of the Programma’s body was conducted by <strong>Mario Bellini</strong>, a then-young architect, who was preferred to other designers who had previously worked for Olivetti, such as Ettore Sottsass, Marco Zanuso, and Marcello Nizzoli. Zanuso was contacted at first, but his proposal was a massive self-standing box, similar to that of a mainframe, which would have nullified all the effort to keep the device as small and lightweight as possible.</p>
<p>The team of Perotto had already created an impromptu wood case for the machine, just to give the P101 some kind of a container, but they were aware they still needed an open-mind architect keen to work on something never seen before. The young Bellini was possibly that man.</p>
<p>For the P101, Bellini conceived a case, mostly made in <strong>cast aluminum</strong>, whose round-edge shape set it apart from other electronics products by Olivetti, such as the mainframe <em>ELEA 9003</em> designed by Sottsass only a few years before.</p>

<p>The design of the Perottina is somewhat reminiscent of that (again by Sottsass) of the <strong>Olivetti Logos 27</strong> electromechanical calculator, which was first presented, together with the Programma 101, in October 1965 at the <strong>Bema</strong> (Business Equipment Manufacturer Association) show in New York.  Like the 101, the Logos 27 also had a die-cast alloy case; overall, both machines look a bit like big typewriters.</p>

<p>I see in it some elements – such as the use of thin lines to make the object appear smaller than it actually was, the playful contrast between the almost-white color case and the vividly-colored logo area, and the uncluttered design of slots and handles – which recall me the <strong>“Snow White” design language</strong> developed for Apple by German designer <em>Hartmut Esslinger</em> twenty years later.</p>

<p><strong>The P101 commercial success and legacy</strong></p>
<p>Olivetti <strong>sold about 44,000 Programma 101 units</strong>, mostly in the United States, including 10 machines that NASA used for the Apollo 11 program.</p>
<p><em>“By Apollo 11 we had a desktop computer, sort of, kind of, called an Olivetti Programma 101. It was kind of a super calculator. (…) It would add, subtract, multiply, and divide, but it would remember a sequence of these things, and it would record that sequence on a magnetic card (…). So you could write a sequence, a programming sequence, and load it in there”</em> David W. Whittle, Johnson Space Center, NASA</p>
<p>What makes the Perottina a quantum leap in computer concept and design was being <strong>the first human-centered computer</strong> ever made.</p>
<p><em>“Those days, few manufacturers and designers were interested in the user’s perspective and user-friendliness of machines. After all, In the ’60s, the available technology was limited, and the interest of computer designers was entirely focused on technical issues and on making devices work. It was the user who had to adapt to the machine, not the opposite. The electronics had to provide quantitative performances – as much computational power, memory, and printing speed as possible -, there was no room to improve the relationship between computers and their users who, moreover, were all specialized technicians. Despite technology was improving in power, nevertheless, it didn’t leave much to those interested in making machines more friendly and easy to use.”  </em>(Pier Giorgio Perotto, Programma 101. The never told, fascinating story of the invention of the Personal Computer, p. 20)</p>
<p>That’s why the Programma was technically and aesthetically conceived as an unintimidating object everyone could use, even at home. In that sense, there is no doubt that the Olivetti Programma 101 truly is <strong>the first Personal Computer</strong> in history.</p>
