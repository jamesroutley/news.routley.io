    <h1>I made a substack because I like having a platform more than I hate thinking about audience engagement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I made a newsletter. It’s <a href="https://eieio.substack.com">here</a>, on substack. Then I wrote a post on my blog about making a substack. It’s <a href="http://eieio.games/essays/i-made-a-substack">here</a>, on my blog, which you’re reading right now.
<!-- excerpt-end --></p>

<p>Having another platform for posting text feels a little silly. I am on a <a href="http://eieio.games/whats-my-deal">horrifying number of platforms</a> already. But newsletters are different than blogs. They’re having a Moment. They’re good for audience engagement. Thinking about audience engagement is not good for my mood, but having a platform is.</p>

<p>So I made a substack! I’ll use it to send out high-signal updates about my work such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Announcements of larger things like <a href="http://eieio.games/nonsense/game-12-stranger-video">stranger.video</a></li>
  <li>Occasional aggregations of things like <a href="http://eieio.games/game-diary/game-8-wub">wub</a> and <a href="http://eieio.games/essays/my-computer-tells-me-to-go-to-bed">my computer tells me to go to bed</a></li>
  <li>(maybe) longer columns, if I end up writing any</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this will let me continue to post small things on my site without spamming subscibers of the substack.</p>

<p>I spent November thinking about my goals for 2024, which lead to me making a substack, which means that I’ll forever associate my substack with my 2024 goals. I also spent November going <a href="https://twitter.com/NendooMAN/status/1725852293969670243">viral in Japan</a>, an experience I’ll forever associate with not yet having a substack for folks to subscribe to.</p>

<p>I’m working on a post recapping 2023 and looking at my goals for 2024. In the meantime, make sure to like and subscribe.</p>
