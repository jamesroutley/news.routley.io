    <h1>Soldering Wires â€“ Here&#39;s a different way</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article"><header data-location="header"></header><div><div><section id="intro" data-stepid="SL0E58OKZ7C3YNP"><h2>Introduction: Soldering Wires - Here&#39;s a Different Way</h2><p>This is a easy method of soldering wires to circuit boards. The solder feeds itself into the joint automatically so you don&#39;t need an extra hand to hold it. This method also allows exact amounts of solder on each joint. And it&#39;s quick.</p></section><section id="stepsupplies" data-stepid=""><h2>Supplies</h2><p>Nothing special required, just your soldering iron and solder. Oh, and your PCB and wires!</p></section><section id="step1" data-stepid="SH6MSFGKZ7C3YNS"><h2>Step 1: Watch the Video</h2><p>Two great tips in a couple of minutes. Subscribe to the channel for more like this.</p></section><section id="step2" data-stepid="S6REHEEKZ7C3YNV"><h2>Step 2: Why Use My Method?</h2><div><p>Use this method where you want to avoid &#39;spikey&#39; joints and achieve speed and consistency of the joints.</p><p>So many times I see people using previously applied solder on a joint where the flux has already been used up. This can lead to &#39;spikey&#39; solder joints. My method feeds in flux and new solder automatically at the correct speed and the correct quantity for the joint.</p></div></section><section id="step3" data-stepid="SR1Z9XAKZ7C3YNY"><h2>Step 3: How It Works</h2><p>Instead of the solder being last to the joint, I apply it first and I make sure it&#39;s not all melted. I cut off the surplus to ensure the joint will have the correct amount of solder. Now&#39;s a good time to add solder lengths to the other pads that require wires.</p></section><section id="step4" data-stepid="S65QIPDKZ7C3YO2"><h2>Step 4: The Soldering Step Is Super-quick</h2><p>Offer up the wire to the joint followed by the iron. The solder melts and feeds into the joint super-quick (watch the video, even in slow-mo it&#39;s amazing).</p></section><section id="step5" data-stepid="S6X0QMPKZ7C3YO6"><h2>Step 5: Multiple Wire Joints</h2><div><p>If you have lots of wires to connect, this is a real timesaver. Each joint can have a different amount of solder depending on its size. Trimming off the length determines how much solder will be used, so it keeps you in full control here.</p><p>Not having to hold the solder gives you freedom to position each wire easily by hand.</p></div></section><section id="step6" data-stepid="S4TZ47UKZ7C3YO9"><h2>Step 6: Avoiding Melting the Insulation</h2><p>Here is the last tip. Pull the sleeving back before soldering, and ease it back after the joint cools.</p></section><section id="imadeits"><h2>
