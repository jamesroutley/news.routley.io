    <p>The virtual palisade <em>paywall</em> is first used to describe a membership-restricted sports website in 2004. The Wall Street Journal’s site had been paywalled since 1996, but this was such a rare practice that we didn’t need a word for it until much later. The Great Paywalling did not in fact begin until the early 2010s, when it became clear the previously dominant ad-supported model could not sustainably fund good journalism. For example, the NYT’s paywall went up in March 2011.</p>

<p><em>Paywall</em> is obviously a compound of the common words <em>pay-</em> and <em>-wall</em>, but the choice of <em>-wall</em> in particular is influenced by the parallel <em>firewall</em>. Referring to computer security systems since 1971 and popularized in the 1983 hacker movie WarGames (“the only winning move is not to play”), a <em>firewall</em> referred to any system that separated unauthorized users from other critical systems. It settled on its current more specific meaning of a passive deterrence that blocks automated intrusions in the 1990s.</p>

<p><em>Firewall</em>’s computer security meaning arose from a metaphor for its physical meaning, a fire-resistant barrier preventing the spread of fires by separating burnable things from each other. Uncontained, wildly spreading fires used to be a major problem for cities; <em>firewalls</em>, first attested in 1851, were one of many tools developed and deployed to combat this. The more general meaning of a protective barrier of any sort is from 1907.</p>
