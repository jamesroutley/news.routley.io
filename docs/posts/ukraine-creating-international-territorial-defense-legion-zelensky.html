    <p>Ukraine is creating an international territorial defense legion consisting of foreigners who want to join the resistance to Russian occupiers and protect world security, the Ukrainian President&#39;s Office has said.</p>

        <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/zvernennya-do-gromadyan-inozemnih-derzhav-yaki-pragnut-dopom-73213?fbclid=IwAR0NHx2fTbMdgXHEnf-OmAvss68kK2O3J3EQ77gpCB67FkBPD7wf7GanAq4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said </a>in his address that early on February 24, 2022, Russia launched a new military operation against Ukraine. This is an unjustified criminal and cynical invasion. The Russian army is following very vile tactics. Residential houses destroyed by missiles and artillery are the ultimate argument for the world to stop the occupation invasion.</p>

<p>&#34;Ukrainians have the courage to defend their homeland, to defend Europe, to defend the values of civilization. However, this is not just Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe. Against the unity of Europe. Against basic human rights in Europe. Against all the rules of coexistence on the continent,&#34; Zelensky said.</p>

<p>The president addressed all citizens of foreign countries who are friends of Ukraine: all those who want to join the defense of security in Europe and the world can come and stand side by side with Ukrainians against the invaders of the XXI century.</p>

<p>According to the Regulations on Military Service in the Armed Forces by Foreigners and Stateless Persons, approved by Ukrainian presidential decree No. 248 of June 10, 2016, foreigners have the right to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine on contracts on a voluntary basis. They can also join the territorial defense forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.</p>

<p>In this regard, all foreigners who wish to join the resistance to Russian occupiers and protect world security, the leadership of Ukraine offers to come and join the ranks of the territorial defense forces. A separate unit of foreigners is being formed - the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine.</p>

<p>This will be a key sign of support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>For registration in the legion and for all details, it is necessary to contact the defense attachés of the Embassies of Ukraine in respective countries (contact information available on the websites of the embassies).</p>
