<p>Lately, I’ve had several occasions to reconsider what I read and how and why I take notes. I’ve been constantly refining the process, getting rid of everything that’s unnecessary, reducing the “system” to a bare minimum. One of the realizations has been that I read too much, take too many notes, yet don’t really <em>do</em> anything with this new information.</p>



<p>This is similar to the idea of having <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/04/16/a-personal-library-of-100-books/">a personal library of 100 books</a>, but back then, I was thinking mostly of books. And <em>thinking</em> doesn’t equal <em>doing</em>, because even after writing that post I didn’t actually spend any time applying the knowledge I’d gained over the last several years.</p>



<p>I’m tired of this. I think we overvalue thinking and undervalue taking action on that thinking. It’s easy to discuss ideas, which is one reason I think I’ve done so much of it and used to find it appealing.</p>



<p>Lately, though, simply reading or thinking about ideas feels inadequate, even a waste of time. It feels <em>wrong</em> to me, because it goes against some of the things I value deep down–things which don’t have a specific word for them (that I’m aware of, with my non-native knowledge of English).</p>



<p>It’s the value that seeks to <em>do</em> things, <em>see</em> the results of doing those things. Ideas made tangible. </p>



<p>I don’t want to do a lot of things; <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/09/06/38-there-is-no-shame-in-dying-for-nothing/">I don’t want to give productivity any say in how I live my life</a>. Which is why I stopped tracking my reading on Goodreads and StoryGraph and <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/12/14-no-more-keeping-count-of-words/">stopped counting the number of words I write</a> each day and try not to check my views on LinkedIn (keyword: try).</p>



<p>I don’t want to derive pleasure from “having an opinion.” I want to be hopeful and action-oriented, but not idealistic and closed to discussion. I don’t want the mere discussion of ideas to give me satisfaction. </p>



<p>So recently my mind rewarded me with something that would help me live up to that unnamed value within me: the concept of a “do something about it” club.</p>



<p>People who’ve been reading this blog for some while might know about my mission to <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/10/12-the-bookmark-deep-clean/">read everything in my bookmarks bar</a>. How’s that going? Well, I’ve read a lot–and filled several pages with notes–but the bookmarks keep coming. If you use the internet every day like I do, and follow interesting people, you’ll always have stuff you need to read and watch and listen to.</p>



<p>So, even after 2 months of regularly deep cleaning my bookmarks bar, the total number hasn’t budged much. The problem was that I was chasing the horizon. It was the wrong goal. Since inaction frustrates me, what I should have aimed to do back then was to not make notes on the contents of the articles/blog posts/videos/etc. but to ask of each item, “now what?”</p>



<p>Now that I’ve read this article on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">small b blogging</a>, for example, what’s next? What can I do? <em>Is</em> there anything I can do? If not, do I really need to remember this? And if I don’t need to remember this, what and who am I taking notes for? Do I simply want to collect statements, that when shared with people who disagree with me, will give me an ego boost for being exposed to and believing in “better” ideas than them?</p>



<h2>Club rules</h2>



<p>I call it a club, because that’s the solution I envisioned to the above problems: I imagined a group of, say, 10-15 people reading an article, then meeting in person or online to discuss the answer to “now what?” We won’t talk about our feelings but rather brainstorm actions. Author X pointed out this gap in concept Y. What can we do about this, as individuals or as groups?</p>



<p>For example, I recently <a href="https://chavanniclass.com/2023/08/31/32-one-thing-at-a-time/">wrote a blog post</a> about <a href="https://jessicaabel.com/one-goal/">Jessica Abel’s post on choosing one goal at a time</a>, a principle I’ve applied successfully:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few days, while working on the first issue of <em><a href="https://the-metronome.ghost.io/">The Metronome</a></em>, I’ve been applying this principle as much as possible: one tab, one document, one task at a time. And I’ve gotten a lot of work done. When a website loads, I wait instead of opening up another tab to pass the time meanwhile. I don’t flit between tabs the moment I get bored; I get up and take a break, or shut down the laptop.</p>



<p>It’s been light, freeing. I smile more often. And I don’t feel the burden of tasks to be done. There’s no feeling of overwhelm. My eyes don’t get tired.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was just me taking action on something that concerned only me. In the club, I imagine that the members can come together and take actions that not only help them but also each other and the people around them or the world in general. Maybe they’ll start a new publication. Organize a class. Volunteer somewhere. Create a petition. Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plogging">plogging</a> together. Invent something. Who knows?</p>



<p>The point is to stop getting satisfaction from simply reading a lot and focus on actually taking action. Me reading about and thus becoming aware of a problem doesn’t fix the problem until and unless I do something about it. If there’s no change in my actions, then I might as well have not read it at all.</p>



<p>Of course, sometimes you read something that you can’t immediately act upon–such as a guide on supporting someone with panic disorder when you don’t know anyone who has panic disorder. </p>



<p>But we tend to choose stuff that’s relevant to us, and I think it’s safe to bet that for at least 50% of the things we read, there is some action we can take, no matter how small, and no matter whether its directed at our own selves or at the world outside of us. And that’s what I hope we can do in the Do Something About It Club. </p>



<p>I think I’ll do something about it and start recruiting.</p>
