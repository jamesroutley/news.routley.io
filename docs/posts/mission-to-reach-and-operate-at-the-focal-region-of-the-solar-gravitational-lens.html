      <span>Abstract:</span>  We present initial results of an ongoing engineering study on the feasibility
of a space mission to the focal region of the solar gravitational lens (SGL).
The mission goal is to conduct exoplanet imaging operations at heliocentric
distances in the range ~548-900 astronomical units (AU). Starting at 548 AU
from the Sun, light from an exoplanet located behind the Sun is greatly
amplified by the SGL. The objective is to capture this light and use it for
multipixel imaging of an exoplanet up to 100 light years distant. Using a
meter-class telescope one can produce images of the exoplanet with a surface
resolution measured in tens of kilometers and to identify signs of
habitability. The data are acquired pixel-by-pixel while moving an imaging
spacecraft within the image. Given the long duration of the mission, decades to
900 AU, we address an architecture for the fastest possible transit time while
reducing mission risk and overall cost. The mission architecture implements
solar sailing technologies and in-space aggregation of modularized functional
units to form mission capable spacecraft. The study reveals elements of such a
challenging mission, but it is nevertheless found to be feasible with
technologies that are either extant or in active development.
