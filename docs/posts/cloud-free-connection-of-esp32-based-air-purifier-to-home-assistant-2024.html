There&#39;s something so satisfying about having everything connected and automated in one application; I can finally forget every random mobile app for a different brand of smart product.</p><p>But there is one product I own that stubbornly doesn&#39;t connect to anything other than its own mobile app. It&#39;s a sleek air purifier that is unfortunately let down by its disappointing app.</p><p>So many modern products depend on an internet connection and cloud account for basic functions, and who knows what unnecessary data they collect or technical vulnerabilities they add to the home network?</p><p>I want to control this expensive air purifier just like the rest of my smart gadgets. And that marks the start of this challenging yet undoubtedly fun journey.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s time to hack an air purifier! 😆</strong></p><p>By the way, if you enjoy my content, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://buymeacoffee.com/jmswrnr"><span aria-hidden="true"><img alt="" role="presentation" loading="lazy" width="16" height="16" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://jmswrnr.com/api/favicon/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2J1eW1lYWNvZmZlZS5jb20vam1zd3JuciIsInN1YiI6ImZhdmljb24tYXBpLXVybCJ9.hhylThN750CSNHURkKtq9DvxllRuvwkywVbRgkXkv1U"/><span aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></span><span>Buy Me a Coffee</span></a> to support my content creation!</p><div><p>The contents of this post are intended for educational purposes on the process of reverse engineering IoT smart devices and network protocols. </p><p>Hacking can be a scary term, so I&#39;d like to make it clear that my intentions were solely to upgrade the smart device I&#39;ve purchased to integrate with my smart home system. Doing so does not affect any other instances of this product or its cloud services. Therefore, any sensitive product-specific data, such as private keys, domains, or API endpoints, have been obfuscated or redacted from this post.</p><p>Tinkering with your devices will likely void any warranty and carries a risk of permanently damaging the device; do so at your own risk.</p></div><h2><a href="#the-plan" title="The Plan"><span aria-hidden="true"></span><span>The Plan</span></a></h2><p>If we&#39;re going to hack this device to be controlled by custom software, we&#39;re going to need to understand its current capabilities and plan a point of attack, requiring the least amount of work to achieve our goal. </p><p>The device already supports remote control with its own mobile app, which annoyingly requires a cloud account to use. By toggling my phone&#39;s Bluetooth, WiFi, and 5G, I was able to confirm that the app required an internet connection to control the device. Remote control was not possible locally via Bluetooth or WiFi.</p><p>This means the mobile app and device must be connected to a cloud server for the remote control to be possible. So, somewhere in that network, data between the device and its cloud server must be the fan speed and everything else the app controls. </p><p>So, that is our point of attack:</p><ul><li><p>If we can intercept the device&#39;s network traffic and change those values, we have control of the device. </p></li><li><p>If we can emulate all of the server responses, we have control of the device without depending on an internet connection and its cloud server.</p></li></ul><h2><a href="#mobile-app-analysis" title="Mobile App Analysis"><span aria-hidden="true"></span><span>Mobile App Analysis</span></a></h2><p>One of the first things I looked into was the remote control mobile app. This can be a quick way to gather some information, as Android apps can be relatively simple to pull apart.</p><p>Apps on Android are stored as a <code>.apk</code> file.

For example, data at offset <code>0x17CC4</code> in the partition image is actually mapped to <code>0x40080ce0</code> in the device&#39;s virtual memory, so although this file contains all of the application logic and data, Ghidra won&#39;t understand how to resolve any absolute memory references, at least for now. There will be more on this later!</p><p>The ESP32 microprocessor uses the Xtensa instruction set, and Ghidra has recently added support for this! When loading the image, you can select the language <code>Tensilica Xtensa 32-bit little-endian</code>. We can run the auto analysis; although it won&#39;t give us great results just yet, we can still look at any defined strings it is able to find.</p><h2><a href="#string-theory" title="String Theory"><span aria-hidden="true"></span><span>String Theory</span></a></h2><p>Text strings in a compiled application are a fast-track way of locating and understanding logic when reverse engineering; they can reveal a lot about the application. </p><p>Because this compiled file only contains bytecode instructions for the processor, there are no function names, data types, or parameters. It can initially seem like a giant blob of nonsense, but as soon as you a string reference like <code>Failed to read wifi config file</code>, you can start to piece together what the logic is doing. Reverse engineering compiled applications can be difficult, but it is certainly a rewarding challenge.</p><p>So, I had a look through the <code>Defined Strings</code> window in Ghidra to see what I could find, and noticed all of the strings we saw in the serial output, such as:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>000031c4	</span><span>&#34;Serial Number: %s</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>&#34;</span><span>

Ideally, this should be the address in the virtual memory when running on the ESP32; that way, we can see any bytecode that references this string. We&#39;ll tackle that soon!</p></div><p>In close proximity to these strings were some others of interest:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>000030d0	</span><span>&#34;Message CRC error</span><span>\r</span><span>&#34;</span><span>

So, what exactly are they?</p><p>ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange) is a key agreement protocol that allows 2 parties (like the smart device and its cloud server), each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel (UDP). I found a great explanation of this in more detail in &#34;Practical Cryptography for Developers&#34;: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/ecdh-key-exchange"><span aria-hidden="true"><img alt="" role="presentation" loading="lazy" width="16" height="16" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://jmswrnr.com/api/favicon/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NyeXB0b2Jvb2submFrb3YuY29tL2FzeW1tZXRyaWMta2V5LWNpcGhlcnMvZWNkaC1rZXktZXhjaGFuZ2UiLCJzdWIiOiJmYXZpY29uLWFwaS11cmwifQ.K08dQQf7o8obAAO0J9D2t2OfZToOjgVkGOwsRnFRdpI"/><span aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></span><span>ECDH Key Exchange</span></a>.</p><p>Essentially, if the smart device and server generate an EC key pair and exchange their public keys, they can use the other&#39;s public key with their private key to compute a shared secret key. This shared secret key could be used to encrypt and decrypt the packets! And even though they exchange public keys over the insecure network, you still need one of the private keys in order to compute the shared key.</p><p>This is ideal for securing packets like this, and the first packet sent by the client is actually named the <code>ECC conn packet</code> in the logs:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>UDP Connect</span><span>:</span><span> smartdeviceep.---.com

</span></span><span>UDP Socket created
</span><span>UDP RX Thread Start
</span><span>Write ECC conn packet</span></code></pre></div></div><p>This is great progress; we know the first packet exchange is likely exchanging EC public keys to establish an ECDH key agreement to encrypt all the other packets.</p><p>If we ignore the packet header (13 bytes from the start) and checksum (2 bytes at the end), we can see the contents of the packets for this potential key exchange are both 32 bytes (256 bits), which would be a valid size for a public key. Even though the client&#39;s request has <code>00 01</code> at the start, we can assume this is some unimportant data descriptor as it doesn&#39;t change value between boots:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>// Client request packet contents:</span><span>

That includes any possible input data as well as configurable options.</p><p>It&#39;s safe to assume the ECDH and HKDF functions are used for the packet data, so focusing on the key generation process, I summarize the variables we need to understand:</p><ul><li><div><p>ECDH:</p><ul><li><p>Public key</p></li><li><p>Private key</p></li></ul></div></li><li><div><p>HKDF</p><ul><li><p>Hashing method</p></li><li><p>Output key size</p></li><li><p>Optional salt</p></li><li><p>Optional info</p></li></ul></div></li></ul><p>The smart device and its cloud server both exchange 256 bits of data during what we assume is the key exchange process. But remember, the smart device firmware also loads the following keys from storage:</p><ul><li><p>256-bit device key pair (private &amp; public)</p></li><li><p>256-bit cloud server <code>&#34;root&#34;</code> public key</p></li><li><p>256-bit cloud server <code>&#34;signer&#34;</code> public key</p></li></ul><p>There are a lot of possibilities here, so I take another look at the application in Ghidra. By following the error strings, I located the function which generates this key! I steadily work my way through labeling functions and variables by comparing the assembly to the mbedtls source code. I was able to annotate and simplify it to the following pseudocode:</p><div><div><pre><code><span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>GenerateNetworkKey</span><span>(</span><span>uchar </span><span>*</span><span>outputKey</span><span>,</span><span> uchar </span><span>*</span><span>outputRandomBytes</span><span>)</span><span>

However, the source of truth for state updates is always the device, meaning the state will never update in the MQTT broker unless the device updates it via the custom server. This covers a couple of edge cases:</p><ul><li><p>If the state update was unsuccessful, we should not display the state as updated.</p></li><li><p>The state update should be reflected via the MQTT broker if the smart device was updated via its physical control panel.</p></li></ul></div><p>The three main cases we are supporting here are:</p><ul><li><p>When the smart device boots and initially connects to the custom server, it requests the latest state; we can attempt to obtain this from the MQTT broker&#39;s retained value or fall back to a default state.</p></li><li><p>When Home Assistant wants to update the state, it will send a command to the MQTT broker. We can subscribe to this command topic from the custom server and forward the request to the smart device.</p></li><li><p>When the smart device&#39;s state changes for any reason, it sends the <code>mirror_data</code> packet to update the server state; we send this value to the MQTT broker to update the state and tell it to retain the data as the latest value.</p></li></ul><p>I run this custom server alongside Mosquitto and Home Assistant on my small home automation server.

So, In the case of any data loss, the server would entirely lose the ability to respond to any device communications; that is a scary thought for the business. Unless there is an insecure network fallback in place, which is equally alarming and time-consuming to develop</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Because the firmware contains a private key that is static, an attacker needs a single firmware dump to obtain the key and perform an MITM attack. Whereas, if an EC private key was instead generated at runtime, write access would be required in order to patch the server public key or application firmware, which could be protected by other means.</p></li></ul><p>Also, the mobile app has a 1-star review on the app store.

In the bigger picture, it&#39;s just an annoying yet passable hoop for an attacker to jump through. </p><p>I&#39;ve had a few conversations recently about why engineers build from the ground up vs. using proven standards. And that&#39;s a very interesting topic; I&#39;ll save that for another post!</p><h2><a href="#conclusion" title="Conclusion"><span aria-hidden="true"></span><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>What a crazy journey that was! </p><p>I&#39;d like to emphasize that the reverse-engineering process was not as smooth as it may seem from this post; I&#39;ve done my best to format everything to be best read by you. But in reality, I was often in the dark, unsure if the next thing would work or not, and juggling many tasks and theories, iteratively making progress in multiple places to test my assumptions ASAP.</p><p>I tried some things that hit dead-ends and weren&#39;t worth dedicated sections in this post:</p><ul><li><p>I tried running the firmware in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/espressif/qemu"><span aria-hidden="true"><img alt="" role="presentation" loading="lazy" width="16" height="16" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://jmswrnr.com/api/favicon/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vZXNwcmVzc2lmL3FlbXUiLCJzdWIiOiJmYXZpY29uLWFwaS11cmwifQ._71KMtKqaQJfQpbqc7KbHNLDTF3AE12XHUZeBL-MUwI"/><span aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></span><span>Espressif&#39;s fork of QEMU</span></a>, patched out the CapSense service, and loaded virtual e-fuses to match the MAC address from the firmware, all to find out it doesn&#39;t support WiFi emulation. It was fun to see it booting virtually, though!</p></li><li><p>I also tried flashing a different serial number, device key, and certificates to see if that affected anything before I got around to fully reversing the application logic. I didn&#39;t get much from this. Turns out this likely would have just affected the computed shared secret used for the HKDF salt, which we dumped anyway.</p></li></ul><p>I&#39;ve certainly sharpened a variety of skills from this project. I&#39;m also proud I achieved my goal of adding this device to Home Assistant! The moment I managed to successfully decrypt the first packet was great; everything just clicked into place.</p><p>I&#39;m still curious to explore creating an open-source project to de-cloud and debug smart home products; I&#39;ve learned much more about the technical aspects of achieving that.</p><p>Thanks for reading! I hope you found some value in this post. I put a massive amount of effort into creating it, probably more than I did actually doing the project itself. It would be amazing to receive feedback on the format!</p><p>I&#39;d also really appreciate it if you could help share the post. </p><p>You can drop a follow on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/jmswrnr"><span aria-hidden="true"><img alt="" role="presentation" loading="lazy" width="16" height="16" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://jmswrnr.com/api/favicon/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXR0ZXIuY29tL2ptc3dybnIiLCJzdWIiOiJmYXZpY29uLWFwaS11cmwifQ.-Rrd6Kw2tqfOFMKiz_Y6uSDftdN1O3wtZUZVOj6azWY"/><span aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></span><span>X</span></a> to stay updated with what I&#39;m doing.</p><p>If you found it helpful and would like to support my content creation, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://buymeacoffee.com/jmswrnr"><span aria-hidden="true"><img alt="" role="presentation" loading="lazy" width="16" height="16" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://jmswrnr.com/api/favicon/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2J1eW1lYWNvZmZlZS5jb20vam1zd3JuciIsInN1YiI6ImZhdmljb24tYXBpLXVybCJ9.hhylThN750CSNHURkKtq9DvxllRuvwkywVbRgkXkv1U"/><span aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></span><span>Buy Me a Coffee</span></a>!
