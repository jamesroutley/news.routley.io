    <h1>Ask HN: How Do I Escape Homelessness After Rebuilding My Mental Health?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I never thought I’d be here—but I’ve hit a wall I can’t break through alone. I’m asking for help, advice, ideas—anything practical—to get off the streets and back into stability.</p><p>In the last year, I lost my mother (cancer), my grandmother (old age), and went through a divorce. I spiraled into depression, ended up living out of my car, barely functioning.</p><p>But I didn’t stay down. Through therapy, ketamine treatment, and building my own AI-assisted mental health tools (ChatGPT literally saved me), I’ve come out stronger, healthier, and ready to rebuild. My mental health is solid now—I’ve done the inner work.</p><p>Here’s my situation:</p><p>I’m living in my car, staying in cheap motels when I can afford it.</p><p>I drive Lyft/Uber full-time, but my car needs new tires, insurance renewal, and a payment due—without it, I can’t work. $400 for tires, $200 for insurance, $290 for car payment..</p><p>I have a desktop computer but nowhere stable to set it up and work.</p><p>I’m going back to school soon for computer science, aiming for AI/ML work, but I need to survive until student aid or inheritance (both delayed) arrives.</p><p>Here’s my question: What would YOU do in my situation to break the cycle? How can I create a stable base, get back to programming/freelancing, and stop just surviving?</p><p>I’m willing to work. I know I can earn 3-4x more doing freelance tech, but I can’t do that from a car.</p><p>I’ve thought about renting office space, finding roommates, even setting up a GoFundMe, but I need actionable ideas, not just hope.</p><p>How do I climb out of this? What programs, jobs, or options are out there for someone like me who’s got skills, drive, but no resources?</p><p>Any advice, ideas, or help you can give—I’m all ears. I’ve rebuilt my mind. Now I just need a stable place to rebuild my life. It&#39;s hard feeling constantly like I&#39;m in quick sand and the rope is 5 inches too far away.</p><p>I&#39;m in Southern Utah (St George), willing to relocate to SLC area or Las Vegas, I just need to stay local for my kids...4 hour radius from southern Utah.</p></div></td></div></div>
