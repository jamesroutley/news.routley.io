              <p>At Futel, we believe in the preservation of public telephone hardware as a means of providing access to the agora for everybody, and toward that goal we are privileged to provide free telephone calls, voicemail, and telephone-mediated services.</p>

<p><strong>All services, including telephony and human interaction, are free from any Futel telephone.</strong></p>
