    <h1>Bob Dole Has Died</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         <p>Bob Dole went from the plains of Kansas to the battlefields of Italy, where he was left for dead with grievous wounds, before a dogged recovery enabled him to become a widely respected leader of the Senate and Republican nominee for both president and vice president.</p>
         <p>He died early Sunday morning in his sleep, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation said. He was 98 years old. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the flags at the U.S. Capitol to be flown at half-staff in remembrance of Mr. Dole.</p>
