    <h1>Drasi: Microsoft&#39;s open source data processing platform for event-driven systems</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Drasi is a data processing platform that simplifies detecting changes in data and taking immediate action. It is a comprehensive solution that provides built-in capabilities to track system logs and change feeds for specific events, evaluate them for relevance, and automatically initiate appropriate reactions. Visit our documentation site at <a href="https://drasi.io" rel="nofollow">https://drasi.io</a> for detailed information.</p>

<p dir="auto">Drasi provides real-time actionable insights without the overhead of traditional data processing methods. It tracks system changes and events without the need to copy data to a central data lake or repeatedly query data sources. Drasi uses queries to continuously evaluate incoming data changes. When the changes match the criteria and conditions specified in these queries the result sets of these queries are updated. These updates then trigger context-aware reactions defined tuned to your specific requirements.</p>
<p dir="auto">Drasi operates through three components:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Sources</strong> connect to data repositories within software systems to monitor logs and feeds to track changing data.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Queries</strong> interpret monitored changes by applying criteria and conditions to identify significant changes. In Drasi, these Continuous Queries are written using the Cypher Query Language.</li>
<li><strong>Reactions</strong> trigger meaningful responses based on updates to the result sets of the Continuous Queries.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Configuring a Source to monitor the order management system for changes in order statuses and a second Source to detect when a driver becomes available for a delivery run.</li>
<li>Creating a Continuous Query that combines data from both Sources to match orders ready for pickup with available drivers.</li>
<li>Defining a Reaction to send alerts to drivers, notifying them to proceed to the pickup area.
This streamlined setup ensures drivers are promptly informed, optimizing the delivery process through real-time data integration and automated responses.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Follow the <a href="https://drasi.io/getting-started/" rel="nofollow">Getting Started tutorial</a> and try out Drasi. The tutorial will lead you through:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Applying a Source representing the data source whose changes you want to observe.</li>
<li>Creating Continuous Queries to define the data to observe, conditions to assess changes, and the structure of the output.</li>
<li>Applying a Debug Reaction to view the output generated by one or more Continuous Queries.</li>
</ol>
