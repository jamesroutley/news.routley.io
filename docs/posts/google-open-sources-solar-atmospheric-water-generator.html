<p dir="auto">Summary:</p>
<p dir="auto">This is no longer an active project at X, so we are releasing our technical
documents to allow others to build on our progress to date. To do so, we have
made the following items public:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03900-w" rel="nofollow">Nature paper</a> with key
findings</li>
<li>Tools/code that enabled findings shared in the paper, and others in the AWH
community can use, including:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>“AWH-Geo” which can estimate the water output over time of any AWH
device. This can then be used to estimate the potential user base and
impact of an AWH device. On
<a href="https://github.com/AWH-GlobalPotential-X/AWH-Geo">GitHub</a></li>
<li>“JMP GeoProcessor” which uses geographic information systems (GIS) to
process the UNICEF/WHO data and join them to proper geographic boundaries.
In <a href="https://figshare.com/projects/AWH-GlobalPotential-X/96476" rel="nofollow">FigShare</a></li>
<li>Much of the data analysis code used to produce the figures &amp; charts in
the study. On <a href="https://github.com/AWH-GlobalPotential-X/AWH-Geo">GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two datasets on
<a href="https://figshare.com/projects/AWH-GlobalPotential-X/96476" rel="nofollow">FigShare</a></li>
<li>Hardware assembly documentation
<ul dir="auto">
<li>CAD files of our prototype device: These can be found in the folder
called “CAD_files”</li>
<li>“Assembly_documentation.pdf”, this document details our prototype
assembly process and learnings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/x-prod.appspot.com/files/H2E%20Patent%20Non-Assertion%20Pledge.pdf" rel="nofollow">Patent Non-Assertion Pledge </a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Data and geospatial tools around access to safe drinking water are provided
here to aid academic reproducibility and advancement in the context of the
Nature Paper “Global Potential of Harvesting Drinking Water from Air using
Solar Energy”. They should not be used for decision making without extensive
validation. This caveat applies even more strongly outside the field of
atmospheric water generation, where assumptions and approximations made may not
be suitable . Users are encouraged to use the official public sources
(primarily WHO/UNICEF JMP) from which they are derived.</p>
<p dir="auto">Data and results capture a snapshot at the time of research, and are compiled
at the time of publication (2021-10-27). They will not be updated, even as
underlying realities change.</p>
<p dir="auto">The prototype described here is a purely experimental device. While
substitutions and modifications are reasonably straightforward, water harvested
with this experimental device is not intended to be ingested. Among other design choices, adhesives were selected for experimental performance and would need to be substitued with ones meeting food grade standards.</p>
<p dir="auto">The views expressed in the paper and co-released documentation are the
author’s, and not necessarily the views of authors’ employers.</p>
