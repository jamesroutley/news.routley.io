    <h1>Electrolyser development: 200 times less iridium needed</h1>

                        <p>TNO has spent the last two years experimenting with the sALD technology. Researchers applied an ultrathin layer of iridium as a catalyst material on a porous transport layer of titanium, instead of on a membrane, as is presently customary. The functioning and stability of the new method has been proven after different lab tests. Little to no degradation occurred after initial stress testing. On top of this, the electrolyser’s membrane remains iridium-free, making it easier to recycle and reuse.</p>
                        <h2 id="h36bcac0a-7715-4fa6-3c05-ee10fcbb85df">Scaling up necessary</h2>
                        <p>Together with a group of leading industrial partners and within the <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/sustainable/sustainable-chemical-industry/voltachem-electrification-chemical/">Voltachem</a> program, TNO is working on moving this promising technology from the lab to practice. For this, the method needs to be scaled up to pilot scale to demonstrate its functioning under real-life conditions.</p>
                        <p>‘We’re not there yet’, warns van der Burg. ‘We’ve shown that the technology works in the lab, but we need to continue developing it to improve its lifespan, efficiency, and our capacity to produce it at scale. Previously, TNO and several other <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/newsroom/2020/11/european-rtos-accelerating-development/">European knowledge institutes</a>, already requested setting demands on the use of scarce materials when carrying out large pilot projects. It should be possible to apply the technology at a large scale in 2030. In this year the European target of installed electrolysis capacity is set at 40 GW, which is by than hopefully using much smaller amounts of scarce materials.’</p>
