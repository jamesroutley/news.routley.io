        <p><span>My personal consumption was a tiny fraction of my earnings, and <mark aria-details="investments-from-earnings" data-annotation-id="1">my consumption, donations, and investments combined were less than—and came from—earnings</mark>. Furthermore, FTX&#39;s sponsorships and company real estate were way less than its revenue, and way less than the amount it raised. Nonetheless, nearly all of my personal investments are going to customers. <mark aria-details="branding-marketing-spend" data-annotation-id="2">FTX, as a profitable private company, spent a small fraction of its revenue and the amount it had raised on branding and marketing;</mark> by contrast, Fanduels, Draft Kings, Coinbase, and Robinhood–all publicly listed, unprofitable companies–each spent far more than FTX did on marketing and branding. <mark aria-details="real-estate-coinbase" data-annotation-id="3">And the totality of the real estate purchases made by FTX–purchases made to entice a highly competitive workforce to move from the Bay Area and New York–represent roughly 10% of the amount Coinbase spends <i>every year</i> on its workforce..</mark></span></p>

          <p>This paragraph was added to the post sometime between 11:21pm January 15 and 1:53am January 16 (Pacific Time), three days after SBF originally published it.</p>
          <div id="investments-from-earnings" role="comment" data-annotation-id="1">
            <p>In an Antiguan court filing, SBF attests that he and Gary Wang borrowed $546 million from Alameda in order to buy shares in Robinhood.<sup><a href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> In a filing in the US bankruptcy case, SBF argues the shares belong to him, and that he should be allowed to dip into them to pay for his criminal defense.<sup><a href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup></p>
            <p>If SBF is not outright lying (and he almost certainly is), then he is engaging in some Olympic-level mental gymnastics along the lines of &#34;the investments of a shell company I created, for which I own 90% of the shares, and into whose assets I can dip to pay my own personal expenses, are not <i>technically</i> &#39;my investments&#39;&#34;.</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is an odd redirection. No one really cares about FTX&#39;s branding and marketing spend, they care about the fraud! &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism" target="_blank">But Coinbase spends a lot on marketing too!</a>&#34; isn&#39;t all that compelling of an argument unless Coinbase was <i>also</i> dipping into customer funds to do it.</p>
          <div id="real-estate-coinbase" role="comment" data-annotation-id="3">
            <p>FTX reportedly spent around $256 million on real estate in The Bahamas.<sup><a href="#footnote-31">31</a></sup> If SBF thought that&#39;s 10% of what Coinbase pays its employees, then he estimated Coinbase spends $2.56 billion on its employees per year.</p>
            <p>Except SBF did a tweet thread last summer about Coinbase&#39;s most recent (Q2 2022) earnings report, where he estimated Coinbase spends $4.4 billion annually on employees.<sup><a href="#footnote-32">32</a></sup> So is he saying that FTX actually spent $440 million on real estate? Or has he revised his Coinbase estimate (which was quite high—he was estimating an average of around $884,000 per year in compensation for all employees)? The other possibility is that he was saying Coinbase spends $2.56 billion a year <i>specifically</i> on real estate for employees, but that seems like an outlandish claim even by SBF&#39;s standards.</p>
            <p>Setting aside that the numbers don&#39;t add up, it&#39;s weird to try to justify spending by comparing your company&#39;s expenses on real estate for employees to <i>total</i> employee expenses for a company that also has 10 times as many employees (which was more like 17 times as many earlier this year, before Coinbase performed two rounds of layoffs).<sup><a href="#footnote-33">33</a></sup></p>
