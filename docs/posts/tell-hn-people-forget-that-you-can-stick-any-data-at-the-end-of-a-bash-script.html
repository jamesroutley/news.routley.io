    <h1>Tell HN: People forget that you can stick any data at the end of a bash script</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This is a neat trick I&#39;ve used to write self-extracting software or scripts that extract files from archives by just using</p><pre><code>    tail -c &lt;number of bytes for the binary&gt; $0
</code></pre><p>
All you have to do is make sure you append an explicit &#39;exit&#39; to the end of your program before your new &#39;data section&#39;, so that bash won&#39;t parse any of the &#39;data section&#39;.</p><p>One thing to bear in mind is that if you append binary data, it will be corrupted if you save it in most text editors so when I want to make changes I just delete all the binary and reappend it.</p></div></div></div>
