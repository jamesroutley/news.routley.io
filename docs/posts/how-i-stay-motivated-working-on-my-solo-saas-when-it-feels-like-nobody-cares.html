    <h1>How I Stay Motivated Working on My Solo SaaS (When It Feels Like Nobody Cares)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’ve been grinding on my solo project—a little app to help remote workers find coworking spots nearby—for months, and some days it feels like I’m yelling into the void. Nobody’s signing up, and I’m burned out. But I’ve figured out a few tricks to keep going:</p><p>Set Tiny Wins: I break it into micro-goals, like “fix that bug today” or “post on X once.” Hitting those feels good, even if the big picture’s slow.</p><p>Talk to People: I hop on X, ask random remote workers what they’d want in an app like mine. Even if they don’t sign up, the feedback keeps me pumped.</p><p>Track Progress, Not Just Users: I log every little improvement—code commits, design tweaks, whatever. Seeing a list of wins reminds me I’m moving forward, even if signups are slow.</p><p>Take Breaks: When I’m stuck, I step away—go for a walk, play a game. Coming back fresh helps me see the project differently.
It’s not glamorous, but it’s keeping me in the game. Last week, I got one signup after months, and it felt huge.</p><p>How do you stay motivated on your solo projects? Any tips to share?</p></div></div></div>
