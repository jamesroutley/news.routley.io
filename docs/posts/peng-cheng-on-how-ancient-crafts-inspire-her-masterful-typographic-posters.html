    <h1>Peng Cheng on how ancient crafts inspire her masterful typographic posters</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p data-block-key="6z7hj">The secret behind Peng Cheng’s masterful typographic posters is the way she balances a respect for tradition with ingenuity and imagination. She is fascinated by ancient crafts, citing the weaving and dyeing techniques of the Dong people in Guizhou, the Dongba script of the Naxi people in Yunnan, Chinese paper-cutting, shadow play and New Year paintings. At the heart of all her studies, though, is a fascination with Chinese characters, which she describes as “pictograms” – “a symbolic graphic summary of things in nature”. With the respect to the illustrative nature of the language, Cheng aims to exaggerate the innate storytelling power of Chinese characters through her work. “Simply changing how the patterns are combined and how the colours are matched together yields thousands of new possibilities,” she explains, “like when you are seeing through a kaleidoscope”.</p><p data-block-key="1pehn">Unsurprisingly, Cheng’s skill for boldly updating traditional typography has garnered her a roster of major clients such as Apple, Coca-Cola China, UPS and Adobe. Alongside this commercial work, Cheng nestles away on personal projects, increasingly honing her storytelling skills and trying out different aesthetic combinations. For her <i>Year of the Tiger</i> poster series, she looked to the depiction of tigers in Chinese embroidery, bronze sculptures and New Year paintings. In these myriad interpretations, the tiger fascinates Cheng not least because of its powerful symbolic value in Chinese culture, but also for the way in which the patterns on the tiger’s body are derived from the natural world, like clouds rocks and flowers – “the beautiful phenomena in nature are represented with simple and symmetrical patterns.” Her own artistic vision of the character design is inspired by the cloth tiger – “an indispensable toy in Chinese people’s childhood”. Cheng notes how this ubiquitous little figurine generally looks the same wherever it&#39;s sold throughout China. So for her posters, she attempted to transform it into a “concept”, giving room for more “vitality and creativity” in its interpretation. “I hope it would be like a Lego tiger that can be randomly combined to keep the &#39;old&#39; image while adding a little bit of freshness.”</p></div></div></div></div></div>
