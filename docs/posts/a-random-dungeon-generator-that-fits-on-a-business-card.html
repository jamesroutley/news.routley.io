    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><time datetime="2024-02-17">February 17th, 2024</time> • ~300 words • 1 minute read</p></header><p>I remember my <a href="https://george.mand.is/2023/10/obligatory-blog-refresh-post-a-twist-and-a-tiny-homage/">colorful, recently departed uncle</a> starting a conversation like this:</p><p>&#34;I recently read something about... doorways. Like when you walk through them, it does something to your brain. Something when you enter a new room... Hm. I don&#39;t remember.&#34;</p><p>He proceeded to take a sip of his homemade hooch and we carried on making memories at that family reunion, as we did for so many good years.</p><p>This was many years ago, and that anecdote always stuck in my brain. It piqued my curiousity, but I suppose never enough to warrant a cursory Googling (or ChatGPT-ing, as the turning tides may bring us) and so it bounced around in my head like a pebble in a shoe.</p><p>But just the other day, I noticed a link to a Wikipedia article in the <a href="https://hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker News Newsletter</a> that just said &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doorway_effect">doorway effect</a>.&#34;</p><p>The gist of the thing is that human beings have a tendency to forget recent things when passing the boundaries, real or imagined. We&#39;re episodic, context-oriented creatures it seems.</p><p>Makes me think about the ways we use stories to communicate almost everything. The boundaries serve almost like chapter markers, and it&#39;s interesting to think that the trade-off for the context-switch that allows us to organize these memories in the first place is something almost like flushing the &#34;cache&#34; we&#39;d accrued in the previous chapter.</p><p>Anyway, recognizing that my uncle kind of &#34;forgot&#34; what it was all about as he tried to explain many years later feels like a tiny gift. A funny joke that took tears to play out and landed at just the right time to produce a sweet memory of someone who is now gone.</p></section></article></div></div>
