All the WebGPU examples we provide are <em>Mach core apps</em>: they rely on Mach for window creation, user input, and setting up the WebGPU API - nothing else. Using <em>Mach core</em>, you write your own engine!</p><p>Why use this over, say, GLFW and WebGPU on your own? The benefit is that this will work on Desktop, WebAssembly (soon), Mobile (future), and consoles (long term.) You can write Mach core apps in Zig, or other languages via <code>libmach</code> (more on this later.) Think of Mach core as <em>a competitor to SDL/GLFW.</em></p><p>In the future we’ll offer <em>Mach engine</em> apps, where you buy into our ECS, Unity/Unreal-like editor, and other composable building-blocks that make up the engine at your choosing.

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our thought process was simply to follow any established patterns, learn what didn’t work about it by writing examples, and then revisiting the API later. Even six months ago, though, we knew there were issues with this approach.</p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> In WebGPU, <code>Descriptor</code> data structures are often passed to methods: these fairly large data structures contain a wide range of options and graphics pipeline state to use, and often involve passing a list of WebGPU objects as a field - or nested field - as part of the Descriptor data structure. Because our <code>Texture</code> involves keeping a <code>ptr</code> (the interface implementation) and a <code>vtable</code> pointer (our implementation methods) it meant that a <code>gpu.Texture</code> was two pointers, while a C <code>WGPUTexture</code> was a single pointer - breaking ABI compatibility.</p><p>This meant that our <code>Texture</code> could not simply be passed to a C API expecting a <code>WGPUTexture</code>: instead, we needed to pass our <code>.ptr</code> field only. This had viral effects, though: every <code>Descriptor</code> struct which embedded a <code>Texture</code> needed to be copied/rewritten to convert our two-pointer <code>Texture</code> to a single-pointer <code>WGPUTexture</code>. Worse yet, some descriptors hold <em>dynamic arrays</em> of such objects, requiring us to <em>copy an array to a temporary (and worst-case, heap-allocated), buffer</em> just in order to call the actual WebGPU C API.</p><p>Needless to say, this was a cancer we felt we absolutely had to get rid of in the rewrite.</p><h3 id="comptime-interfaces">Comptime interfaces</h3><p>While we want to get rid of runtime interfaces, maintain C ABI compatability, and be zero-overhead-we’d still like to be able to intercept WebGPU API calls if desired, so that we can provide superior debugging facilities in the future.</p><p>Zig’s <code>std.mem.Allocator</code> being a <em>runtime interface</em> makes sense because they have different use cases, no existing ABI to remain compatible with, and importantly there are cases where you would want to have <strong>multiple allocator implementations</strong> in the same program for different purposes.</p><p>With WebGPU, we have different constraints: it’s very unlikely to want multiple WebGPU implementations per program. We do need to maintain ABI compatibility. So to address this, we introduce a <em>comptime interface</em>.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/184733061-92f1165d-8d20-4c97-8852-34b1abf5b655.png"/></p><p>Let’s look at the <code>Texture.destroy</code> method from earlier:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>inline</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>destroy</span><span>(</span><span>tex</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Texture</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>tex</span><span>.</span><span>vtable</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>(</span><span>tex</span><span>.</span><span>ptr</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this would’ve called the <em>tex.vtable pointer</em>, and passed the <code>tex.ptr</code> interface implementation pointer to it. It’s a classical runtime interface implementation. The key point here is that the data type can remain the same, while the <em>implementation pointer</em> could be replaced at runtime with a different one. On the other side of this invocation, <code>tex.vtable.destroy</code> would look like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>destroy</span><span>(</span><span>ptr</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>anyopaque</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>wgpuTextureDestroy</span><span>(</span><span>@ptrCast</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>WGPUTexture</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>ptr</span><span>));</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now let’s look at how the <em>comptime interface</em> approach differs:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Texture</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>opaque</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>inline</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>destroy</span><span>(</span><span>texture</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>Texture</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>Impl</span><span>.</span><span>textureDestroy</span><span>(</span><span>texture</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Firstly, we see that <code>*gpu.Texture</code> is merely an opaque pointer (a C <code>void*</code> if you like), just the same as before. Unlike before, however, there is no vtable pointer: there is only one pointer, it’s passed directly to the implementor via <code>Impl.textureDestroy</code> - and the implementation <em>cannot be changed at runtime</em>.</p><p>This solves the issue of ABI compatibility (we have only one pointer now), but we still need to let the user of the library - say from their <code>main.zig</code> file - decide which <code>Impl</code>ementation of the interface to use.</p><p>Traditionally, one might use generics for this (passing an <code>Impl</code> type parameter to each method for example), but we’d rather not pass that around everywhere: after all, we know it will be decided by one user of the API for the entire program, and requiring a type parameter here would have viral effects to every user of the WebGPU API (every API they expose would need that same type parameter.)</p><p>Luckily, in Zig there is a trick: from within our WebGPU API we can import the root file of the program (e.g. <code>main.zig</code>). Zig allows this since it lazily evaluates code, so there’s no dependency loop here. So in our <code>mach/gpu</code> package, we can define:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Impl</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>blk</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>};</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This effectively looks in the user’s <code>main.zig</code> (“root”) file for a declaration like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>GPUInterface</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpu</span><span>.</span><span>dawn</span><span>.</span><span>Interface</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Once resolved, our <code>Impl</code> constant is known statically at compile time to be an exact interface implementation of the <code>gpu.Interface</code>: <code>gpu.dawn.Interface</code> in this case, which is just a struct type with functions in it calling the Dawn C API:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Interface</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>// ...
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>The trick here to ensuring that a type actually satisfies the <code>gpu.Interface</code> is that you write a type validator function, which checks if the struct passes to it has the desired methods with matching function signatures:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>/// Verifies that a gpu.Interface implementation exposes the expected function declarations.

</span><span></span><span>};</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Best of all, since the interface implementation is completely static and known at comptime, we can enforce every method invocation is <code>inline</code> and we’re not adding any overhead.</p><h3 id="libmach-and-gpuexport">libmach and gpu.Export</h3><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/184734447-b3df59dc-9b8c-453f-9f8e-2c01eb45e086.png"/></p><p>One recent development is <code>libmach</code>, which will provide at least a C ABI for the creation of <em>Mach core</em> applications from other languages (think a bit like SDL, but for WebGPU and it works on Desktop, Mobile, WebAssembly &amp; more in the future.)</p><p>One thing we’d like to retain, though, is the ability to have such applications get the same nice WebGPU debugging experience in the future, while still using that language’s existing WebGPU bindings. This means instead of calling Dawn’s <code>wgpuTextureDestroy</code> for example, we’d need to call <code>libmach</code>’s <code>wgpuTextureDestroy</code>.</p><p>This is where <code>gpu.Export</code> comes in: it merely takes a <code>gpu.Interface</code> struct with all of the Zig functions that implement the WebGPU API, and exports the WebGPU C ABI for them:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>/// Exports C ABI function declarations for the given gpu.Interface implementation.

</span></code></pre></div><p>From this, you might notice something important: We’ve maintained 100% C ABI compatability in the new <code>mach/gpu</code> rewrite. Every data structure is ABI compatible with Dawn’s <code>webgpu.h</code> header.</p><h3 id="zig-flag-sets">Zig flag sets</h3><p>One nice property of Zig is it’s <code>packed struct</code>s. For example, in C there is a <code>WGPUColorWriteMaskFlags</code> type which is a <code>uint32_t</code> where the first four bits represent a color write mask for red, green, blue, and alpha respectively. The remaining 28 bits are unused at present.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/184735519-cc78d19d-73e8-4914-8f3d-fc3a15d00bb7.png"/></p><p>Interacting with <code>WGPUColorWriteMaskFlags</code> in C can be a bit cumbersome: you need to make sure you remember the right bit masking operations to set bits, check if they are set, and so on.</p><p>In Zig, we have <code>packed struct</code> in which <code>bool</code> is just one bit - and we have integers of any bit width we desire. We can use this to compose a 32-bit data structure compatible with the C ABI variant, but using nice bools to represent those first four bits:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>ColorWriteMaskFlags</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>packed</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

For example, let’s look at a descriptor struct used as the parameters to create a shader module from its text source code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>WGPUShaderModuleDescriptor</span> <span>{</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>That’s pretty nasty! Also take note of how <code>nextInChain</code> needs to be <em>cast to</em> the <code>WGPUChainedStruct</code> pointer type, only the <code>sType</code> field identifies it (the C type system can’t.)</p><p>More importantly: because <code>nextInChain</code> is an opaque type, you can’t really know what type of pointer is legal at all to give to the API in a <code>nextInChain</code> field. Oof!</p><p>Needless to say, we didn’t want to adopt this lack of type safety (and lack of documentation), so we worked with the Dawn developers at Google <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/dawn/issues/detail?id=1486&amp;q=reporter%3Ame&amp;can=1">to add documentation about what structs are legal where</a>, and then in Zig we used this information to replace <code>next_in_chain</code> fields with a union of pointers so it’s type safe (for all known structs) and self-documenting. Our example from before becomes just:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>const</span><span> </span><span>shader_module_descriptor</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpu</span><span>.</span><span>ShaderModule</span><span>.</span><span>Descriptor</span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>};</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>It may not seem much more readable, but all of the type system info is there to protect you and that’s what counts. Of course, we also added a helper to create WGSL shader modules so this ends up being truly clean:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="zig"><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>createShaderModuleWGSL</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;my shader module&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>my_shader_source_code_text</span><span>);</span><span>
