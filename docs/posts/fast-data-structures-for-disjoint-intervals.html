    <h1>Ask HN: Fast data structures for disjoint intervals?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the years I&#39;ve worked on a few applications that needed to model time intervals that are disjoint. For example, there&#39;s some kind of equipment available and time slots are booked out. For a data structure to represent this, you generally need to be able to insert, remove, and perform range queries (i.e., looking for the next availability).</p><p>In the past I&#39;ve represented these with some kind of ordered map or tree. In Rust this might look something like `BTreeMap&lt;u32, 32&gt;` with start being the key and the end being the value. This works really well in practice, but it&#39;s not as fast I&#39;d like for some real-time applications for really read-heavy range queries with thousands of intervals.</p><p>A lot of the specialized interval libraries I&#39;ve found don&#39;t seem to perform better than a plain ordered map like I mentioned (many use an ordered map internally anyway). Many of these also weren&#39;t designed with cache-efficiency or SIMD in mind and spend a lot of time on tree (pointer) traversal.</p><p>I spent some time prototyping with some other data structures that might fit (adaptive radix trees to take advantage of the small integer key, dense bitsets for small ranges, applying a spatial index in 1-dimension, fixed grid hierarchies) but haven&#39;t been able to find anything much faster than an ordered map.</p><p>I was wondering if anyone has come across any interesting data structures that handle this well. Approaches that use a combination of multiple data structures to accelerate reads at the cost of slightly slower inserts/removals could be interesting.</p></div></div></div>
