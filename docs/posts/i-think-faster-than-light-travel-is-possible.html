If you&#39;ve been following my channel for a really long time, you might remember that some years ago I made a video about whether faster-than-light travel is possible. I was trying to explain why the arguments saying it&#39;s impossible are inconclusive and we shouldn&#39;t throw out the possibility too quickly, but I&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t make my case very well. This video is a second attempt. Hopefully this time it&#39;ll come across more clearly!
