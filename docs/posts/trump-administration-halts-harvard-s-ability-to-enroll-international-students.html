The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p><p>The latest move intensifies the administration’s attempt to upend the culture of higher education by directly subverting the ability of one of the nation’s premier universities to attract the best and brightest students from all over the world. That capability, across all of academia, has long been one of the greatest sources of academic, economic and scientific strength in America.</p><p>It is also likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, according to another person familiar with the school’s thinking who insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html" title="">university sued the Trump administration</a> last month over the government’s attempt to impose changes to its curriculum, admissions policies and hiring practices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>“I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,” according to a letter to the university by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security said the action applied to current and future students.</p><p>“Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status,” the department said in a news release on Thursday after Ms. Noem posted the administration’s letter on social media.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>A spokesman for Harvard called the administration’s action “unlawful.”</p><p>“We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard’s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university — and this nation — immeasurably,” said Jason Newton, the university’s director of media relations. “We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community. This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission.”</p><p>The federal student visa program is overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of Ms. Noem’s department. The agency is responsible for vetting international students in the program — and certifying schools, including universities, community colleges or high schools that participate.</p><p>Federal regulations stipulate how and why a school’s certification can be revoked, such as the failure to comply with reporting requirements, which Ms. Noem’s letter specifically mentioned.</p><p>But Harvard has maintained that Ms. Noem’s original request exceeded the reporting requirements that federal statutes require.</p><p>“This is unprecedented,” said Andrea Flores, a former D.H.S official under President Obama and now the vice president of immigration policy <a href="http://fwd.us" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FWD.us</a>, an immigration advocacy group. “D.H.S. has never tried to reshape the student body of a university by revoking access to its vetting systems, and it is unique to target one institution over hundreds that it certifies every year.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>Leo Gerden, a senior at Harvard from Stockholm who has been a staunch advocate on campus for international students, said he was devastated by the news.</p><p>“Without its international students and without its ability to bring in the best people from around the world, Harvard is not going to be Harvard anymore,” said Mr. Gerden, who graduates next week.</p><p>“The Trump administration is using us as poker chips right now,” he added. “It is extremely dangerous.”</p><p>Harvard has been praised for fighting back against President Trump and his administration, and legal experts have said the school has a strong case to get back the federal funding for its research that the administration stripped from the school.</p><p>But the administration’s move is the latest example of why senior Harvard officials have been privately concerned that they are in the midst of an untenable crisis as the administration continues to target the school with onerous investigations and extensive funding cuts.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>Even if the Trump administration is forced to return research funding to Harvard, the university is contending with additional government-imposed burdens, like a recently opened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/politics/harvard-justice-dept-investigation.html" title="">investigation by the Justice Department</a> into the school’s admission policies that includes a cumbersome records request.</p><p>The decision from Ms. Noem on Thursday stemmed from a separate investigation her agency opened on April 16. In a letter to the school, she demanded a trove of information on student visa holders, saying that the college had “created a hostile learning environment for Jewish students.”</p><p>Her request included eight criteria, including the coursework for every international student and information on any student visa holder who had been involved in illegal activity.</p><p>News of the investigation unnerved many students and alumni, and raised concerns among the university’s lawyers that the administration’s request went beyond data that the school was legally allowed to share, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Harvard relayed those concerns to the administration on April 30. On the same day, the university’s executive vice president, Meredith Weenick, issued <a href="https://evp.harvard.edu/update-international-students" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a public letter</a> that vowed the school would provide the administration only with information “required by law” and urged students to “stay as focused as possible on your academic pursuits.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>The administration responded the following week, notifying Harvard that the school’s response did not satisfy Ms. Noem’s request, the people said. In the same message, the administration appeared to narrow its request by asking for information on international students who met any one of four criteria.</p><p>Last week, Harvard told the administration that only a few students met those qualifications and asked the government for additional clarification on one of the requests.</p><p>Then, on Thursday, Ms. Noem disqualified Harvard from the student visa program, explaining that her decision was because of the university’s “failure to comply with simple reporting requirements.”</p><p>She then expanded the list of criteria for student records to six, and gave Harvard 72 hours to comply.</p><p>Miles J.
