The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p><p>The latest move is likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, according to another person familiar with the school’s thinking who insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html" title="">university sued the administration</a> last month over the government’s attempt to impose changes to its curriculum, admissions policies and hiring practices.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>“I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,” according to a letter sent to the university by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>About 6,800 international students attended Harvard this year, or roughly 27 percent of the student body, <a href="https://oneworld.worldwide.harvard.edu/international-students-at-harvard/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to university enrollment data</a>. That was up from 19.7 percent in 2010.</p><p>The move is likely to have a significant effect on the university’s bottom line. Tuition at Harvard is $59,320 for the school year that begins later this year, and costs can rise to nearly $87,000 when room and board are included. International students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/us/losing-international-students-could-devastate-many-colleges.html" title="">tend to pay larger shares of education costs</a> compared with other students.</p><p>A spokesman for Harvard called the administration’s action “unlawful.”</p><p>“We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard’s ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university — and this nation — immeasurably,” said Jason Newton, the university’s director of media relations. “We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community. This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission.”</p><p>Ms. Noem posted the administration’s letter on social media later on Thursday.</p><p>In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security sent a stark message to Harvard’s international students: “This means Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>Leo Gerden, a senior at Harvard from Stockholm who has been a staunch advocate on campus for international students, said he was devastated by the news.</p><p>“Without its international students and without its ability to bring in the best people from around the world, Harvard is not going to be Harvard anymore,” said Mr. Gerden, who graduates next week.</p><p>“The Trump administration is using us as poker chips right now,” he added. “It is extremely dangerous.”</p><p>Miles J.
