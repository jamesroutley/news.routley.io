    <h1>Mechanical Turk is twenty years old today. What did you create with it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>MTurk was built by two two-pizza teams at AWS over the course of a year and launched on Nov 2, 2005. It took a few days for people to find it and catch on, but then things got busy.</p><p>At the time, AWS was about 100 people (when you were on call, you were on call for <i>all</i> of AWS), Amazon had just hit 10,000, S3 was still in private beta, and EC2 was a whitepaper.</p><p>What did you create with MTurk and the incredibly patient hard-working workforce behind it?</p></div></div></div>
