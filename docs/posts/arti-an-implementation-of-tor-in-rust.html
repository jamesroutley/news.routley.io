    <h1>Arti – An implementation of Tor, in Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arti is our ongoing project to create a working embeddable Tor client in Rust. It’s nowhere near ready to replace the main Tor implementation in C, but we believe that it’s the future.</p>
<p>Today, we&#39;ve reached our 0.1.0 milestone: this means that we now
consider Arti&#39;s high-level APIs to be &#34;mostly stable&#34;, and ready for
experimental embedding in other projects.  (We don&#39;t promise no API
breakage, but we don&#39;t break our high-level APIs without a good
reason.)  The 1.0.0 milestone, scheduled for September, will represent
an even stronger API commitment.</p>

<p>From a developer&#39;s point of view the primary new features are our <a href="https://docs.rs/arti-client/0.1.0/arti_client/struct.TorClientBuilder.html">builder API</a> for
constructing <code>TorClient</code> instances, and the ability to create
<a href="https://docs.rs/arti-client/0.1.0/arti_client/#creating-a-client-and-connecting-later">unbootstrapped</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/arti-client/0.1.0/arti_client/#creating-a-client-and-connecting-later">bootstrap-on-demand</a> <code>TorClient</code> instances.  These
features make it easier to create a &#34;lazy&#34; TorClient that bootstraps
itself in the background the first time it&#39;s used: we&#39;ve provided some
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/crates/arti-client/examples/lazy-init.rs">example code</a> to show you how.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also replaced our top-level <a href="https://docs.rs/arti-client/0.1.0/arti_client/struct.Error.html"><code>Error</code> API</a>.  Previously, it exposed
a huge mass of APIs from lower-level crates, and encouraged dependencies
on unstable lower-level error types.  Now the error details are hidden,
and there is instead an explicitly supported <a href="https://docs.rs/arti-client/0.1.0/arti_client/enum.ErrorKind.html"><code>ErrorKind</code></a> type that
programs can use to see what type of error occurred.  (You can still
access the low-level information by enabling an optional trait, if you
really want to.)</p>
<p>There are also a <strong>bunch</strong> of smaller features, bugfixes, and
infrastructure improvements; see the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for a more complete
list.</p>

<p>Between now and our 1.0.0 milestone in September, we&#39;re aiming to make
Arti a production-quality Tor client for direct internet access.  (Onion
services aren&#39;t funded yet, but we hope to change that soon.)</p>
<p>To do so, we need to bring Arti up to par with the C tor implementation
in terms of its <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/88">network performance</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/87">CPU usage</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/329">resiliency</a>, and
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/331">security features</a>.  You can follow our progress on our <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues?scope=all&amp;state=opened&amp;milestone_title=Arti%201.0.0%3A%20Ready%20for%20production%20use">1.0.0
milestone</a>.</p>
<p>We still plan to continue regular releases between now and then.</p>

<p>We rely on users and volunteers to find problems in our software and
suggest directions for its improvement.  Although Arti isn&#39;t yet ready
for production use, you can test it as a SOCKS proxy (if you&#39;re willing
to compile from source) and as an embeddable library (if you don&#39;t mind
a little API instability).</p>
<p>Assuming you&#39;ve installed Arti (with <code>cargo install arti</code>, or directly
from a cloned repository), you can use it to start a simple SOCKS proxy
for making connections via Tor with:</p>
<pre><code>$ arti proxy -p 9150
</code></pre>
<p>and use it more or less as you would use the C Tor implementation!</p>
<p>(It doesn&#39;t support onion services yet.  If compilation doesn&#39;t work, make sure you have development files for libsqlite installed on your platform.)</p>
<p>If you want to build a program with Arti, you probably want to start with the <a href="https://docs.rs/arti-client/latest/arti_client/index.html"><code>arti-client</code></a> crate.  Be sure to check out the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/tree/main/crates/arti-client/examples">examples</a> too.</p>
<p>For more information, check out the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/README.md">README</a> file. (For now, it assumes that you&#39;re comfortable building Rust programs from the command line).  Our <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a> file has more information on installing development tools, and on using Arti inside of Tor Browser. (If you want to try that, please be aware that Arti doesn&#39;t support onion services yet.)</p>
<p>When you find bugs, please report them <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/">on our bugtracker</a>.  You can <a href="https://gitlab.onionize.space/">request an account</a> or <a href="https://anonticket.onionize.space/">report a bug anonymously</a>.</p>
<p>And if this documentation doesn&#39;t make sense, please ask questions! The questions you ask today might help improve the documentation tomorrow.</p>

<p>Our priority for the coming months is to make Arti a production-quality Tor client, for the purposes of direct connections to the internet.  (Onion services will come later.)  We know some of the steps we&#39;ll need to take to get there, but not all of them: we need to know what&#39;s missing <em>for your use-cases</em>.</p>
<p>Whether you&#39;re a user or a developer, please give Arti a try, and let us know what you think.  The sooner we learn what you need, the better our chances of getting it into an early milestone.</p>

Pointard, and Yuan Lyu!</p>
