                 <div>“Around the world, Apple Watch has had an immeasurable positive impact on people by helping them stay healthy, active, safe, and connected to the things that matter to them — and it’s helped save countless lives along the way,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Series 10 builds on a decade of breakthrough innovations to offer the most advanced version yet, with even more intelligence, our biggest wearable display, and a design that’s slimmer and sleeker than ever.”

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Watch Series 10 is nearly 10 percent thinner than Apple Watch Series 7, Series 8, and Series 9, while offering all the advanced capabilities users love, adding new features, and maintaining all-day 18-hour battery life. An innovative metal back integrates the antenna into the housing of the device itself, combining the two layers into one. The back is perfectly matched in material, finish, and color to the rest of the case, making it appear like the device is made from a single piece of metal.

The case also features more rounded corners and a wider aspect ratio, which contribute to a much larger display while only slightly growing the case to new 42mm and 46mm sizes.

This improves readability and usability: In apps like Messages, Mail, or News, users can see an additional line of text or increase the font size without sacrificing content. The larger display also makes it easier to type a message, pause a workout, or enter a passcode.

Building on the intelligent health features already available to track key overnight metrics such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature, Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea.<sup>1</sup>

                 <div>Sleep apnea is a potentially serious condition where breathing stops repeatedly during sleep. <span>The condition, which is estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, goes undiagnosed in most cases. If left untreated, sleep apnea can have important consequences on health, including an increased risk of hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiac issues.</span>

                 <div>To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some of these disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep and, when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated, and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.

                 <div>The new sleep apnea algorithm analyzes breathing disturbance data, so Apple Watch can notify a user if the data indicates consistent signs of sleep apnea. The notification will include the time period when potential sleep apnea occurred and educational materials on the importance of seeking treatment, along with a PDF providing three months of breathing disturbance data, notification details, and additional information to reference during a conversation with a healthcare provider.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning and an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. The feature was then validated in a clinical study — unprecedented in size for sleep apnea technology. In the clinical validation study, every participant identified by the algorithm had at least mild sleep apnea. The feature is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon. Sleep apnea notifications will be available in more than 150 countries and regions this month, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.

Water temperature is also displayed in workout metrics during Pool Swim and Open Water Swim workouts.

                 <div>Audio can now be played back through the built-in speaker on Apple Watch Series 10. Just like with phone calls, users can listen to audio from a range of apps — including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books, and third-party apps — right from their Apple Watch.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Watch Series 10 also uses a new voice isolation neural network running on the 4-core Neural Engine to suppress background noise during phone or FaceTime audio calls, so a user’s voice sounds crisp and clear on the other end of the line — even in noisy environments like a crowded restaurant, a city street, or a windy day outside.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>For the first time, Apple Watch is available in a polished aluminum finish, jet black, with a distinctively glossy, reflective shine. To achieve this, the aluminum case is polished using nano-particles and then undergoes a 30-step anodization process. Apple Watch Series 10 also comes in an updated rose gold aluminum, along with the popular brushed silver aluminum.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Additionally, Apple Watch Series 10 is available in an aerospace-grade polished titanium that replaces the stainless steel of previous generations. The new grade 5 titanium cases offer a spectacularly reflective, jewelry-like finish, while being almost 20 percent lighter than Apple Watch Series 9 in stainless steel. The titanium cases come in three stunning colors: natural, gold, and slate.

                 <div>Last year, Apple Watch became Apple’s first carbon neutral product by dramatically reducing carbon emissions across the three biggest sources — materials, electricity, and transportation — and using high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects to offset the small amount of emissions remaining. With the introduction of Apple Watch Series 10, made with 100 percent recycled aluminum or 95 percent recycled titanium in the case, customers now can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch in any material. This is an important step toward Apple 2030, Apple’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by 2030.
