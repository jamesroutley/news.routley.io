    <h1>The Real GenAI Issue</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">Last week I published a
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/01/First-AI-Code">featherweight narrative</a> about applying GenAI in a real-world context, to
    a tiny programming problem.  Now I’m regretting that piece because I totally ignored the two central issues with
    AI: What it’s meant to do, and how much it really costs.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>What genAI is for</span> · 
The most important fact about genAI in the real world is that there’ve been literally
    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-nvidia-played-a-central-role-in-the-306-billion-ai-startup-boom-195741749.html?guccounter=1">hundreds
    of billions</a> of dollars invested in it; that link is just startups, and ignores a comparable torrent of cash pouring out of Big
    Tech.</p>

<p>The business leaders pumping all this money of course don’t understand the technology. They’re doing this for exactly one
    reason: They think they can discard armies of employees and replace them with LLM services, at the cost of
    shipping shittier products.  Do you think your management would spend that kind of money to help you with a quicker first draft or
    a summarized inbox?</p>

<p>Adobe said the quiet part out loud:
    <a href="https://petapixel.com/2024/05/03/adobe-throws-photographers-under-the-bus-again-skip-the-photoshoot/">Skip the
    Photoshoot</a>. </p>

<p>At this point someone will point out that previous technology waves have generated as much employment as they’ve eliminated.
    Maybe so, but that’s not what business leaders think they’re buying. They think they’re buying smaller payrolls.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m overly sensitive, but thinking about these truths leads to a mental stench that makes me want to stay away from
    it.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>How much does genAI cost?</span> · 
Well, I already mentioned all those hundreds of billions. But that’s pocket change. The investment community in general and
    Venture Capital in particular will whine and moan, but the people who are losing the money are people who can afford to.</p>

<p>The first real cost is hypothetical: What if those business leaders are correct and they can gleefully dispose of millions of
    employees? If you think we’re already suffering from egregious levels of inequality, what happens when a big chunk of the
    middle class suddenly becomes professionally superfluous?  I’m no economist so I’ll stop there, but you don’t have to be a
    rocket scientist to predict severe economic pain.</p>

<p>Then there’s the other thing that nobody talks about, the massive greenhouse-gas load that all those data centers are going
    to be pumping out. This at a time when we we blow past one atmospheric-carbon metric after another and David Suzuki says
    <a href="https://www.ipolitics.ca/2025/07/02/its-too-late-david-suzuki-says-the-fight-against-climate-change-is-lost/">the
    fight against climate change is lost</a>, that we need to hunker down and work on survival at the local level.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>The real problem</span> · 
It’s the people who are pushing it.  Their business goals are quite likely, as a side-effect, to make
    the world a worse place, and they don’t give a fuck.  Their technology will inevitably worsen the onrushing climate catastrophe,
    and they don’t give a fuck.</p>

<p>It’s probably not as simple as “They’re just shitty people”<span> —</span> it’s not exactly easy to escape the
    exigencies of modern capitalism. But they are people who are doing shitty things.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>Is genAI useful?</span> · 
Sorry, I’m having trouble even thinking about that now.</p>
