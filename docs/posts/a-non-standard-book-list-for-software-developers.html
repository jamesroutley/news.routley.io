<h2 id="org58115c7">Summary</h2>
<p>
<b>[March, 2022]</b> I view the field of software development as a big logical system
with highly interconnected and complex parts. Understanding such a big systems
naturally requires having an excellent grasp on the tools used to build
them. And the most fundamental one is logic itself. What follows from what, what
are the starting-points or the elementary parts, what are the ways of composing
these into more complex ones, ways to spot complete non-sense in the system and
how to decompose the complex parts back to more fundamental ones to check their
consistency and truth. The following book list contain titles that are all
playing fields for one to start experimenting with such systems and gain the
required confidence that one can master them.

<h2 id="org9cbf93a">Euclid&#39;s Elements</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
Inasmuch as many things, while appearing to rest on truth and to follow from
scientific principles, really tend to lead one astray from the principles and
deceive the more superficial minds, he (Euclid) has handed down methods for the
discriminative understanding of these things as well, by the use of which
methods we shall be able to give beginners in this study practice in the
discovery of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paralogism#Noun">paralogisms</a> and to avoid being misled.
</p>

<p>
— Proclus (412-485 AD) - A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid&#39;s Elements
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Looking back at the 15 years that have passed since I&#39;ve first read this opus, I
can honestly say it has had the most lasting impact on the way I approach big
systems, be it mathematics, software and even politics. If I pay close attention
to the discussions taking place around me, and observe the thought patterns of
the speakers, I can tell which of them definitely haven&#39;t read or paid attention
to Euclid. Their logic is usually all over the place. They draw true conclusions
from one set of assumptions but false ones from a set of similar ones, or there
are no clear assumptions to start with and the logical conclusions are based on
gut feeling. The Elements fixes that.
</p>

<p>
A book about Geometry, on the surface, but a book about logic through and
through. Aristotle applied this kind of logic to understand Politics, for
example, and countless other disciplines have paid homage over the centuries to
it by devising logical systems inspired by it in the search of God, the ultimate
ethics and philosophy systems. In short, it is one of the Western Philosophy&#39;s
pillars that has shaped our thought even though we&#39;re not aware of it and most
of the time we only have bits and pieces at our disposal. This is the best place
to start and gather all the pieces in one place and devour it whole.
</p>

<p>
Reading Euclid, additionally, has put me into a certain mindset, a mindset of
always going back to first principles or even more importantly, realizing that
there really are first principles from which everything is built and the
confidence that I can find them with the right tools and enough time. Once I got
into this mindset, I began questioning and exploring everything, not only
doubting, but analyzing, going back, applying the learned tools of logic to
reach explanations and a deeper understanding.

<blockquote>
<p>
Since the foundations of analysis provided the arena in which modern modes of
mathematical thinking developed, calculus ought to be the place in which to
expect, rather than avoid, the strengthening of insight with logic.
</p>

<p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I remember the high-school years and the calculus classes quite vague but
reading through this Calculus book much later in life, accompanied by <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/">Herbert&#39;s
Gross</a> excellent Calculus video lectures from the &#39;70s, has left me with a long
lasting feeling that &#34;yes, those were the days!&#34;. Another book about
strengthening your thinking and not necessarily your calculus knowledge. Even if
your interest lies into that field or not, similarly to geometry, the most
important thing to learn is the method. That is, to develop a method for
thinking, based on demonstration following a fixed and known set of
starting-points or axioms, and to start learning how to guide one&#39;s thoughts so
as not to fall badly in side road ditches and start to believe in fairy
tales. Or, going the other way around it, having a system, a theorem or any kind
of fact already before one&#39;s eyes, to be able to deconstruct it into its
constituent parts using the tools of logic. And if you can&#39;t, then maybe that
&#34;theorem&#34; is really someone trying to deceive you.
</p>

<p>
A big advantage to these systems is that they are completely understood and open
so it&#39;s ripe soil for training sessions at your leisure. You do not get into the
boxing ring on match day completely unprepared and hope to train your jabs and
uppercuts. If you haven&#39;t trained them before with a boxing bag or a partner day
and night you surely won&#39;t get a chance to practice them with an adversary bent
on knocking you out. This applies to any other sports and to the practice of
software development as well. You have to be trained when you have clients,
bosses, deadlines, crashed software and high expectations. Hopefully, when that
time comes you can with a calm inner voice say to yourself, yes, I know how to
approach this situation, I&#39;ve learned and practiced the tools in my free time. I
don&#39;t need pretty pictures that half-explain the system to me but leaves me
unsure of how or why I do what I do.

<blockquote>
<p>
Ironically, few operating system textbooks or courses explain underlying
patterns and principles that form the basis for operating system construction.
Students form the impression that an operating system is a black box, and
textbooks reinforce the misimpression by explaining operating system features
and focusing on how to use operating system facilities. More important, because
they only learn how an operating system appears from the outside, students are
left with the feeling that an operating system consists of a set of interface
functions that are connected by a morass of mysterious code containing many
machine-dependent tricks.
</p>

<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The book about Operating Systems to understand all the other Operating
Systems. On the surface, a simplified UNIX system, but between it&#39;s pages and
through its fully-available, buildable and BeagleBone-installable software,
there one finds the OS Emperor stripped of his clothes.
</p>

<p>
Reading, tweaking and building Xinu countless of times, has left a deep
impression on me since whenever I find myself plagued by questions, among
others, of multithreading which is notoriously difficult to understand and apply
correctly, I go back in my mind and think: &#34;How did Xinu do it?&#34; And almost by
instinct I unravel the big onion bit by bit until I get down to context
switching, process stacks and the OS watching over all of them like the king he
truly is. And again, like in the Elements, this kind of exercise pays off and it
is the stuff on which your mind needs to get used to. That is, there is no
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/V/voodoo-programming.html">vodoo</a>, you get the complete system, all its basic parts and the elements holding
it together. Any question you might have does not get answered by appeal to holy
spirit, but by going back and thinking about it&#39;s constituent parts, it
starting-points and its assumptions. Once you get in this habit of mind, you get
a feel for how it plays out and most importantly you get the confidence in
yourself that you can understand it, that the system is understandable and it is
you that can unravel it, you will not wait for some self-proclaimed guru with
nice pictures and pretty stories to help you along. No. You have the confidence
of figuring out yourself, testing it and bending it to your will. Once you are
in that position, you&#39;ll soon find out you&#39;ll discover things that cannot be
explained and could not have been found by looking at those nice pictures.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Muad&#39;Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the
first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It&#39;s shocking to
find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe
learning to be difficult.
</p>

<p>
Similar to the Elements, this book is also not really about the usefulness of
Xinu in real life as surely as the Elements was not about Geometry. &#34;To be
inquiring everywhere about usefulness is least of all fitting for those who are
great-souled and free&#34;, after all. Here you have a stripped down version of a
fully functional, commercially available OS that has been prepared for teaching
purposes since the 1980s. And it shows. Besides the clean code that will teach
something about the age-old and ubiquitous C programming language and some
pointers kung fu to last you your whole life, there is talk and implementation
of a scheduler and context switching. These take care of all the processes on
the OS and make sure each gets its own share of the limited HW resources. There
is also a memory manager, that takes care of your malloc&#39;ed calls, assigns each
process its own memory, takes care to free that memory when the process dies,
among others. There are interrupts, device drivers, an IP protocol stack, file
systems, and all that is needed for the good functioning of this fundamental
piece of software we use daily.

<blockquote>
<p>
This book was inspired partly by two earlier works: Anatomy of Lisp (1978),
and Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach (1980), which gave all the
necessary code without hiding any details on how an operating system works and
thereby gained the reader&#39;s complete confidence.
</p>

<p>
In the same spirit, we want to produce a precise (rather than concise) book
where the central theme is the semantics of the applicative languages generally
and of Scheme in particular […] We&#39;ll &#34;tell all&#34; so that you, the reader, will
never be stumped for lack of information, and standing on such solid ground,
you&#39;ll be able to experiment with these concepts yourself.
</p>

<p>
Ah, what a nice introduction and homage to Xinu and one that I&#39;ve completely
missed on my first reading but with which I&#39;ve come to agree with after studying
this book for a while. That is, it is indeed similar to Xinu and the rest of the
books on this short list. There is nothing hidden in them. You get the real
deal, the complete system with which you can play to your liking. They all give
you building blocks and not ready-built cozy houses. You get the &#34;whys&#34; and
&#34;hows&#34; not the &#34;whats&#34;. That last part is left as a lifelong exercise to the
reader.
</p>

<p>
I have read SICP, The Little Schemer, the K&amp;R, etc, but none has provided the
level of insight and naked truth regarding programming languages as this one
has, even though those are the more popular ones. To be sure, this should not be
first Lisp reading even though it starts from the beginning and does not assume
anything. For full pleasure though, it is best to have a love of Lisp before
venturing in. For the veterans though, it does not only present complete
implementations of different styles of interpreters, where changing even one bit
has tremendous repercussions on the whole system (and you get to play with that
and understand why), but it does so in clear and beautiful language. I don&#39;t
think I&#39;ve seen even one useless joke in there and each sentence is packed full
of meaning, words are chosen carefully for their biggest impact. That does mean
a re-reading is often necessary, but this is not a competition for who reads the
fastest. The information is there, you just have to read it carefully, go back
and forth multiple times. It&#39;s a book for study, actually, and not for casual
reading, as all the great books are. As all the books on this short but heavy
list.
