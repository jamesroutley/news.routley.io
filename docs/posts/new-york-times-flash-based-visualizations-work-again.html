<p>In the 2000s, if you wanted to make interactive or animated visualization for the web, Flash was the main option. When Flash lost support and fell off the internet, a solid decade of great visualization no longer worked. </p>
<p>The New York Times has resurrected their archives with a Flash emulator. So pieces that were relegated to static thumbnail images are back. See the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/23/movies/20080223_REVENUE_GRAPHIC.html">box office streamgraph</a> that once upset many, the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/06/business/economy/unemployment-lines.html">multi-line chart</a> showing jobless rates for people like you, and the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html">interactive stacked area chart</a> on how people spend their day. </p>
<p>NYT is <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmichael_mur/status/1747853253503844711">using</a> the open source <a href="https://ruffle.rs">Ruffle</a> as their Flash emulator. I hope other news outlets follow. Itâ€™s great to see my favorite visualizations working again. [via <a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2024/nytimes-web-flash-player">EagerEyes</a>] </p>
