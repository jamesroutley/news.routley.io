<p>Real house prices—prices adjusted for inflation—have steadily increased in the U.S. since 2012. Further acceleration in the pace of house-price appreciation began before the pandemic but has strengthened noticeably since early 2020.</p>
<p>For prospective buyers and sellers as well as policymakers, knowing the state of housing markets is imperative. Using a novel statistical  toolkit for assessing the health of the U.S. housing market in real time, we argue  that the underlying causes of the run-up differ from those during the last housing  boom, which preceded the 2007–09 Global Financial Crisis. However, there is growing concern that U.S. house prices are again  becoming unhinged from fundamentals.</p>
<h2>Monitoring Emergence of Housing Bubbles in Real Time</h2>
<p>An asset—in this case, housing—is in the primary expansionary  phase of a bubble when price rises are out of step with market fundamentals. Rapid  real house-price appreciation, such as that observed now, does not in itself signal  a bubble. Shifts in disposable income, the cost of credit and access to it, supply  disruptions, and rising labor and raw construction materials costs are among the  economic reasons for sustained real house-price gains. </p>
<p>But real house prices can diverge from market fundamentals when  there is widespread belief that today’s robust price increases will continue. If  many buyers share this belief, purchases arising from a “fear of missing out”  can drive up prices and heighten expectations of strong house-price gains.</p>
<p>This self-fulfilling mechanism leads to price growth that may  become exponential (or explosive), resulting in the housing market becoming  progressively misaligned from fundamentals until investors become cautious, policymakers  intervene, the flow of money into housing dries up and a housing correction or  even a bust occurs.</p>
<p>Expectations-driven explosive appreciation (often called  exuberance) in real house prices has many consequences, including the misallocation  of economic resources, distorted investment patterns, individual bankruptcies and  broad macroeconomic effects on growth and employment. Monitoring the housing  market in real time for the emergence of such booms in prices can help  investors and policymakers respond before misalignments become so severe that subsequent  corrections produce economic upheaval.</p>
<p>Time series of real house prices that contain episodes of expectations-driven  bubbles display two important properties—they are nonlinear when graphed because  they are explosive during their boom (or exuberant) phase, and they result in a  correction or even a collapse if the market crashes.</p>
<p>To  provide market diagnostics, the Dallas Fed’s <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/institute/houseprice">International House Price Database</a> team, in partnership with a network of scholars from around  the world collaborating under the <a href="https://int.housing-observatory.com/" target="_blank">International Housing Observatory</a>, produces datasets and statistics that characterize potential market exuberance.  The methodology uses novel <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/institute/wpapers/2020/0383">statistical  methods</a> to continuously monitor housing markets—in the  U.S. and around the world—to detect symptoms and signal the presence of emerging  housing booms.</p>
<h2>Signs of a Market Tipping Point</h2>
<p>When the statistics derived from these  techniques are significant, the periods are date-stamped to signify exuberance—prices growing  at an exponential rate exceeding what economic fundamentals would justify. The  indicators are computed quarterly. A test outcome above a 95 percent threshold  signifies 95 percent confidence of abnormal explosive behavior, or housing  market fever.</p>
<p>The  history of the U.S. exuberance indicator is shown against the 95 percent threshold  in Chart 1. The statistic plotted in the bottom panel delivers a market temperature  reading, like that from a personal thermometer. The exuberance  indicator shows the temperature, and the confidence upper bound is the abnormality  threshold. The current reading indicates that the U.S. housing market has been  showing signs of exuberance for more than five consecutive quarters through  third quarter 2021.</p>

<p>The U.S. is not alone in  experiencing housing market fever. <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0928">Eleven of the 25 countries</a> in the Dallas Fed’s International House Price  Database show signs of real house-price exuberance.</p>
<h2>A Diagnostic Approach to U.S. Housing Markets</h2>
<p>To <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12430" target="_blank">assess</a> U.S.  house prices during the pandemic, we first develop an empirical relationship  between house prices and those economic fundamentals underpinning the market, based  on data through fourth quarter 2019. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11146-015-9531-2" target="_blank">The theoretical benchmark</a> is the fundamental  value of housing based on the sum of discounted future rents. This is similar  to the finance tenet that the fundamental value of a company’s stock is the flow of future dividends  discounted by the cost of capital. (Analogously, the company here is a house, and  its dividends are rents that are discounted by interest rates.) </p>
<p>Working  from that benchmark, the house-price-to-rent ratio is explained by a small set  of lagged economic variables, such as personal disposable income per capita, housing  rents and long-term interest rates. The residual of the regression, after  removing the effects of fundamentals, is assessed for any remaining evidence of  explosive behavior. The upshot: Since the beginning of 2020, the price-to-rent  ratio has soared beyond what observed fundamentals alone can explain (<em>Chart 2</em>).</p>
<p><img alt="Chart 2: Price-to-Rent Ratio Rapidly Diverging from Fundamentals" src="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2022/~/media/Images/research/economics/2022/0329/dfe0329c2.png"/></p>

<p>The gap between the actual price-to-rent ratio and its  fundamental-based level in the U.S. has grown rapidly during the  pandemic—comparable to the run-up of the last housing boom—and started showing  signs of exuberance in 2021. The exuberance statistic confirms that recent  increases are far from ordinary.</p>
<p>Another  important long-run anchor—tied directly to housing affordability—is the ratio  of house prices to disposable income. Chart 3 shows dates of episodes of  exuberance for this measure of housing affordability. These data—unlike our  previous metrics—do not yet display evidence of explosiveness in the third  quarter of 2021. But the rapid increase in the statistic close to the threshold  during 2021 indicates that U.S. real house prices may soon become untethered from  personal disposable income per capita.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart 3: Price-to-Income Ratio Has Been Increasing Quickly, But Not Yet Exuberant" src="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2022/~/media/Images/research/economics/2022/0329/dfe0329c3.png"/></p>

<p>The delay in elevation of this exuberance statistic is partly the consequence  of a surge in real disposable income during the pandemic that led to slower  growth rates in the price-to-income ratio. The surge in disposable income is mostly associated with pandemic-related fiscal and monetary stimulus  efforts and reduced household consumption arising from mobility restrictions  and lockdowns.</p>
<p>If  disposable income increases turn out to be transitory—as fiscal stimulus wanes  and the Federal Reserve reverses its accommodative monetary policy—recent  patterns in the price-to-income ratio may prove a less-useful measure of  housing affordability. Such transitory increases in disposable income are not  strong determinants of long-term housing investment. Thus, the price-to-income  ratio measure alone may produce overly conservative results when identifying housing  market bubbles.</p>
<h2>Another U.S. Housing Bubble Brewing?</h2>
<p>Our evidence points to abnormal U.S. housing market behavior for  the first time since the boom of the early 2000s. Reasons for concern are clear  in certain economic indicators—the price-to-rent ratio, in particular, and the  price-to-income ratio—which show signs that 2021 house prices appear increasingly  out of step with fundamentals.</p>
<p>While historically low interest rates are a factor, they do not  fully explain housing market developments. Other drivers have played a role,  including pandemic-related U.S. fiscal stimulus programs and COVID-19-related supply-chain  disruptions and associated policy responses. The resulting fundamental-driven  higher house prices may have fueled a fear-of-missing-out wave of exuberance  involving new investors and more aggressive speculation among existing  investors.</p>
<p>Based on present evidence, there is no expectation that fallout  from a housing correction would be comparable to the 2007–09 Global Financial  Crisis in terms of magnitude or macroeconomic gravity. Among other things,  household balance sheets appear in better shape, and excessive borrowing doesn’t  appear to be fueling the housing market boom.</p>
<p>Importantly,  experience from the housing bubble in the early 2000s and the subsequent  development of advanced tools for early detection and deployment of warning  indicators—some illustrated in this analysis—mean that market participants,  banks, policymakers and regulators are all better equipped to assess in real  time the significance of a housing boom. Thus, they are in a more-informed  position to react quickly and avoid the most severe, negative consequences of a  housing correction.</p>                    <!-- ::end::content -->
