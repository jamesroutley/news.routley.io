<p>Dear SSLPing user,</p>

<p>I want to thank you for this adventure we had together, but I must announce the immediate end of service of SSLPing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s broken, and I can&#39;t and won&#39;t fix it :-(</p>

<p>- it was using an older OS, and I couldn&#39;t update it because some old SSL stuff was removed from openssl, which would have changed SSLPing&#39;s features</p>

<p>As a side project, I think it was a success: hundreds of free users, thousands of servers, millions of checks...</p>

<p>But 5 days ago, SSLPing started dying, and I can&#39;t figure out how to bring it back to life.</p>

<p>And I can&#39;t afford to lose more time and money on SSLPing (only 25% of hosting costs were covered by Patreon). </p>

<p>If I ever get to ship sslbot.io (which could replace SSLPing) I&#39;ll let you know first hand!</p>

<p>I sincerely regret sending such an email, but I hope the inconvenience will not be too severe.</p>

<p>Best wishes</p>
