    <h1>How to Stare at Your Phone Without Losing Your Soul</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>How many hours per day can you stare at your phone before you qualify for a 12-step program? Eight? Four? Twenty? One? Here’s the truth:</p>
<p><strong>Screen time doesn’t matter.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about how much you use your phone. It’s about whether your phone is a needy, attention-sucking vampire.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, the only healthy screen time is no screen time. Zero. That’s why the main metric tracked by screen time apps is deceptive: ten minutes of shooting crack cocaine intravenously are still ten minutes of shooting crack cocaine intravenously.</p>
<p>But that’s expected: a tech company trying to cop around how much you use your devices is like a booze maker helping you track how much booze you should drink. Sure, they want to keep you alive: you are the <em>consumer</em> after all, and you must be around to consume.</p>
<p><strong>AA meetings don’t give out badges to members who drink for less than 2 hours per day. Or to those who stop drinking 2 hours before bed.</strong></p>
<p>Improving the relationship with your phone requires conscious decisions. It’s like couples therapy, but for you and your tech. Sometimes you need some <em>me-time</em>, sometimes it’s better to break up. Sometimes, everything is great! It is, right?</p>
<p>Ask yourself: is your phone a helpful assistant or a demanding boss?</p>
<p>When it helps you to check in on your partner, to get directions, or to edit photos professionally, time doesn’t matter as much—does it?</p>
<p>There are better parameters to evaluate <em>quality</em>, not quantity, of the time spent staring at your screens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this app do its job and then politely step aside?</li>
<li>Does it linger in your brain like an awkward party guest at 2:30 A.M. after everyone else already left?</li>
<li>Did I summon this app, or did it summon me via notifications?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Go on, spend 4 hours on an app. Just make sure you decided to—and that you feel those 4 hours are life well spent.</strong></p>
<p>But consider that anything not honoring your time and attention is disrespecting you.</p>
<p>Tracking for how long your attention is disrespected makes little difference.</p>
