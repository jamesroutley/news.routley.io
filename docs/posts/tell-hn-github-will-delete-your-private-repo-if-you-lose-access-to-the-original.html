    <h1>Tell HN: GitHub will delete your private repo if you lose access to the original</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was surprised to see this in my email today:</p><p>&gt; Your private repository baobabKoodaa/laaketutka-scripts (forked from futurice/how-to-get-healthy) has been deleted because you are no longer a collaborator on futurice/how-to-get-healthy.</p><p>That was an MIT-licensed open source project I worked on years ago. We published the source code for everyone to use, so I certainly did not expect to lose access to it just because someone at my previous company has been doing spring cleaning at GitHub! I had a 100% legal fork of the project, and now it&#39;s gone... why?</p><p>Turns out I don&#39;t even have a local copy of it anymore, so this actually caused me data loss. I&#39;m fine with losing access to this particular codebase, I&#39;m not using HN as customer support to regain access. I just wanted everyone to be aware that GitHub does this.</p></div></div></div>
