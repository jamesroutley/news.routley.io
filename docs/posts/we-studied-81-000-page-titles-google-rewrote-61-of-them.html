    <h1>We Studied 81,000 Page Titles – Google Rewrote 61% of Them</h1>

<p><code>&lt;title&gt;Hey Google, Don&#39;t Rewrite This (Please)&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>
<p>Title tags are what we call an <a href="https://zyppy.com/seo-success-factors/">outsized Google ranking factor</a><a href="https://zyppy.com/seo-success-factors/"> </a>.</p>
<p>Like most Google ranking signals, titles play only a small part in the overall algorithm. But because they are typically the first things users see in Google results, titles can have a <strong>large impact on click-through rates</strong> and the number of visits your site ultimately receives.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Google used title tags to generate the page title in its search results. Over the years, it wasn’t uncommon to see Google make small changes to the title—typically because of length or relevancy—but <em>these changes were mostly minor</em>.</p>
<p>More recently, Google became much more aggressive with title rewriting, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/08/update-to-generating-page-titles">incorporating additional HTLM tags</a> and generally rewriting far more titles than previously.</p>
<p>Many site owners find that the titles they carefully craft <em>almost all get rewritten</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, here at Zyppy, we have a large database of titles thanks to <a href="https://zyppy.com/features/">our title tag analysis tool</a>. Armed with this data, we set out to determine how often Google rewrites titles and the scenarios which trigger this behavior.</p>
<h2>Google Rewriting Many of Your Page Titles</h2>
<p>For this research, we examined a total of 80,959 title tags across 2370 sites from across the globe and compared them against desktop Google results.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we found that <strong>Google rewrote 61.6% of the titles.</strong></p>
<p>This number generally agrees with an <a href="https://moz.com/blog/ways-google-rewrites-title-tags">earlier study</a><a href="https://moz.com/blog/ways-google-rewrites-title-tags"> </a> conducted by Dr. Pete Meyers using a slightly different methodology. To be fair, many of these Google rewrites are minor (while many aren’t) but 61% is still a <em>very large number</em>.</p>
<p>If Google rewrites a significant number of your titles, it can be helpful to understand why they do this, because Google’s algorithm obviously believes it can write better titles than you.</p>
<p>Looking at individual results, we found a number of common scenarios in which it became more <a href="https://staging.zyppy.com/blog/5-ways-to-beat-google-title-rewrites-and-a-new-seo-traffic-tool/">likely for Google to rewrite titles</a>. These scenarios includ:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Length</strong>: overly long titles and short titles</li>
<li>Using the same keyword <em>more than once</em></li>
<li>Use of title <strong>separators</strong>, such as dashes “-” or pipes “|”</li>
<li>Titles with [brackets] or (parentheses)</li>
<li>Identical “<strong>boilerplate</strong>” used across many titles</li>
<li>Missing or superfluous <em>brand names</em></li>
</ul>
<p>… and more.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into 3 of the most common scenarios that trigger Google rewrites that haven’t yet been explored in depth: length, brackets/parenthesis, and separators.</p>
<h2>How Character Length Impacts Google Title Rewriting</h2>
<p>On desktop search, Google typically limits titles to 650 pixels (often a bit more for mobile results.) Titles longer than this are almost always truncated with ellipses (...).</p>
<p>But Google also rewrites <strong>very short titles</strong>.</p>
<p>We mapped all 80,959 titles by the number of characters in each to determine the likelihood of Google rewriting each one. As you can see in the graph below, Google rewrites both long titles and extremely short titles <em>over 95% of the time</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.zyppy.com/assets/ebb1ef81-3b81-4c90-8364-1540850d7154#screenshot" alt="Title Length vs Google Rewrites"/></p>
<p>Short titles between <strong>1-5 characters</strong> (e.g. “Home” or “IBM”) <em>were rewritten 96.6% of the time</em>, typically by adding more words and information. In fact, any title 20 characters or less had a better than 50% chance of getting rewritten.</p>
<p>On the other hand, long titles with <strong>over 70 characters</strong> were rewritten <em>a whopping 99.9% of the time</em>. Any title over 60 characters had a greater than 76% chance of getting rewritten.</p>
<p>The “sweet spot” seemed to be between 51-60 characters. These titles had the lowest percentage of rewrites, <em>ranging between 39% to 42%</em>.</p>
<p><em>Note: Simply because Google doesn’t display certain words from your title tag in search results doesn’t always mean that those words aren’t helping you to rank. These are in fact two separate processes.</em></p>
<h2>Does Google Favor [Brackets] or (Parentheses)?</h2>
<p>You’ve likely seen titles utilize both brackets and/or parentheses, e.g.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>It’s a common method to help make key ideas and terms stand out in a cluttered sea of search results.</p>
<p>Brackets and parentheses may seem interchangeable, but our analysis shows that Google is far more likely to one differently than the other.</p>
<p>For pages that contained brackets [], Google rewrote 77.6% of titles. Not only that, Google <em>completely removed the bracketed portion of text 32.9% of the time</em>.</p>
<p>So a title that looked like this:</p>
<p>Might now look like this in Google search 32.9% of the time:</p>
<p>On the other hand, the text contained in parentheses fared far better. Google only rewrote these titles 61.9% of the time - nearly equal to all other titles. And Google completely removed the parenthesis section of text only 19.7% of the time, far less often than the 32.9% seen with brackets.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.zyppy.com/assets/68c5591a-eb66-49d1-9828-94b6ed276f13" alt="Brackets vs Parentheses in Titles"/></p>
<p>In other words, if you want to emphasize text in titles, it’s far better to use parentheses as Google seems less likely to remove these portions of text.</p>
<h2>Which Title Separator Does Google Prefer?</h2>
<p>Title separators are bits of common punctuation used to break titles into parts, such as arrows “&gt;” or colons “:”.</p>
<p>For years, the title separator you used was largely a matter of personal preference.</p>
<p>Today, two of the most common separators in use are the <strong>dash</strong> and its many variations “- – —” and the <strong>pipe</strong> “|”.</p>
<p>Does Google care which separator you use? According to our analysis, the answer is almost certainly yes.</p>
<p>For titles that use dashes as separators, Google rewrote and completely <strong>removed the dashes 19.7% of the time</strong> (and presumably the content in between.</p>
<p>By comparison, titles that used pipes saw Google remove and/or replace the pipes <strong>41.0% of the time</strong> - more than double.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, Google simply replaced pipes with a different separator, typically a dash. It doesn’t seem like using a pipe will hurt you in any way, but dashes are definitely less susceptible to rewriting.</p>
<h2>Fighting Google Title Rewrites With H1 Tags</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, Google now considers <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/08/update-to-generating-page-titles">other HTML elements</a> when crafting page tiles beyond title tags. Chief among these are H1 tags.</p>
<p>Indeed, we found that using H1 tags strategically could limit the amount of title rewriting Google might perform on your site.</p>
<p>For example, when pipes are used as separators, we showed that Google rewrote titles 41% of the time. But when pipes were <em>also</em> included in the first H1 tag—as well as the title—Google rewriting <strong>dropped in half to 20.6%</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, we found that matching your H1 to your title dropped typically dropped the degree of rewriting across the board, <em>often dramatically</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.zyppy.com/assets/14d6dbf8-deee-4aeb-ace8-3b350e081f1c#screenshot" alt="Google Title/H1 Matching"/></p>
<p>For example, pages that contained at least one <strong>number</strong> (1-9, 2022, 7a, etc) in the title tag, but <em>no numbers in the H1,</em> saw their titles rewritten to contain no numbers 25.8% of the time.</p>
<p>By contrast, on pages where <strong>both</strong> the title and the H1 contained a number, Google included a number in the title a <strong>shocking 97.3% of the time</strong>. In other words, when numbers were also included in the H1, Google only rewrote titles to not include a number a <strong>meager 2.3% of the time</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: to dramatically decrease the chance of Google rewriting your title, matching the H1 to the title tag seems to be an effective strategy.</p>
