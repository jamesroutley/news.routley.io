    <h1>One Million Chessboards</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I made a website. It’s called <a href="https://onemillionchessboards.com">One Million Chessboards</a>. It has one million chessboards on it.</p>
<p>Moving a piece moves it for everyone, instantly. There are no turns. You can move between boards.</p>

<h2 id="toc:what">What</h2>
<p>Well last year I made this game called <a href="https://eieio.games/blog/one-million-checkboxes">One Million Checkboxes</a>.</p>
<p>It was a pretty fun time! So I thought I’d do something like this again.</p>
<p>I worked really hard on this one. I hope you like it.</p>
<h2 id="toc:how">How</h2>
<p>This was the most technically challenging thing that I’ve worked on in a long time. I’m going to save a full technical writeup until I see how my decisions pan out, since I think there’s a decent chance I’ll need to make a lot of changes.</p>
<p>But I’ll summarize a few things for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike One Million Checkboxes, I designed this for scale</li>
<li>The game runs on a single server (!)</li>
<li>The board is stored fully in-memory; it’s a 2D array of 64 million uint64s</li>
<li>The backend is written in go. This is my first go project.</li>
<li>I use a single writer thread, tons of reader threads, and coordinate access to the board with a mutex</li>
<li>The frontend optimistically applies all moves you make immediately. It then builds up a dependency graph of the moves you’ve made, and backs them out if it receives a conflicting update before the server acks your move.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last part - optimistic move application with what games people sometimes call “rollback” - is about 1,600 lines of code that took me a ~7 days of fulltime work to write. I don’t remember the last time I wrestled with a problem that hard!</p>
<h2 id="toc:can-i-play">Can I play</h2>
<p>Yes! <a href="https://onemillionchessboards.com/">Play it here</a>.</p>
<p>I really hope you like this one. More updates to come :)</p></article></div>
