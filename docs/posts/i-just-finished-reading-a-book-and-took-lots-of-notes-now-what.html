    <h1>I just finished reading a book and took lots of notes. Now what?</h1>

<div><h3 id="i-just-finished-reading-dirt-by-david-r-montgomery-and-created-a-note-for-each-of-the-hundred-twenty-one-ideas-i-found-interesting-but-i-m-confused-as-to-how-i-m-supposed-to-link-these-individual-notes-in-my-zettelkasten-am-i-missing-something">&#34;I just finished reading <em>Dirt</em> by David R. Montgomery and created a note for each of the hundred twenty one ideas I found interesting. But, I&#39;m confused as to how I&#39;m supposed to link these individual notes in my zettelkasten? Am I missing something?&#34;</h3>
<p>Hey, great start! And, so many interesting ideas! Here&#39;s what&#39;s missing: <strong>your interpretation of the ideas you&#39;re capturing</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason you&#39;re unsure as to how they all connect is because these aren&#39;t your ideas. These are the author&#39;s ideas whose done you a solid and linked them all for you. It&#39;s called <em>Dirt</em>. It&#39;s the book you just finished reading. <strong>Your zettelkasten should be made up of <em>your</em> ideas <em>about</em> the authors ideas</strong>. Linking <em>these</em> notes is what&#39;s meant to happen.</p>
<p>What I would have done instead is create a single note (often called a reference or lit note) and mark down all the pages where you found something interesting. Now you have a reference note pointing you to all the goods you came across. That note goes in a folder called &#34;Reference Notes&#34; (or &#34;Literature Notes&#34; or &#34;Bib Notes&#34; etc. They&#39;re all the same).</p>
<p>The next step, is to take only those ideas that are relevant to what you&#39;re working on (after all, the ZK is primarily a tool for helping writers develop their ideas) and make individual zettels for each one based on <strong>your interpretation of the author&#39;s idea.</strong> But, in order to do this, you have to know what you&#39;re working on!</p>
<p>Again, the zettelkasten is a tool to help you develop ideas so you can put those ideas into some form of outward expression. In short, it is a writing tool. Are you a writer? Are you blogging? Are you working on developing a theory of something? Without knowing what you&#39;re working on it&#39;s really hard for you to know <em>why</em> an idea is interesting to you. It has no context.</p>
<p>The linking comes when you interpret the ideas for your own work. While you&#39;re reading you&#39;ll think &#34;oh, this reminds me of that other idea I had about xyz.&#34; That&#39;s when you write your new zettel, interpreting the work of someone else in light of what you&#39;re working on, and link it to notes of a similar thought line already stored in your zettelkasten.</p>
<p>Right now you&#39;re collecting someone else&#39;s ideas and trying to fit them together like a puzzle. But, like I said, the author already did that for you. Now it&#39;s your turn to see how this author&#39;s ideas are important to <em>your</em> work.</p>
