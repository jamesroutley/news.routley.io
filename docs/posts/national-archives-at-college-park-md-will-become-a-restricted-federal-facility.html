<p>My parents’ house has an on-demand water heater for energy efficiency reasons.
This has a small drawback: you have to press a button to prime the water heater
and then wait 2-5 minutes before showering.</p>

<p>This turns into a somewhat bigger drawback for the one room for which it’s just
Not Possible to wire up a button. The water heater company hypothetically sells
a plug-and-play wireless solution for this sort of thing, but that is seemingly
incompatible with my parents’ walls (???).</p>

<p>Thankfully, I have a <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/wakeonlan/">have a playbook</a> for this.</p>

<p>There’s just one problem: how do I make a Raspberry Pi talk to the water
heater? I investigated a couple of different approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>analyze and replicate the water heater company’s proprietary Bluetooth
protocol</li>
  <li>install a physical button presser, inspired by the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e8845120d0b98bbc3341fa6fa69539bb">Recurse
Center</a>’s elevator-related shenanigans</li>
</ul>

<p>but after a couple of discussions with my dad and a support tech from the
company, we determined that we should instead <em>emulate</em> a button press. To find
out what that means, let’s take a look at a very sketchy wiring diagram:</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>The heater supplies 12V at 0.2A on the red wire. When the button is
pressed, it connects the red and black wires, which the heater interprets as a
signal to start heating. The wire nuts are there because several buttons are
already joined together this way.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This means we would have to add a new “button” and have it briefly connect two
wires. Because the last time I actually touched some wires was over 10 years
ago in robotics and I don’t want to start any fires, I reach out to the usual
suspects: Tom and Logan. They inform me that the thing I am looking for is
called a relay and that companies sell pre-built relay hats for the Pi. Super.</p>

<p>I ended up buying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Pi Zero 2W and accoutrements</li>
  <li>A relay hat with headers and stabilization posts</li>
  <li>Telephone wire from the hardware store, which already has bundled red/black
wire</li>
</ul>

<p>At some point I sit down to build the thing and realize that I don’t actually
know how relays work. The relay I bought had three ports: NC, NO, COM. After
some searching, I figure out that I want one wire in NO (“normally open”) and
one in COM (“common”). This means that the relay, when activated, will close
the circuit.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>I downloaded the sample code from the company that sells the relay hats and
realized that it is an extremely thin (~10 LOC) wrapper over the existing
Python GPIO library provided and pre-installed by Raspberry Pi, so I just
manually inlined it:</p>

<p>If you read my previous post (linked above), you will know that is is, of
course, a CGI script that is triggered on a website button press:</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>The tagline under #justshowerthings is randomly selected on page
load from a medium-long list I wrote. All the items are carefully designed to
toe the line.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All of the rest of the software is the same as in the previous post. Very
boring stuff: httpd, systemd. Hopefully nothing goes wrong. But if it does and
I need to administer this device from afar, I also set up Tailscale (no, this
is not an ad; just happy).</p>

<p>The total bill for this came to ~$40 or so, which isn’t half bad. It could
probably be done for 35 cents using an old microcontroller and a paperclip or
something but I wanted an exceptionally boring (to me) approach. That’s all for
now. Thanks for reading!</p>
