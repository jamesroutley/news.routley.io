<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> chipmaker <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/tsmc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TSMC</a> has said that several then-employees tried to steal trade secrets relating to the company’s most advanced chip process. TSMC fired the individuals concerned and is now taking legal action against them. The former employees may also face criminal prosecution.</p>



<p>The report relates to the company’s 2-nanometer chip process, which is expected to be used for the A20 chips across next year’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 18</a> lineup …</p>

<p>TSMC leads the world in the most advanced chip processes, and is next year expected to use its 2nm technology <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/apples-a20-chip-packaging-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the A20 chips</a> used in the iPhone 18 range. Apple typically gets access to TSMC’s most advanced chip processes ahead of the company’s other customers.</p>



<p>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that the new chip will be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/22/apple-iphone-18-2nm-a20-chip-kuo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used for all iPhone 18 models</a>, not just the two Pro ones.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/tsmc-fires-workers-for-breaching-data-rules-on-cutting-edge-chip-tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikkei Asia</a></em> reports that TSMC accused several former employees of attempting to obtain secret information about its 2nm chip development and production process.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Several former employees of TSMC are suspected of attempting to obtain critical proprietary information on 2-nanometer chip development and production while working at the company, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.</p>



<p>In response to Nikkei Asia’s questions, TSMC said that it recently “detected unauthorized activities during routine monitoring, leading to the discovery of potential trade secret leaks.”</p>



<p>The world’s top chipmaker said on Monday it took “strict disciplinary actions against the personnel involved and has initiated legal proceedings.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The attempt was detected by spotting “unusual access patterns” on the part of one of the employees.</p>



<p>The report says there could even be national security implications, as the Taiwanese government takes extremely seriously the protection of advanced technology developed within the country. Prosecutors have confirmed that they are investigating, and TSMC says that it will seek prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.</p>



<p>No details have been shared on the nature of the information obtained. It is likely that it relates to the 2nm process in general rather than anything specific to Apple’s A20 chip.</p>
