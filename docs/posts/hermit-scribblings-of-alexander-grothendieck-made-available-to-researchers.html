<p>Tens of thousands of handwritten pages by one of the 20th century&#39;s greatest mathematicians, Alexander Grothendieck, many of which the eccentric genius penned while living as a hermit, were unveiled in France on Friday.

<p>The unpublished manuscripts, which veer from math to metaphysics, autobiography and even long musings on Satan, offer a unique insight into the enigmatic mind of the French mathematician, according to experts at the Paris library where they were donated.
</p><p>Grothendieck, who died aged 86 in 2014, is considered by some to have revolutionized the field of mathematics in the way that Einstein did for physics.
</p><p>His work on <a href="https://phys.org/tags/algebraic+geometry/" rel="tag">algebraic geometry</a> earned him the 1966 Fields Medal, known as the Nobel prize of the math world.
</p><p>At that time Grothendieck was already a radical environmentalist and pacifist. But he withdrew from the world almost entirely in the early 1990s, in part to focus on what he referred to as his &#34;scribblings&#34;.
</p><p>While living as a hermit in the southern French village of Lasserre he frantically wrote &#34;Reflections on Life and the Cosmos,&#34; one of the two main works added to the collection of the National Library of France (BnF) on Friday.
</p><p>The massive tome includes 30,000 pages across 41 different volumes covering science, philosophy and psychology—all densely scribbled with a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/fountain+pen/" rel="tag">fountain pen</a>.
</p><p>The second work, &#34;The Key to Dreams or Dialogue with the Good Lord,&#34; is a typed manuscript in which he explores the interpretation of dreams.
</p><p>These pages, which have previously circulated online, were written between 1987-1988.
</p><h2>&#39;Completely cut ties&#39;</h2>
<p>At that time, Grothendieck remained a professor at the University of Montpellier but had largely withdrawn from the mathematical community.
</p><p>He became a recluse when he moved to Lasserre.
</p><p>&#34;He completely cut ties with his family, we could no longer communicate with him,&#34; his daughter Johanna Grothendieck told AFP.
</p><p>&#34;When we sent him a letter, it was returned to sender,&#34; said Johanna, a 64-year-old ceramic artist who traveled from southwest France to attend the ceremony at the library.
</p><p>&#34;Writing was his main activity,&#34; she added.
</p><p>Towards the end of Grothendieck&#39;s life, a neighbor told his family that his health was deteriorating.
</p><p>Johanna and one of her brothers were finally able to visit their father. It was than that they discovered &#34;Reflections on Life and the Cosmos,&#34; which was meticulously catalogued in his library.
</p><p>In his 1997 will, Grothendieck left the early sections of the tome to the BnF. Now his children have donated the rest.
</p><p>&#34;It was an extremely important work in his eyes. He even wanted to create a foundation to look after it,&#34; Johanna Grothendieck said.
</p><h2>&#39;Ghosts of his past&#39;</h2>
<p>Jocelyn Monchamp, a curator an the BnF, said the manuscripts were unique because they covered so many subjects at the same time yet formed a whole with &#34;undeniable literary qualities&#34;.
</p><p>This is particularly the case for the autobiographical volume &#34;Harvest and Sowing&#34;, which depicts the author &#34;in a metaphysical retreat,&#34; she said.
</p><p>Monchamp has spent a month poring over the writing, trying to decipher the dense fountain pen text.
</p><p>&#34;I became used to it,&#34; she said, adding that at least Grothendieck methodically wrote the numbers and dates on all the pages.
</p><p>In one of the sections, &#34;Structures of the Psyche,&#34; enigmatic diagrams translate psychology into the language of algebra.
</p><p>In another, &#34;The Problem of Evil,&#34; Grothendieck muses over 15,000 pages on metaphysics and Satan.
</p><p>One gets the feeling of a man &#34;overtaken by the ghosts of his past,&#34; Johanna Grothendieck said.
</p><p>The mathematician&#39;s father fled Germany during World War II, only to be handed by the Vichy France government to the Nazis and die at the Auschwitz concentration camp.
</p><p>Experts expect it will take some time to fully understand Grothendieck&#39;s writing.
</p><p>On Friday, the collection joined the manuscript department of the BnF, where it will only be accessible to researchers.
</p><p>During the donation ceremony, one of the volumes was placed in a glass case next to a manuscript by ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, considered the father of geometry.
