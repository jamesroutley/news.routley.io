    <h1>&#39;Cryptoqueen&#39; Ruja Ignatova added to FBI most-wanted list over OneCoin scheme</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="published datetime">Updated: Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:02:44 GMT</p><p>A German citizen accused of defrauding investors out of $4 billion by selling a fake cryptocurrency called OneCoin has been added to the FBI&#39;s list of its ten most-wanted fugitives, US officials said on Thursday.</p><p>Ruja Ignatova, also known as &#34;Cryptoqueen,&#34; was charged in 2019 with eight counts including wire fraud and securities fraud for running the Bulgaria-based OneCoin Ltd as a pyramid scheme. Prosecutors say the company offered commissions for members to entice others to buy a worthless cryptocurrency. </p><p>&#34;She timed her scheme perfectly, capitalizing on the frenzied speculation of the early days of cryptocurrency,&#34; said Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.</p><p>Williams described OneCoin as &#34;one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.&#34;</p><p>Ignatova disappeared in late 2017 after bugging an apartment belonging to her American boyfriend and learning he was cooperating with an FBI probe into OneCoin, Williams said. She boarded a flight from Bulgaria to Greece and has not been seen since, he said.</p><p>The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to Ignatova&#39;s capture, said Michael Driscoll, the FBI&#39;s assistant director-in-charge in New York.</p><p>Driscoll declined to comment on any leads as to where Ignatova might be. The bureau adds fugitives to its most-wanted list when it believes the public may be able to assist with tracking suspects down.</p><p>&#34;She left with a tremendous amount of cash,&#34; Driscoll told reporters. &#34;Money can buy a lot of friends, and I would imagine she&#39;s taking advantage of that.&#34;</p><p>Ignatova was charged alongside Mark Scott, a former corporate lawyer who prosecutors said laundered around $400 million for OneCoin. Scott was found guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit bank fraud following a three-week trial in Manhattan federal court.</p></div></div>
