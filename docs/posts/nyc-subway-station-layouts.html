     <p>I added a new section to this site a couple weeks ago called
<a href="https://jvns.ca/til/">TIL</a> (“today I learned”).</p>
<h3 id="the-goal-save-interesting-tools-facts-i-posted-on-social-media">the goal: save interesting tools &amp; facts I posted on social media</h3>
<p>One kind of thing I like to post on Mastodon/Bluesky is “hey, here’s a cool
thing”, like <a href="https://github.com/dbcli/litecli">the great SQLite repl litecli</a>, or
the fact that cross compiling in Go Just Works and it’s amazing, or
<a href="https://www.latacora.com/blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers/">cryptographic right answers</a>,
or <a href="https://diffdiff.net/">this great diff tool</a>. Usually I don’t want to write
a whole blog post about those things because I really don’t have much more to
say than “hey this is useful!”</p>
<p>It started to bother me that I didn’t have anywhere to put those things: for
example recently I wanted to use <a href="https://diffdiff.net/">diffdiff</a> and I just
could not remember what it was called.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution-make-a-new-section-of-this-blog">the solution: make a new section of this blog</h3>
<p>So I quickly made a new folder called <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/">/til/</a>, added some
custom styling (I wanted to style the posts to look a little bit like a tweet),
made a little Rake task to help me create new posts quickly (<code>rake new_til</code>), and
set up a separate RSS Feed for it.</p>
<p>I think this new section of the blog might be more for myself than anything,
now when I forget the link to Cryptographic Right Answers I can hopefully look
it up on the TIL page. (you might think “julia, why not use bookmarks??” but I
have been failing to use bookmarks for my whole life and I don’t see that
changing ever, putting things in public is for whatever reason much easier for
me)</p>
<p>So far it’s been working, often I can actually just make a quick post in 2
minutes which was the goal.</p>
<h3 id="inspired-by-simon-willison-s-til-blog">inspired by Simon Willison’s TIL blog</h3>
<p>My page is inspired by <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison’s great TIL blog</a>, though my TIL posts are a lot shorter.</p>
<h3 id="i-don-t-necessarily-want-everything-to-be-archived">I don’t necessarily want everything to be archived</h3>
<p>This came about because I spent a lot of time on Twitter, so I’ve been thinking
about what I want to do about all of my tweets.</p>
<p>I keep reading the advice to “POSSE” (“post on your own site, syndicate
elsewhere”), and while I find the idea appealing in principle, for me part of
the appeal of social media is that it’s a little bit ephemeral. I can
post polls or questions or observations or jokes and then they can just kind of
fade away as they become less relevant.</p>
<p>I find it a lot easier to identify specific categories of things that I actually
want to have on a Real Website That I Own:</p>
<ul>
<li>blog posts here!</li>
<li>comics at <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/">https://wizardzines.com/comics/</a>!</li>
<li>now TILs at <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/">https://jvns.ca/til/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and then let everything else be kind of ephemeral.</p>
<p>I really believe in the advice to make email lists though – the first two
(blog posts &amp; comics) both have email lists and RSS feeds that people can
subscribe to if they want. I might add a quick summary of any TIL posts from
that week to the “blog posts from this week” mailing list.</p>
