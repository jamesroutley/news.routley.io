      <p>As we reported earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised US President Donald Trump and the US for &#34;acting with a lot of strength&#34; in its strikes on Iran&#39;s nuclear sites.</p><p>In the full video address, <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1936600958508618192">posted on social media,<span>, <!-- -->external</span></a> Netanyahu congratulates the US president for his &#34;bold decision to target Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities with the awesome and righteous might of the United States&#34;, saying the action will  &#34;change history&#34;.</p><p>Netanyahu says Israel had done &#34;truly amazing things&#34; in its own operations against Iran, but that &#34;in tonight’s action against Iran’s nuclear facilities, America has been truly unsurpassed&#34;.</p><p>&#34;It has done what no other country on Earth could do. History will record that President Trump acted to deny the world’s most dangerous regime, the world’s most dangerous weapons. His leadership today has created a pivot of history that can help lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace,&#34; he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ckg3rzj8emjt?post=asset%3A318f6f11-bf58-4ce9-8849-f347aac2e313#post">As our Middle East bureau chief wrote earlier,</a> as people across the Middle East wake this morning they will be waiting to see if this action marks the beginning of the end of this conflict, or the beginning of an even more deadly phase to the war.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump, the president who returned to the White House in January promising to be a &#34;peacemaker&#34;, has taken a dramatic step to insert the US into the fraught conflict between Iran and Israel.</p><p>Far from bringing peace to the Middle East since taking office, Trump is now presiding over a region on the precipice of even greater warfare - a fight in which America is an active participant.</p><p>Now Trump risks a political blowback. That risk includes domestic political concerns, along with questions of international security.</p><p>The prospect of a US attack on Iran had already prompted sharp criticisms not only from Democrats but also from within Trump&#39;s own &#34;America First&#34; movement.</p><p>Read my <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg86pd63j8o">analysis in full here</a>.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="Donald Trump speaks during his televised address" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/2561fd26-d9cc-41c9-9c46-09863f9810dd.jpg.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/2561fd26-d9cc-41c9-9c46-09863f9810dd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/2561fd26-d9cc-41c9-9c46-09863f9810dd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/2561fd26-d9cc-41c9-9c46-09863f9810dd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/2561fd26-d9cc-41c9-9c46-09863f9810dd.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/2561fd26-d9cc-41c9-9c46-09863f9810dd.jpg.webp 800w" width="1000" height="563"/></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>EPA</span></p></figure>

      <p>Bluff. It is a word repeated a lot since I started watching Iran’s
state TV a few hours ago to see their reaction to the US attacks on its nuclear
sites.</p><p>A presenter on state TV said Donald Trump is “bluffing” about
destroying Fordo nuclear site, adding that “only two tunnels at the entrance
and exit of Fordo have been damaged”.</p><p>Iranian official media began downplaying the attacks early on,
calling them “unverified reports”.</p><p>Morteza Heydari, spokesperson for Qom province crisis management,
who had confirmed the attack on “a part” of Fordo, was quick to say afterwards
that the whole province was “entirely calm”.</p><p>Iranian outlets also tried to downplay by saying the explosions
were “not that loud”.</p><p>At the same time, Iran has limited access to the internet,
citing “enemy cyberattacks” as the reason. This has led to a drop in videos and photos sent to the BBC and
shared on social media, meaning we have to rely more on videos by Iranian
outlets and state media and their narratives.</p>

      <p>When
Israel hit Iran last Thursday week, Donald Trump’s Secretary of State and
National Security Adviser, Marco Rubio, immediately distanced the US from the
action, calling it “unilateral” on Israel’s part.</p><p>Fast
forward to now, and America is a combatant.</p><p>The
president hopes this is a ‘one and done’ action, as Americans like to put it,
but the one thing that is out of his hands is how Iran responds.</p><p>He
is urging Iran to make peace – warning that future attacks would be “far worse
and a lot easier”.</p><p>Does
that mean he’s prepared to go as far as regime change? That would certainly be
counter to his promise to avoid taking the US into foreign wars and could cause
a significant domestic backlash among many of his supporters.</p><p>US
presidents often come into office vowing to focus on their agenda at home – and
many have ended up getting drawn into international hotspots and wars. Is the
same happening to the most isolationist president in living memory?</p>

Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>The organisation also criticises the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) for being “indifferent and even complicit”.</p><p>The AEOI called on the global community to “condemn the attacks
and support Iran’s rightful position”.</p><p>The organisation says that “despite the malicious plans of the
enemies”, scientists and experts will “keep the country’s nuclear industry
moving forward”.</p><p>The organisation will be taking “necessary&#34; steps which will

Instead, he made it clear the US considers the operation largely over. But if - and only if - Iran comes to the table. </p><p>The US has moved considerable military assets to the region, which suggests, as Trump noted, that the US is ready to move extremely quickly if the president so chooses.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="Trump walks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth before his address to the nation" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 800w" width="1000" height="563"/></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p></figure>
