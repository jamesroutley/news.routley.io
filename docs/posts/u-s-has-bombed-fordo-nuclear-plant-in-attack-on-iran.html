      <p>When
Israel hit Iran last Thursday week, Donald Trump’s Secretary of State and
National Security Adviser, Marco Rubio, immediately distanced the US from the
action, calling it “unilateral” on Israel’s part.</p><p>Fast
forward to now, and America is a combatant.</p><p>The
president hopes this is a ‘one and done’ action, as Americans like to put it,
but the one thing that is out of his hands is how Iran responds.</p><p>He
is urging Iran to make peace – warning that future attacks would be “far worse
and a lot easier”.</p><p>Does
that mean he’s prepared to go as far as regime change? That would certainly be
counter to his promise to avoid taking the US into foreign wars and could cause
a significant domestic backlash among many of his supporters.</p><p>US
presidents often come into office vowing to focus on their agenda at home – and
many have ended up getting drawn into international hotspots and wars. Is the
same happening to the most isolationist president in living memory?</p>

      <p>We&#39;re just getting some more reaction from Iran following the US strikes. </p><p>The Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) condemns America&#39;s “savage assault” on three
Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>The organisation also criticises the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) for being “indifferent and even complicit”.</p><p>The AEOI called on the global community to “condemn the attacks
and support Iran’s rightful position”.</p><p>The organisation says that “despite the malicious plans of the
enemies”, scientists and experts will “keep the country’s nuclear industry
moving forward”.</p><p>The organisation will be taking “necessary&#34; steps which will
include “legal actions” following the attacks, the statement said.</p>

      <p>Trump&#39;s message to the Iranian regime was short, simple and direct: come to the negotiating table, or more strikes will come. </p><p> &#34;If they do not, future attacks will be far greater,&#34; he said. &#34;And a lot easier.&#34; </p><p>In the lead-up to the attacks, Trump had repeatedly - at least publicly - left room for negotiations to continue. </p><p>Now, he continues to leave the path open, but with the threat of further American strikes looming over Iran&#39;s leadership. </p><p>&#34;There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,&#34; he said. </p><p>Notably, Trump did not explicitly mention the possibility of regime change in Tehran. Instead, he made it clear the US considers the operation largely over. But if - and only if - Iran comes to the table. </p><p>The US has moved considerable military assets to the region, which suggests, as Trump noted, that the US is ready to move extremely quickly if the president so chooses.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="Trump walks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth before his address to the nation" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/1c6c9f22-0008-4059-8e8f-b277ba29a4ce.jpg.webp 800w" width="1000" height="563"/></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p></figure>

      <p>Israel
has always maintained that it had the capacity to destroy Iran’s nuclear
programme on its own, but it is also no secret that only America possessed the
massive ordnance capable of dealing with the strongest levels of protection,
particularly at Fordo, built deep inside a mountain.</p><p>If
the sites are now indeed out of use, then there may be an opportunity for
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare his main war aim
complete.  </p><p>But
this morning the Middle East will be holding its breath, waiting to see whether
this marks the beginning of the end of this conflict, or the beginning of an
even more deadly phase to the war.</p><p>Last
week Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had vowed to hit back at the US were it to enter the
war. “The Americans should know that any US military intervention will
undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage,” he said.</p><p>Only
on Saturday the Houthi group in Yemen - staunch Iranian allies - had threatened
to attack US ships transiting through the Red Sea if America entered the war.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks in a televised message following the Israeli strikes, in Tehran, Iran, June 18" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 800w" width="1000" height="563"/></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks in a televised message following the Israeli strikes in Tehran on June 18</p></figcaption></figure>
