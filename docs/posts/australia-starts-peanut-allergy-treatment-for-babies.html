    <h1>Australia starts peanut allergy treatment for babies</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>Babies with peanut allergies in Australia will be offered treatment to build immunity to the potentially life-threatening condition, under a world-first programme.<!-- --></p><p>Supervised by select paediatric hospitals, eligible babies will be given gradually increasing doses of peanut powder each day for at least two years, to reduce sensitivity.<!-- --></p><p>Oral immunotherapy has been available in clinical trials and some specialist allergy centres around the globe, but this is the first time it has ever been adopted as a national model of care for peanut allergies.<!-- --></p><p>Australia is often dubbed the &#34;allergy capital of the world&#34;, with one in 10 infants diagnosed with food sensitivities.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Peanut allergy affects about 3% of Australians at 12 months old and – unlike other food allergies – few children outgrow it, making it the most common food allergy among school-aged children.<!-- --></p><p>“[This] might be the game changer we have all wanted to stop this terrible allergy in its tracks,” Assistant Minister for Health Ged Kearney said.<!-- --></p><p>The free programme is only available to children under 12 months who have already been diagnosed with a peanut allergy and are receiving care at one of ten participating hospitals across the country.<!-- --></p><p>The dosing schedule will be carefully calculated for each child, until they reach a “maintenance dose” which they will remain on for two years, programme lead Tim Brettig told the BBC.<!-- --></p><p>Some children may experience side effects including an allergic reaction, but for most children in this age group they are mild and do not require treatment, he said.<!-- --></p><p>The aim is to raise their tolerance threshold and lower the risk - and anxiety - posed by exposure to peanuts, with results measured by a food allergy test at the end of the treatment.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;In some cases, [the threshold] might be so high that they can eat peanut in their diet freely, for others it might raise it to a level where accidental exposures wouldn&#39;t result in an allergic reaction.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>“Ultimately, we want to change the trajectory of allergic disease in Australia so that more children can go to school without the risk of a life-threatening peanut reaction,&#34; said Professor Kirsten Perrett, Director of the National Allergy Centre of Excellence (NACE). <!-- --></p><p>NACE will evaluate the programme for both effectiveness and safety with the hope of extending it to more hospitals, and potentially other food allergies.<!-- --></p><p>However, doctors have stressed that families should not try oral immunotherapy at home unsupervised.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s definitely not a programme for everybody,&#34; Dr Brettig said.<!-- --></p></div></div>
