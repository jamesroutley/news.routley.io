    <h1>Ask HN: What’s the deal with random people sending me money over PayPal?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>From time to time I get emails from PayPal stating that someone sent me a small amount of money (always an odd number, between 5 and 21 Euro), and that I should register to claim this amount.</p><p>It is obviously a scam, because</p><p>- I don’t know the senders</p><p>- It’s to an email address I no longer use and that gets spammed frequently</p><p>- It’s from a PayPal affiliate in the country of the email domain (I no longer live there)</p><p>What is the game here? Is it to confirm my email address is real? Will they claim the money back? Or would I become a money laundering mule when they ask me to send the money back to a different account? I just can’t come up with anything that sounds remotely profitable to me.</p></div></div></div>
