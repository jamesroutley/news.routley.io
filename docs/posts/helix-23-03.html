<p>Helix is a modal text editor with built-in support for multiple selections,
Language Server Protocol (LSP), tree-sitter, and experimental support for Debug
Adapter Protocol (DAP).</p>
<p>Today marks the 23.03 release. First, a big <em>thank you</em> to everyone involved!
This release includes changes from 102 contributors. Today&#39;s release brings
some especially useful and exciting features, so let&#39;s jump right in.</p>
<h2 id="soft-wrap">Soft-wrap</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/softwrap.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>Soft-wrap breaks up lines to fit in view without inserting actual line break
characters into the text (so called &#34;hard-wrapping&#34;). This can be useful for
reading and editing documentation or code with especially long lines. Enable
soft-wrap in your config with the <code>editor.soft-wrap.enable</code> key:</p>
<pre data-lang="toml"><code data-lang="toml"><span># ~/.config/helix/config.toml
</span><span>[editor.soft-wrap]
</span><span>enable </span><span>= </span><span>true
</span></code></pre>
<p>Heuristics for where to break lines and the wrap indicator may also be
<a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/configuration.html#editorsoft-wrap-section">configured</a>.</p>
<p>Soft-wrap is the first feature implemented on top of a new &#34;virtual text&#34; API
within the Helix codebase. The virtual text API allows us to decorate and
manipulate the actual text in a document without disturbing positioning and
modifications. The virtual text API opens the door for many new exciting
features like the inlay hints we&#39;ll see next.</p>
<h2 id="inlay-hints">Inlay hints</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/inlay-hints.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>Inlay hints are a new feature in the latest LSP specification. Language servers
can provide editors with hints to show in a document. In the example above,
rust-analyzer provides type hints for variables and intermediary expressions
as well as parameter names in function calls.</p>
<p>Inlay hints can be enabled in your config with the <code>lsp.display-inlay-hints</code>
key.</p>
<h2 id="initial-support-for-snippets">Initial support for snippets</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/snippets.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>LSP snippets are a way for language servers to provide more complex completions
for an editor. Language servers can specify where to place cursors within a
completion (tabstops), placeholder values and more. Helix now has initial
support for LSP completions, leaving more advanced snippet features like
virtual placeholders, multiple tabstops, and variable substitutions for future
work.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-workspace-symbol-picker">Dynamic workspace symbol picker</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/dynamic-workspace-symbol-picker.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>The workspace symbol picker (<code>&lt;space&gt;S</code>) is an LSP-driven feature for looking
up a symbol in a project. Large projects might have many symbols, though, so
this symbol picker typically wouldn&#39;t load them all at once. The workspace
symbol picker has been reworked in this release though to dynamically
re-request symbols with a new query as you type in the picker. This lets the
language server narrow down the number of symbols and only tell Helix about the
ones relevant to the search. This rework fixes compatibility with some language
servers which returned empty symbols with no query (<code>gopls</code>, <code>pyright</code>,
<code>clangd</code>) or limited results (<code>rust-analyzer</code>).</p>
<p>The &#34;dynamic picker&#34; introduced in this refactor may benefit other pickers in
the future, for example allowing the global search picker (<code>&lt;space&gt;/</code>) to
update on-the-fly as you change the query.</p>
<h2 id="version-control-head-statusline-element">Version control HEAD statusline element</h2>
<asciinema-player src="/vcs-statusline-element.cast" cols="94" rows="25"></asciinema-player>
<p>A new statusline element has been added which displays the version control
HEAD. Add this to your statusline by introducing the <code>&#34;version-control&#34;</code>
element in the
<a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/configuration.html#editorstatusline-section"><code>editor.statusline</code></a>
section of your config for the <code>left</code>, <code>center</code> or <code>right</code> sides.</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-keyboard-protocol">Enhanced keyboard protocol</h2>
<p>Support for the <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/">enhanced keyboard protocol</a> is now enabled. Terminals that
support the protocol (Kitty, WezTerm) can now send unambiguous keycodes to
Helix, enabling key combinations that weren&#39;t possible to bind before like
<code>C-/</code>, <code>C-h</code> or <code>S-backspace</code>. This functionality works out-of-the-box for
terminals that support the protocol.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-directory-refactor">Runtime directory refactor</h2>
<p>Helix keeps files like tree-sitter parsers and queries, themes and the tutor
file in a special &#34;runtime&#34; directory. This directory is typically installed
by your package manager and shouldn&#39;t be modified by hand. Multiple runtime
directories are now supported, so you can keep the runtime files installed by
your package manager unchanged while adding new tree-sitter parsers and
queries to a local runtime directory. On Unix systems you can add files to the
<code>~/.config/helix/runtime</code> directory which take precedence over the runtime
directory installed by a package manager.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>These flashy features are just the tip of the iceberg though. Check out the
23.03 <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2303-2023-03-31">changelog</a> for the full details on all of the changes in this release.</p>
