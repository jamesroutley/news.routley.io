    <h1>Ask HN: Why do some people not communicate clearly?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This is something that&#39;s bothering me from time to time, so I&#39;m interested in knowing if others are struggling with it as well.</p><p>It seems to me there are some people (my experience is with SWEs but probably not limited to that) that:</p><p>- don&#39;t directly address the point of your question / provide a much complex answer (or even worse, a non-answer) to a simple question</p><p>- don&#39;t stay focused to the point of the discussion</p><p>- don&#39;t have some level of clarity in their train of thought and speech</p><p>- generally over-complicate matters by wandering off to other related subjects and extending the scope of the discussion</p><p>In such cases I find it hard to have technical discussions at the point where I&#39;m frustrated thinking of all the pointlessly-spent energy required to have those discussions the first place.</p><p>Anyone else feeling like this at work? Why do you think this happens? Is it an intentional choice to communicate like this, is it lack of some skill (on theirs or on my part) or something else?</p><p>P.S. Apologies for this rant (that probably lacks clarity as well)</p><p>---</p><p>EDIT: Fixed title and some missing words (oh the irony).</p></div></div></div>
