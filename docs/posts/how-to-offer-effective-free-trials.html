    <h1>How to offer effective free trials</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="trial to paid" src="https://upollo.ai/assets/images/trial-to-paid-defe515a338963f6a718e5e35ec5cccc.png" width="2400" height="1350"/></p><p>If you could increase the conversion rate of your free trials by 10%,
how much of a difference would that make? For most companies, even a 5%
boost in their trial-to-paid conversion rate would transform their
business.</p><p>The problem is figuring out how to do that. What defaults should you
use? How should you design your trials? There are so many small
decisions that can make a big impact.</p><p>To help, we created a cheat sheet on how to offer an effective free
trial so you don&#39;t have to A/B test until you&#39;re sick of hearing the
first two letters of the alphabet.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="credit card or no credit card" src="https://upollo.ai/assets/images/credit-card-or-not-68cdab34ddf1c4b3ac8e8aaa65fc5dbf.png" width="2400" height="1350"/></p><h2 id="to-require-a-credit-card-or-to-not-require-a-credit-card">To require a credit card or to not require a credit card?<a href="#to-require-a-credit-card-or-to-not-require-a-credit-card" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The big debate when it comes to free trials is whether to require a
credit card to access your trial. Companies and experts often go back
and forth on the merits of both options. Here are our thoughts:</p><p><strong>Requiring a credit card</strong></p><ul><li><p>Increases the number of people who convert at the end of the trial</p></li><li><p>Reduces the number of people who sign-up for the trial</p></li><li><p>Reduces the amount you spend on free trials for those without buyer intent</p></li><li><p>Trial participants are only those truly interested in your product</p></li><li><p>You&#39;re better able to identify those who have already done a trial</p></li><li><p>Some forget to cancel the trial and could file a chargeback</p></li></ul><p><strong>Not requiring a credit card</strong></p><ul><li><p>Increases the number of people who sign up for your trial</p></li><li><p>Reduces the number of people who convert</p></li><li><p>Increases the costs of your free trial program</p></li><li><p>Trial participants might not be very invested in your product</p></li><li><p>It&#39;s easier for users to get multiple free trials rather than signing up</p></li></ul><p>Some argue that since you can get more people to try your product by not
requiring a credit card, you could potentially still convert enough to
come out ahead. However, that&#39;s not always the case and whether that
strategy makes sense might depend on your product.</p><p>For example, some free trials are expensive for companies to offer. If
you&#39;re giving out trials to a significant mass of people who aren&#39;t
exhibiting buying intent, you could be greatly increasing your customer
acquisition costs and the number of months it will take to start
generating income off that new subscriber.</p><p>If that customer churns before you hit that magic breakeven point,
you&#39;ll have lost money on that customer. You also don&#39;t want to just
pour people into your trial funnel. The number of users that take part
in trials doesn&#39;t matter to your bottom line. The percentage of people
that convert does.</p><p>If you have a small market and you encourage people into the trial when
they don&#39;t have a buying mindset, you&#39;re also going to potentially burn
through prospects that might have converted at a time they were more
invested in finding a solution.</p><p>A free tier can be a great alternative to capture the wider audience
without requiring a credit card, but have the higher rate of conversion
from a credit card gated trial.</p><p>For most businesses, requiring credit cards is a key part of effective
trials.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="different trial lengths" src="https://upollo.ai/assets/images/trial-length-f1496d647033c269fd7d7f0b5dc879c4.png" width="2400" height="1350"/></p><h2 id="choose-the-right-free-trial-length">Choose the right free trial length<a href="#choose-the-right-free-trial-length" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Choosing the length of your trial seems easy. Just do the same as your
competitors! The industry standard knows best, right? But there is no
one size fits all for free trials.</p><p><strong>Your product&#39;s time-to-value</strong></p><p>Each product has a different time-to-value. The goal of your trial is
not just to get users to understand the value of your service but to
feel that it&#39;s so valuable that it&#39;s worth paying for. With some
services, that takes a bit longer than with others.</p><p>A music streaming service, for example, gives users immediate value on
their trial. However, a workflow app for teams requires a company&#39;s
staff to onboard onto it, learn the system, and figure out how to make
it fit into their workflow? That takes more than a week.</p><p>Also, your competitors might not know best. Or your product might have
functionalities that distinguish your solution from theirs and require a
bit longer to fully understand and use.</p><p>Similarly, if you have a number of tiers for your trial or if your trial
is focused around moving current users to a higher tier, you might need
to give your users long enough to become so dependent on those features
they can&#39;t imagine giving them up.</p><p><strong>Testing different lengths</strong></p><p>The good news is that you can test different trial lengths and see if
they have an impact on conversion. To decide which trial lengths to try,
spend some time thinking like a user. What will their use look like?
What steps will they need to take to get to the point where they&#39;re
getting value from your product?</p><p>If your product requires a user to complete a lot of steps to understand
it&#39;s full value, you can offer trials where the user gets extra time if
they complete certain trial milestones. You might offer an additional
week if they invite someone from their team to use it or a few days
extra if they import their data. This can be a great way to ensure users
are getting the most out of their trial and doing things that optimize
them to convert at the end.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="incontext upgrade" src="https://upollo.ai/assets/images/incontext-upgrades-cb370118556f672e96aa52a43867b778.png" width="2400" height="1350"/></p><h2 id="showcase-tiered-features-in-your-trial">Showcase tiered features in your trial<a href="#showcase-tiered-features-in-your-trial" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Whether you&#39;re trying to upsell a current paying user to a higher tier
or trying to onboard a new user, your higher tiered features should be
the stars of your free trial.</p><p><strong>Before your trial even begins</strong></p><p>If your product offers a free tier, this should start before the free
trial even begins. Current users should be able to see the buttons for
the higher-tiered features they can&#39;t access. Your UI and site flow
should clearly indicate that these are higher tiered features and what
they do.</p><p>When users hover over them, they should be told how the feature works,
its benefits, and what kinds of users like them. For example, a career
networking site like LinkedIn might offer tiered features for high
volume users like recruiters. In this case, your copy would talk about
how certain upper tier features are particularly valuable for companies
recruiting over 20 people a year on the platform.</p><p>If users click on these features, they should see in context information
and benefits and be immediately able to sign up for a free trial to try
them out. Here you could break down how much the higher tier costs per
new employee when companies recruit 20 new staffers via the platform
versus how much time it saves for recruiters.</p><p><strong>During the trial</strong></p><p>During a trial, you should also clearly distinguish which features are
at a higher tier in the UI. When a user first uses a higher tier
feature, you could tell them with a pop-up, too. This allows users to
test and know which features they won&#39;t have access to after the trial
is over. If they love those features, they&#39;ll be aware that the only way
to keep them is to move to a higher tier.</p><h2 id="be-meticulous-about-your-copy">Be meticulous about your copy<a href="#be-meticulous-about-your-copy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Copy matters a lot in trial conversion.</p><p>A trial is, essentially, a storytelling process. You are telling your
users about your product and how it could improve their lives. You need
effective and succinct copy that shows why your product&#39;s features will
improve their lives. You also need to teach them how to use it and help
them if they&#39;re struggling to figure that out.</p><p>Here are some things that can help on both those counts:</p><ul><li><p>Explain your features and their purpose during your onboarding tutorial</p></li><li><p>Give examples for who the features benefit most when they first try them</p></li><li><p>Help them imagine how they will use your higher-tier feature by linking to blog posts or case studies showing how others have used that feature</p></li><li><p>Automate a drip campaign during their free trial with emails coming from key people from your company educating them about features or offering to answer any questions they have</p></li><li><p>Send them messages via email, in-product, and through other channels when they complete key trial milestones</p></li><li><p>Send them a reminder when their trial is almost over. If you can easily integrate their user data with this automated email, personalize this email so it talks about the product features they used most. This notification also helps you avoid chargebacks since they get notified before they are charged</p></li><li><p>Allow them to convert midway through their trial with a funnel page giving them a discount if they pay for the first period in a lump sum</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="repeated trials" src="https://upollo.ai/assets/images/already-done-a-trial-dc003d4cb7e8ff9ce38c0600e6bdc728.png" width="2400" height="1350"/></p><h2 id="catch-the-people-attempting-a-second-trial">Catch the people attempting a second trial<a href="#catch-the-people-attempting-a-second-trial" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Given that 10% of people trialing any product have done the free trial
previously, most people have double trialed a product at some point in
their lives. Some are frequent triple trialers. Rather than see this as
a problem, we see it as an opportunity.</p><p><strong>Repeat trialers represent your next conversions</strong></p><p>The only people willing to go through the trouble of creating a new
email address or listing someone else&#39;s address just to get another
trial, are people who love your product. They&#39;re a great population to
market to because they&#39;re already fans. In fact, they&#39;re more likely to
convert if you ask them the right way.</p><p>That&#39;s right, we think that repeat trialers can be an area of growth for
your business. By identifying them with products like Upollo, you can
then send them an offer designed to (finally) convert them. For example,
you could offer them a discount on their first few months.</p><p>With 10% of users trying your product already fans, if you could
increase your conversion of that group by just a few percentage points,
that would make a huge impact on your revenue.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions<a href="#conclusions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Effective trials are an art and a science. While some A/B testing is
critical to ensure that yours are optimized, creating a smart free trial
strategy is the most effective way to optimize your conversion rate.
That involves paying careful attention to things like your trial length,
how you highlight your features, and how you message your users during
the trial.</p><p>It also means catching repeat trialers and sweetening the deal to
convert them. Upollo can help you find those repeat trialers and turn
them into happy paying customers. And we can do it in as little as three
lines of code. Curious? Sign up for our beta and start converting more
