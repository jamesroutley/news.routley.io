(a “Clearing Bank”), Members FDIC. Within two business days, funds are transferred to a disbursement account at a Brex Treasury Third-Party Service Provider (the “Settlement Account”), and then swept automatically into omnibus deposit accounts established by Brex Treasury in its name on behalf of Brex Treasury customers at Brex&#39;s designated partner banks. Only the first $250,000 in combined deposits at any partner bank will be subject to FDIC coverage. FDIC coverage does not apply to deposits while at the Clearing Bank or any account at an intermediary depositary institution. Deposits that are in the Settlement Account while in the process of being swept to or from a partner bank will be subject to FDIC coverage of up to $250,000 per customer (combined with any other customer deposits at the bank holding the Settlement Account).</p><p>This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities, or to open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Brex Treasury LLC is not registered.</p><p>*Note: Your account earns yield on an annual basis. The figure shown here is an estimate of the annualized yield based on the average performance of the past 7 days. Yield is variable and fluctuates as market conditions change.
