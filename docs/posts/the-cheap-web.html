          <h2>cheap ≠ free</h2>
          <p>Making nice things is difficult and time-consuming.</p>
          <p>
            If we want people to make nice things for us, we have to pay for
            their rent and grocery bills and raw materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are spending less than
            <a href="https://taylor.town/dollar-per-hour">$1 per hour</a> on
            your entertainment (podcasts, videos, articles, games, books, etc.),
            consider finding ways to support creators and the infrastructure
            that supports them.

            Unfortunately, the HTML source for
            <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a> is not so &#34;beautiful
            on the inside&#34;, but Apple engineers shouldn&#39;t be faulted for ugly
            HTML. Their only option was to wrap a sleek skin around shoddy

            HTML/CSS should evoke feelings of sculpting with digital concrete,
            but it feels more like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_bridge">building bridges with uncooked pasta</a>. The whole digital design landscape is begging for simple markup
            languages that can participate in honest architecture.

            can&#39;t expose their brick-and-wood architecture because it&#39;s actually
            Megablocks and sawdust underneath all that paint.

            <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch">mechanical watch demo</a>
            is proof that honest software is viable. Each guide is erected as a
            giant wall of WebGL. It&#39;s beautiful, but definitely not sleek.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World Wide Web needn&#39;t be all 3D WebGL wizardry. The websites of

          <p>
            Computers are really good at finding and storing things, so why is
            much of the internet broken and/or missing?

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Spam:</strong> Corporations and computers manufacture crap
              at scale, then
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">exploit</a>
              (and often pay) Google to overwhelm independent search results.

            <li>
              <strong>Javascript:</strong> Modern websites are built with more
              JS (dynamic) than HTML (static), and dynamic content is difficult
              for computers to read. Imagine ordering <em>The Hobbit</em> and
              unexpectedly receiving a N64 cartridge with an e-book on it. A
              book is simple and unchanging. A N64 cartridge requires (1) a
              working N64, (2) a compatible television, (3) knowledge of how to
              use/repair the equipment, (4) knowledge of how to use the
              cartridge, and (5) time/energy to load the cartridge and navigate
              menus. Hodgepodge cartridges do not scale. To keep HTML
              competitive with JS, we need better tooling. Some HTML resources
              are listed on the side of this webpage. To supplant JS, the HTML
              development experience must become 10x easier/faster/cheaper/etc
              than the current JS experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Images:</strong> HTML is more sustainable than JS, but
              HTML remains hostile to beginners. Without an easy markup
              language, people use Powerpoint/Photoshop to share documents. It&#39;s
              hard for computers to decipher/archive images, and it only becomes
              harder as fewer photocopies-of-photocopies survive. We need
              something powerful like HTML/CSS, yet simple like Markdown.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> HTML is generally unkind to people
              of limited hearing, vision, etc. By default, stuff on the cheap
              web should work flexibly with many interfaces.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect">Everybody benefits from curb cuts.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payments:</strong> Browsers could have implemented digital
              wallets to manage subscriptions and one-click payments, but
              consumers had to wait for Amazon and Apple to launch proprietary
              solutions to public platform problems. Payments were difficult, so
              nobody paid for things. Advertising became the default way to
              sustainably make money; piracy became the default way to guard
              one&#39;s attention/privacy. To escape from this advertising
              hellscape, we must make online payments better for developers and
              consumers, especially for digital goods.

            <li>
              <strong>Arbitrary Addresses:</strong> The modern internet works
              much like Amazon&#39;s delivery network. Amazon can deliver stuff in
              its warehouses quickly, but one must wait longer to get products
              directly from suppliers. But digital goods needn&#39;t come from a
              supplier nor the closest distribution center. All internet data
              can be sent and received faster by copying data from neighbors!
              Cryptographers
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">invented magic</a>
              to do exactly this, but it&#39;s not being used at all layers of our
              digital infrastructure. To get mainstream adoption at the www.*
              level, we need
              <a href="https://brave.com/ipfs-support/">more browser support</a>
              and killer apps (an
              <a href="https://imgur.com">imgur</a> alternative seems like a
              good candidate).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platforms:</strong> Nobody owns email or podcasts (RSS),
              and everybody benefits tremendously from that freedom and
              flexibility. Corporations like Slack, Twitter, Visa, Zoom, Google,
              Amazon, Instagram, Unity, YouTube, and GoDaddy retain control over
              infrastructure that needn&#39;t be controlled at all. To escape
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>
              cycles, we need open protocols and designers to make nice
              interfaces for those protocols. Federated services like Mastadon
              are promising.
