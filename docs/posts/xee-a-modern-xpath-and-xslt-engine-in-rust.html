    <h1>Xee: A Modern XPath and XSLT Engine in Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            
            
            <p>For the last two years I&#39;ve been working on a programming language
implementation in Rust named Xee. Xee stands for &#34;XML Execution Engine&#34; and
it supports modern versions of XPath and XSLT. Those are programming languages,
and yes, that&#39;s XML stuff.</p>
<p>Now hold on. Your brain might shut down when I talk about XML. I totally get
that XML may not be your cup of tea. But I&#39;m also going to be talking about a
strange different world of technology where everything is specified, and the
implementation of a programming language using Rust, so I hope you still decide
to read on if those topics could interest you.</p>
<p>And if XML <em>does</em> happen to be your cup of tea, I think you should be excited
about Xee, as I think it can help secure a better future for XML technologies.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://github.com/Paligo/xee">Xee repository</a>.</p>
<p>There are two highlights: a command-line tool
<a href="https://github.com/Paligo/xee/?tab=readme-ov-file#obtaining-the-xee-commandline-tool"><code>xee</code></a>
that lets you do XPath queries, and a Rust library
<a href="https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/"><code>xee-xpath</code></a> to issue XPath
queries from Rust.</p>
<h2 id="genesis"><a href="#genesis" aria-label="Anchor link for: genesis"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Genesis</h2>
<p>In 2023 I was asked by <a href="https://paligo.net/">Paligo</a>, my amazing and generous
client, whether I wanted to implement a modern version of XPath and XSLT in
Rust. I felt extremely nervous for a week. Then I told them that this was a big
project. I told them that I could do it and I was excited to do it, but it was
going to be a <em>lot</em> of work.</p>
<p>And although I was right to be very intimidated by the scope, I <em>still</em>
underestimated the effort at the time.</p>
<p>But Xee has come a long way nonetheless! I&#39;m going to take you along on its
journey if you&#39;re willing to follow.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-xee"><a href="#what-is-xee" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-is-xee"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
What is Xee?</h2>
<p>Xee is a programming language implementation. It implements two core XML
programming languages: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a> and,
partially at the time of writing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>.
XPath is an XML query language, and XSLT is a language that uses XPath as its
expression language which lets you transform XML documents into other
documents. Xee implements <em>modern</em> versions of these specifications, rather
than the versions released in 1999.</p>
<p>Xee implements these languages in the Rust programming language. This brings
modern XML technology not just to Rust. Rust is a systems programming language
and is good at integration with other programming languages. So Xee can bring
its capabilities to other programming languages as well, from PHP to Python.
I&#39;ve already experimented with <a href="https://github.com/Paligo/xee-php">PHP
bindings</a>.</p>
<p>Since Xee is written in Rust, it should also be possible to compile the Xee
interpreter to WASM and run this stuff in the browser.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll continue to talk about how Xee is implemented later, but first we&#39;ll take
a break and share some XML history.</p>
<h2 id="xml-history"><a href="#xml-history" aria-label="Anchor link for: xml-history"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
XML history</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s talk a bit about XML. XML emerged in the late 90s, and though it may be
difficult to believe now, for a while in the early part of the 2000s, XML was a
cool technology everyone wanted to use. There was much excitement in the form
of industry activity and many computer science papers were also published.</p>
<p>To illustrate how big this was, last year I was at the RustNL conference and I
spoke to <em>two separate speakers</em> who mentioned they had worked on an XSLT
engine in the past. One of them was <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/">Niko
Matsakis</a>, Rust core developer.</p>
<p>So me being a young and hip developer back then , I was doing cool XML
stuff too. My biggest accomplishment in the XML space was the creation of
<a href="https://lxml.de/">lxml</a>, the XML library for Python. I started that project in
late 2004. Early on <a href="http://consulting.behnel.de/index.en.html">Stefan Behnel</a>
joined the project and he has competently maintained it ever since - it would
not have been as successful without him.</p>
<p>While XML technology isn&#39;t cool anymore today, it&#39;s still everywhere. The core
language web browsers use is not XML but its close cousin HTML. Embedded in
HTML are true XML-based languages, such as SVG and MathML. Even though JSON and
other languages took a large chunk out of it, XML is still used to store and
transmit a lot of data, and it&#39;s extensively used for documents as well, in
formats such as docbook and JATS. XML is now niche technology, but it&#39;s a
bigger niche than you might think, and it&#39;s not going to go away any time soon.</p>
<p>In my own career, I became less and less involved with XML over time, though
I&#39;d still run into it on a regular basis. It&#39;s both amusing and useful that
whenever I talk to a potential client that uses Python, they&#39;re already using
lxml somewhere.</p>
<p>A few years ago I entered back into the XML world. And here I am, that
relatively rare bird who knows a fancy modern programming language like Rust,
and is at the same time very familiar with XML.</p>
<h2 id="xpath-and-xslt-are-programming-languages"><a href="#xpath-and-xslt-are-programming-languages" aria-label="Anchor link for: xpath-and-xslt-are-programming-languages"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
XPath and XSLT are programming languages</h2>
<p>So XPath and XSLT are both programming languages.</p>
<p>XPath is a query language for XML. Given an XML document, let&#39;s say something
like HTML, you can query it with expressions like: <code>/html/body//p</code> to get all
<code>p</code> elements inside the <code>body</code> element of the outer <code>html</code> element. XPath in
its modern incarnation is a functional programming language with a type system,
variables, function definition, conditionals, loops and so on.</p>
<p>XSLT is a transformation language for XML. It describes, using templates and a
functional approach, how to transform an XML document of one type into another.
You can for instance use it to transform docbook XML, which describes
documents, into HTML. It builds on XPath - XPath expressions are the expression
language of XSLT. XSLT itself <em>also</em> supports programming constructs like
variables, loops, conditionals, functions and the like, in a partial
duplication of XPath.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-the-xml-open-source-stack"><a href="#state-of-the-xml-open-source-stack" aria-label="Anchor link for: state-of-the-xml-open-source-stack"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
State of the XML open source stack</h2>
<p>So if you want to use these programming languages and you use an open source
stack, where do you go?</p>
<p>The Java world has good modern XPath and XSLT support. XPath and XSLT are
implemented by Saxon, which has been around for a long time. Saxon is available
on .NET as well. There are also PHP and Python bindings via a rather complex C
to Java bridge, and Saxon offers a JavaScript reimplemention of its runtime as
well. Besides its open source offerings, Saxon also has closed-source
professional/enterprise editions which provide more features. Besides Saxon,
there are also open source XQuery implementations in Java.</p>
<p>But if you step out of the Java world and its periphery, and if you look in
your average open source stack or Linux distribution for an XPath or XSLT
implementation you don&#39;t find Saxon or these XQuery databases; you find
<code>libxml2</code> and <code>libxslt</code>.</p>
<p><code>libxml2</code> and <code>libxslt</code> are C libraries for handling XML. This amalgam of
libraries supports parsing XML, querying it using XPath, transforming it using
XSLT and more. <code>libxml2</code> is everywhere - in your Linux distribution and in
MacOS. People don&#39;t just use it from C code - for Python for instance I built
<code>lxml</code> on top.</p>
<p>These libraries were originally created by <a href="http://veillard.com/">Daniel
Veillard</a>. I remember speaking to him once, many years
ago. We came from different worlds - he was thinking about writing fast
processor-cache friendly code in C, whereas I was interested in an easy to use
API in Python. I was impressed he had implemented all these specifications -
<code>lxml</code> was merely piggybacking on that hard work.</p>
<p>But <code>libxml2</code> is stuck in the past - it implements XPath, but only XPath 1.0,
and similarly <code>libxslt</code> implements XSLT 1.0 only. These are specifications from
1999. The XPath 2 specification was released in 2007, and we&#39;re currently
actually at XPath 3.1, released in 2017. Similarly XSLT 2.0 was released in
2007 and XSLT 3.0, the current version, in 2017.</p>
<p>My hope is that Xee can be a more modern alternative to <code>libxml2</code> and <code>libxslt</code>
that finds its home in the open source world. For XPath and XSLT to be thriving
standards they need multiple implementations, in multiple programming
languages, by multiple parties.</p>
<p>And personally I feel like I have come full circle - finally, in these latter
days of XML, I am where Daniel Veillard had gone ages before with <code>libxml2</code>. I
find myself implementing the same stuff, not in C, but still in a systems
programming language, Rust.</p>
<h2 id="specification-culture"><a href="#specification-culture" aria-label="Anchor link for: specification-culture"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Specification culture</h2>
<p>I was at <a href="https://www.xmlprague.cz">XML Prague</a>, an XML conference, last year,
and I noticed something interesting about XML culture. It is still very
standards focused. This was a very prevalent attitude in the web development
world in the early 2000s, but I think that although standards are still
considered important today, they&#39;re less culturally prominent.</p>
<p>The XML culture is different: stuff needs to be specified. If it&#39;s not in a
specification it&#39;s not fully <em>real</em>. This makes the XML community move more
slowly than the rest of the software community. I was somewhat bemused to hear
talk in 2024 about updating the RESTXQ spec, an XQuery based web framework
standard, first discussed in 2012, to make use of language features like
hashmaps and arrays, now that they had been finally added to XPath/XQuery in
2017.</p>
<p>These XML specifications go deep, they build on each other, they are solid. If
you value solid foundations that will stand the test of time, the XML world has
got your back.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-a-programming-language"><a href="#implementing-a-programming-language" aria-label="Anchor link for: implementing-a-programming-language"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Implementing a programming language</h2>
<p>You might be bored with XML by now so before I return to the discussion of
specifications, I will talk a bit about the architecture of Xee.</p>
<p>Xee follows various familiar patterns in the implementation of programming
languages. I based part of its architecture on the excellent book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting
Interpreters</a>.</p>
<p>In Xee, XPath gets lexed into tokens, then parsed into an abstract syntax tree
(AST). The AST is then transformed into an intermediate representation (IR)
that represents the expression in a more compact way. This IR is then compiled
into bytecode - a simple assembly-language like stack machine, similar to the
one that underlies many programming languages such as Python and Java. The Xee
interpreter can then execute the bytecode.</p>
<p>This translation at present is straightforward; while I&#39;ve prepared the IR to
support optimization passes such as constant folding and the like, this doesn&#39;t
happen yet.</p>
<p>XSLT, though unfinished, is built on the same architecture as the XPath engine.
There&#39;s a frontend that transforms XSLT XML into an XSLT AST, and then this is
transformed into the same IR as the one used for XPath. It uses the same
bytecode intepreter. So, only the XSLT frontend is different, everything else
is the same. This made it easy to implement a whole bunch of XSLT features as I
had already implemented them for XPath.</p>
<p>Implementing programming languages is fun!</p>
<h2 id="specifications-again"><a href="#specifications-again" aria-label="Anchor link for: specifications-again"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Specifications, again</h2>
<p>XPath and XSLT are programming languages that are fully specified. You can
really implement them from the specification. On the one hand this makes life a
lot easier - the goals are clear as it&#39;s clearly specified how things are
supposed to work. There&#39;s a vast conformance test suite available as well. On
the other hand this means an endless treadmill; I can&#39;t just stop when I think
it looks good enough when there&#39;s more specification left to implement.</p>
<p>XPath 3.1 has grown a <em>lot</em> bigger than XPath 1.0; it became a full-fledged
programming language, with a much larger standard library. XSLT 3.0 has also
evolved a lot since XSLT 1.0. Specifications keep building on each other, and
add more features in new updates, until implementing them becomes a daunting
task. I sometimes I wish I was implementing XPath 1.0 and XSLT 1.0, like Daniel
Veillard back in the day.</p>
<p>Let me give you a quick tour of various specifications so you can understand
something about the magnitude of the task of implementing them.</p>
<p>The grammar and behavior of the XPath language is laid out in the W3C
specification <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/">XML Xpath Language (XPath)
3.1</a>. This refers to another specification,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel-31/">XQuery and XPath Data Model 3.1</a>
which describes how XPath views XML data - what properties of XML data exist.
It also builds on another specification <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/">XPath and XQuery Functions and
Operators 3.1</a>, which not only
describes the behavior of XPath operators such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> and <code>*</code>, but also
defines its standard library of functions.</p>
<p>XPath has a type system, and its types are described by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/">W3C XML Schema
Definition Language (XSD) 1.1: Part 1:
Structures</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/">W3C XML Schema
Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2:
Datatypes</a>. This defines atomic types
(which Xee implements) but also lets you define new types and use types from an
XML schema, which Xee doesn&#39;t implement at present. These specifications also
describe how XPath is to parse and format strings of atomic types, such as the
format of decimals and dates.</p>
<p>Oh, and that XPath functions and operators specification? Some of the functions
use regular expressions. The specification defines XPath regular expressions as
an extension of the regular expressions system defined in the XML schema
specification. And all of that builds on the unicode specification but that&#39;s
another country. So I ended up implementing <a href="https://github.com/Paligo/regexml/">a regex
engine</a> too.</p>
<p>Over to XSLT. There&#39;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version
3.0</a> which defines the XSLT programming
language. It builds on all the specifications that went before, and also builds
on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization-30/">XSLT and XQuery Serialization
3.0</a>, which describes
options for how to serialize XML and various other things.</p>
<p>Of course all of this builds on the XML specification itself, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">Extensive Markup
Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)</a>, extended with
namespaces, in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML 1.0</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are a few stray specifications that are also relevant like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/">XML
Base</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">xml:id</a>. But those are small ones.</p>
<p>Once I counted up the page count of just the XPath and XSLT
specifications along with the most relevant XML Schema spec (part 2), and that
subset is over 1800 pages.</p>
<p>I probably forgot a few specifications, because after a while they start coming
out of my ears, but this should give you an impression.</p>
<h2 id="xee-status"><a href="#xee-status" aria-label="Anchor link for: xee-status"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Xee status</h2>
<p>What I&#39;m most proud of is the XPath 3.1 implementation in Xee. The XPath core
language and most of its standard library have been implemented. There are gaps
in the standard library implementation still - some formatting functions are
particularly huge, for instance, but overall it&#39;s pretty complete.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an XPath 3.1 conformance test suite, and of the 21859 tests, 20130
tests are passing at the time of writing. Most of the failing tests have to do
with the implementation of missing standard library functionality.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this test suite runs those 20130 tests in 13 seconds on my
machine. Computers are fast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Xee also provides a solid basis for XSLT, reusing a lot of the XPath
infrastructure. While a lot of XSLT works, much remains to be done and I&#39;m
hoping to find people who want to help contribute!</p>
<h2 id="a-call-for-contributors"><a href="#a-call-for-contributors" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-call-for-contributors"><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
A call for contributors</h2>
<p>So now I will call for this rare bird: someone who read all this, saw all those
XML specifications, knows a bit of Rust, likes implementing programming
languages and thought: cool! I want to help!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you like the challenge of implementing some functionality, small or large,
according to spec? Xee has plenty of tasks for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you interested in programming language implementation? Perhaps do cool
programming language optimization work? For a programming language that has
an existing user base already? Xee has the foundations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you like to think about query optimization problems? Care about using
<a href="https://blog.startifact.com/posts/succinct/">succinct</a> data structures? (not
integrated into Xee proper yet). We have plenty of what should interest you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you care about the future of XML and want to ensure a modern open source
implementation is available outside of the Java world?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Xee project could use your help and is ready for it. Small and large
contributions are possible and welcome!</p>
