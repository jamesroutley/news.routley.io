The cells also surpassed 1,000 cycles while retaining 93% of their capacity.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">The achievement shattered the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) goal of achieving 80% charge in 15 minutes.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Other goals for USABC at the cell level include a usable energy density of 550 Wh/L, a survival temperature range of </span><span data-contrast="auto">-40 to +66 degrees C, and a cost of $75/kWh at an annual output volume of 250,000 units.

The cells contain a 100% active silicon anode. Enovix said the material has long been heralded as an important technology in the next generation of battery anodes. </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Silicon anodes can theoretically store more than twice as much lithium than the graphite anode that is used in nearly all Li-ion batteries today (1800mAh/cubic centimeter vs. 800mAh/cubic centimeter).</span></p><figure id="attachment_79606"><img loading="lazy" src="https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/41871776-16243519993926451_origin-600x251.png" alt="" width="600" height="251" srcset="https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/41871776-16243519993926451_origin-600x251.png 600w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/41871776-16243519993926451_origin-1200x502.png 1200w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/41871776-16243519993926451_origin-1536x643.png 1536w, https://l0dl1j3lc42iebd82042pgl2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/41871776-16243519993926451_origin-2048x857.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"/><figcaption><i> Image: Enovix </i></figcaption></figure><p><span data-contrast="auto">“Fast charge capability can accelerate mass adoption of EVs and we’ve been able to demonstrate a level of performance that meets and exceeds many OEM roadmaps,” said Harrold Rust, co-founder, CEO and president of Enovix. “EV manufacturers are in pursuit of batteries that support longer range, while the public and private sectors work to increase EV driver access to fast chargers. We’re proud to support these goals to help electrify the automotive industry and demonstrate our batteries are an exciting option to power long-range, fast-charging EVs.”</span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Silicon’s high energy density, however, creates four significant technical problems that Enovix has addressed with its technology:</span></p><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" data-list-defn-props="{&#34;335552541&#34;:1,&#34;335559683&#34;:0,&#34;335559684&#34;:-2,&#34;335559685&#34;:720,&#34;335559991&#34;:360,&#34;469769226&#34;:&#34;Symbol&#34;,&#34;469769242&#34;:[8226],&#34;469777803&#34;:&#34;left&#34;,&#34;469777804&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;469777815&#34;:&#34;hybridMultilevel&#34;}" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">First Charge Expansion: The cells have a stainless-steel constraint system surrounding it that limits the battery from swelling.
