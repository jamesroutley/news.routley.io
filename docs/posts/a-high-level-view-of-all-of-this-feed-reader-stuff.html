    <h1>A high-level view of all of this feed reader stuff</h1>
    
    
<p>
Yeah, I know, it&#39;s another post about feed reader stuff.  I figured 
people are probably wondering what the results have been looking like.  
I also wanted to see things in aggregate, and fixing my
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/06/24/fs/">mistakes</a>
turned out to really need a &#34;30,000 foot view&#34; approach.
</p>
<p>
So, here&#39;s a screen shot of the top third of my admin tool with the 
unique keys removed to give a taste of what we&#39;ve all been collectively 
finding out.
</p>

<p>
This is showing the number of requests, how many were conditional or 
not, which ones presented a good If-Modified-Since value, one that was 
out of sequence (&#34;oos&#34;), or made up entirely.  Then it does the same 
three counters for If-None-Match values.
</p>
<p>
Next up are the counters for cookies, referrers and query parameters 
which were needlessly presented for whatever reason, and finally it&#39;s 
whether the requests are showing up over IPv4 or IPv6.
</p>
<p>
I mostly rigged it this way so I could watch the &#34;ims bogus&#34; counts drop 
out as I fixed each set of entries in the database.  (What a mess.)
</p>
<p>
There are more than a few keys which were issued but haven&#39;t been used, 
and that&#39;s what those grey rows are in the table.  Even with that 
reduction, it still goes on much too far to present as a single screen 
shot - there are a *lot* of people taking part in this thing.
</p>
<p>
So, what can we learn from this view?  The first row was just me running 
tests, so I deliberately tripped a bunch of badness to make it show up 
in the reports.  Then there are a few boring ones which were more tests 
from me, and then it starts getting into actual programs.
</p>
<p>
See the one with 256 hits and 256 unconditional requests?  That&#39;d be the
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/06/24/feed/">&#34;leaked to the clown&#34;</a>
situation from the other day.  They&#39;re still showing up over and over to 
fetch that thing.
</p>
<p>
How about the one with 1258 bogus IMS values?  That&#39;d be a feed reader 
which is sending the feed update time, not the Last-Modified time.  
That&#39;s a nasty one since it looks conditional, but in practice it is 
not.  Every one of those requests gets the full feed shipped out.  (This 
is a rather popular program, so there are lots of these things hitting 
the real site all day every day.  Groan.)
</p>
<p>
The really interesting parts of this are the ones which are consistently 
sending out-of-sequence If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match values.  Out 
of sequence in this context means &#34;they&#39;re sending a value, but it&#39;s an 
old one, not the most recent one served to them on their last hit&#34;.  It 
seems we have managed to trip a LOT of caching bugs in these programs.  
They latch in some bad state, and just keep going like this forever.  
Not good!
</p>
<p>
One thing that has been gratifying about this is when feed reader 
authors have changed something in their code and then reached out to me 
for a fresh key.  That lets them start from scratch with their new 
behavior and leave the old one behind.  I&#39;m always happy when this 
happens.
</p>
<p>
This also adds a new dimension that I&#39;ll have to start tracking, now 
that we have tests ending and others coming in to replace them: 
staleness.  I&#39;ll only be looking at things which are still actively 
checking in so as not to penalize anyone who&#39;s improved their stuff.  We 
will leave the old behaviors behind and focus on what&#39;s current.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s the best you can hope for: a series of improvements.
