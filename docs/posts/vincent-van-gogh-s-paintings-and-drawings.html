<h2 id="disclaimer-mostly-insight-free-zone-below">Disclaimer: Mostly insight free zone below</h2>
<p>I started this thinking I would be able to draw out some useful insights and reflections on my time at RC...but apparently all Iâ€™m up to is listing what Iâ€™ve done during my final day...</p>
<h2 id="final-day-at-rc">Final day at RC</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meditation, nice camaraderie and solidarity from the others about never graduating today</li>
<li>Check-ins</li>
<li>Writing a presentation on translating index co-ordinates to Cartesian co-ordinates<ul>
<li>Getting seriously distracted by pre-emptive half-thoughts on how I&#39;m feeling about never graduating<ul>
<li>Realising that I have serious gaps in understanding how I translated between these two co-ordinate systems (NB, look into linear transformations)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lovely coffee chat with <a href="https://jeffzh4ng.com/index.html">Jeff Zhang</a></li>
<li>Ordered Julia Evansâ€™ new zine, <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/integers-floats/">How Integers and Floats Work</a></li>
<li>Presentation writing<ul>
<li>Rehearsing presentation, realising Iâ€™m way over five minutes<ul>
<li>Presentation re-writing<ul>
<li>Running out of time to finish presentation re-writing <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup><ul>
<li>Giving presentation<ul>
<li>Running over my five minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Really enjoying watching everyone elseâ€™s presentations</li>
<li>Niceties ðŸ’–</li>
<li>Writing this with the aim of doing some â€˜reflectionâ€™ but itâ€™s just a list of things Iâ€™ve done today ðŸ˜‚</li>
</ul>

<li id="fn-1"><p>A lot of the work stemmed from repeatedly forgetting and then going back to re-apply the lessons from <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei">David Tufte&#39;s <em>Envisioning Information</em></a>. Even with the re-working I had the nagging feeling that there must be cleaner and more impactful way to visually describe transforming between index co-ordinates and Cartesian co-ordinates. One for a future blog post maybe.<a href="#fnref-1">â†©</a></p></li>
