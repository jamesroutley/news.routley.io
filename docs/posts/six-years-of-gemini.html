    <h1>Six Years of Gemini</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	
	<p>Today is the sixth anniversary of the public announcement of Project Gemini!
	</p><p>It&#39;s been a quiet year at geminiprotocol.net thus far.  I&#39;ve let two &#34;Apollo days&#34; slip by without a word.  I&#39;m about as disappointed in myself for this as I expect many folks are unsurprised by it.  I do still have plans and clear ideas for finalising the minor oustanding spec issues.  I&#39;d tell people to look forward to something by Apollo 15 day (2025-11-03), but at this point, who&#39;d believe me?  Well, let&#39;s see.
	</p><p>I&#39;ll stick to my promise from last year&#39;s anniversary announcement of discontinuing the previously traditional report of Geminispace size statistics: endless growth is not and never was a goal of the project, so there&#39;s little sense in continuing to do this.  In case anybody thinks this is just a high-minded way to disguise the first set of disappointing numbers, I did check and in fact almost all of them have gone up a little, so there.
	</p><p>I might have been idle of late, but not everybody in the community has been.  I continue to receive, and to apply, patches to the geminiprotocol.net repository correcting errors in the official documentation or adding translations of into diverse languages, and I continue to be very grateful for these generous contributions of time and energy.  The same is true, of course, for all those folks who continue to keep search engines, aggregators, multi-user hosting services and more up and running, year after year.  Thank you all!
