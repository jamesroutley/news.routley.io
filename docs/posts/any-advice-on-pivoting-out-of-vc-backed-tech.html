    <h1>Ask HN: Any advice on pivoting out of VC-backed tech?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m exploring moving away from work with VC-backed B2B SaaS startups and towards working with B2C businesses on Main Street.</p><p>For anyone else who&#39;s felt inclined to make a similar pivot - any advice? Particularly when it comes to remaining challenged, informed, and translating valuable hype-cycle concepts to people who don&#39;t care about hype.</p><p>While it&#39;s interesting to play with shiny toys, helping investors make money by creating products related to the hype-cycle de jour that get used by other B2B SaaS companies just feels soulless.</p><p>(My background is in GTM systems and data analytics mostly, but I think the question applies to anyone)</p></div></div></div>
