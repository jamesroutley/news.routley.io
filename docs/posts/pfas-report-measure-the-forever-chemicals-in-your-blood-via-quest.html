   Up until now, it&#39;s been hard to get your blood tested for PFAS contamination. You either have to find a lab that tests individuals, or convince a doctor to test for you. Most doctors don&#39;t even know the proper test codes. <span>PFAS.report</span> allows you to test yourself.

      <p>This is a standard PFAS exposure monitoring panel that detects the following:</p>

      <p>Currently, no. When you go to Quest Diagnostics, make sure you select &#34;No Insurance&#34; when checking in at the kiosk. It&#39;s possible you can submit this test for insurance reimbursement after the fact but we make no guarantees it will work.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>This test takes 2-3 weeks from the time blood is drawn to the results. Your results will be emailed to you. Processing times may vary due to testing volume.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Last year, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) released a report establishing a standard reference range for Total PFAS blood level. The full report is available <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK584705/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Full report of PFAS medical guidance">here</a>.</p>

          If your results come back elevated for any PFAS, you should consider consulting an attorney. PFAS are not natural compounds, do not belong in your body, and a positive blood test may entitle you to <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/federal-judges-ruling-allows-class-action-suit-against-pfas-makers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Legal rights">certain legal rights</a> for remedy in the United States. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Total PFAS blood level is &gt;2 ng/mL, you should also talk with a doctor to determine if additional health screenings are warranted. PFAS have been linked to certain cancers, <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2023/exposure-to-chemicals-found-in-everyday-products-is-linked-to-significantly-reduced-fertility#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPFAS%20can%20disrupt%20our%20reproductive,syndrome%20in%20few%20previous%20studies" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Fertility issues">fertility issues</a> and elevated cholesterol in humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exposure to PFAS typically occurs from contaminated drinking water, consumption of contaminated foods, or repetitive use of products containing PFAS. You can view EPA&#39;s water contamination map <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ItJdY/7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="EPA map">here</a>.  If your community is listed, consider having your tap water tested by an <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/pfas/docs/pfas-laboratories.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Accredited labs">EPA-accredited lab</a> and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/reducing-pfas-drinking-water-treatment-technologies" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Water treatment technologies">filtering</a> the source.

      <p>There are currently over 4,000 PFAS-like compounds in use on the market today. While this test only detects six, these are the most persistent and harmful of the class. A negative test does not preclude the presence of other PFAS compounds in your blood, however it does rule out your exposure to these six.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><span>PFAS.report</span> uses NMS Labs via Quest, which utilizes blood serum sampling. It has a detection threshold of 0.1 ng/ml and is the most accurate test on the market. Capillary blood testing from other companies is notoriously less reliable, particularly at lower reference ranges.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Lab requisitions ordered through <span>PFAS.report</span> are non-refundable. It is up to the individual user to schedule their appointment and have their blood drawn in a timely manner at an eligible Quest Diagnostics Patient Testing Center.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Lab requisitions expire within six months of their generation date.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>If, due to technical error or a clerical mistake, a user fails to receive their original lab requisition, <span>PFAS.report</span> will generate a new order upon request. Contact support@pfas.report.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>If there’s sufficient demand, yes.</p>
