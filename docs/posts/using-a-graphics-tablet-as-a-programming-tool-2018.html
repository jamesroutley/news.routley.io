    <h1>Using a graphics tablet as a programming tool (2018)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>I&#39;ve been meaning to share this tip for a while. About one year ago, I discovered a software called <a href="https://github.com/serge-rgb/milton" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Milton</a>. It&#39;s a drawing application that lets you draw on an infinite canvas with an amazing zooming function. It&#39;s incredibly fast and the interface doesn&#39;t get in your way. It turns out it&#39;s really useful for taking notes or thinking about how to solve problems visually.</p><p>Here is a snapshot of a small portion of the notes I took while working on my game <a href="http://rashtal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rashtal</a>:</p><p><img alt="img" src="https://jeandavidmoisan.com/posts/using-a-graphics-tablet-as-a-programming-tool/milton-01.png"/></p><p>To take notes easily, I have the Wacom Bamboo as my graphics tablet. If you don&#39;t have a graphics tablet yet, I&#39;d suggest getting one. Even the cheapest one should do the job perfectly.</p><p>Before using Milton, I would use a pen and paper, but for some complex algorithms, I find the infinite canvas to be much easier to work with. Once I&#39;ve been working on a project for a while, the canvas starts to look really impressive.</p><p>I find that being able to see all the notes I&#39;ve taken since starting to work on a project really helps me stay motivated. Sometimes I can spend days barely writing any lines of code but then I look at my notes and I can see my thought process and all the planning I went through. Even the simplest lines of code can take a long time to figure out and I tend to forget that.</p><hr/><p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and good luck with your algorithm planning!</p></main></div></div>
