<p>Months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/quake-remaster-owners-should-go-download-its-free-next-gen-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FPS classic <em>Quake</em> got a major 25th anniversary re-release</a>, its modern handlers have returned with an update that exceeds all expectations. <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/3rYFUPEADaMtS2W4WBLui9/quake-update-2-release-notes-december-2">Thursday&#39;s new 770MB patch</a> on all platforms (<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/quake/9p1z43krnqd4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA01880_00-PROJECTSILVER000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/quake-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/QUAKE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>) adds an entirely new co-op combat mode, and it officially opens the game&#39;s mod floodgates for players outside the PC ecosystem.
</p><p>The uncreatively named &#34;Horde&#34; mode works much like a mode of the same name in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/gears-5-review-an-obvious-gaming-recommendation-if-you-already-paid-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gears of War</em></a>. Instead of progressing through a level from start to finish, players are expected to hunker down inside a somewhat circular arena and then contend with hundreds of enemies spawning from all sides. Kill a full &#34;wave&#34; of foes, and your team will get a moment to breathe, replenish health and ammo (or argue over who gets to use it), and do it all over again.</p>

<p>For the sake of <em>Quake</em>&#39;s first-ever official co-op mode (beyond the campaign, which always supported co-op as an option), Bethesda support studio MachineGames has whipped up four brand-new battling arenas, which are pictured above. Each includes at least one &#34;silver key&#34; door, which is full of more powerful weapons and is gated until players earn a key by defeating a tougher &#34;boss wave&#34; of foes. Get through nine enemy waves, and your team gets a &#34;gold key.&#34; You can either exit the level at that point or stay and keep fighting increasingly tough foes until your team dies. (If you&#39;re hunting for in-game achievements or trophies, Bethesda hasn&#39;t updated <em>Quake</em> with any new ones for Horde, if that changes whether your team uses the gold key or not.)</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The results aren&#39;t as complex as newer stabs at the Horde concept, and MachineGames didn&#39;t add complicated systems like the ability to build turrets, barriers, or other implements of survival. But as an excuse to distill the OG <em>Quake</em> experience and fast forward you and some friends into high-speed combat, it works fantastically—and it&#39;s hard to knock as a freebie.</p>

<p>The other major addition in this week&#39;s patch is the first full-blown &#34;add-on&#34; built into the <em>Quake</em> menu system. Bethesda teased this feature at launch with &#34;<em>Quake 64</em>,&#34; which tweaked the maps, changed the game&#39;s music, and added an N64-like blur filter to better resemble the original game&#39;s N64 port. This week&#39;s addition is much more full-fledged: it&#39;s <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/honey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the beloved 2012 <em>Quake</em> mod &#34;Honey,&#34;</a> made by a modder who was eventually hired by MachineGames. As part of this week&#39;s release, Bethesda also released <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/7L0viRtSdoqdKXvtmeEjEu/nods-to-mods-interview-honey-quake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with said modder, Christian &#34;czg&#34; Grawert</a>, who confirms that the studio has hosted weekly <em>Quake 1</em> modding challenges among its devs—and that these eventually led to the contents of the new level pack included in the <em>Quake 1</em> re-release in August.</p>
<p>Honey became <a href="https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/honey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quaddicted&#39;s highest-rated mod over the years</a> for good reason, and it&#39;s a good kickoff to <em>Quake</em>&#39;s new &#34;add-on&#34; menu. id Software and Bethesda have already been filling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/bethesda-removes-classic-doom-games-from-xbox-one-store-to-sell-a-new-package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Doom 1</em> and <em>Doom 2</em> re-releases</a> with a variety of community-made mods, all free as part of both games, with a somewhat regular cadence of free updates there. Based on how <em>Quake</em>&#39;s menu structure resembles that of <em>Doom</em> and <em>Doom 2</em>, we believe the same will come to <em>Quake</em>—and are stoked to see quality map packs breaking out of the PC ecosystem on consoles like PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox.</p>
