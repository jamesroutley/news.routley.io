    <h1>F*: A proof oriented general purpose programming language</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="intro">
  
  <hr/>

  <p>
  F* (pronounced <it>F star</it>) is a general-purpose proof-oriented
  programming language, supporting both purely functional and
  effectful programming. It combines the expressive power of dependent
  types with proof automation based on SMT solving and tactic-based
  interactive theorem proving.
  </p><p>
  F* programs compile, by default, to OCaml. Various fragments of F*
  can also be extracted to F#, to C or Wasm by a tool
  called <a href="https://github.com/FStarLang/karamel">KaRaMeL</a>,
  or to assembly using
  the <a href="https://github.com/project-everest/vale">Vale</a>
  toolchain. F* is implemented in F* and bootstrapped using OCaml. 
  </p><p>
  F* is open source on <a href="http://github.com/FStarLang/FStar">GitHub</a> and is under 
  active development by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>, 
  <a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/">Inria</a>, and by the community.
</p></div><div id="download">
 
 <hr/><p>
  F* is distributed under the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FStarLang/FStar/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">Apache 2.0 license</a>.
  Binaries for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are posted regularly on the <a href="https://github.com/fstarlang/fstar/releases">releases page on GitHub</a>.
  You can also install F* from OPAM, Docker, Nix, or build it from sources, by following the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a>.

    F* is used in several projects in both industrial and academic settings.
    We list a few of them here. If you are using F* in your project, please
    let us know by writing to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fstar-mailing-list">fstar-mailing-list</a>.
    </p>
  <h2>Project Everest</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://project-everest.github.io">Project Everest</a> is an umbrella project that develops high-assurance
    secure communication software in F*. A big part of the development of F* has been motivated by the scenarios
    that Project Everest targets. Several offshoots from Project Everest continue as their own projects, including
    some of those listed below.
  </p><h2>HACL*, ValeCrypt, and EverCrypt</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://hacl-star.github.io/">HACL*</a> is a library of high-assurance cryptographic primitives, written in F* and extracted to C.
    <a href="https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star/tree/main/vale">ValeCrypt</a> provides formally proven implementations of cryptographic primitives in Vale, 
    a framework for verified assembly language programming embedded in F*.
    <a href="https://hacl-star.github.io/EverCryptDoc.html">EverCrypt</a> combines them into a single cryptographic provider.
    Code from these projects is now used in production in several projects,
    including <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/09/13/verified-cryptography-firefox-57/">Mozilla Firefox</a>,
    the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/0f2a4af27b649c13ba76431552fe49c60120d0f6/lib/crypto/curve25519-hacl64.c#L1">Linux kernel</a>,

  </p><h2>EverParse</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/everparse/">EverParse</a> is a parser generator for binary formats that produces C code extracted from formally proven F*.
    Parsers from EverParse are used in production in several projects, including in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/everparse-hardening-critical-attack-surfaces-with-formally-proven-message-parsers/">Windows Hyper-V</a>, 
    where every network packet passing through the Azure cloud platform is parsed and validated first by code generated by EverParse. EverParse is also used in other
    production settings, including <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows">ebpf-for-windows</a>.

    F* is an active topic of research, both in the programming languages and formal methods community, 
    as well as from an application perspective in the security and systems communities.
