    <h1>More thoughts on the 1670 modem&#39;s weird noises</h1>
    
    
<p>
I recently
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/02/28/1670/">wrote</a>
about getting a pair of VIC-20s and attached 1670 modems to connect over 
a length of line cord with nothing else in the middle.  At the end, I 
tossed out a side note about the odd noises these things make in dial 
mode.
</p>
<p>
Some readers have been asking if it could be a relay, like for pulse 
dialing, and so I figured I should try to clarify as much as I can.
</p>
<p>
First, here&#39;s a recording from the other day&#39;s shenanigans, complete 
with me bopping the keys on the less-reliable computer to make it Do 
Stuff.
</p>

<p>
For those who can&#39;t hear it for whatever reason: there&#39;s some 
background humming in the whole recording from other devices in 
the room.  But, then there&#39;s a source of white noise that&#39;s much closer 
and louder - that&#39;s the modem joining in.  It &#34;dips&#34; every now and then 
and is replaced with the &#34;pa-tink&#34; noise I mentioned and then it comes 
back up to the previous volume level.  This happens a few times, and I 
smack a key or two, and then the recording ends.
</p>
<p>
Looking in Audacity, it hits at about 1.2s, 2.4s, 3.6s, and 4.8s.  
That&#39;s curious, right?  About 1.2 seconds each time?
</p>
<p>
To be crystal clear: this is not pulse dialing.  That sounds completely 
different, and besides, I didn&#39;t tell the modem to dial anything.  I 
sent it &#34;ATD&#34; which basically means &#34;go into originate mode without 
actually trying to generate any pulse or tone signals - just grab 
the line and start listening&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Another rejected hypothesis: this is not just something broken in my 
originating test unit here.  Both of them do it when they&#39;re in that 
role.  It&#39;s also not a case of &#34;they&#39;re almost 40 years old and they 
both degraded into this state&#34;, because the original I had way back in 
1988 definitely did this, too.  That&#39;s how it got stuck in my head in 
the first place!
</p>
<p>
One thing I don&#39;t know is whether this is solely a function of the 
local speaker, or if it&#39;s actually putting that clicking onto the line.  
I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just the speaker, but I&#39;m also not feeling like 
setting up the test rig and somehow finding a way to listen to one side 
and not the other.
</p>
<p>
For whatever reason, the 1670 makes those noises when it&#39;s sitting 
there waiting for an answer tone from the other side, and I&#39;ve never 
understood why.  Obviously, at this point, it doesn&#39;t matter, but it&#39;s 
just one of life&#39;s little nerd mysteries.
