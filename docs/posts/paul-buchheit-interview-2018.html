<p><em>Paul Buchheit is an engineer and partner at Y Combinator. He was the 23rd employee at Google, where he built Gmail and the first prototype for Adsense. After leaving Google he co-founded Friendfeed, which was acquired by Facebook.</em></p>

<p><em>Triplebyte co-founder and CEO, Harj Taggar, sat down with Paul to talk about how he got started with programming, joining Google, and becoming a great engineer.</em></p>

<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<p><strong>How did you start programming?</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s when I realized wow, this is way more fun than the actual game. With games you&#39;re just trapped inside someone else&#39;s world. But with programming, you can do anything you want to the world, right? It&#39;s an open environment, and there&#39;s no limit to what you can do. From then on, video games just seemed like a pointless waste of time compared to programming.</p>

<p>I had actually first started programming maybe a year earlier. I&#39;d bought a 386 with one megabyte of memory and started playing with it. I found a text file on how to program on a BBS, along with a C compiler which halfway worked. I learned a little bit by playing with those. Later at a hamfest I found a used Turbo C 2.0 compiler for $11 which came with a manual. So now I had a working compiler and a manual, and I started bashing my head against a wall for a couple of years figuring out how it all worked. At first I didn&#39;t actually enjoy it very much, but I was stubborn and determined to figure it out.</p>

<p><strong>Did you feel like you were a good programmer when you got to college?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why did you join Intel after you graduated?</strong></p>

<p>After college I wanted to work at a startup, but didn&#39;t really know how to find one -- there wasn&#39;t much information about startups on the Internet back then. However I know that they would probably be in Silicon Valley. That&#39;s where Netscape, SGI and a bunch of these cool sounding companies all were. I took a job at Intel because they were located in Silicon Valley, and I thought it would be the best way to meet people and find a cool startup. My naive assumption was that I would bump into them on the street or something. I thought the streets of Silicon Valley would be paved in startups, or that I would meet startup people everywhere. But that never really happened.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you decide to leave Intel?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How did you find Google? What was the hiring process like back then?</strong></p>

<p>I would spend a lot of time reading Slashdot for all the latest Linux news. That was where I read about Google, which was this little startup building clusters of Linux machines! To me, what could possibly be more exciting than clusters of Linux machines? And they had a special Linux search so they would show up on Slashdot relatively often. And they had more than just the color gray—they had four colors, so I applied for a job!</p>

<p>Amusingly, my resume email actually bounced because their mail server was misconfigured! But I sent it again the next day, and by then they had fixed the MX record or whatever was wrong, and someone got back to me to setup a phone call. I did a phone screen, and then they invited me in for a day of interviews.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you decide to take the Google offer?</strong></p>

<p>Also, it was exciting, and I thought they were doing cool stuff. I didn&#39;t believe in the business or think the company would be a huge success, though. I thought they were going to be roadkill and would get squashed by one of the big internet companies. By then, Yahoo was already a behemoth, and Alta Vista had so much money. I didn&#39;t understand how this little startup would be able to compete. But I decided I didn&#39;t care. I wanted to go work on Linux stuff and figured I&#39;d at least meet some smart people there, and maybe they&#39;d later start a company that would actually be successful.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I realize the early team at Google was actually quite remarkable. I think they made a real point of hiring smart people. In part, that was because they were working on really interesting problems and smart people want to work on interesting problems. I remember Jeff Dean had gone to work at another startup before Google and immediately fixed all of their problems. When he asked, “Now what do I do?,” it turned out that they had nothing else interesting to work on, so he left. He was drawn into Google because of the interesting systems problems there.</p>

<p>It became a cycle. These smart people would bring more smart people with them and so on. I think we got the whole systems department at UCSB because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urs_H%C3%B6lzle">Urs</a> was a professor there. It was like pulling on a string of talent and getting all the talent attached to it.</p>

<p><strong>So, you thought Google would fail and be “roadkill.” When did you change your mind?</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize that Google was really taking off, though, until we did the Yahoo deal, which was after I&#39;d been there a year or so. We took the Yahoo deal away from Inktomi, which at the time was a huge high flying company. I think they were worth many billions of dollars at the time, and it was exciting to beat them. I remember they tried to downplay the loss and announced something publicly like, “This &#39;search thing&#39; isn&#39;t really great. The real money is in internet caching.”</p>

<p>After that I thought, “wow, these people are idiots, and we&#39;re going to roll over them.” From then on, we just kept winning deals and squashing other companies. That was exciting.</p>

<p><strong>How did they decide what you got to work on at Google?</strong></p>

<p>I generally had product tendencies and was always hacking things on the side and adding features to things. I actually built the first version of the “did you mean?” feature after looking through our search query logs and discovering that I&#39;m not the only person who can&#39;t spell. The quality team was working on these obscure things to improve search quality by .1% and I&#39;m thinking, “at least 20% of our queries are misspelled. If we fix the spelling, I can improve 20% of the queries!” So I hacked that together. I would hack a lot of things together like that.</p>

<p><strong>As Google grew, did you keep the freedom to hack on things you found interesting? Was creating Gmail part of that?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How did you manage your personal career progression at Google?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Why did you decide to leave Google?</strong></p>

<p>But when I went in the next day, the energy drained out of me. I suddenly felt like I used to feel working at Intel. Partially I think Google had grown so much in my absence, but it was also partly a “boiling the frog” effect: before I spent time away, I hadn&#39;t noticed things slowly changing, but when I got back I realized, “Oh wow, here I am in a meeting with a bunch of people I don&#39;t know who are telling me to do stuff that I don&#39;t care about.” I knew immediately that if I stayed at Google, and wanted to be successful and influential, I would have to become more of a big company person. I knew that I had the capacity to do that, but I didn&#39;t want to. I wanted to do something else, so I left.</p>



<p><strong>What skills and knowledge does it take to be a good engineer?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do you become a better engineer?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who are some of the best engineers you&#39;ve worked with? What made them great?</strong></p>

<p>The story about Bret I most vividly remember is from our days at Google. He wasn&#39;t even an engineer there, instead he was a product manager for some reason. As the PM on Google Maps, he was frustrated that the JavaScript was really slow. It would take forever to load. So, one weekend he said, “I&#39;m going to rewrite it”. And he rewrote the entire thing, making it 10 times as fast and a third of the size. He completely threw away the code that a team of engineers had been working on for months. Someone who can do that is ridiculous. Talk about 10x engineers. That&#39;s more like 1000x. And it&#39;s good, clean code too. Literally no number of median engineers can do that. You can give me a million median engineers and they would never be able to do that. They would just make a huge mess.</p>

<p>Craig Silverstein was another, he was the very first Google employee. He is someone who types and programs faster than I can perceive what he&#39;s doing. Sometimes I like to watch other engineers work so I can learn how they do things. But with Craig he moved too fast for that. The screen would flicker and code would just appear. He&#39;d constantly be flipping buffers in Emacs or whatever. He types so fast. I&#39;ve never seen anyone else that fast.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think every good engineer currently working at Google, Facebook, or Apple should quit to join a startup?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Alright. Who should and who shouldn&#39;t?</strong></p>

<p>I feel the need to preface that any generalization about joining startups is basically wrong because startups have tremendously high variance. Most startups are s**t. There&#39;s a few of them that are really exceptional, and if you land at an exceptional one, you can do really well. If you randomly pick something, you&#39;ll probably have a bad time.</p>

<p><strong>If the hours and the pay are worse, what are the benefits of working at a startup?</strong></p>

<p>Gmail is an example of this. I was 24 years old at the time, and I&#39;d never completed a project of that scale or built anything like that before. Google today would never give that project to a relatively inexperienced 24 year old. But at a startup you can end up getting a project that a more mature company would give to a more experienced engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Today, the big technology companies are paying engineers a lot more money than Intel was when you left for Google. How should that fact affect an engineer&#39;s decision to join a startup?</strong></p>

<p>I would suggest thinking about joining a startup as more like going to grad school to learn. Optimize around learning when choosing a job. That&#39;s the best thing. Then if a startup fails, you can always go back to Google and probably get paid a lot more, because now you&#39;re actually a much better engineer than you would have been if you had stayed there like everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>If you&#39;re thinking about joining a startup, how do you tell if the founders are like Larry and Sergey or if they&#39;re an Elizabeth Holmes?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Generally, when you are interviewing with a startup, how should you decide if it is the right company for you?</strong></p>

<p>Their questions required being able to think at all these different levels: “Is there something going on in the kernel? Do you understand that hard drives are not these magical things which spit out information? Do you know why random access takes time?”</p>

<p>I only interviewed at one other company and they asked stupid questions like, “name the seven layers of the OSI Networking Stack,” or something that you&#39;d pull out of a textbook, not things that were actually interesting.</p>

<p>Also, when I first went to work at Google, I had the opposite feeling I described having at Intel. I was excited. I woke up in the morning and was excited to go to work. There was this buzz of productivity in the office all the time. I think that&#39;s one way to know if a startup is doing well: When you go into their office, you can just tell. Are people busy working, or are they sitting around on Twitter wasting time? Are people showing up because they have to, or are they eagerly working because they&#39;re excited? Google was a really energizing place to be back then.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think being an engineer made you a better investor?</strong></p>

<p>I do think that the ability to break problems down into smaller pieces helps in a lot of areas. Certainly, as an investor, you need to be able to evaluate people and call them on their shit. Especially with technical things, someone who doesn&#39;t have a technical background can&#39;t really evaluate well. If someone says that something is easy to do or hard to do, a person without tech skills will just have to take their word for it.</p>

<p><strong>You joined Google because you were deeply interested in Linux. Is there a technology you&#39;re equally excited about today?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is college useful?</strong></p>

<p>By the time I got to college, I&#39;d already had my first job programming. I was working with a friend of my father who did machine repair, programming an industrial robot that would pick metal rods out of a hopper and put them into a grinder. I learned a lot doing that, but I didn&#39;t really know anyone who could program. It was exciting to meet people who could program well in college because I could learn from them.</p>

<p><strong>Why isn&#39;t everyone happy all the time?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ok that&#39;s everything, thanks Paul!</strong></p>
