<p>EasyOS ships as a .img file, that is written to a drive. Barry stopped shipping EasyOS as an
      ISO file from early 2020. This was a controversial decision. Barry
      will continue the rest of this page writing in the first-person.<br/>
</p>
<p>When I first wrote this page, in December 2021, I was reacting to 
emails that I had received. Quite incredible emails; one guy told me it 
is not my fault, I am showing the signs of early dementia!<br/>
</p>
<p>My reaction below, is somewhat confronting, but it represents my mood
 at the time. Revising this page in November 2022, I decided to leave 
that text as-is...<br/>
</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p>I maintain that the ISO format has &#34;had it&#39;s day&#34; and needs to be
      retired. Furthermore, I claim that the image format is simpler and
      easier to use; however, some Linux &#34;old timers&#34; claim the
      opposite.
    </p>
<p>I saw their entrenched obstinacy as akin to my elderly
      step-mother sticking with audio cassettes and keyboard flip phone.
      So finally, in December 2021, I decided to clarify my claim in a
      blog post:</p>
    <p><b><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://bkhome.org/news/202112/why-iso-was-retired.html">https://bkhome.org/news/202112/why-iso-was-retired.html</a></b></p>
    <p>I also started a thread on the Puppy Forum for feedback, and as a
      consequence wrote a follow-up blog post:</p>
    <p><b><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://bkhome.org/news/202112/why-iso-was-retired-part-2.html">https://bkhome.org/news/202112/why-iso-was-retired-part-2.html</a></b></p>
    <p>If anyone reading this feels that they would like to contribute
      an opinion, here is the forum thread:</p>
    <p><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?t=4690">http://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?t=4690</a></p>
    <p>However, please do not just post your pre-conceived prejudices
      and narrow understanding.</p>
    <p>Misunderstandings are OK, as long as the person is willing to
      learn.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>For example, someone sent me an email yesterday (December 26,
      2021) asking if they needed to format the usb stick with an ext3
      or ext4 partition before writing the &#39;easy-3.1.17-amd64.img.gz&#39;
      (latest release at time of writing) file to the drive. I replied
      that it doesn&#39;t matter what is on the drive beforehand, just use
      Etcher or easydd or some other tool that will write the image file
      to the usb-stick, then boot from the stick and you are good-to-go.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A note to anyone reading this, who needs help on how to use
        tools like Etcher or easydd, see this page:</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That person was willing to learn and did follow my instructions.
      Unlike the entrenched &#34;pro ISO&#34; elderly Linux users, who just &#34;dig
      their heels in&#34; and re-state their fossilized opinions.</p>
    <p>I will make one more statement. I received an email recently, the
      person stated that they understood ISOs and just didn&#39;t want to
      have to learn something different. This attitude is common among
      the elderly Linux users. The funny thing is, there isn&#39;t much to
      learn to make the switch to image format. The one area of
      difficulty is opening up an image file if one wants to extract the
      contents (vmlinuz, initrd, easy.sfs); however, that difficulty
      only applies to legacy Linux distributions, not to EasyOS.<br/>
</p>
<hr size="2"/>
<p>Fast forward to November 2022, editing this page, I will add a more 
fundamental reason why I don&#39;t want to release EasyOS on an ISO anymore:
 it undermines what Easy is all about.</p>
<p>What I mean by that, is all of the documentation about Easy, and the 
features of Easy, are based on the layout of a boot-partition and a 
working-partition, whether it be in a USB-stick or installed in internal
 partitions.<br/>
</p>
<p>If there was a live-CD, I would have to put in conditions throughout 
the documentation, like &#34;except that you cannot do that if booted from a
 live-CD&#34;. The behaviour having booted from a live-CD is very different,
 and it adds up to a maintenance overhead, meaning it takes up my time.<br/>
</p>
<p>There are only so many hours in the day. I have a tendency to get 
enthusiatic about something new, then get burnt out and have to wind 
back. Easy is, essentially, a one-person project, and I have to remain 
focussed on what is really needed.
