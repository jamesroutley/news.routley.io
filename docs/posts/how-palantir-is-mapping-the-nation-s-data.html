    <h1>How Palantir is mapping the nation’s data</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When the U.S. government signs contracts with private technology companies, the fine print rarely reaches the public. <a href="https://www.palantir.com/">Palantir Technologies</a>, however, has attracted more and more attention over the past decade because of the size and scope of its contracts with the government. </p>

<p>Palantir’s two main platforms are Foundry and Gotham. Each does different things. Foundry is used by corporations in the private sector to help with global operations. Gotham is marketed as an “<a href="https://www.palantir.com/platforms/gotham/">operating system for global decision making</a>” and is primarily used by governments.</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JnTFiOQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a researcher</a> who studies the intersection of data governance, digital technologies and the U.S. federal government. I’m observing how the government is increasingly <a href="https://theconversation.com/from-help-to-harm-how-the-government-is-quietly-repurposing-everyones-data-for-surveillance-254690">pulling together data from various sources</a>, and the political and social consequences of combining those data sources. Palantir’s work with the federal government using the Gotham platform is amplifying this process.</p>

<p>Gotham is an investigative platform built for police, national security agencies, public health departments and other state clients. Its purpose is deceptively simple: take whatever data an agency already has, break it down into its smallest components and then connect the dots. Gotham is not simply a database. It takes fragmented data, scattered across various agencies and stored in different formats, and transforms it <a href="https://assets.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-14/documents/92736/801146272055049-service-definition-document-2024-11-26-1253.pdf">into a unified, searchable web</a>.</p>

<p>The stakes are high with Palantir’s Gotham platform. The software enables law enforcement and government analysts to connect vast, disparate datasets, build intelligence profiles and search for individuals based on characteristics as granular as a tattoo or an immigration status. It transforms <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/revealed-this-is-palantirs-top-secret-user-manual-for-cops/">historically static records</a> – think department of motor vehicles files, police reports and subpoenaed social media data like location history and private messages – into a fluid web of intelligence and surveillance.</p>

<p>These departments and agencies use Palantir’s platform to assemble <a href="https://epic.org/epic-settles-ice-lawsuit-about-palantir-and-profiling/">detailed profiles of individuals</a>, mapping their social networks, tracking their movements, identifying their physical characteristics and reviewing their criminal history. This can involve mapping a suspected <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/how-a-tech-firm-brought-data-and-worry-to-new-orleans-crime-fighting/article_33b8bf05-722f-5163-9a0c-774aa69b6645.html">gang member’s network</a> using arrest logs and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/drive-los-angeles-police-track-every-move/">license plate reader data</a>, or flagging individuals in a specific region with a particular immigration status.</p>

<p>The efficiency the platform enables is undeniable. For investigators, what once required weeks of cross-checking siloed systems can now be done in hours or less. But by scaling up the government’s investigative capacity, Gotham also alters the relationship between the state and the people it governs.</p>

<h2>Shifting the balance of power</h2>

<p>The political ramifications of Palantir’s rise come into focus when you consider its influence and reach across the government. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement alone has <a href="https://fedscoop.com/dhs-renews-software-contract-with-palantir-for-investigative-case-management-services">spent more than US$200 million</a> on Palantir contracts, relying on the software to run its <a href="https://fedscoop.com/dhs-renews-software-contract-with-palantir-for-investigative-case-management-services">Investigative Case Management system</a> and to integrate travel histories, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/">visa records</a>, biometric data and social media data. </p>

<p>The Department of Defense has awarded Palantir billion-dollar contracts to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/palantir-lands-10-billion-army-software-and-data-contract.html">support battlefield intelligence</a> and AI-driven analysis. Even domestic agencies like the <a href="https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/press-releases/palantir-expands-longstanding-cdc-partnership-for-disease-monitoring-and/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html">Internal Revenue Service</a>, and local police departments like the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/palantir-contract-dispute-exposes-nypds-lack-transparency">New York Police Department</a>, have contracted with Palantir for data integration projects.</p>

<p>These integrations mean that Palantir is not just a vendor of software; it is becoming a partner in how the federal government organizes and acts on information. That creates a kind of dependency. The same private company helps define how investigations are conducted, how targets are prioritized, how algorithms work and how decisions are justified.</p>

<p>Because Gotham is proprietary, the public, and even elected officials, cannot see how its algorithms weigh certain data points or why they highlight certain connections. Yet, the conclusions it generates can have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-what-the-company-does/">life-altering consequences</a>: inclusion on a deportation list or identification as a security risk. The opacity makes democratic oversight difficult, and the system’s broad scope and wide deployment means that mistakes or biases can scale up rapidly to affect many people.</p>

<h2>Beyond law enforcement</h2>

<p>Supporters of Palantir’s work argue that it modernizes outdated government IT systems, bringing them closer to the kind of integrated analytics that are routine in the private sector. However, the political and social stakes are different in public governance. Centralized, attribute-based searching, whether by location, immigration status, tattoos or affiliations, creates the capacity for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0306396810377002">mass profiling</a>.</p>

<p>In the wrong hands, or even in well-intentioned hands under shifting political conditions, this kind of system could normalize surveillance of entire communities. And the criteria that trigger scrutiny today could be expanded tomorrow.</p>

<p>U.S. history provides warning examples: <a href="https://time.com/6097712/muslim-american-surveillance-supreme-court-sept-11/">The mass surveillance of Muslim communities after 9/11</a>, the targeting <a href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/fbi">of civil rights activists in the 1960s</a> and the <a href="https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-surveillance-security-privacy/chpt/antiwar-protest-surveillance-1960s">monitoring of anti-war protesters during the Vietnam era</a> are just a few. </p>

<p>Gotham’s capabilities may enable government agencies to carry out similar operations on a much larger scale and at a faster pace. And once some form of data integration infrastructure exists, its uses <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-38619-0">tend to expand</a>, often into areas far from its original mandate. </p>

<h2>A broader shift in governance</h2>

<p>The deeper story here isn’t just that the government is collecting more data. It’s that the structure of governance is changing into a model where decision-making is increasingly influenced by what integrated data platforms reveal. In a pre-Gotham era, putting someone under suspicion of wrongdoing might have required specific evidence linked to an event or witness account. In a Gotham-enabled system, suspicion can stem from patterns in the data – patterns whose importance is defined by proprietary algorithms. </p>

<p>This level of data integration means that government officials can use potential future risks to justify present action. The predictive turn in governance aligns with a broader shift toward what some scholars call “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ips.12042">preemptive security</a>.” It is a logic that can erode <a href="https://legaltimelines.org/accessible-timeline/safeguards-of-justice/">traditional legal safeguards</a> that require proof before punishment.</p>

<h2>The stakes for democracy</h2>

<p>The partnership between Palantir and the federal government raises fundamental questions about accountability in a data-driven state. Who decides how these tools are used? Who can challenge a decision that was made by software, especially if that software is proprietary? </p>

<p>Without clear rules and independent oversight, there is a risk that Palantir’s technology becomes normalized as a default mode of governance. They could be used not only to track suspected criminals or terrorists but also to manage migration flows, monitor and suppress protests, and enforce public health measures. The concern is not that these data integration capabilities exist, but that government agencies could use them in ways that undermine civil liberties without public consent.</p>

<p>Once put in use, such systems are hard to dismantle. They create new expectations for speed and efficiency in law enforcement, making it politically costly to revert to slower, more manual processes. That inertia can lock in not only the technology but also the expanded scope of surveillance it enables.</p>

<h2>Choosing the future</h2>

<p>As Palantir deepens its government partnerships, the issues its technology raises go beyond questions of cost or efficiency. There are civil liberties implications and the potential for abuse. Will strong legal safeguards and transparent oversight constrain these tools for integrated data analysis? The answer is likely to depend on political will as much as technical design.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Palantir’s Gotham is more than just software. It represents how modern governance might function: through data, connections, continuous monitoring and control. The decisions made about its use today are likely to shape the balance between security and freedom for decades to come.</p>
