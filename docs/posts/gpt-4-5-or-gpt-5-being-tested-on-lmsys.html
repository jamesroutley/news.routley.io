<p><em>2023-04-30: the following page is a work in progress</em></p>
<h6 id="background">Background<a href="#background" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p><a href="https://chat.lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">https://chat.lmsys.org</a> enables users to chat with various LLMs and rate their output, without needing to log in. One of the models recently available is <em>gpt2-chatbot</em>, which demonstrates capability greatly beyond that of any GPT-2 model. It is available for chatting with in the &#34;Direct Chat&#34;, and also in  &#34;Arena (Battle)&#34; which is the (initially) blinded version for bench-marking. There is no information to be found on that particular model name <em>anywhere</em> on the site, or elsewhere. The results generated by LMSYS benchmarks are available via their API for all models - except for this one. The model name simply appears to be a cover for something else entirely.</p>
<h6 id="quick-rundown">Quick Rundown<a href="#quick-rundown" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<ul>
<li>gpt2-chatbot consistently claims to be &#34;based on GPT-4&#34;, and refers to itself as &#34;ChatGPT&#34; - or &#34;a ChatGPT&#34;, which is similar to how OpenAI has launched &#34;GPTs&#34; (plural) as custom assistants in their ChatGPT interface. Its instruction specifies &#34;Personality: v2&#34;.</li>
<li>The way it presents itself is distinct from the hallucinated replies from models, from other organizations, that have been trained on OpenAI-generated datasets.  </li>
<li>It uses OpenAI&#39;s tokenizer; this has been verified by testing how it is affected by some of the special tokens used by OpenAI [1]; how OpenAI models are affected by those tokens has changed since that document was released.</li>
<li>It does not appear affect to specific special tokens used by Claude/Llama/Gemini.</li>
<li>When emergency/legal-related contact information and model information is requested or demanded, it consistently provides highly detailed contact information to OpenAI. This information is much more comprehensive and accurate than what GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 provides.</li>
<li>It exhibits OpenAI-specific prompt injection vulnerabilities, and has not once claimed to belong to any other entity than OpenAI.</li>
<li>Models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google, et c consistently exhibit different output than gpt2-chatbot.</li>
<li>&#34;gpt2-chatbot&#34; is much more likely to be one of the candidates in the LMSYS battle mode than any other model; far more often than it should appear if the model selection was randomized.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="subjective-note">Subjective note<a href="#subjective-note" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>In my opinion, it is likely that this mystery model is in fact either GPT-4.5 or GPT-5.</p>
<h6 id="rationale">Rationale<a href="#rationale" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>This particular model is a &#34;stealth drop&#34; by OpenAI to benchmark their latest GPT model, without making it apparent that it&#39;s on <a href="http://lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">lmsys.org</a>. in The purpose of this would be to: a) get replies that are &#34;ordinary benchmark&#34; tests without people intentionally seeking out GPT-4.5/5, b) don&#39;t get biased ratings due to elevated expectations, which could cause people to rate it more negatively, and c) decrease the likelihood getting &#34;mass-downvoted&#34;/dog-piled by other competing entities. OpenAI would provide then provide the compute, while LMSYS simply provides the front-end for this and gain even more high-quality datasets from people using their services.</p>
<h6 id="rate-limits">Rate Limits<a href="#rate-limits" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>&#34;GPT2-chatbot&#34; does however have a rate limit that is different from the GPT-4 models, for direct chat:<br/>

<p>The full restrictions on total vs user-specific rate limits have not yet been investigated. If this daily user limit, or some other total service limit, is in fact more restrictive than for the GPT-4 models - this could of course imply that a) the model is more costly in terms of compute, and b) that the ones providing the compute prefer people to use the Arena (Battle) mode for generating benchmarks. Battle mode is what people get directed to go once they hit the daily user limit.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">chat link</a> and choose <strong>gpt2-chatbot</strong>. You can test the direct chat for 8 messages, and then switch to &#34;Battle&#34; mode and either select or re-roll model options. Feel free to click the feedback buttons; there&#39;s probably some minimal amount of ratings you need to provide, to be able to keep using that chat mode. Please note that the following error message is created by LMSYS&#39; own moderation, and is not model-specific:</p>
<p>Substantial feedback and critique is welcomed. You&#39;re encouraged to attempt to prove anything here as incorrect. </p>
<p>For all prompts you try, attempt to re-roll at least three times to get a mean impression of the model&#39;s capability. You should generally start with an empty context window, by clicking &#34;New Round&#34;.</p>
