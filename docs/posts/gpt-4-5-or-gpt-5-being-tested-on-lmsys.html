<p><em><a href="https://chat.lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">https://chat.lmsys.org</a> enables users to chat with various LLMs and rate their output, without needing to log in. One of the models recently available is </em>gpt2-chatbot<em>, which demonstrates capability greatly beyond that of any known GPT-2 model. It is available for chatting with in the &#34;Direct Chat&#34;, and also in  &#34;Arena (Battle)&#34; which is the (initially) blinded version for bench-marking. There is no information to be found on that particular model name </em>anywhere<em> on the site, or elsewhere. The results generated by LMSYS benchmarks are available via their API for all models - except for this one.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>gpt2-chatbot is a model that is capable of providing remarkably informative, rational, and relevant replies. The average output quality across many different domains places it on, at least, the same level as high-end models such as GPT-4 and Claude Opus.</li>
<li>It appears to use OpenAI&#39;s <em>tiktoken</em> tokenizer; this has been verified by comparing the effect of those special tokens on gpt2-chatbot and multiple other models, in the &#34;Special Token Usage&#34; section below).</li>
<li>Its assistant instruction has been extracted, and specifies that it&#39;s based off the GPT-4 architecture and has &#34;Personality: v2&#34;.</li>
<li>When &#34;provider&#34; contact details are demanded, it provides highly detailed contact information to OpenAI (in greater detail than GPT-3.5/4).</li>
<li>It claims to be &#34;based on GPT-4&#34;, and refers to itself as &#34;ChatGPT&#34; - or &#34;a ChatGPT&#34;. The way it presents itself is generally distinct from the hallucinated replies from other organizations&#39; models that have been trained on datasets created by OpenAI models. </li>
<li>It exhibits OpenAI-specific prompt injection vulnerabilities, and has not once claimed to belong to any other entity than OpenAI.</li>
<li>It is possible that the autobiographical information is merely a hallucination, or stem from instructions incorrectly provided to it.</li>
<li>Models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google, et c regularly provide different output than gpt2-chatbot for the same prompts.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="subjective-notes">Subjective notes<a href="#subjective-notes" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>It appears quite likely that this mystery model is an early version of GPT-4.5 (not GPT-5), as part of another line of &#34;incremental&#34; model updates from OpenAI. The quality of the output in general - in particular its formatting, verbosity, structure, and overall comprehension - is absolutely superb. Multiple individuals, with great LLM prompting and chat-bot experience, have noted unexpectedly good quality of the output (in public and in private) - and I fully agree. To me the model feels like the step from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, but instead using GPT-4 as a starting point. The model&#39;s structured replies appears to be strongly influenced by techniques such as modified CoT (Chain-of-Thought), among others. </p>
<p>There is currently no good reason to believe that that the mystery model uses some entirely new architecture. The possibility that LMSYS have set up something conceptually similar to a MoE (Mixture of Experts), acting as a router (adapter) for their connected models, has not been investigated. It is possible that LMSYS has trained a model of their own, as discussed below. The simplest explanation may be that this is the result of some kind of incorrect service configuration within LMSYS. I encourage people to remain skeptic, be aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">confirmation bias</a>, and maintain an evidence-based mindset. </p>
<p>As a result of publishing this rentry, there has been quite a bit of discussion online regarding the possible OpenAI/gpt2-chatbot connection. Earlier today, Sam Altman <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1785107943664566556" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">posted a tweet</a> that was <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/w7awhp.png" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">quickly edited</a>, which cannot reasonably be anything but a reference to the discussion. While some have considered this to be a &#34;soft endorsement&#34; of their connection to the model, I do not believe it indicates anything in particular. A vague and non-committal comment of that nature contributes to the hype, and serves their goals, regardless of whether the discussion is well-founded or not.</p>
<h6 id="possible-motivations">Possible motivations<a href="#possible-motivations" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>This particular model could be a &#34;stealth drop&#34; by OpenAI to benchmark their latest GPT model, without making it apparent that it&#39;s on <a href="http://lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">lmsys.org</a>. The purpose of this could then be to: a) get replies that are &#34;ordinary benchmark&#34; tests without people intentionally seeking out GPT-4.5/5, b) avoid ratings that may be biased due to elevated expectations, which could cause people to rate it more negatively, and to a lesser extent c) decrease the likelihood of getting &#34;mass-downvoted&#34;/dogpiled by other competing entities. OpenAI would provide provide the compute while LMSYS provides the front-end as usual, while they are provided with unusually high-quality datasets from user interaction.</p>
<h6 id="other-options">Other options<a href="#other-options" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>Something I would put in the realm of &#34;pretty much impossible&#34; rather than &#34;plausible&#34; is the notion that gpt2-chatbot could be based off the GPT-2 architecture. The main reason for even bringing this up is that a recent (April 7, 2024) article, from Meta/FAIR Labs and Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI (MBZUAI), titled <em>Physics of Language Models: Part 3.3, Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws</em> studied particulars of the GPT-2 architecture in-depth and established that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The GPT-2 architecture, with rotary embedding, matches or even surpasses LLaMA/Mistral architectures in knowledge storage, particularly over shorter training durations. This arises because LLaMA/Mistral uses GatedMLP, which is less stable and harder to train.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If LMSYS were the model creators, an application of some of the results of that article could then utilize datasets generated via LMSYS for training, among others. The model&#39;s strong tendency to &#34;identify&#34; as GPT-4 could then be explained by utilizing mainly datasets generated by GPT-4. The above connection is notable given that MBZUAI is a <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/iziql8.png" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">sponsor of LMSYS</a>, as can be seen on their webpage:</p>

<h6 id="rate-limits">Rate Limits<a href="#rate-limits" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>&#34;GPT2-chatbot&#34; does however have a rate limit that is different from the GPT-4 models, for direct chat:<br/>

</div>
<p>The full restrictions on total vs user-specific rate limits have not yet been compared. If this daily user limit, or some other total service limit, is in fact more restrictive than for the GPT-4 models - this could imply that the model is more costly in terms of compute, and that the ones providing the compute prefer users to use the Arena (Battle) mode for generating benchmarks. Battle mode is what people get directed to go once they hit the daily user limit.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">chat link</a> and choose <strong>gpt2-chatbot</strong>. You can test the direct chat for 8 messages, and then switch to &#34;Battle&#34; mode and either select or re-roll model options. Feel free to click the feedback buttons; there&#39;s probably some minimal amount of ratings you need to provide, to be able to keep using that chat mode. Note: the following error message is created by LMSYS&#39; own moderation, just like the &#34;&lt;span&gt;&#34; code displayed during text generation, and is not model-specific:</p>

<p>gpt2-chatbot appears to utilize the same special tokens as different OpenAI models, such as GPT-4, and will either a) not print, or b) have its output be interrupted when attempting to print a special token that acts as a stop token in its inference pipeline, for example:</p>
