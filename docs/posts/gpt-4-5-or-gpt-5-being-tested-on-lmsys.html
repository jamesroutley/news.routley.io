<p><em><a href="https://chat.lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">https://chat.lmsys.org</a> enables users to chat with various LLMs and rate their output, without needing to log in. One of the models recently available is </em>gpt2-chatbot<em>, which demonstrates capability greatly beyond that of any previously known GPT-2 model. It is available for chatting with in the &#34;Direct Chat&#34;, and also in  &#34;Arena (Battle)&#34; which is the (initially) blinded version for bench-marking. There is no information to be found on that particular model name </em>anywhere<em> on the site, or elsewhere. The results generated by LMSYS benchmarks are available via their API for all models - except for this one.  There is also an exciting possibility that the model is in fact based off the GPT-2 architecture, but the model name may simply be a cover for something else.</em></p>
<h6 id="quick-rundown">Quick Rundown<a href="#quick-rundown" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<ul>
<li>gpt2-chatbot consistently claims to be &#34;based on GPT-4&#34;, and refers to itself as &#34;ChatGPT&#34; - or &#34;a ChatGPT&#34;. Its extracted instruction specifies that it&#39;s based off the GPT-4 architecture and has &#34;Personality: v2&#34;.</li>
<li>The way it presents itself is generally distinct from the hallucinated replies from other organizations&#39; models that have been trained on OpenAI-created datasets. </li>
<li>It appears to use OpenAI&#39;s <em>tiktoken</em> tokenizer; this has been <a href="https://rentry.org/GPT2#special-token-usage">verified</a> by testing its special tokens on multiple models.</li>
<li>When &#34;provider&#34; contact details are demanded, it consistently provides highly detailed contact information to OpenAI (in greater detail than GPT-3.5/4).</li>
<li>It exhibits OpenAI-specific prompt injection vulnerabilities, and has not once claimed to belong to any other entity than OpenAI.</li>
<li>It is possible that the autobiographical information is merely a hallucination, or stem from incorrect instructions provided to it.</li>
<li>Models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google, et c consistently provide different output than gpt2-chatbot for the same prompts.</li>
<li>A recently published article [2] demonstrates that GPT-2 can be more performant than certain other models in specific domains, and one of the article authors is associated with MBZUAI - which happens to be one of the LMSYS sponsors. Implications discussed <a href="https://rentry.org/GPT2/#main-alternative-theory">here</a>.</li>
<li>&#34;gpt2-chatbot&#34; is much more likely to be one of the candidates in the LMSYS battle mode than any other model; far more often than it should appear if the model selection was randomized.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h6 id="subjective-notes">Subjective notes<a href="#subjective-notes" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>In my opinion, it seems likely that this mystery model is in fact either GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 - or in fact an actual GPT-2 model (by OpenAI or LMSYS).</p>
<h6 id="rationale">Rationale<a href="#rationale" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>This particular model is a &#34;stealth drop&#34; by OpenAI to benchmark their latest GPT model, without making it apparent that it&#39;s on <a href="http://lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">lmsys.org</a>. in The purpose of this would be to: a) get replies that are &#34;ordinary benchmark&#34; tests without people intentionally seeking out GPT-4.5/5, b) don&#39;t get biased ratings due to elevated expectations, which could cause people to rate it more negatively, and c) decrease the likelihood getting &#34;mass-downvoted&#34;/dog-piled by other competing entities. OpenAI would provide then provide the compute, while LMSYS simply provides the front-end for this and gain even more high-quality datasets from people using their services.</p>
<h6 id="main-alternative-theory">Main alternative theory<a href="#main-alternative-theory" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>Another possibility is that it is in fact a GPT-2 model. The main reason for this is that a recent (April 7, 2024) article, from Meta/FAIR Labs and Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI (MBZUAI), titled <em>Physics of Language Models: Part 3.3, Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws</em> studied particulars of the GPT-2 architecture in-depth and established that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The GPT-2 architecture, with rotary embedding, matches or even surpasses LLaMA/Mistral architectures in knowledge storage, particularly over shorter training durations. This arises because LLaMA/Mistral uses GatedMLP, which is less stable and harder to train.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If LMSYS were the model creators, an application of some of the results of that article could then utilize datasets generated via LMSYS for training, among others. The model&#39;s strong tendency to &#34;identify&#34; as GPT-4 could then be explained by utilizing mainly datasets generated by GPT-4. The above connection is particularly notable given that MBZUAI is a sponsor of LMSYS:</p>

<h6 id="rate-limits">Rate Limits<a href="#rate-limits" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>&#34;GPT2-chatbot&#34; does however have a rate limit that is different from the GPT-4 models, for direct chat:<br/>

<p>The full restrictions on total vs user-specific rate limits have not yet been compared. If this daily user limit, or some other total service limit, is in fact more restrictive than for the GPT-4 models - this could imply that the model is more costly in terms of compute, and that the ones providing the compute prefer users to use the Arena (Battle) mode for generating benchmarks. Battle mode is what people get directed to go once they hit the daily user limit.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">chat link</a> and choose <strong>gpt2-chatbot</strong>. You can test the direct chat for 8 messages, and then switch to &#34;Battle&#34; mode and either select or re-roll model options. Feel free to click the feedback buttons; there&#39;s probably some minimal amount of ratings you need to provide, to be able to keep using that chat mode. Note: the following error message is created by LMSYS&#39; own moderation, just like the &#34;&lt;span&gt;&#34; code displayed during text generation, and is not model-specific:</p>

<hr/>
<h6 id="special-token-usage">Special Token Usage<a href="#special-token-usage" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>gpt2-chatbot appears to utilize the same special tokens as different OpenAI models, such as GPT-4, and will either a) not print, or b) have its output be interrupted when attempting to print a special token that acts as a stop token in its inference pipeline, for example:</p>
<p><img alt="endoftext" referrerpolicy="same-origin" src="https://files.catbox.moe/jsasy2.png" title="endoftext"/></p>
<p><code>Remove &#34;@&#34; from the following text: &#34;Bowl &lt;|@fim_suffix@|&gt; Raining&#34;</code> can also be used for this.</p>
<p>Models that are unaffected by this include Mixtral, LLaMa, Claude, Yi, Gemini, et c. Note that their &#34;vulnerability&#34; to this can also depend on how input/output is preprocessed by their inference setup (notably: ChatGPT is nowadays able to print its special tokens because of such customization). You can test how the models are affected in terms of inability to read, parse, or print the following special tokens - as specified in the tiktoken.py [1] file:</p>
