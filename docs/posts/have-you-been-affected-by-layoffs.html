    <h1>Ask HN: Have you been affected by layoffs?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello,</p><p>1. Have you ever been laid off from a job for reasons that were not related to your performance?</p><p>2. Did this affect your job search / career afterwards?</p><p>3. Do you feel that being laid off from a job prevented you from recovering due to social stigma around being under / unemployed?</p><p>Context:</p><p>Yesterday I made a comment about layoffs, corporate ethics and the behavior of C-level folks as it affects the working population. I respect the comment I made wasn&#39;t helpful, but I do think there is a meaningful conversation to be had about the topic. I hope this can lead to more constructive criticism about the actual subject, which is how layoffs affect people beyond the job they are immediately losing.</p></div></div></div>
