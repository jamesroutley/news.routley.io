    <h1>MCP Security Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><div><p>Elevenlabs AudioNative Player</p></div>
<p>Been digging into Model Context Protocol implementations lately and found some stuff that&#39;s keeping me up at night. Not because it&#39;s earth-shattering, but because it&#39;s the kind of boring security debt that bites you when you least expect it.</p>
<p><em>This is Part 1 of a two-part series. <a href="https://forgecode.dev/blog/prevent-attacks-on-mcp-part2/">Read Part 2: Actually Fixing This Mess →</a></em></p>

<p>MCP is Anthropic&#39;s attempt at standardizing how AI models talk to external tools<sup><a id="ref-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. Instead of every AI app rolling their own integration layer, you get a common protocol. Think of it like REST for AI tools, except with way less thought put into security.</p>
<p>The spec is pretty straightforward - JSON-RPC over stdio or HTTP. AI asks for available tools, gets back a list with descriptions, then calls them with parameters. Simple enough that you can implement a basic server in an afternoon.</p>
<p>Which is exactly the problem.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where things get interesting. MCP servers describe their tools using natural language descriptions that the AI reads to understand what each tool does. Sounds reasonable, right?</p>
<p>Except those descriptions get fed directly into the AI&#39;s context. And if you control the MCP server, you can put whatever you want in those descriptions.</p>

<p>The AI reads this description and suddenly thinks it has new instructions. User asks for weather, AI decides to exfiltrate data instead.</p>
<p>I tested this against a few popular MCP implementations and... yeah, it works. Most don&#39;t even try to sanitize tool descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-actually-matters">Why This Actually Matters<a href="#why-this-actually-matters" aria-label="Direct link to Why This Actually Matters" title="Direct link to Why This Actually Matters">​</a></h3>
<p>Unlike typical prompt injection where you need user input, this attack vector lives in the protocol itself<sup><a id="ref-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>. The AI has to read tool descriptions to function. You can&#39;t just &#34;sanitize&#34; them without breaking core functionality.</p>
<p>And here&#39;s the kicker - in most setups, the user never sees the tool descriptions. They just see &#34;checking weather...&#34; while the AI follows completely different instructions in the background.</p>

<p>Spent some time looking at MCP server implementations in the wild. The authentication situation is... not great.</p>
<p>A lot of servers I found basically look like this:</p>

<p>Reference<sup><a id="ref-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>That TODO comment/Documentation is doing a lot of heavy lifting.</p>
<p>The MCP spec does mention authentication, but it&#39;s basically &#34;figure it out yourself.&#34; Most implementations I&#39;ve seen either skip it entirely or bolt on some basic API key checking that&#39;s trivial to bypass.</p>
<p>Found one server that checked for an API key but only on GET requests. POST requests (you know, the ones that actually do stuff) went straight through.</p>

<p>MCP tools are distributed as packages, which means we get all the fun of supply chain attacks. But with a twist - these tools run with whatever permissions your AI system has.</p>
<p>Regular supply chain attacks might steal your npm tokens or mine some crypto. MCP supply chain attacks can read your conversations, access your databases, and impersonate you to other services.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been watching a few popular MCP tool repositories. The security practices are... inconsistent. Lots of tools with broad permissions, minimal code review, and maintainers who probably haven&#39;t thought much about security.</p>
<p>Not naming names because I&#39;m not trying to shame anyone, but if you&#39;re using MCP tools in production, you might want to audit what you&#39;re actually running.</p>

<p>Tested this stuff against a few internal systems (with permission, obviously). The results weren&#39;t great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got tool description injection working against 2/4 MCP implementations</li>
<li>Found unauthenticated endpoints in 1/10 production deployments</li>
<li></li>
<li>Identified several tools with way more permissions than they needed</li>
</ul>
<p>The scariest part? Most of this stuff would be invisible in standard logs. User requests &#34;check my calendar,&#34; AI executes malicious tool, logs show &#34;calendar_check: success.&#34; Good luck spotting that in your SIEM.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about rewriting everything. Most of this is fixable with some basic hygiene:</p>
<p><strong>For tool descriptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parse and validate descriptions before feeding them to the AI</li>
<li>Strip out anything that looks like instructions</li>
<li>Consider using structured descriptions instead of free text</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For authentication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Actually implement it (OAuth flows are now required in MCP 2025-06-18)</li>
<li>Use proper OAuth Resource Server patterns as specified in the latest MCP spec</li>
<li>Implement Resource Indicators (RFC 8707) to prevent token theft</li>
<li>Validate tokens on every request</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For supply chain:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pin tool versions</li>
<li>Review code before deploying</li>
<li>Run tools with minimal permissions</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is rocket science. It&#39;s just boring security work that nobody wants to do.</p>

<p>MCP adoption is picking up fast. I&#39;m seeing it deployed in financial services, healthcare, customer support systems. Places where a security incident would be really, really bad.</p>
<p>The window for fixing this stuff cleanly is closing. Once you have thousands of MCP servers in production, coordinating security updates becomes a nightmare.</p>
<p>Better to fix it now while the ecosystem is still small enough to actually change.</p>

<li>New security best practices documentation</li>

<p>However, the core vulnerabilities described above (tool description injection, supply chain risks) remain unaddressed in the protocol itself.</p>

<p>Part 2 will cover specific mitigation strategies and some tools I&#39;ve been building to make this stuff easier to secure. Nothing groundbreaking, just practical stuff that actually works.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re building MCP tools or have seen other security issues, let me know. This ecosystem is still small enough that we can actually fix problems before they become disasters.</p>
