I’m going on a hike in <em>two days</em> through the forest in Thüringen, and am going to take some photos / write some things along the way. I’m also going to be <em>emailing</em> those things – potentially to <em>you</em>, dear Reader! – in what I’ve seen referred to as a <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/popup_newsletters/">“pop-up newsletter”</a>.</p><p>Does this warrant a whole blog post? <strong>No</strong>, probably not, but I know there’s like a handful of people subscribed to this blog via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I didn’t want them to miss out just because I had no other way to contact them 🙃</p><p>All the details are over at <a href="https://wo.ist.fabi.jetzt">Where Is Fabian, <em>now</em>?</a>. Go take a look and sign up over there!</p></div></div>
