    <h1>OBS and Streamlabs Commit to Long-Term Collaboration</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>First and foremost, we want to thank you all again for your incredible outpouring of love and support for OBS. Everyone on the team is incredibly thankful and humbled by your enthusiasm for what we do.</p>
<p>Second, we wanted to share some positive news: In the past few weeks, Jim and the team have been in discussion with Streamlabs to have a transparent conversation on trust and partnership, and together, we now have a plan moving forward.</p>
<p>Both of our teams have a shared mission to support streamers, and the industry is better when we can all work together. We are happy to have Streamlabs support the project in the long-term so we can continue to build tools for the community.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the team at Streamlabs for listening and taking immediate action to resolve the issues that led to the current situation. While past actions cannot be changed, we look forward to a fresh start.</p>
<p>To all of you: thank you once more for being so supportive, and stay tuned for more updates!</p>
<p>Best,</p>			</div></div>
