Barely more than a week ago, FTX, led by its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was regarded as one of the most respected and innovative companies in the crypto industry,” the filing notes. “FTX faced a severe liquidity crisis that necessitated the filing of these [bankruptcy] cases on an emergency basis last Friday. Questions arose about Mr. Bankman-Fried’s leadership and the handling of FTX’s complex array of assets and businesses under his direction.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The filing goes on to state that, originally, it was thought that there were “over one hundred thousand creditors in these Chapter 11 Cases.” It then states that, “in fact, there could be more than one million creditors,” meaning that FTX could owe money to more than a million people, the vast majority of whom are customers and former customers.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The filing is an attempt to consolidate and simplify the bankruptcy process; as noted in an earlier filing, FTX operated a highly complex corporate structure with dozens of companies, each of which filed for bankruptcy separately last week.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The fate of customers&#39; money is still up-in-the-air as FTX halted withdrawals last week.</p></span></p><div><div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
