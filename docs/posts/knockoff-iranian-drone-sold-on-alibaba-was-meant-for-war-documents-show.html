The XHZ-50 Fixed Wing UAV was marketed for use with “survey mapping inspection,” and other models came with similar disclaimers on the e-commerce website. </p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>According to documents obtained by Motherboard, however, the drone was really meant for war.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A sales document about the XHZ-50, which has a a 50KG payload and looks nearly identical to Iran’s Shahed-136 drone which has been used by Russia in Ukraine, described the UAV as a “suicide” weapon for use on a battlefield. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“It is a tactical UAV that can roll, move on a vehicle or be launched with a solid rocket boost from a ship. It can be launched by multiple aircraft at the same time. It is a long-range suicide UAV used on the battlefield to attack fixed targets,” the document said. “The aircraft has low-altitude and high-speed penetration capabilities and is difficult to be detected by radar. It flies very low and dives down to 100 meters before hitting the target and flies close to the ground at high speed for penetration.” A sales document for the XHZ-20, a smaller drone model with a 20KG payload, contains the same wording.</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1705606693327-screen-shot-2024-01-18-at-23721-pm.png?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1705606693327-screen-shot-2024-01-18-at-23721-pm.png?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1705606693327-screen-shot-2024-01-18-at-23721-pm.png?resize=20:*"/><img alt="Marketing materials from Sunlipo say the XHV-50 is designed as a &#34;suicide UAV used on the battlefield.&#34; " decoding="async" loading="eager" width="1004" height="1232"/></picture></div></div><p>Marketing materials from Sunlipo say the XHV-50 is designed as a &#34;suicide UAV used on the battlefield.&#34; </p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A Sunlipo employee confirmed it had pulled the drones from Alibaba because they are weapons, and claimed the listing had attracted too much interest.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Too many people want to buy it, it’s not a good thing for us,” Johnny Lu, Shenzhen-based OEM Sunlipo’s sales director told Motherboard over WhatsApp. “We are afraid that Alibaba platform will be frozen if Alibaba knows that it’s a weapon.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Lu also sent Motherboard photos showing one of the XHZ-20 drones sold by the company in a nondescript field. He did not send Motherboard photos of the XHZ-50, the model that looks like Iran’s Shahed-136. </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>According to Lu, the drones are destined for Eastern Europe. “This item is customized for one big client in UKR [Ukraine],” he said. Motherboard sent a request for comment to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, which was not returned in time for publication. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When asked if the XHZ-50 was based on Iran’s Shahed-136, Lu said it’s similar. </p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1705606221330-your-paragraph-text-61.jpeg?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1705606221330-your-paragraph-text-61.jpeg?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1705606221330-your-paragraph-text-61.jpeg?resize=20:*"/><img alt="Photos of the XHZ-20 drone in a field.

They’re a fiberglass airframe powered by a simple gasoline engine similar to what’s on a lawnmower or dirtbike. It wouldn’t be hard for anyone to copy the design and sell them to whoever they wish. The hardest parts of the project are finding an explosive payload as well as the communications and navigation systems.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>According to the sales documents obtained by motherboard, the XHZ-50 and 20 can use GPS, GLONASS, or Beidou for navigation. These different methods of navigation are operated by the governments of the U.S., Russia, and China, respectively. It’s equipped with a camera of some kind, but the details are light. In addition to the two models of drone, Sunlipo has also manufactured a drone catapult to launch them which is priced at $41,000.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Both Ukraine and Russia are hungry for drones. From quadcopters to Shaheds, the UAV has come to define the war. Kyiv has said it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-million-fpv-drones-next-year-minister-2023-12-20/" target="_blank">wants to produce</a> 1 million FPV drones—small drones remote-controlled by a pilot with a video feed—in 2024 and Moscow has ordered a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-produce-over-32000-drones-each-year-by-2030-tass-2024-01-06/" target="_blank">ramp up</a> in domestic production. The machines are cheap, easy to use, and can deliver death from a safe distance. Expensive equipment like tanks have struggled to defend themselves from aerial assaults against the cheap devices.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Russia has used the Shahed to great effect against Ukraine and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/us/russia-iran-drones-ukraine.html" target="_blank">manufactured</a> its own knockoffs. The market for drones is wide open and Kyiv and Moscow are both more than happy to pay for whatever they can get. </p></span></p></div><div><div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div></div></div>
