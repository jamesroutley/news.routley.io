          <p>Changing a duvet or comforter cover used to be quite hard for me, before I
discovered a trick to make it much more simple. Imagine replacing your duvet
cover in minutes, and without resorting to frantic shaking of your duvet. This
duvet cover changing hack, which I call the “roll-invert-unroll” will make this
a reality.</p>

<h2 id="putting-on-a-duvet-cover-can-be-challenging">Putting on a duvet cover can be challenging</h2>

<p>I recently learned that <a href="https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/cleaning-tips/clothes/laundry-basics">the American Cleaning Institute recommends that we wash
our duvet covers
monthly</a>.
Other expert voices say we should be doing this fortnightly, or even weekly.
Without revealing too much, I’ll admit my current schedule falls a little outside
of these recommendations.</p>

<p>The hardest part of changing my bedclothes is usually attempting to get the
duvet cover on after everything has been washed! Frankly, it is the part I dread
the most. Between the floppy nature of the comforter inner and the friction
between cover and inner, it felt like trying to force a noodle through a straw.
Often I had to resort to</p>

<ul>
<li>crawling inside the duvet cover and standing up with the inner</li>
<li>a tonne of shaking to get the two masses of fabric to line up satisfactorially.</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems are much harder when you’re alone, but even with a partner to
help there’s a lot of wasted effort. In the next section, I’ll describe how to
put on a duvet cover easily and more efficiently, especially when you’re doing
it alone.</p>

<h2 id="roll-invert-unroll">Roll - Invert - Unroll</h2>

<p>While I don’t exactly remember how I discovered this method of putting on a
duvet cover, I do recall waking up one day with this method in my head. Perhaps
I had dreamed it? Excited to try it out, I immediately removed my duvet cover
and put it back on again, without actually washing it—and I was excited
when the method worked.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that I’m the first to invent it, but I’m stubbornly not going to
check the Internet before publishing this article. At the very least, I’m
helping spread the word to new people.</p>

<p>The method follows very simple steps: Roll, Invert, Unroll.</p>

	<figcaption>Fig. 1 First take your washed and dried duvet cover and turn it inside out.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Inverting the cover before you begin is a critical step, and it will make sense later.</p>

<figure>

	<figcaption>Fig. 2 Next, lay it out completely flat on the bed, with the opening towards the foot of the bed</figcaption>
</figure>

	<figcaption>Fig. 3 Now lay your duvet inner on top of your cover</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Fig. 4 Secure all four corners of your duvet inner to the cover</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This step is not absolutely necessary, but makes the following steps easier and
more tolerant if you’re a little less precise with the rolling and unrolling.
Securing the corners will also prevent the inner from drifting inside the cover
and forming lumps. My cover has ties for securing it to the inner. If you don’t
have them, you can use safety pins.</p>

<h3 id="roll-the-duvet-inner-and-cover-together">Roll the duvet inner and cover together</h3>

	<figcaption>Fig. 5 Tightly roll the inner and the cover together, keeping the cover on the outside. Start at the head of the bed, and roll towards the cover opening at the foot.</figcaption>
</figure>

	<figcaption>Fig. 6 When you&#39;re done rolling, it should look like this. Note that I&#39;ve rotated the entire roll for better lighting in this photo—you should keep your roll by the foot of your bed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="invert-the-duvet-cover-over-the-entire-roll">Invert the duvet cover over the entire roll</h3>

<p>This is the part that feels like magic. Keeping the roll tight, you invert the
duvet cover over the entire roll, starting from one end of the opening and
working towards the other.</p>

<figure>

	<figcaption>Fig. 7 Start by finding the vertex of the opening on one side. Usually, the opening will be a few centimeters in from the very end of the roll. Feel free to stuff the end through this opening. </figcaption>
</figure>

	<figcaption>Fig. 8 Work along the edge, continuing to join the openings of the cover on the opposite side of the roll. It helps to button the opening on the correct side, as you go.</figcaption>

<h3 id="unroll">Unroll</h3>

<p>And that’s it—Your duvet rolls right into place, ready for your to sleep in it!</p>

<h2 id="to-wrap-it-up">To wrap it up</h2>

<p>I have been replacing my duvet in this way for more than five years now. Not
only has it saved me a lot of time and effort, but the reduced frustration in
the task of laundry leaves me calmer and feeling less frantic. Additionally, the
way in which the duvet cover flips right-side-out during the middle of the
process genuinely gives me a sparkle of joy every time I do it.</p>

<p>I hope that you try out this method of replacing your duvet cover, and that you
find it is useful!</p>
