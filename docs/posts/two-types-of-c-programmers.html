    <h1>Two types of C programmers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The two types of C programmers (a provocative thesis)</h2>

	<p><small>April 22, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Here is a provocative thesis:</p>

<blockquote><p>There are two types of C programmers: people who chose C because they
liked various of its properties, or people who used C because it was
their best or only option at the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/CTriumph">Back in the days</a>, C was somewhere between your best
option or your only real option for doing certain sorts of programming.
If you were writing a Unix program, for example, for quite a while
C was your only real choice (then later you could consider C++).
The people who came to C often found some of its virtues to be
attractive, but they weren&#39;t necessarily strongly committed to it;
they&#39;d picked C as an expedient choice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are people who looked at C and felt (and often
still feel) that it was very much the language for them (out of
those available at the time). They feel strongly drawn to C&#39;s
virtues, often explicitly in contrast to other languages, and today
they may still program in C out of choice. If and when they switch
languages they often pick languages that are as close to the virtues
of C (as each person sees them) as possible.</p>

<p>I am the first sort of C programmer. I like some aspects of C but
there are others that I more or less always found to be kind of a
pain; as <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/RustMyViews">I&#39;ve kind of said before</a>, I no longer want
to have to think about memory management and related issues. So
I&#39;ve wound up mostly in the Go camp, despite Go&#39;s garbage collection
being anathema to a certain sort of C programmer.</p>

<p>(Thinking about memory management can be fun every so often, just as it
can be fun to optimize anything, but I want it to be an optimization,
not a mandatory thought.)</p>

<p>My perception of the second sort of C programmer is that if they&#39;ve
moved to any more recent mainstream language, it&#39;s probably Rust.
Rust is certainly not C-like in some respects, but in a lot of ways
its virtues are the most C-like out of all of the mainstream languages
(and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/RustIsInevitable">some of the ways it&#39;s better than C are important</a>).</p>

<p>(Like all provocative theses, this is a generalization and
simplification. People had and have many reasons for choosing C. And
yes, there are non-mainstream languages that are trying to be &#39;a
better C&#39; in ways that are significantly different from Rust.)</p>
