    <h1>Ask HN: How to deal with a serious mental health breakdown?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am dealing with a delicate problem concerning my housemate who has recently had a very serious mental health breakdown.</p><p>This man is my friend of a decade and a housemate for 5 (uneventful) years. He began behaving erratically last week, and got progressivlely worse over the last weekend to the point where he was not really making any sense at all anymore. (&#34;Reality is an illusion - but he knows the truth now&#34; type stuff). He was not sleeping and began talking to himself.</p><p>I no choice but to call his family and also a mental health crisis team. The crisis team arrived first with police and forcibly entered his space.</p><p>This made him very angry, both at them and me, and he was forcibly removed to a hospital where I understand that he is refusing any sort of treatment and cannot be forced.</p><p>His family arrived to pack some things for his stay and found a half-written suicide note in his room. He is claiming it is &#34;creative writing&#34;.</p><p>My flatmate is fiercely intelligent, and very highly educated. He is a professional working scientist and way smarter than me, or almost anyone I know.</p><p>He is insisting on returning to our house (as his legal right) but obviously I am very worried about him and terrified of making wrong decisions for both myself and him.</p><p>I know am not responsible for him, but his family are not really helping him properly (imo) either and he is my friend.</p><p>Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before? I am lost and desperate for advice.</p><p>dang: please delete this post if you deem it inappropriate.</p></div></div></div>
