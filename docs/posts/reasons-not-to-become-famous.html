<blockquote><p>Let the cymbals of popularity tinkle still. Let the butterflies of fame glitter with their wings. I shall envy neither their music nor their colors.</p><cite>— John Adams</cite></blockquote>



<p>“If I’m not famous by 30, I might as well put a bullet in my head.”</p>



<p>That’s an actual sentence I spoke to one of my closest friends. At the time, I was 28.</p>



<p>Fortunately, unlike <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">during my darkest period in college</a>, I wasn’t serious about suicide. Nonetheless, the sentiment was real. I felt like I somehow needed fame. In retrospect, there was a lot of self-loathing from tough childhood experiences, and I desperately hoped that love from without (i.e., from masses of other people) would somehow make up for hate from within.</p>



<p>As luck would have it, I got to test this hypothesis.</p>



<p><a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank"><em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em></a>, my first book, was published in 2007. It hit the <em>New York Times</em> Hardcover Business bestseller list, where it stayed for an unbroken four years and four months. It was quickly translated into approximately 40 languages, and shit went bonkers. Everything changed.</p>



<p>I was 29.</p>



<p>Soon, I was engulfed in a hailstorm of both great and terrible things, and I was utterly unprepared for any of it.</p>



<p>To kick off this post, let’s start with a real example from 2010. I vividly remember the day I received an email from someone we’ll call “James.” James was a frequent commenter on my blog, and we’d become friendly over time. He was a great guy and a huge help to other readers. I’d given him advice, he’d built a few successful businesses, and we’d developed a nice virtual rapport. That day in 2010, however, I actually received an email from James’ longtime assistant. It was succinct: “James learned so much from you, and he instructed me to give you this video.” I clicked on the attachment. James popped up. He was clearly agitated and clenching his jaw, making contorted faces and speaking strangely. He thanked me for all of my help over the years and explained that it had helped him through some very dark times. He finished by saying that he was sorry, but that he had to end things. That’s when he turned off the video and killed himself.</p>



<p>This experience profoundly fucked me up for a long period of time.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, I didn’t realize that this type of thing was part of the Faustian fame-seeking bargain.</p>



<h3><strong>THE 30,000-FOOT VIEW</strong></h3>



<p>Now it’s 2020. 13 years, 5 books, 1,000+ blog posts, and nearly 500M podcast downloads later, I’ve learned a few things about the promises and perils of seeking fame.</p>



<p>And I say “seeking fame” deliberately, because—let’s be honest—I’m not <em>really</em> famous. Beyoncé and Brad Pitt are truly famous. They cannot walk around in public anywhere in the world. I am a micro public figure with a monthly audience in the millions or tens of millions. There are legions of people on Instagram alone with audiences of this size. New platforms offer new speed. Some previous unknowns on TikTok, for example, have attracted millions of followers in a matter of <em>weeks</em>.</p>



<p>If you suddenly had 100,000 or 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 more followers, what might happen?</p>



<p>I thought I knew, and I was naive.</p>



<p>This post will explore a lot of things. Chief among them will be answering the question: if you win the popularity game, what might you expect?</p>



<p>I’ll mention some of the rewards and upsides, which can be incredible. I will also talk about some of the risks and downsides, which can be horrifying.</p>



<p>My hope is that this post will help people better understand the wall their ladder is leaning against… before they spend years climbing towards the top. Or, in a world of TikTok-like acceleration, before they let the genie out of the bottle without thinking it through.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in building a large audience to become rich and famous, some warnings and recommendations are in order. If you’re interested in building a large audience you also truly care about and with whom you are vulnerable, even more precautionary tales are in order.</p>



<h3><strong>ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, SOME VERY REAL BENEFITS</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s cover some of the great stuff first.</p>



<p>One could easily argue that the national exposure that accompanied <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em></a> and <a href="http://tim.blog/books" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">later books</a> was a necessary ingredient for:</p>



<ul><li>Meeting many of my now dear friends, including <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/kevinrose">Kevin R</a><a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label="o (opens in a new tab)" href="http://instagram.com/kevinrose" target="_blank">o</a><a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/kevinrose">se</a>, <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://ma.tt" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg</a>, and many others. These are people I hope will be my close brothers and sisters for life. That led to…</li><li>Being able to invest in <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://angel.co/tim" target="_blank">dozens of early-stage technology deals</a>, the proceeds of which then allowed…</li><li>Helping <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tim.blog/about/causes/" target="_blank">many causes and organizations</a> that are making a real, positive dent in the world, including education (<a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/author-tim-ferriss-flash-funds-145-school-projects-on-li-1.11567795" target="_blank">DonorsChoose</a>, <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-venture-capitalists-help-connect-low-income-students-with-elite-colleges-1431535621" target="_blank">QuestBridge</a>, etc.); <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/science/psychedelic-drugs-hopkins-depression.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank">scientific research aimed at treatments for chronic depression, PTSD, and other “intractable” psychiatric conditions</a> (Johns Hopkins, <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/trial/NCT02950467">UCSF</a>, etc.); and more.</li><li>Launching projects to aid the above (e.g., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tim.blog/2019/03/09/trip-of-compassion/" target="_blank"><em>Trip of Compassion</em> documentary</a>)</li></ul>



<p>And then there are the occasional fringe benefits, like getting tables at busy restaurants, getting free samples of products (although “free” often ends up being the most expensive), and so on.</p>



<p>Many of the things I’m proudest of in life would have been difficult or impossible to accomplish without a large audience. For that, I owe every one of my readers and listeners a huge debt of gratitude.</p>



<p>Using fame as a lever, however, can be tricky. </p>



<p>First off, what type of “fame” do you want? In concrete terms, what would “successful” look like and over what period of time? From 0–100%, how confident are you that you can convert exposure to income? If more than 0%, what evidence do you have to suggest that your strategy will work? Do you have a plan for becoming <em>un</em>famous if you don’t like it?</p>



<p>During my college years, one of my dorm mate’s dads was a famous Hollywood producer. He once said to me, “You want everyone to know your name and no one to know your face.”</p>



<p>Taking it a step further, we could quote Bill Murray: </p>



<blockquote><p>I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: ‘try being rich first.’ See if that doesn’t cover most of it. There’s not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job. . . . The only good thing about fame is that I’ve gotten out of a couple of speeding tickets. I’ve gotten into a restaurant when I didn’t have a suit and tie on. That’s really about it.</p></blockquote>



<p>But how could this be true? It seems like a farce. At the very least, it must be an exaggeration, right?</p>



<p>To wrap your head around what “famous” really means, there is one metaphor that might help.</p>



<h3><strong>THE TRIBE, THE VILLAGE, THE CITY — THIS IS IMPORTANT</strong></h3>



<p>Here’s an email I received in July of 2007:</p>



<blockquote><p>[Your sport] shows that you are a hypocrite to profess helping others with your book. You are showing a grave example of the White horseman to our children. Shame on you. Shame on you… Shame. And Wickedness… It is the most evil war on earth, the one for blood spectacle for those who would entertain by whoring themselves prostituting violence to those who seek and lust to watch inhumanity. You are an evil one who has gained the world and lost your soul.</p></blockquote>



<p>What did I do or say that caused this? Was it in response to a how-to article on clubbing baby seals? </p>



<p>Not quite. It was in response to my blog post highlighting the non-profit <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.donorschoose.org/" target="_blank">DonorsChoose.org</a>, which I’ve advised for 10+ years. The explicit goal? To raise money for under-funded public school classrooms. In the introduction, I happened to mention that the founder and CEO of DonorsChoose was my wrestling partner in high school. That’s it.  </p>



<p>This same “White horseman” reader proceeded to send me more than a dozen increasingly threatening emails, concluding with “I shall deliver you on judgment day.”</p>



<p>Was that a death threat? Was there anything I should do or could do about it? I’d never dealt with such things, and I didn’t know. But I did know one thing: it was very scary and completely out of the blue.</p>



<p>That week, I shared the above story with a female career blogger. She laughed and said soberly, “Welcome to the party.” She got an average of one death threat and one sex request/threat per week. At the time, our audiences were roughly the same size.</p>



<p>This brings me to the topic of audience size and the metaphor of the tribe, the village, and the city.</p>



<p>Think back to your 5th-grade class. In my case, there were 20–30 kids. Was there anyone totally off the rails in your class? For most of you, there’s a decent chance kids seemed pretty sane. It’s a small sample size.</p>



<p>Next, think back to your freshman year in high school. In my case, there were a few hundred kids. Was there anyone volatile or unbalanced? I can think of at least a handful who were prone to violence and made me uneasy. There were fights. Some kids brought knives to school. There was even a kid rumored to enjoy torturing animals. Keep in mind: this high school was in the same town as my elementary school. What changed? The sample size was larger.</p>



<p>Flash forward to my life in July of 2007, less than three months after the publication of my first book. </p>



<p>In that short span of time, my monthly blog audience had exploded from a small group of friends (20–30?) to the current size of Providence, Rhode Island (180,–200,000 people). Well, let’s dig into that. What do we know of Providence? Here’s one snippet from Wikipedia, and bolding is mine:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Compared to the national average, Providence has an average rate of violent crime and a higher rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010, there were 15 murders, down from 24 in 2009. </strong>In 2010, Providence fared better regarding violent crime than most of its peer cities. Springfield, Massachusetts, has approximately 20,000 fewer residents than Providence but reported 15 murders in 2009, the same number of homicides as Providence but a slightly higher rate per capita.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>The point is this: you don’t need to do anything <em>wrong</em></strong><strong> to get death threats, rape threats, etc. You just need a big enough audience. </strong>Think of yourself as the leader of a tribe or the mayor of a city.</p>



<p>The averages will dictate that you get a certain number of crazies, con artists, extortionists, possible (or actual) murderers, and so on. In fairness, we should also include a certain number of geniuses, a certain number of good Samaritans, and so on. Sure, your subject matter and content matters, but it doesn’t matter as much as you’d like to think.</p>



<p>To recap: the bigger the population, the more opportunities and problems you will have. A small, self-contained town in Idaho might not have a Pulitzer Prize winner among its residents, but it probably doesn’t need a SWAT team either.</p>



<p>Now, here we are in 2020.  </p>



<p>My monthly audience is larger than the size of New York City (NYC).  </p>



<p>For fun, Google “New York City” and click on “News.” On some level, those are the dynamics—good and bad—you will need to deal with if your audience is that large.</p>



<p>But let’s assume you only have 100 or 1,000 followers. You should still wonder: At any given time, how many of these people might go off of their meds? And how many of the remaining folks will simply wake up on the wrong side of the bed today, feeling the need to lash out at someone? The answer will never be zero.</p>



<h3><strong>ON THE DARKER SIDE, SOME VERY REAL ISSUES</strong></h3>



<p>To quote Henry David Thoreau, “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” (<a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Walden-Civil-Disobedience-Henry-Thoreau/dp/0451532163/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank"><em>Walden</em></a>) </p>



<p>If you’ve ever wondered why many celebrities disappear for a period of time, sometimes years, it’s often in the hopes that the below will fade or go away. Sadly, it’s very hard to put the toothpaste back in the toothpaste tube once you have a large Google footprint. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Stalkers. </strong>One example to set the tone: Back when I lived in SF, a fan on the East Coast thought I was sending him secret, personalized messages embedded in my public Facebook posts. He believed I was asking him to move into my house and work for me. He told his co-workers, who were worried he’d go postal, so they reported him to the CEO, who reached out to me. It was a close call, and I got lucky. This particular employee had already bought plane tickets for the following week, intending to fly to SF to find me. I got the FBI involved, his family staged an intervention, and, lo and behold, he had gone off of his meds for psychiatric disorders.  Another example from 2008, a year after my first book came out. That’s  when the first person showed up at my door looking for me. I’d just closed on my first home, a cute little townhouse near Sunnyvale, CA. The random visits didn’t happen sooner, as I’d been renting up to that point.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Death threats.  </strong>I get regular death threats, and this is common for public figures. I would estimate I get at least one per month via some channel. Sometimes they’re related to extortion (coming later), but they’re most often from people who are mentally unstable. What are they angry about? Once again, therein lies the rub: it is rarely in response to anything that I’ve said or done. That is the scariest thing, and it’s also why the tribe-village-city metaphor is so apt. The people sending death threats are normally suffering from psychotic episodes, and there is nothing you can do to prevent them. </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Harassment of family members and loved ones.</strong> </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Dating woes. </strong>As you might imagine, dating can be a quagmire of liabilities and bear traps. It could be someone hoping to write a clickbait article about their date with you (obviously without disclosing such), or it could be much worse. If you’re a female, this is where things can once again become physically dangerous. If you’re a male, this is where things can become legally dangerous. There are many predators for both sides, and it can make you lose your faith in humanity.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Extortion attempts.</strong> </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Desperation messages and pleas for help. </strong>This is a sad category, much like the the suicide video story in the introduction to this piece. It’s one thing to get an “I committed suicide and I’m letting you know” note, which is absolutely awful. It’s quite another to get a message with something like: “You’re my last hope. I have no one else to ask. If you can’t help me with X, Y, and Z in the next 48 hours, I’m going to kill myself.” I have received dozens of these. In the beginning, I tried to help everyone and became horribly enmeshed. This never failed to end in misery and countless sleepless nights. Now, the senders of such notes are referred to suicide hotlines (e.g., 1 (800) 273-8255 in the US; <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html" target="_blank">a list of international hotlines</a> [<a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines" target="_blank">alternative link</a>]) and a post I wrote entitled “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tim.blog/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide/" target="_blank">Some Practical Thoughts on Suicide</a>.” I owe many thanks to <a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.tinynibbles.com/">Violet Blue</a> for her moral and tactical support with many of these situations. Thank you, Violet. This is very rough terrain. The more you operate in the world of how-to advice, and the more vulnerable you are with your audience, the more of these you will receive.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Kidnapping.</strong> </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Impersonation, identity theft, etc. </strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Attack and clickbait media.</strong>There are a lot of amazing writers and media professionals with rock-solid ethics. Many of my dear friends are journalists in this camp. On the flip side, there are increasingly large numbers of bad actors due to perverse incentives created by the click-baity, fast-is-the-new-good digital playing field. </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>“Friends” with ulterior motives.</strong>Once you have a decent sized audience or “platform,” the majority of people who want to grab coffee, ask mutual friends for an intro, or—especially—offer you unsolicited favors will have ulterior motives. It took me a long time to accept this, and I paid a hefty tax for being Pollyannaish.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Invasions of privacy.</strong> </li></ul>



<h3><strong>IN CONCLUSION</strong></h3>



<p>It’s been a wild ride. </p>



<p>That said, all of the above have created heightened levels of anxiety that I didn’t anticipate. I’m lucky to have the support of my family and friends, my girlfriend, and<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4vzyNTHtmx/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"> my guardian and fluffball, Molly</a>. I simply couldn’t handle it otherwise.</p>



<p>Would I have listened to all these warnings in advance? Would it have changed my behavior? I don’t know. Perhaps not. Unless you’ve lived it, it might seem like someone is being gifted a Bugatti and complaining about gas mileage.</p>



<p>Before 2007, I was the blind men. </p>



<p>Only now do I have some idea of what it’s like to be the elephant itself. No matter what part you grab beforehand, you can’t fully appreciate the scope of experience until you’re <em>in</em> it.</p>



<p><strong>If I’ve learned anything, it is this: fame will not fix your problems.  </strong></p>



<p>Instead, fame is likely to magnify all of your insecurities and exaggerate all of your fears. It’s like picking up a fire extinguisher for your pain that ends up being a canister of gasoline. </p>



<p>If you don’t, you will end up with sand slipping through your fingers, leaving you with the same feelings of emptiness. Only now, along with disappointment, you will have the new challenges described in this post.</p>



<p>I also highly recommend reading Kevin Kelly’s essay entitled “<a rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" aria-label="1,000 True Fans (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank">1,000 True Fans</a>.” Is it possible that being “famous” to the right 1,000 people could get you to your goals faster—and be healthier—than seeking the adoration and validation of millions? I tend to think so.</p>



<p>But then again…</p>



<p>Does that mean no one should pursue the path of Great Fame or tempt the sirens of the Great Public? I can’t say that. My intention is simply to shine light upon some of the hazards that such a journey entails.  </p>



<p>Perhaps—just perhaps—you should give stardom a shot.</p>



<p>After all, as Jim Carrey has said: </p>



<p>“I think everybody should get rich and famous, and do everything they ever dreamed of, so they can see that it’s not the answer.”</p>
