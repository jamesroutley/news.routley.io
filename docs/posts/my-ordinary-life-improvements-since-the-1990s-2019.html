    <h1>My Ordinary Life: Improvements Since the 1990s (2019)</h1>

        <p>A list of unheralded improvements to ordinary quality-of-life since the 1990s going beyond computers.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>It can be hard to see the gradual improvement of most goods over time, but I think one way to get a handle on them is to look at their <em>downstream</em> effects: all the small ordinary everyday things which nevertheless depend on obscure innovations and improving cost-performance ratios and gradually dropping costs and new material and… etc. All of these gradually drop the cost, drop the price, improve the quality at the same price, remove irritations or limits not explicitly noticed, or so on.</p>
            <p>It all adds up.</p>
            <p>So here is a personal list of small ways in which my ordinary everyday daily life has been getting better since the late 1980s/early 1990s (as far back as I can clearly remember these things—I am sure the list of someone growing up in the 1940s would include many hassles I’ve never known at all).</p>
          </blockquote>

        <p><span>Small stuff matters too.</span> Progress is usually debated in terms of the big things like lifting the Third World out of poverty, eliminating child mortality<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_science#2000s" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years_in_science#bodyContent">science</a> &amp; tech: discovering gravitational waves, creating world champion AIs, turning AIDS into a treatable rather than terminal disease, conquering hepatitis C, or curing deadly cancers with genetically-engineered T-cells. But as cool as those big things are, and matters of life-and-death for many, such achievements tend to be remote from ordinary people, and not your everyday sort of thing (or so one hopes). What about the <em>little</em> things in an ordinary life?</p>

        <p><span>The seen and the unseen.</span> When I think back, so many hassles have simply disappeared from my life, and nice new things appeared. I remember my desk used to be crowded with things like dictionaries and pencil sharpeners, but between smartphones &amp; computers, most of my desk space is now dedicated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#bodyContent">cats</a>. Ordinary life had a lot of hassles too, I remembered once I started thinking about it. (“The past is a third world country”, but America in the 1990s could also have used some improvement.)</p>
        <p>These things rarely come up because so many of them are about removing irritations or creating new possibilities—dogs that do not bark, and ‘the seen and the unseen’—and how quickly we forget that the status quo was not always so. The hardest thing to see can be that which you no longer see. I thought it would be interesting to try to remember the forgotten. Limiting myself to my earliest relatively clear memories of everyday life in the mid-1990s, I still wound up making a decent-sized list of improvements to my ordinary life.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
        
        <section id="improvements">
          
          <p>Roughly divided by topic:</p>
          <section id="computers">
            <h2><a href="#computers" title="Link to section: § &#39;Computers&#39;">Computers</a></h2>
            <p>With computers, it’s hardly worth trying to enumerate the improvements on every dimension, and it might be easier to list the exceptions instead—if I made a list of a hundred things, someone would chime in with another one I’d forgotten, like easy rental rooms through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb#bodyContent">Airbnb</a> or food delivery apps. But nevertheless, here’s a few:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Cheap</strong>: electronics prices keep falling.</p>
                <p>These days, people whine endlessly online if a RAM or semiconductor shortage (something that happens every decade or so, as the industry has notorious boom-and-bust dynamics) means that they have to pay as much as they did a few years ago for something, but the long-term trends are dramatic.</p>
