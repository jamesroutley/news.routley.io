Taken together, this allows me to fully define the 2D and 3D appearance and interactivity of a game object in a single React component.</p></div><div><h2 id="w-node-_3aaf6d95-14c7-5eac-8413-bee6d4fbaa0c-bee9e583">Robust high-performance geometry kernel</h2><p id="w-node-_3aaf6d95-14c7-5eac-8413-bee6d4fbaa16-bee9e583">Almost every object in the Citybound world can be arbitrarily shaped, be it roads, zones or building lots - and their exact shape typically results from complex geometric operations between other objects. My <a href="https://github.com/aeickhoff/descartes" target="_blank">Descartes</a> library provides everything from simple path operations to vast polygon-overlay tasks, with a focus on performance and topological robustness despite approximation and inaccuracies.</p></div><div><h2 id="w-node-_5fc5d167-e6e1-89bc-0c78-aa447e19e88a-bee9e583">Incremental computation framework</h2><p id="w-node-_5fc5d167-e6e1-89bc-0c78-aa447e19e88c-bee9e583">To provide real-time interactive editing of large city plans and to minimise bandwidth usage between UI and server while streaming plan result previews, it is vital to have a precise formalisation of how changes in plan input affect plan results, and then communicating only the differences. Currently implemented ad-hoc in a monolithical planning manager, this approach will be generalised and translated into a distributed framework to allow plans to scale beyond one backend server.</p><div id="w-node-_87017114-683c-cd03-f5d7-593298d4196d-bee9e583"><p data-w-id="87017114-683c-cd03-f5d7-593298d4196e"><strong>Details &amp; Inspiration ▾</strong></p><div><p>Papers:</p><ul role="list"><li>Matthew A.

Early work has begun in my <a href="https://github.com/aeickhoff/michelangelo" target="_blank">Michelangelo</a> library that will provide expressive shape-grammars to describe architecture styles or natural shapes based on extrusions, which can then be evaluated on demand to generate optimally-batched meshes and instance-arrays with dynamic level of detail and animated components.</p><div id="w-node-ef35c612-a3e4-0d99-e45b-dc9aa66dff59-bee9e583"><p data-w-id="ef35c612-a3e4-0d99-e45b-dc9aa66dff5a"><strong>Details &amp; Inspiration ▾</strong></p><div><p>Papers:</p><ul role="list"><li>Kelly, T., &amp; Wonka, P.
