<p>Yesterday, I was working on a project that had to parse a JSON file. I’d named the
file <code>config.yml</code> instead of <code>config.json</code> by mistake, so when it came to filling
in this function below, autopilot took over and did this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><p><span>  <span>def</span> <span>config</span></span></p><p><span>+   <span>YAML</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>File</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;config.yml&#39;</span><span>))</span></span></p><p><span>  <span>end</span></span></p></pre>
</div>

<p>Fast-forward to today morning, as I’m reviewing my pull request I see the mistake and wonder…
why didn’t this break my tests?</p>

<p>That, dear reader, is the story of how I learnt that <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2-old/spec.html#id2759572">YAML is a superset of JSON</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>YAML can therefore be viewed as a natural superset of JSON, offering improved human readability and a more
complete information model. This is also the case in practice; every JSON file is also a valid YAML file.
This makes it easy to migrate from JSON to YAML if/when the additional features are required.</p>

  <p>(from <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2-old/spec.html#id2759572">YAML: Relation to JSON</a>)</p>
