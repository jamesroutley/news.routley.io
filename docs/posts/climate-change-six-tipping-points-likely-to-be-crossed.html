was first introduced by the UN&#39;s climate science group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), two decades ago.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>If crossed they could spark a significant change in the way the Earth&#39;s systems operate, affecting oceans, weather and chemical processes, which could be &#34;irreversible&#34;, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/">according to the UN</a>. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Once a critical point is crossed - or &#34;tipped over&#34; - the breakdown of the system is self-sustaining, so will continue even if there is no further warming. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>This is self-perpetuating: a bit like if a ball crests the top of a hill and starts rolling down and cannot stop.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Irreversible-cascade"><span role="text">Irreversible cascade</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the time it was thought the tipping points would only be crossed if global average temperatures increased to more than 5C.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But since then there has been increasing evidence that these thresholds may be crossed much earlier. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The six tipping points &#34;likely&#34;

such as dieback in the Amazon Rainforest aren&#39;t expected to be triggered unless global temperatures rise by 3.5C, all of these systems are connected.
