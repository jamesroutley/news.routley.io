    <h1>Map of forest sounds from around the world</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="project-summary">
    
    <p>We are collecting the sounds of woodlands and forests from all around the world, creating a growing soundmap bringing together aural tones and textures from the world’s woodlands.</p>
    
    <p>The sounds form an open source library, to be used by anyone to listen to and create from. <a href="https://timberfestival.org.uk/sounds-of-the-forest/the-next-phase/">Selected artists</a> will be responding to the sounds that are gathered, creating music, audio, artwork or something else incredible, to be presented at <a href="https://timberfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Timber Festival 2021</a>.</p>

        <h4>Timber</h4>
        <p>An annual three-day festival at the heart of the National Forest, Timber celebrates our connection to trees and woodlands through music, art and ideas, taking its inspiration from the transformed landscape of the National Forest in the Midlands.</p>
