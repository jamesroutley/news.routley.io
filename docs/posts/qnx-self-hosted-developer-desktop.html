            <p>The team and I are beyond excited to share what we&#39;ve been cooking up over the last little while: <strong>a full desktop environment running on QNX 8.0, with support for self-hosted compilation</strong>! This environment both makes it easier for newly-minted QNX developers to get started with building for QNX, but it also vastly simplifies the process of porting Linux applications and libraries to QNX 8.0.</p><p>This self-hosted target environment is pre-loaded with many of the ports you&#39;ll find on <a href="https://oss.qnx.com/?ref=devblog.qnx.com" rel="noreferrer">the QNX Open-source Dashboard</a>. (The portal currently includes over 1,400 ports across various targets, QNX versions, and architectures, of which more than 600 are unique ports!)</p><p>In this initial release, you can grab a copy of the QEMU image and give it a try for yourself. There&#39;s still so much more to add, but it&#39;s in a great place today for this first release. The team is really passionate about this one, and we&#39;re eagerly looking forward to your feedback!</p><p>For the initial release of Desktop, we tried to cover all the basics: windowing, terminal, IDEs, browser, file management, and samples. To that end, here&#39;s what makes up the QNX Developer Desktop:</p><ul><li>A customizable XFCE desktop environment running on Wayland</li><li>The tools you need to compile and/or run your code (<code>clang</code>, gcc, <code>clang++</code>, Python, <code>make</code>, <code>cmake</code>, <code>git</code>, etc)</li><li>A web browser (can you join <a href="https://discord.gg/Jj4EkkrFTT?ref=devblog.qnx.com" rel="noreferrer">the QNX Discord</a> from the QNX Desktop? 🏅👀)</li><li>Ports of popular IDEs/editors, like Geany, Emacs, Neovim, and vim</li><li>Thunar, for file management</li><li>Preloaded samples, like Hello World in C, C++, and Python, and GTK demos OpenGL ES demos</li><li>... and of course, a terminal.</li></ul><h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2><p>This environment runs as a virtual machine, using QEMU on Ubuntu. To try the image, you&#39;ll need:</p><ul><li>Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04</li></ul><p>(Keep in mind this is the first release, so it takes a minute to get started and it&#39;s a bit rough around the edges.)</p><p>With <a href="https://qnx.com/getqnx?ref=devblog.qnx.com" rel="noreferrer">a free QNX license</a>, you can find this release in QNX Software Center. On the <strong>Available</strong> tab of the <strong>Manage Installation</strong> pane, search for &#34;quick start&#34; and install the &#34;QNX SDP 8.0 Quick Start Target Image for QEMU&#34;.</p><p>You&#39;ll find the image in your QNX installation directory, usually <code>~/qnx800/images</code> by default. Follow the <code>README.md</code> file in the <code>qemu</code> directory to extract &amp; combine the multiple QNX packages downloaded under the hood.</p><p>Next, follow the PDF instructions found in the new <code>./qemu_qsti/docs/</code> directory to install the required dependencies and boot up.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>If you experience any trouble starting the environment, check the PDF&#39;s <b><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></b> chapter, or come <a href="https://discord.gg/Jj4EkkrFTT?ref=devblog.qnx.com" rel="noreferrer">ask us on Discord</a>.</p></div><p>This is just the very first release! Over the next few months and beyond, we&#39;ll drop more updates of Desktop. You can look forward to:</p><ul><li>QEMU images for Windows &amp; macOS, and native images for x86</li><li>A native Desktop image on Raspberry Pi</li><li>Enhanced documentation</li><li>Features to help use this self-hosted environment in CI jobs</li><li>More samples &amp; stability</li><li>... and more! Have suggestions? Let us know.</li></ul><p>Lastly, if you want some help with your QNX journey, you can find the QNX team and community:</p><ul><li>in Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/Jj4EkkrFTT?ref=devblog.qnx.com" rel="noreferrer">discord.gg/Jj4EkkrFTT</a></li><li>on Reddit at: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/qnx?ref=devblog.qnx.com" rel="noreferrer">reddit.com/r/qnx</a></li></ul>
