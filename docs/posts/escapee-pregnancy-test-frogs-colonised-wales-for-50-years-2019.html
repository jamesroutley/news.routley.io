unlikely new lodgers, it still isn&#39;t known precisely how - or when - the frogs made their way here.</p><p>The Welsh Government said it was &#34;most likely that it took place in the early 1960s and was a result of being released or an escape&#34;. </p><p>Evidently, what is now Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan offered everything to fit their needs, so Xenopus laevis - to use the creature&#39;s scientific name - settled in.</p><p>In the 1980s, a colony was uncovered in a stream at Dunraven Castle in Southerndown, along the River Alun and ponds upstream to nearby Croescwtta.</p><p>David Slade, of the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre, said: &#34;So effectively they were known from Glamorgan for a number of years, around the Alun Valley, and Bristol University conducted extensive long-term research projects on them whilst keeping the location secret.&#34;</p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="line"/></p></div></figure><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/92CC/production/_102608573_gettyimages-124123565.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Two African clawed frogs"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>African clawed frogs are found in freshwater all over the world, including the US, Chile, France, Indonesia, Portugal and Italy</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2>Frog factfile</h2></p><div data-component="unordered-list-block"><ul><li>Males weigh 2oz (60g) and are about 2.5in (6cm) long.
