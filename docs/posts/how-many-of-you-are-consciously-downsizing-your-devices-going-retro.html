    <h1>Ask HN: How many of you are consciously downsizing your devices/going retro?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Although Sales and Marketing would have us believe that we should upgrade our devices on a regular basis, a growing number of us are pushing back and consciously not buying new and many cases going retro and using older machines with a modern OS. I eschewed desktops in favour of laptops and now I&#39;ve progressed to an iPad Mini 6 and a 2018 Android Tablet with Termux and Debian 12 (non-GUI). How about you?</p></div></div>
