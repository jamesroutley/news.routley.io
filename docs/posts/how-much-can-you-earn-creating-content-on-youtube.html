    <h1>How much can you earn creating content on Youtube?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Truth time! I love transparency because it takes away the uncertainty and illusions. It helps and inspires people to plan and execute based on facts, not bullshit.</p>

<p>Here are the results of being a (part time) content creator for ~2 years now.</p>

<p>I created and published over <code>137 Youtube videos</code> (long and short form), in addition to <code>30 TikTok videos</code> (those that didn‚Äôt make it to Youtube), equivalent to hundreds of hours of content.</p>

<p>I single handedly scripted, shot, edited and designed an entire brand. <a href="https://glich.stream/tkg">Built and released a product</a> and engaged with you all across 5 social media networks (<a href="https://glich.stream/youtube">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BassemDy/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BassemDy">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bassemdghaidy/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@glich.stream">TikTok</a>).</p>

<p>Throughout this entire journey:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have made a total of ü•Å ‚Ä¶ drum roll ‚Ä¶ ü•Å <code>~148 EUR</code> from Youtube ad revenue, <code>0 EUR</code> from TikTok, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</li>
  <li>I have earned up to <code>~2,000 EUR</code> from Patreon cumulative, 1 off donations and consulting work.</li>
  <li><code>49%</code> of this gross revenue was paid in taxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know many other creators who made <code>0 USD</code> for all their years of sharing value with the world.</p>

<p>Moral of the story is, be kind to the content creators you like. Only a handful are getting rich in the process. The drive for many of us is to add value to the world and share our knowledge.</p>

<p>And for those who are inspired to create, know that this is a ‚Äúlong‚Äù and painful process. You will not get rich anytime soon EVEN when you go viral (and my content went viral several times).</p>

<p>Your drive needs to be something else.</p>

<p>And just to be clear, I‚Äôm not seeking advice or ideas on how to do better. I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing, and I know exactly that if I compromise some of the principles I‚Äôm building on top of (no clickbait bullshit), I can earn much more. This is a post to share my experience nothing more.</p>

<p>Stay awesome and keep building ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
