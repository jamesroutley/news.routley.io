    <h1>Samsung Removes Bootloader Unlocking with One UI 8</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				
				
				
<p>Bootloader unlocking is a popular way to breathe new life into older devices, by loading unofficial software onto a device, like custom ROMs, gaining root access, custom kernels, etc. This option will be taken away from users with <a href="https://sammyguru.com/tag/one-ui-8/">One UI 8</a>. There’s a lot to cover, so let’s jump right in.</p>

<h2>Bootloader unlocking is no more with One UI 8</h2>
<p>The OEM Unlocking toggle has been removed with the stable build of One UI 8 on the latest <a href="https://sammyguru.com/tag/galaxy-z-fold-7/">Z Fold 7</a> and <a href="https://sammyguru.com/tag/galaxy-z-flip-7/">Z Flip 7</a> devices, as well as the official beta builds on the Galaxy S25 series. This was also observed by <a href="https://x.com/ya_sking12767/status/1949144134532595897"><span>@ya_sking12767</span></a> over on X.</p>
<p><a href="https://sammyguru.com/?attachment_id=25277" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1781297033" data-slb-internal="25277" data-slb-group="slb"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://sammyguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1753552122746-439x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="439" height="1024"/></a></p>

<p>Now, one could assume that this is a temporary thing. The Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 are brand new. The S25 beta is, well, a beta. They could add it back in later on, right?</p>
<h2>It’s not a temporary measure at all</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://xdaforums.com/t/bootloader-unlocking-option-removed-from-one-ui-8-0.4751904/#post-90208099">XDA forum post</a> delves deep into various system files from the Flip 7’s stock firmware to get to the root of the issue. What he found was huge. There’s a lot of technical jargon here, so we’ll simplify it. Focus on this code snippet:</p>
<p><code>@Override</code></p>

<p>This controls the visibility of the toggle, and whether you can unlock the bootloader. When <code>ro.boot.other.locked</code> equals <code>0</code>, it lets the user unlock. When <code>1</code>, you can’t. US models haven’t been able to unlock for a while now, and that’s thanks to this value. International units weren’t affected however. But with One UI 8, this value is set to <code>1</code> for everyone, no matter which region the device is from. And when it’s set to <code>1</code>, the toggle no longer appears.</p>
<p>Now, in this snippet, the bootloader code is grepped (searched) for anything relating to unlock functionality. And all code in relation gets stripped upon compilation. On top of that, all devices running One UI 8, including non-US units, have <code>androidboot.other.locked</code> set. Here shown is from build AYFK for the Z Flip 7 interational (F761B)</p>

<p>As mentioned, this is very much simplified. We recommend reading the <a href="https://xdaforums.com/t/bootloader-unlocking-option-removed-from-one-ui-8-0.4751904/#post-90208099">XDA forum post</a> to get the full picture.</p>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>This means not only is the OEM Unlock not visible in Settings anymore, but the bootloader doesn’t even contain any of the code required to unlock itself. This means a workaround to brute force it open is not possible at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to add this logic back in.</p>

<p>This is a huge blow to the entire Samsung enthusiast community. Devices shipped on One UI 8 or higher, like the new Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7, as well as devices updated to One UI 8, can not have their bootloaders unlocked at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to support it. This means custom ROMs, which can save devices, years after official support ends, won’t be possible. Rooting is also no longer possible. Custom kernels, for improved performance and/or efficiency, also no longer possible. This shuts down many avenues for tinkering with the device you own, and is a serious consideration for anyone buying a device with One UI 8 loaded onto it. We’re definitely a bit bummed about this development, but we’ll update you if anything changes. Will this stop you from purchasing a new Samsung device?</p>
