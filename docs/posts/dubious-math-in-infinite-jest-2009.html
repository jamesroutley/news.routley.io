    <h1>Dubious Math in Infinite Jest (2009)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><span>Dubious Math in Infinite Jest</span></strong><span> by </span>Mike Strong</p><p>Let me say, first of all, that I am a huge fan of David Foster Wallace in general and <u><span>Infinite Jest</span></u><span> in particular.<span>  </span>On my first reading of <u>IJ</u>, I noticed a few mathematical errors but thought little of them.<span>  </span>After reading the essay <em>Derivative Sport in Torndao Alley</em> in <u>A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#39;ll Never Do Again</u>, though, I became curious about why a writer with a clear aptitude for math would include such mistakes in his opus.<span>  </span>Therefore, during my second reading of <u>IJ</u>, I made a note of the errors that I noticed.<span>  </span>As it turned out, their number was smaller than I had imagined.<span>  </span>Consequently, I lost interest in this topic until reading DFW&#39;s review of a pair of mathematical novels in a scientific journal.<span>  </span>The broad knowledge of math demonstrated by DFW in this article rekindled my curiousity about the errors in <u>IJ</u>, and I decided to document them, in case others might be interested.<span>  </span>My list is actually quite short - only four<span>  </span>mistakes, two of which might well be typographical - and I offer no theories about why they appear.<span>  </span>One of the errors is attributable to the omniscient<span>  </span>narrator, while the other three are spoken<span>  </span>by Mike Pemulis.<span>  </span>Both, we can assume, are competent mathematicians.</span></p><p><span>Before I outline the errors, I must make a logistical note.<span>  </span>Because I am writing this using a simple text editor, I am somewhat symbolically challenged.<span>  </span>Exponentiation will be denoted using a caret (e.g., 2^3 = 8).<span>  </span>Also, I will not even attempt to depict an integral sign or the usual mathematical symbol for combinations, a pair of elongated parenthesis.<span>  </span>I hope this makes the explanations no less understandable.</span></p><p><span>The first, and perhaps the most interesting error that I noted, appears on page 259 of <u>IJ</u>.<span>  </span>The narrator states that the odds of a 108 game tennis match ending in a 54-match-all tie are 1 in 2^27.<span>  </span>This is incorrect by about seven orders of magnitude; in fact, such an outcome is much more likely than the narrator suggests.<span>  </span>The problem of determining the odds is an exercise in probabilty and combinatorics, a fancy mathematical term for systematic counting.<span>  </span>By the laws of probability, the odds of a 108 game match ending in a tie are</span></p><p><span>(the number of outcomes resulting in a 54-54 tie) / (the total number of possible outcomes).</span></p><p><span>The denominator in this expression is easy to calculate.<span>  </span>It is simply 2^108 (an example will follow).<span>  </span>The numerator can be found using the concept of combinations.<span>  </span>That is, the correct anwer is the total number of ways team A can be assigned exactly 54 victories out of the 108 matches.<span>  </span>(Of course, if team A wins exactly 54 matches, so must team B.)<span>  </span>In combinatorics this is referred to as &#34;the number of combinations of 108 things taken 54 at a time.&#34;<span>  </span>Although the derivation is well beyond the scope of this discussion, it can be shown that the number of combinations of <em>n</em> things taken <em>m</em> at a time is</span></p><p><em><span>n! / ((n-m)! m!)</span></em>.</p><p>Therefore, the numerator in the probabilty expression above is 108! / (54! * 54!), and the correct odds are</p><p>(108! / (54! *54!))/(2^108) or approximately 0.0766.</p><p>This is considerably greater than 1/2^27, or about 0.00000000745.<span>  </span>To illustrate this result, consider the following enumerable example:<span>  </span>What are the odds of a 4 game match ending in a 2-2 tie?<span>  </span>Again, the method above predicts that odds are</p><p>(4! / (2! * 2!))/(2^4)<span>  </span>=<span>  </span>(24 / (2 * 2))/(16)<span>  </span>= 6/16.</p><p>The answer suggested by the narrator of <u>IJ</u> would be 1/(2^1) = 1/2.<span>  </span>To see which is correct, we can list all 16 possible outcomes as follows:</p><p>AAAA<span>   </span>ABAA<span>                </span>BAAA<span>                </span>BBAA</p><p>AAAB<span>   </span>ABAB<span>                </span>BAAB<span>                </span>BBAB</p><p>AABA<span>   </span>ABBA<span>                </span>BABA<span>                </span>BBBA</p><p>AABB<span>    </span>ABBB<span>                </span>BABB<span>                </span>BBBB</p><p>Clearly, there are six outcomes resulting in a 2-2 tie (AABB, ABAB, ABBA, BAAB, BABA, and BBAA), so the odds are, indeed, 6/16 as the method above predicts.</p><p>The second significant instance of dubious math in <u>IJ</u> occurs in a footnote on pages 1023 and 1024.<span>  </span>In this section Mike Pemulis describes to Hal how the Mean Value Theorem for integrals can be used to distribute megatons of thermonuclear weapons among Eschaton combatants.<span>  </span>The Mean Value Theorem for integrals states that, for a function<span>  </span><em>f(x) </em>that is continunous on the interval from <em>x = a</em> to <em>x = b</em>,</p><p>the integral from <em>a </em>to <em>b </em>of<span>  </span><em>f(x)dx = f(x&#39;)(b - a) </em><span> </span>for some value <em>x&#39; </em><span> </span>between <em><span> </span>a</em> and <em>b.</em></p><p>In effect, this theorem simply states that the area underneath the curve described by the function <em><span> </span>f(x)</em> from <em>x = a</em> to <em>x = b</em> is exactly the same as the area of a rectangle whose width extends from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> and whose height has a value of <em><span> </span>f(x&#39;)</em> for some value <em>x&#39;<span>  </span></em>between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.<span>  </span>Now, while Pemulis&#39; description of the theorem is essential correct, the problem in this footnote is the way the theorem is supposedly applied.<span>  </span>Specifically, the Mean Value Theorem for integrals is a theoretical tool for proving the <em>existence</em> of this particular <em>x&#39;.<span>  </span></em>It does not, however, offer any method of finding the <em>value</em> of<span>  </span><em>x&#39;</em>.<span>  </span>Therefore, it is difficult to imagine how the Mean Value Theorem for integrals could be employed in Pemulis&#39; Eschaton calculations.<span>  </span>Incidently, the third, minor error, which may very well be typographical, also occurs on page 1024 in this footnote.<span>  </span>Note that the abstract statement of the Mean Value Theorem for integrals which appears in the text (i.e., <em><span> </span>f(x)dx = f(x&#39;)(b - a) </em>) is missing the sign for the integral from <em>a</em> to <em>b.</em></p><p>The final mathematical error that I noted occurs in a footnote on page 1063.<span>  </span>Again, Mike Pemulis is lecturing Hal, but this time he is helping Hal<span>  </span>prepare for the college board exams.<span>  </span>Pemulis states<span>  </span>that for the function <em>x^n</em>, the derivative is <em>nx + x^(n-1)</em>.<span>  </span>In fact, the correct expression is <em>nx^(n-1)</em>.<span>  </span>This, too, may be a typographical error.</p><p>As I have said, I have no theories to explain the existence of these errors.<span>  </span>I would, however, be interested in the thoughts of others.</p><p>Mike Strong</p></div></div>
