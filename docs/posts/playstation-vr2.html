    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/11/02/playstation-vr2-launches-in-february-at-549-99/">will launch</a> its PSVR2 headset on February 22nd priced at $549.99. The PSVR2 will be priced at $549.99 in the US, €599.99 across Europe, £529.99 in the UK, and ¥74,980 in Japan. The VR headset itself will include Sense controllers and stereo headphones, but a Sense controller charging station will be available separately, priced at $49.99 (€49.99 / £39.99 / ¥5,480).</p><p>Preorders for the PSVR2 will begin on November 15th, limited to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-vr2/register-to-pre-order/?smcid=psvr2-psd:homepagebanner:register">Sony’s PlayStation online store</a> in many markets, including the US, UK, France, and Germany. Games, including <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain, </em>will also be available to preorder later this month.</p><p>The PSVR2 headset is a major upgrade over the original, with an OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, and 4K HDR support. It also supports up to 120Hz for smoother frame rates and gameplay. The VR headset has four cameras built into the front of the display, so you won’t have to set up external cameras to follow your movements.
