    <h1>Where the time went during a &#34;laptop&#34; coding interview</h1>
    
    
<p>
Have you ever wondered where the time goes during a &#34;laptop&#34; coding 
interview?  This is one of those things where you bring in your own 
little laptop computer (or, they supply one, I guess) and you are 
expected to solve some problem on the spot.  They give you maybe 60-90 
minutes to do this, and they want to see it work, and have tests, and 
all of that good stuff.
</p>
<p>
The interviewer hands you a piece of paper and may or may not discuss 
it.  Then they set you loose and disappear for a while.  It&#39;s just you 
and your little machine, and maybe some music if you thought ahead.
</p>
<p>
Where does the time go?  The last time I went through it, it went 
something like this in my head:
</p>
<p>
(looks at paper) huh, okay, so, what are they giving me here.  I have to 
go get some text files from some Dropbox thing.  Okay, get on their 
guest network, go scarf down their files.  Two input files, two output 
files.  I&#39;m supposed to take the input and turn it into the output by 
running some algorithm they explain on rest of the sheet of paper.
</p>
<p>
The file is line-oriented, such that the first line is a number, and 
that says how many data lines will follow.  Then they have that many 
more lines, each with two numbers split by a space.  This didn&#39;t come 
from a DOS machine so it&#39;s not CRLF, at least.  It didn&#39;t come from an 
old-school Mac so it&#39;s not a bare CR, either.  It all ends with just a 
line feed, typical Unix stuff.
</p>
<p>
Right, so, I have to figure out some method to solve the actual problem 
they gave me, and then I have to write it.  But, I also need all of the 
stuff required to actually inhale this file and get the data to run 
through that &#34;engine&#34; I end up writing.  Joy.
</p>
<p>
So I guess I can just write something terrible to use fgets to read 
through this and give me a bunch of lines, then chop it up in some 
really terrible way, mash it through strtoul or something to make values 
out of them, and then probably call into my &#34;engine&#34; with the two 
arguments.  Joy.
</p>
<p>
Right, so, let&#39;s get going on the base level stuff and hope the 
algorithm starts setting into place while I do this.  I kinda-sorta have 
some idea for how to handle it but will need to try it and see how it 
goes, and I can&#39;t do that until I get something to actually throw 
numbers at it.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s get to it, then.  Hum, well, I don&#39;t have any of my personal 
library stuff here, so I guess I get to code it all up the old-school 
way.  Also, what are they going to be building this on?  I have no idea 
where they are in terms of compilers.  Let&#39;s assume C++98 just to be 
safe.
</p>
<p>
Okay, need to get the file, then read the file, so...
</p>
<pre class="terminal">int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, &#34;usage: %s &lt;file&gt;\n&#34;, argv[0]);
    exit(1);
  }
</pre>
<p>
... and of course this means we need stdio.h for fprintf and stdlib.h 
for exit right there, so add those #includes at the top.
</p>
<p>
Keep going.  Open the thing and yell if it&#39;s not there.  I normally 
have my own LOG stuff but not here.  Failing that I&#39;d usually fprintf 
something to stderr, give it a message and a format string and then jam 
strerror(errno) into it, but time is short.  perror is yucky but it&#39;s 
faster, so screw it, use that.
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  FILE* f = fopen(argv[1], &#34;r&#34;);
 
  if (!f) {
    perror(&#34;open&#34;);
    exit(1);
  }
</pre>
<p>
And now we need errno.h, too.  Go #include that.
</p>
<p>
Time to get that first line.  Let&#39;s just read it and totally ignore the 
fact that it could EOF on this read and we might not get anything, 
because, again, pressed for time here.  Crap, this is going to suck.
</p>
<p>
And, uh, crap, fgets leaves the newline on the end, so I have to tie 
that off.  Again, I guess I&#39;ll just assume I got something more than an 
empty line here and assume I can subtract 1 from strlen without going 
into the weeds.  This is exactly why I have all of this fancypants 
read-file-to-line stuff at home that was so painstakingly written!
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  char buf[1024];
 
  fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), f);
  buf[strlen(buf) - 1] = &#39;\0&#39;;
</pre>
<p>
Dirty.  So dirty.  And now we need a number from that.  strtoul would be 
the right sort of thing, then all of the error checking you&#39;re supposed 
to do, but that&#39;s a ton of work, and again, none of my home library set 
is here to save me (which already has that work done in it).  Screw it, 
atoi, and hope nothing comes along which doesn&#39;t work with that.
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  int input_lines = atoi(buf);
</pre>
<p>
[ Time check: it&#39;s already taken me 17 minutes just *writing this post* 
to get this far down.  I&#39;m going based on my notes and the code from 
that day several years ago.  Tick, tick, tick. ]
</p>
<p>
Better say what I got for debugging purposes.  Use stderr so it doesn&#39;t 
corrupt the output.
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  fprintf(stderr, &#34;XXX input lines: %d\n&#34;, input_lines);
</pre>
<p>
Now I guess it&#39;s time to start a loop that reads this crap and splits it 
up and stores it somewhere.  So, uhm...
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  map&lt;int, int&gt; input_jobs;  // key: start time, val: run time
 
  while (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), f)) {
    if (strlen(buf) &lt; 1) {
      continue;
    }
 
    buf[strlen(buf) - 1] = &#39;\0&#39;;
 
    char* sp = strchr(buf, &#39; &#39;);
 
    if (!sp) {
      fprintf(stderr, &#34;bad line (no space): %s\n&#34;, buf);
      exit(1);
    }
 
    *sp = &#39;\0&#39;;
    char* len_str = sp + 1;
 
    int start_at = atoi(buf);
    int run_for = atoi(len_str);
 
    input_jobs[start_at] = run_for;
  }
 
  fclose(f);
</pre>
<p>
SO MUCH BADNESS HERE.  Gotta go add stuff up top: #include &lt;map&gt; 
and using std::map.  I really hope they don&#39;t give me a duplicate start 
time or I&#39;ll squish the previous one.  (I think they said something 
like &#34;this won&#39;t happen&#34;, but why would you ever trust that?)
</p>
<p>
Again with the blindly assuming we have usable data for atoi... and the 
bad line thing with no space thing, well, that&#39;s also not supposed to 
happen, but again, I don&#39;t trust them that much.  I&#39;m willing to barrel 
through some stupidity, but this would do terrible things when it gets a 
NULL back from strchr and then tries to dereference it later, so instead 
of writing yet another terrible &#39;80s C pointer hole, let&#39;s just die.
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, I guess I should make sure they gave me what they told me 
they&#39;d give me, since I&#39;m reading to EOF.
</p>
<p>
Go back in above the loop...
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  int actual = 0;
</pre>
<p>
... and in the loop ...
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  ++actual;
</pre>
<p>
... and after the loop:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  if (actual != input_lines) {
    fprintf(stderr, &#34;expected %d got %d\n&#34;, input_lines, actual);
    exit(1);
  }
</pre>
<p>
Right, so now I&#39;ll know if that&#39;s screwy for some reason at least.
</p>
<p>
[ Time check: 27 minutes elapsed in writing this post. ]
</p>
<p>
Now I guess I get to iterate through the data I read and do something 
useful with it.  Oh yeah, by reading it in first and not &#34;streaming&#34; it, 
I&#39;ve basically committed myself to an O(n) memory situation at best, and 
it&#39;ll probably end up worse than that.  So this temporary &#34;read into a 
map&#34; thing will probably have to go at some point, and I&#39;ll call into 
the &#34;add something I just parsed&#34; from inside the for loop.  Joy.
</p>
<p>
Anyway.  Iterate.  But, okay, C++98, so old-school iteration, none of 
that &#34;for const auto&#34; stuff.
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  map&lt;int, int&gt;::const_iterator ii;
 
  int job_count = 0;
  for (ii = input_jobs.begin(); ii != input_jobs.end(); ++ii) {
    const int&amp; start_time = ii-&gt;first;
    const int&amp; run_time = ii-&gt;second;
    add_job(start, time, run_time, job_count++);
  }
</pre>
<p>
And obviously now we need something up above main that&#39;ll do this 
add_job, so let&#39;s write a stub to get that started.
</p>
<pre class="terminal">static void add_job(int start_time_raw, int run_time, int job_number) {
  fprintf(stderr, &#34;XXX add_job %d | %d | %d\n\n&#34;,
          start_time_raw, run_time, job_number);
  // XXX write me
}
</pre>
<hr/>
<p>
Okay.  I&#39;m going to stop there for now.  Realize that what you&#39;re seeing 
is the *final form* of that code.  There&#39;s a bunch of stuff that 
happened in-between.  For example, see how it&#39;s called &#34;start_time_raw&#34; 
in the add_job function?  That&#39;s because the start time value from the 
file turned out to be &#34;HHMM&#34;.  That is, 12:00 noon was in the file as 
&#34;1200&#34;.  1:45 PM was in the file as &#34;1345&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I had initially parsed it as something in the range 0-1439, because, 
well, given a system that lets you schedule stuff at a given time 
during the day with one-minute precision, <em>personally</em>, I&#39;d be using 
the &#34;number of minutes since midnight&#34; as the base.  They weren&#39;t.  
They were using human-readable time less the usual colon we put in the 
middle for readability!
</p>
<p>
How did I know 1439?  I&#39;ve written schedulers before, and a normal 
civil day that doesn&#39;t have any DST transitions in it is 1440 minutes 
long: 24 * 60.  I also know from writing those same schedulers that a 
week of those same non-DST days is 10080 minutes long, because that&#39;s 
just 24 * 60 * 7, and you run into that number a lot.  It gets baked 
into your head.  Or at least, it got baked into *my* head.  What can I 
say,
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/11/26/magic/">I&#39;m weird like that.</a>
</p>
<p>
So, it&#39;s start_time_raw because it hasn&#39;t been split up and turned into 
a value that&#39;ll make sense inside an array.  The first bits of code in 
the eventual add_job() ended up doing something terrible to change HHMM 
into &#34;minutes since midnight&#34; in the range 0-1439, like this:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">  int start_hour = start_time_raw / 100;
  int start_minute = start_time_raw % 100;
 
  int start_time = start_hour * 60 + start_minute;
</pre>
<p>
Awful, right?  No sanity-checking.  It just mods and divides and 
multiplies and adds and off it goes.
</p>
<p>
Now, at this point, I haven&#39;t done one damn thing towards actually 
working on the algorithm, and so I haven&#39;t even talked about it here
because I wanted to point out how much time goes into just getting the
foundation in place to let you actually do anything with the data.
</p>
<p>
Getting a filename, opening the file, reading the contents, turning them 
from text into numbers, putting them somewhere sensible and then 
starting to iterate through them takes some amount of time.  If you know 
exactly what you need when you sit down and start typing, you can 
probably rip through it in, I don&#39;t know, maybe 15-20 minutes?
</p>
<p>
But, can you do it in an interview, away from your 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/12/21/env/">usual setup,</a>
on a laptop keyboard, with the laptop screen, in a funny chair, on a 
weird desk, with the clock ticking, and someone (in theory) keeping 
tabs on you?  Also, you have the possibility of not getting the job 
riding on this.  You probably need the job to make money to keep your 
house or apartment, feed you and your loved ones, and all of that good 
stuff.
</p>
<p>
But hey, no pressure.
</p>
<p>
I went through this, and I had nothing at stake.  If I didn&#39;t get the 
job, big deal.  I didn&#39;t need the job.  I&#39;m also significantly older 
than your average new grad and have been worn down into not putting too 
much of my self-worth into what these interviewers might think of me or 
my code.
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;ve done this whole &#34;argc, argv, fgets into buf, squash the 
newline, do it in a loop, chop it up on a space and deal with the 
results&#34; in C probably over a hundred times in my life up to this 
point.  I know all of the parts.  I also know what parts can go wrong.  
I had to make a decision of what to skip and what to keep in terms of 
sanity-checking in the name of saving time.  I didn&#39;t have to spend 
time trying to make that work.  Someone who hasn&#39;t been down that road 
yet wouldn&#39;t have it so easy.
</p>
<p>
But... even so, I was still sweating like crazy, and felt like shit when 
it was over... even though, again, nothing was riding on this.  If I 
didn&#39;t get the job then I wouldn&#39;t end up coworkers with some of my 
friends who wanted me there and had invited me to interview there.  I&#39;d 
just go back home and keep writing snarky tales about the industry, 
like this right here.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine you&#39;re 22, you need the job, and all of that stuff.  You 
have actual things at stake.  Imagine how you&#39;d feel, and what that 
would do to your problem-solving skills in the moment with that level of 
stress.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, when it came to this problem and I finally started working 
on the &#34;engine&#34; and the algorithm,  I picked the wrong implementation.  
I wound up focusing on the wrong &#34;axis&#34; in terms of how I imagined the 
solution working, and caught myself in a dead-end corner.  Ironically, 
my experience doing a scheduler (for people) previously had pointed me 
at trying to use that as the solution, and it didn&#39;t work for what they 
wanted here.
</p>
<p>
It wasn&#39;t after disconnecting from the problem and spending some time 
away from the computer that it came to me and I figured it out.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s that?  You don&#39;t have the time to disconnect and then come back 
to it, because you&#39;re being timed, and they&#39;re coming to check in on 
you soon?  Too bad!  Good luck figuring out where you went wrong.
</p>
<p>
That.  That right there is where the time goes.
</p>
<p>
