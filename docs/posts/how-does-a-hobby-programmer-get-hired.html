    <h1>Ask HN: How does a hobby programmer get hired?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been tinkering with code since a young age and I like thinking my way through problems and understanding the way computers work, but I&#39;ve never had a programming job. For the longest time, I went in other directions even though I enjoy it a lot, because I was told that I shouldn&#39;t spend my life in front of a computer. It turns out that I do that anyway, just not being paid for it.</p><p>Without any programming jobs on my CV, what is a good way to penetrate into the market? I&#39;ve had job interviews where I did a bunch of coding challenges (and passed), but didn&#39;t get accepted because of lack of experience. I considered that maybe I need to do a bootcamp as an initial way to back my skills up.</p></div></div></div>
