I’ve moved around a lot these past few years, and my friends are scattered cross-country, from Los Angeles to New York, Austin to San Francisco. </p><p>The pandemic further cemented the slow dissolution of many relationships I wish to rekindle but are complicated by the sheer fact of geography. This year in particular, after moving from LA to SF, I saw many dear friends much less frequently; it had an undeniable impact on my emotional well-being and resilience. </p><p>All this is to say: These past few months have underlined the importance of deep and meaningful relationships to me. Time and time again, when life gets rough, it is my friends who consistently show me the love and compassion I am unable to give myself, gently lifting me back up into the light. </p><p><strong>Punchline: </strong><span>How do we help people build and nurture meaningful relationships? It’s perhaps the most important question we should be addressing in the mental health space. </span></p><p>Tackling the loneliness epidemic will be no easy challenge—and not everyone can move close to their friends—but it’s a great goal to strive for. The good thing is, the first step can be very simple. A text to an old friend, a coffee with a new one. Little moments of connection spark more connection, and connection goes a long way. </p><div data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://headlineshq.substack.com/p/issue-no-029-live-near-your-friends?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p><span>Thanks for reading ☁️🍄.
