    <h1>Friday.app is shutting down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, I&#39;m bummed to say that we will be shutting down Friday and ceasing operations. <strong>The app will be turned off on June 3rd, 2022.</strong> </p><p>If you are a Friday customer, please continue to read more about next steps and how we aim to make this transition as smooth as possible for you.</p><h2 id="the-backstory">The backstory</h2><p>I started Friday (originally it was called Friday Feedback) as a nights and weekends project back in 2016 after spending a few years working remotely. Despite the autonomy and lack of a commute, working from anywhere still felt way too tough. I didn&#39;t know what people were working on, I didn&#39;t know my coworkers, and I didn&#39;t really understand how my work fit into the bigger picture.</p><p>After working on this side project for a few years, I decided I had to pursue the opportunity full-time. If I didn&#39;t, <em>I would always regret it if I didn&#39;t try</em>. In the fall of 2019, we raised a pre-seed round of investment and I jumped in FT and hired a few engineers.</p><p>Fast forward a few months - we publicly launched the new version a couple weeks before Covid arrived in the US. For the next two years, remote work became the new normal. We raised a seed round in the Fall of 2020 and continued to build.</p><p>Today, the number of organizations that offer remote/flexible work has exploded. It&#39;s been amazing to see this change despite the circumstances. This flexibility is good for society and leads to stronger families, engaged local communities, and a better work/life balance.</p><h2 id="why-are-you-shutting-down-friday">Why are you shutting down Friday?</h2><p>Despite adding 100k users in the last 12 months, we struggled to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Who is the buyer?</li><li>What is the willingness to pay? Where do we find budget?</li><li>Is Friday a replacement to an existing tool like a wiki, or a brand-new one?</li></ul><p>Additionally, there&#39;s a lot of competition in the &#34;productivity space&#34; and there was a growing interest in investing in this type of tooling. This created a lot more competition in this market.</p><p>Ultimately, I didn&#39;t have enough clarity to continue pursuing additional investment and as a byproduct, growing the business. The pain-point we aimed to solve is still a very big issue, but I believe over time existing tools (docs, project management, HRIS) will work to solve the problems people face when working outside of the office.</p><h2 id="im-a-paid-customer-what-happens-next">I&#39;m a paid customer, what happens next?</h2><p>We are suspending billing effective immediately, so you will no longer be charged, but you will continue to have access to the product for the next 60 days. <strong>You will have until June 3rd, 2022 to migrate any/all data from Friday before we turn off the application.</strong> If you have paid annually, we will be issuing a pro-rated refund for unused time on the subscription.</p><p>Our aim is to do everything we can to make sure that the transition is as smooth as possible. </p><h2 id="i-have-a-free-account-what-happens-next">I have a free account, what happens next?</h2><p>You will continue to have access to the product for the next 60 days (June 3rd) and will be unable to upgrade to a paid account. After that, you will no longer have access to use the product.</p><h2 id="id-like-to-export-my-data-what-do-i-do">I&#39;d like to export my data, what do I do?</h2><p>We have created the ability to export all data in a zip file in a variety of formats (CSV, json, PDF). Please visit <a href="https://my.friday.app/settings/export">this page</a> to start this process. For larger teams and organizations, we can provide assistance to accelerate the transition.</p><h2 id="do-you-have-any-recommendations-for-other-products-i-can-use-instead-of-friday">Do you have any recommendations for other products I can use instead of Friday?</h2><p>It all depends on how you use Friday, but we have a few recommendations!</p><ul><li><strong>Company Home: </strong>checkout <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/atlas">Atlas</a> by Atlassian if you want a centralized place to share updates, centralize knowledge, and get to know your team. </li><li><strong>Daily planning/project management: </strong>checkout <a href="https://clickup.com/">ClickUp</a> or <a href="https://sunsama.com/">Sunsama</a>.</li><li><strong>Docs/Wiki: </strong>look into <a href="http://coda.io/">Coda</a>, <a href="https://almanac.io/">Almanac</a>, or <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>.<strong> </strong></li><li><strong>Chrome Extension:</strong> look into <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en">Momentum</a></li></ul><p>If you are looking for more customization for status updates, you can try building an internal version of Friday check-ins with <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> or <a href="https://www.airtable.com/">Airtable</a>.</p><h2 id="id-like-to-talk-to-someone-at-friday-what-should-i-do">I&#39;d like to talk to someone at Friday, what should I do?</h2><p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please drop us a note at support@friday.app or you can email me directly at luke@friday.app. We&#39;d be happy to help.</p><h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h2><p>I want to thank all our users, customers, investors, and employees for giving Friday a shot.

I&#39;ve learned a lot, and I regret nothing.</p></div></div>
