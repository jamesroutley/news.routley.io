<!--?xml encoding="utf-8"?--><p>Today Blender development is moving to a new platform, hosted on projects.blender.org. The move has been announced and documented in several articles and documents, so here we will focus on the expected results of the move.</p>



<p><a href="https://projects.blender.org">projects.blender.org</a> is the new platform for bug reporting, task management and code review.</p>



<ul>
<li>Bug reports and design tasks have been migrated to projects.blender.org. This includes task status, priority, labels and subscribers.</li>



<li>User accounts have been migrated to Blender ID. If you had a Blender ID account, the username is now set to the one from the profile there. If you did not, a new Blender ID account was created. Please contact <a href="https://id.blender.org/about">Blender ID support</a> in case of any problems, or reach out through the <a href="https://blender.chat/channel/blender-developers-migration-support">dedicated chat channel</a>.</li>



<li>Code reviews and pastes have not been migrated but archived. Pending code reviews need to be <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Tools/CodeReview">resubmitted as pull requests</a>.</li>



<li>Workboards and project descriptions will be manually recreated by the modules.</li>
</ul>



<a href="#new-urls"><h2 id="new-urls">New URLs</h2></a>



<p>The Git repositories have changed location. If you have an existing Blender checkout, point to the new location as follows:</p>



<pre><code>git remote set-url origin https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender.git</code></pre>



<pre><code>git fetch origin main</code></pre>



<pre><code>git submodule sync</code></pre>



<p>The development branch is now named main instead of master. To get the latest changes, switch as follows:</p>



<pre><code>git checkout main</code></pre>



<pre><code>make update</code></pre>



<p>For developers:</p>



<ul>
<li>For push access to repositories, <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Tools/Git_Gitea#Commit_Access">set the remote url to SSH and re-upload your SSH key</a>.</li>



<li>Follow the <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Tools/CodeReview">pull request instructions</a> to create a fork.</li>



<li>Find <a href="https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gitea-workflows-and-module-help-needed/27541" data-type="URL" data-id="https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gitea-workflows-and-module-help-needed/27541">additional information for developers and module members</a> on devtalk.</li>
</ul>



<p>The developer.blender.org website is now archived.</p>



<ul>
<li>Code reviews and pastes will remain permanently available as static web pages at the same location as before.</li>



<li>Tasks links are redirected to projects.blender.org. A static archive of tasks is also available on archive.blender.org/developer.</li>



<li>The developer.blender.org website will remain available as read-only for a few weeks to help in migration, in particular for workboards.</li>
</ul>



<p>Given the scope of the migration, some data might not have been correctly migrated. If you see an issue, please report it in the comments below.</p>



<p>Congratulations to the migration task force: Arnd, Brecht, Danny, Sergey, and Sybren, with support from Dalai, Thomas, Pablo, and Philipp.</p>



<p>Special thanks to the Gitea project and all the blender.org developers community!</p>
