                <li>This is a work in progress and nowhere close to completion</li>

                Some paragraphs are coherent; others are not. 
                Sometimes paragraphs are only a phrase or a note to myself.
                Nothing has been professionally edited.

                I&#39;ve been developing the pages in Edge using Visual Studio Code 
                running under Windows 11 on a Microsoft Surface Pro 9.
                I&#39;ve also been testing the pages in Chrome on that machine, and   
                in Safari on a Mac Mini running Sequoia, and 
                in Chrome (version 126, it says) on an Asus Chromebook.

                However, my iPad Mini running iOS 12.5.7 has several 
                problems with these webpages, 
                and the pages often become quite awkward on phones.
