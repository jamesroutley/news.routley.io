<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Game development serves as a vibrant canvas for one&#39;s creativity. Especially when focusing on small games, which are simple to create and instantly enjoyable, one can quickly immerse oneself in their allure. Through this article, I aim to delve into the joy of crafting small games.</p>
<p>In the section <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/fun_to_make_small_games.html" target="_blank">&#34;Making Small Games, Which Is Fun in Itself&#34;</a>, the essence of what small games are and why creating them is enjoyable will be explored. Developing small games is not merely a training ground for bigger projects, but it holds its unique charm.</p>
<p>When embarking on creating a small game, deciding on which programming language or game engine to utilize is an initial hurdle. In the <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/device_and_environment.html" target="_blank">&#34;Target Devices and Development Environment&#34;</a> section, I have gathered information regarding these concerns.</p>
<p>Conceiving the core idea is key to small game creation. The section <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/ideas/" target="_blank">&#34;How to Come Up with Ideas for Small Games&#34;</a> provides tips on brainstorming such ideas. Furthermore, in <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/restrictions/" target="_blank">&#34;Constraints: A Catalyst for Creativity and Game Completion&#34;</a>, the method of imposing constraints on game input methods or resolution to foster better ideas is discussed.</p>
<p>In small games, it’s common for the gameplay to gradually become more challenging as the game progresses. <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/difficulty/" target="_blank">&#34;What Constitutes Appropriate Difficulty in Small Games&#34;</a> deliberates on how to set a level of difficulty that players find moderately challenging.</p>
<p>A game is dull without some flavor. In <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/make_game_juicy.html" target="_blank">&#34;Making Games ‘Juicy’&#34;</a>, the methods to enrich the game by adding effects and sound, centering around the term &#39;juicy&#39;, are introduced.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/tools/" target="_blank">&#34;Creating Your Own Game Development Tools&#34;</a>, the narrative extends to creating custom libraries or game engines alongside your game. While crafting tools for the game is immensely enjoyable, it’s a double-edged sword as diving too deep may hinder the game’s completion.</p>
<p>For the quick creation of small games, there’s a method of auto-generating graphics and sound. <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/procedural/" target="_blank">&#34;Enhancing Development through Automation&#34;</a> introduces ways to have the computer generate pixel art, background music, sound effects, and levels.</p>
<p>If computers could create games, they would further ease human effort. <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/generation/" target="_blank">&#34;Can Small Games Be Self-Generated?&#34;</a> contemplates the possibility of computers developing games from scratch, focusing on the utilization of AI chatbots.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve woven various topics concerning small game development throughout this article. Through this narrative, I hope readers will feel the charm of small game development, and that this may serve as a catalyst for many to take up the challenge of creation.</p>
