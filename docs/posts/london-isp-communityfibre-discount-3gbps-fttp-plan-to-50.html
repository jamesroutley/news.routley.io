<p>The new deal will be available to order from now until <strong>29th June 2022</strong>, although the special offer on their top 3Gbps tier – one of the fastest broadband packages in the UK – is only available for the first 150 subscribers to take it. Alternatively, they’ve also discounted their 500Mbps plan to just £27 per month for 24-months (£42.50 thereafter).</p>
<p>New <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/go/communityfibre" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="communityfibre">CommunityFibre</a> customers can expect to receive a free installation, symmetric speeds and unlimited usage. The 3Gbps package also gives you a high-end <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/wifi" target="_blank" rel="" title="wifi" data-chref="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/broadband_wireless.php">WiFi</a> 6 router, which also features a 10Gbps <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/lan" target="_blank" rel="" title="Local Area Network" data-chref="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/jargon/jargon_detail.php?LAN---Local-Area-Network-50">LAN</a> port and that’s not something we often see with consumer-focused broadband packages.</p>
