  <p>I have to admit it’s getting better </p>

  <p>– Lennon-McCartney</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in <strong>2021</strong>, somebody released an <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-kClj7YhRg">AI-generated album in the style of the Beatles</a></strong>. Well, maybe “album” is too strong a word, since it was only fifteen minutes long. Also it wasn’t really “music” in the traditional sense. I don’t know how to describe it exactly. Some sort of <strong>music-like audio document</strong>? It was all garbled and weird, definitely not something you would just put on and listen to like music.</p>

<p>Still though, I was blown away. Despite everything, <strong>it really sounded like the Beatles</strong>. This was back before ChatGPT blew up, before AI came to mainstream attention. It was a major <strong>wow moment</strong> for me. I had had the usual skepticism: computers will never be able to make music, computers will never be able to do this or that, etc. Even thought it was just a crude proof of concept, this “album” (or whatever you want to call it) changed my mind. It made me think: <em>this technology is real, and even if today’s AI-generated “music” is gibberish, tomorrow’s may not be.</em></p>

<p>Now it is <strong>2025</strong>, and <strong>full-blown real music is being produced by AI</strong>. No need for scare quotes – it is <em>actual, listenable</em> music. And I don’t just mean formulaic genre junk like EDM, muzak, lofi beats, etc. I mean <strong>genuinely novel, artistically interesting music</strong>. And “here today” I would like to highlight a particular example: <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv0L5Cjn0og">The Beach Boys Sing The Beatles</a></em></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/ai-generated-music/the-beach-boys-sing-the-beatles.jpg" alt="img"/></p>

<p>I don’t think the correct <strong>vocabulary or conceptual framework</strong> has yet been developed to discuss a work like this, so bear with me. Basically this is <strong>an album in the style of the Beach Boys where all of the lyrics are from Beatles songs</strong>. The songs are <em>not covers of Beach Boys songs</em> and they are <em>not covers of Beatles songs</em> – they are “original” Beach Boys-like songs with seemingly random snippets of recognizable Beatles lyrics.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize a few points.</p>

<p>First, <strong>this album is amazing. I cannot stop listening to it. It is so good.</strong> It is sometimes claimed that <strong>“real music”</strong> must, by definition, be produced by humans. Well, if this isn’t real music, <em>what have I been whistling to myself all week?</em> Am I some kind of cretin who cannot identify music? Or is it possible, on the other hand, that the human-creation criterion is just a pointless restriction on the definition of music?</p>

<p>Second, we have these expressions <em>“in the style of the Beach Boys”</em> or <em>“Beach Boys-like”</em>. These <strong>crummy circumlocutions</strong> really sell it short: <strong>this album sounds just like the Beach Boys</strong>. And not just cornball striped-shirt surfboards-and-cars Beach Boys. I’m talking about late-60s Brian-at-his-peak fire-helmet Beach Boys. The whole gang is there: Carl, Mike, everyone. And they all sound great. “Carl” in particular has some moments that give me chills, matching his most soulful <em>Wild Honey</em> vocals.</p>

<p>Third, it is difficult to figure out where to start discussing a work like this. For one thing, it is not obvious whether it even is a “work”, or what kind of “work” it is. As I said before, I don’t think the vocabulary or conceptual framework exists to discuss this cogently. <strong>The technology is just too new and too dazzling, and traditional theories of art interpretation and criticism have not caught up.</strong></p>

<p>But I would say on its face there are two way to discuss it. The first is <strong>as what it actually is</strong>, namely an AI-generated album from 2025. Who made it? How exactly was it made? To what extent was there human involvement in its production? I don’t know the answers to any of these questions.</p>

<p>The last question is especially important. In my own experience dealing in AI-generated stuff (images, code, etc), I find that <strong>there is a lot of garbage to sort through</strong>. It’s rarely the case that you get what you want on the first try. Maybe you get something close to what you want, but not quite. The prompt-evaluate-retry loop can go on for a while. So while the output is “AI-generated”, there may be a substantial <strong>human-influenced selection bias</strong> in what the final work ends up actually being.</p>

<p>Digging a little further into the specific content of the album, I am most interested to know <strong>how the particular Beatles lyrics were chosen</strong>. By human? By AI? It is, to put it mildly, a “very strange” selection. If you are able to listen to it and identify all the songs used, I would call you a <strong>Beatles expert</strong>.</p>

<p>Anyway, that is the first way to discuss this album. The second way to discuss it is as an <strong>alternative history work</strong>. It is sometimes claimed (again, by definition) that the work is not actually what is important about art; what is important instead is the <strong>process that led to the creation of the work</strong>.</p>

<p>In this case, it is easy to imagine a <strong>backstory</strong> that could have led to the creation of this album. Consider: <em>The Beatles broke up in 1969. Brian Wilson, who had for years been driven by friendly competition with the Beatles, was inspired to take a bunch of random lines from Beatles songs and set them to new music. The album was released in 1970 to a combination of puzzlement and acclaim.</em></p>

<p>This is an <strong>eminently plausible scenario</strong>. It didn’t happen, but it very well might have. And in that case, what would be the place of <em>BBSB</em> in the Beach Boys canon? How would it be understood in relation to <em>Pet Sounds</em> and <em>Smile</em>? How would the Beatles themselves have responded? Sure, <em>BBSB</em> doesn’t have a real historical context, but that doesn’t mean that these counterfactuals can’t be pondered.</p>

<p>(Things probably would have gone better for the Beach Boys if they had released this album. <strong>It’s a lot better than what actually did happen</strong>: Brian went nuts, and the rest of the band, lacking any direction or vision, spent the early 70s releasing a string of dull, lifeless, forgettable albums.)</p>

<p>Listen, I could go on all day about this album. In fact, I have been doing that – my family and friends are sick of hearing about it. So I’ll wrap this up with a takeaway message: <strong>AI-generated music is here and it’s real</strong>. People are still saying that it’s nothing but hype, it’s just a big scam, it will always sound janky and unnatural and weird, it will never be “truly musical”, etc. If you believe any of this, I strongly encourage you to listen to <em>The Beach Boys Sing The Beatles</em> and reassess.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Did you listen to <em>BBSB</em>? If so, what did you think?</li>
  <li>Which Beatles lyrics were you able to identify? Which were you unable to identify?</li>
  <li>Are there any obvious AI-artifacts? Anything that clearly sounds bad, off, unmusical, etc?</li>
  <li>What are the “inspirations” behind the album? Are there any specific moments from the album that are clearly ripped off from existing songs?</li>
  <li>To what extent is <em>BBSB</em> an “original” musical work? To what extent does it manage to sidestep the problem of “originality” by openly relying on preexisting Beach Boys sounds and Beatles lyrics?</li>
  <li>If the Beach Boys actually had released <em>BBSB</em>, to what extent would it have been “original”?</li>
  <li>Other than its lyrics, does music consist of anything apart from its pitches, rhythms, timbres, etc?</li>
