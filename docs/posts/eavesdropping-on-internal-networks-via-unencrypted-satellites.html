      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky and carried out the most comprehensive public
          study to date of geostationary satellite communication. A shockingly large amount of sensitive traffic is
          being broadcast unencrypted, including critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government
          communications, private citizens’ voice calls and SMS, and consumer Internet traffic from in-flight wifi and
          mobile networks. This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few hundred dollars of consumer-grade
          hardware. There are thousands of geostationary satellite transponders globally, and data from a single
          transponder may be visible from an area as large as 40% of the surface of the earth.</p>

    <section id="whoisvuln">
      <h3>What type of network traffic was exposed?</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <h4>Cellular Backhaul</h4>
          <p>
            We observed unencrypted cellular backhaul data sent from the core network of multiple telecom providers and
            destined for specific cell towers in remote areas. This traffic included unencrypted calls, SMS, end user
            Internet traffic, hardware IDs (e.g. IMSI), and cellular communication encryption keys.
          </p>

          <h4>Military and Government</h4>
          <p>
            We observed unencrypted VoIP and internet traffic and encrypted internal communications from ships,
            unencrypted traffic for military systems with detailed tracking data for coastal vessel surveillance, and
            operations of a police force.
          </p>

          <h4>In‑flight Wi‑Fi</h4>
          <p>
            We observed unprotected passenger Internet traffic destined for in-flight Wi-Fi users on airplanes. Visible
            traffic included passenger web browsing (DNS lookups and HTTPS traffic), encrypted pilot flight‑information
            systems, and in‑flight entertainment.
          </p>

          <h4>VoIP</h4>
          <p>
            Multiple VoIP providers were using unencrypted satellite backhaul, exposing unencrypted call audio and
            metadata from end users.
          </p>

          <h4>Internal Commercial Networks</h4>
          <p>
            Retail, financial, and banking companies all used unencrypted satellite communications for their internal
            networks. We observed unencrypted login credentials, corporate emails, inventory records, and ATM networking
            information.
          </p>

          <h4>Critical Infrastructure</h4>
          <p>
            Power utility companies and oil and gas pipelines used GEO satellite links to support remotely operated
            SCADA infrastructure and power grid repair tickets.

      <h3>Has the Issue been Fixed?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          There is no single stakeholder responsible for encrypting GEO satellite communications. 
          Each time we discovered sensitive information in our data, we went through considerable effort to determine the responsible party,
          establish contact, and disclose the vulnerability. In several cases, the responsible party told us that they had deployed a remedy.
          For the following parties, we re-scanned with their permission and were able to verify a remedy had been deployed: <i>T-Mobile, WalMart, and KPU</i>.

      <h3>Who is Affected &amp; What Should They Do?</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>End Users</h4>
        <p>
          There is no way for end users to know if upstream providers are encrypting their traffic. Nearly all Internet
          browsing traffic was encrypted by end-user devices using TLS or QUIC, and cellular backhaul exposure was
          limited to a relatively small number of cell towers in specific remote areas. End users can encrypt network
          traffic they directly generate by using a VPN; for messaging and voice communications use end‑to‑end encrypted
          apps like Signal.
        </p>

        <h4>Organizations Using Satellite Communications</h4>
        <p>
          Satellite communication links should be treated like unsecured and public wireless networks. There are many
          opportunities for encryption: TLS can protect individual application traffic, IPsec or multipoint encrypted
          VPNs can encrypt networks, and satellite communication providers may offer encryption of the satellite beam.
          Encryption should be used at every layer as defense-in-depth protection against individual failures. Treat
          encryption as mandatory, not an add‑on.
        </p>

      <h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>What did your study do?</h4>
        <p>
          We set up a consumer-grade satellite dish on the roof of a university building in San Diego, California with a
          positioning motor and a consumer-grade TV tuner card to capture raw bytes. We then scanned for all
          transponders (position and frequency) visible from our fixed location, and wrote
          <a href="https://github.com/ucsdsysnet/dontlookup">custom protocol-parsing code</a>
          to reconstruct network packets from the quirky custom protocol stacks we reverse-engineered from different
          vendors. We observed 411 transponders across 39 GEO satellites, and our single fixed-location dish could
          receive IP traffic from 14% of all global Ku-band satellites.
        </p>


        <h4>Why aren&#39;t all GEO satellite links encrypted?</h4>
        <p>
          There are direct costs to enabling encryption. Encryption imposes additional overhead to an already limited
          bandwidth, decryption hardware may exceed the power budget of remote, off-grid receivers, and satellite
          terminal vendors can charge additional license fees for enabling link-layer encryption. In addition,
          encryption makes it harder to troubleshoot network issues and can degrade the reliability of emergency
          services. Some users may forgo encryption intentionally; others may be unaware these links are unencrypted or
          underestimate the risk and ease of eavesdropping attacks. While significant academic and activist attention
          has been put into ensuring nearly universal use of encryption for modern web browsers, there has been much
          less visiblity and attention paid to satellite network communications.
