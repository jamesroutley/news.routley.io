    <h1>An NFT without a Blockchain. No gas fees. No ETH. No gatekeepers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody"><p>This is a small proof-of-concept.  It relies on PGP - but you could use Keybase, GPG, or any other hard-to-use encryption program.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Suppose you want to support an artist and give them money. That&#39;s easy. Most artists take PayPal, bank transfer, or cash. But how can you prove that you&#39;ve paid an artist for a specific piece of work?  That is, in essence, all an NFT is - the seller signing a statement that the buyer has sent them money related to a thing.</p><p>Whether that claim can be meaningfully sold on to someone else is outside the scope of this discussion.</p><h2>The artist&#39;s signature</h2><p>Most cryptographic schemes let a user digitally sign a file. Essentially, all this says is &#34;this string of bits was seen by this user&#34;. It cannot say whether the signer was the person who <em>originally created</em> the file.</p><p>Here&#39;s an example.</p><pre><code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
I, Terence Eden, created &#34;monkey.jpg&#34; with a SHA512 hash of
123a887f3d5e7f246077eee40d0c073fa5ecad85d5b9bd130a87eb07408…
This token was created at 2021-12-25T01:02:03.5Z

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
</code></pre><p>Hey presto! Now the seller has a token - the above file - which offers strong proof that they were in possession of that exact <code>monkey.jpg</code> file.</p><p>(In reality, this would be a formal schema - JSON, ASN.1, XML, whatever - with lots of metadata. But for these examples, let&#39;s keep it simple and human readable.)</p><h2>The transaction</h2><p>The sale can go via any medium. Cash in hand, PayPal, bank transfer, or even unregulated cryptocurrency. The problem with Blockchain is that you cannot guard against off-chain transactions. There&#39;s nothing to stop me buying an NFT for 100ETH and the seller immediately returning that to me in cash.</p><p>Here&#39;s how a buyer can create their own &#34;receipt&#34; saying that they purchased the above token:</p><pre><code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
I, Luke Skywalker, have purchased &#34;monkey.jpg&#34; with a SHA512 hash of

</code></pre><p>Ta-da! The buyer now has a chain of cryptographically signed, Non-Fungible Tokens, which shows that an artist claims to have created a file and claims to have received funds from the buyer.</p><p>Sure, you can pad it out with a bit more back-and-forth, adding promises to sell, more thorough metadata. You could even use a publicly agreed-on Merkle Tree to add a bit more &#34;trust&#34;.</p><p>And that&#39;s how you mint an NFT with none of the baggage and none of the fees. Easy!</p><h2>Problems</h2><p>But there are a few drawbacks with this.</p><p>Without a published chain of transactions, there is no guarantee that the artist hasn&#39;t sold the same item multiple times.</p><p>Without a verified on-chain transaction, there is a risk that either the buyer or the seller may be lying about the transaction price.</p><p>Because there are no third-parties involved, there is no opportunity for escrow or complaint resolution.</p><p>To be clear - <em>all</em> of these problems are also present in &#34;traditional&#34; NFTs. Buyers have no idea of the provenance of the piece, there&#39;s nothing stopping multiple sales of visually identical artworks, scams are rife and smart-contracts are buggy.</p><p>But if you want to create an Non-Fungible Token - there&#39;s no reason to pay inflated &#34;gas&#34; fees. You don&#39;t need any centralised brokers or platforms. You can own your own ledger and be completely decentralised for free.</p><p>Web3 should be about <em>you</em> being in control - not endlessly paying micro-transactions to hundreds of gatekeepers.</p></div></div>
