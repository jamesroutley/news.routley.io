Our new watches will change from being called Core 2 Duo â†’ Pebble 2 Duo, and Core Time 2 â†’ Pebble Time 2. </p><p>The big news today is that weâ€™re revealing the final design for Pebble Time 2. The design that we showed off back in March were preliminary designs. We&#39;ve been able to tweak and improve the industrial design quite a bit since then. I think itâ€™s turned out fantastically well! I even have a working albeit early engineering sample on my wrist.</p><p><img src="http://tinylogger.com/assets/pebble-time-2-design-reveal-0-image.png" alt="Early production sample - not final quality/finish yet!!!"/></p><p>Early production sample - not final quality/finish yet!!!</p><p>A few more glamour shots:</p><p><img src="http://tinylogger.com/assets/pebble-time-2-design-reveal-1-bolt_hero_01_blue_lighter.png"/></p><p><img src="http://tinylogger.com/assets/pebble-time-2-design-reveal-2-3020a181-3a95-4c83-91d4-5b872c69e76a.png"/></p><p>Hereâ€™s how the design compares to the initial version we showed off in March at the launch</p><p><video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="/assets/pebble-time-2-design-reveal-5-cleanshot_2025-07-31_at_17.27.57.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>CleanShot_2025-07-31_at_17.27.57.mp4</p><p>And <a href="https://imgur.com/a/LLo0qOf">compared to 2016 unreleased Pebble Time 2 </a>(we hardly knew ye).</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1grNZx7lqRmMBLsfQ8qxCHGTK9IiRhNRU?usp=sharing"><strong>Download these images</strong></a> (and more!) in high resolution</p><h3>Colourways</h3><p>Weâ€™re planning to release 4 different Pebble Time 2 colourways.
