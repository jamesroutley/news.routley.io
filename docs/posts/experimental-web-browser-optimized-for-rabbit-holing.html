    <h1>Experimental web browser optimized for rabbit-holing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/"><span>Cartographist</span></a></h2><p>Cartographist is an experimental web browser optimized for rabbit-holing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of opening new windows (with <code>cmd</code>-click), Cartographist spawns horizontally scrollable panes.</li>
<li>Instead of forcing you to find things in a linear history, Cartographist shows a tree-structured outline of your browsing:

<li>Instead of always starting fresh, Cartographist can save, and load &#34;trails&#34; — the exact state of the session you&#39;ve left — supporting researching topics over long periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more context about the project, you can check out the longer write-up below, which originally appeared as a part of <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/"><span>Q4 2021</span></a> newsletter.</p>

<h2>Transcluded from <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/#cartographist"><span>Cartographist</span></a></h2>
          
<p>During the summer of 2020 I played around with an idea for research-focused web browser, embodying some of the concepts from <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/notes/browsing-vs-searching/"><span>Browsing vs Searching</span></a> note — <em>browsing</em> being an open-ended divergent activity, and <em>searching</em> understood as information retrieval.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/szymon_k/status/1289942401318977537" target="_blank"><span>I shared a preview on Twitter</span><span> ↗</span></a>, to a surprisingly overwhelming response, but I got distracted with other things and never got back to the project. I still occasionally get requests for sharing this, so here it is: <a href="https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist" target="_blank"><span>szymonkaliski/Cartographist</span><span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>The main idea of browsing in panes was inspired by <a href="http://andymatuschak.org" target="_blank"><span>Andy Matuschak&#39;s website layout</span><span> ↗</span></a> and some of <a href="http://nateparrott.com" target="_blank"><span>Nate Parrot&#39;s</span><span> ↗</span></a> experiments around stacking mobile web browser views next to each other (which I can&#39;t seem to find anymore, sorry).
This sort of layout has a long history, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns" target="_blank"><span>Miller columns</span><span> ↗</span></a> and the original Smalltalk class browser, and is a great interface for detail-in-context browsing.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also use this technique for navigating code with Vim, where a single shortcut goes to a definition of a function in a new pane:</p>
<p><img src="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/vim-panes.jpg" loading="lazy" width="3536" height="1790"/></p><p>(<a href="https://gtoolkit.com" target="_blank"><span>Glamorous Toolkit</span><span> ↗</span></a> is worth checking out, as it takes the idea of pane browsing to another level)</p>
<p>In theory, I also really like the idea of disk-persisted history which allows for going back to a browsing session after a while, and consciously deciding which &#34;topic&#34; I am in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in practice, I don&#39;t think having the full history is that useful.
Yes, it&#39;s sometimes good to know how you ended up somewhere, but I think what&#39;s most valuable about &#34;research&#34; is the synthesis part — grabbing parts of larger wholes, rearranging, recombining, thinking with the material.
A small step in this direction could be persisting scroll position or maybe selection, and making the history editable — allowing users to remove dead ends, add notes, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, it started to feel that I&#39;m solving this problem on a wrong level.
For example, a good window manager could replace Cartographist almost completely —
I played around with columnar layout in <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/hhtwm/"><span>HHTWM</span></a> for a bit, but lack of horizontal scrolling makes it not that useful in the end.</p>
<p>Well, let me know if you have any ideas how to make Cartographist better! Is there anything interesting here that I&#39;m not seeing? Could it be useful to you in any way?</p>
