            <h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>A Bank of England and HM Treasury publication</h3>
<p>The way we use money is changing. This Consultation Paper sets out our assessment of the case for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) – a so-called ‘digital pound’. It has been overseen by the joint Bank-HM Treasury <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/the-digital-pound/cbdc-taskforce-terms-of-reference">CBDC Taskforce</a> that was announced in April 2021.</p>
<p>At this stage, we judge it likely that the digital pound will be needed in the future. It is too early to decide whether to introduce the digital pound, but we are convinced preparatory work is justified.</p>
<p>The digital pound would be a new form of sterling, similar to a digital banknote, issued by the Bank of England. It would be used by households and businesses for their everyday payments needs. It would be used in-store, online and to make payments to family and friends. If introduced, it would exist alongside, and be easily exchangeable with, cash and bank deposits.</p>
<p>The digital pound would maintain public access to retail central bank money and, as our lifestyles and the economy become ever more digital, it would also promote innovation, choice and efficiency in domestic payments.</p>
<p>During this consultation, HM Treasury and the Bank of England will engage extensively with stakeholders across the UK to seek views on the proposed model of the digital pound set out. Responses to this consultation are invited from all interested members of the public, experts, and organisations.</p>
