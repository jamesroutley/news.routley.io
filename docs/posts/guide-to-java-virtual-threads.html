        <p><em>Another tour de force by <a href="https://github.com/rcardin">Riccardo Cardin</a>. Riccardo is a proud alumnus of Rock the JVM, now a senior engineer working on critical systems written in Java, Scala and Kotlin.</em></p>

<p>Version 19 of Java came at the end of 2022, bringing us a lot of exciting stuff. One of the coolest is the preview of some hot topics concerning Project Loom: <em>virtual threads</em> (<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/425">JEP 425</a>) and <em>structured concurrency</em> (<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/428">JEP 428</a>). Whereas still in a preview phase (to tell the truth, structured concurrency is still in the incubator module), the two JEPs promise to bring modern concurrency paradigms that we already found in Kotlin (coroutines) and Scala (Cats Effect and ZIO fibers) also in the mainstream language of the JVM: The Java programming language.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s first introduce virtual threads. As we said, both projects are still evolving, so the final version of the features might differ from what we will see here. Future articles to come will focus on structured concurrency and other cool features of Project Loom.</p>

<h2 id="1-setup">1. Setup</h2>

<p>As we said, both the JEPs are still in the preview/incubation step, so we must enable them in our project. At the end of the article, we will give an example of a Maven configuration with all the needed dependencies and configurations. Here, we will just show the most important parts.</p>

<p>First, we need to use a version of Java that is at least 19. Then, we must give the JVM the <code>--enable-preview</code> flag. Although we will not talk about structured concurrency, we set up the environment to access it. So, we need to enable and import the <code>jdk.incubator.concurrent</code> module. Under the folder <code>src/main/java</code>, we need to create a file named <code>module-info.java</code> with the following content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>virtual</span><span>.</span><span>threads</span><span>.</span><span>playground</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requires</span> <span>jdk</span><span>.</span><span>incubator</span><span>.</span><span>concurrent</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The name of our module doesn’t matter. We used <code>virtual.threads.playground</code>, but we can use any name we want. The important thing is that we need to use the <code>requires</code> directive to enable the incubator module.</p>

<p>We’ll use Slf4j to log something on the console. So, all the code snippets in this article will use the following logger:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>final</span> <span>Logger</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>LoggerFactory</span><span>.</span><span>getLogger</span><span>(</span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, we won’t use the <code>logger</code> object directly in our example but the following custom function <code>log</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>message</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;{} | &#34;</span> <span>+</span> <span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>currentThread</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In fact, the above function allows us to print some helpful information concerning virtual threads that will be very handy in understanding what’s going on.</p>

<p>Moreover, we’ll also use Lombok to reduce the boilerplate code when dealing with checked exceptions. So, we’ll use the <code>@SneakyThrows</code>, which lets us treat checked exceptions as unchecked ones (don’t use it in production!). For example, we’ll wrap the <code>Thread.sleep</code> method, which throws a checked <code>InterruptedException</code>, with the <code>@SneakyThrows</code> annotation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span> <span>duration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>duration</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we’re in an application using Java modules, we need both dependencies and the required modules. The above module declaration then becomes the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>virtual</span><span>.</span><span>threads</span><span>.</span><span>playground</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requires</span> <span>jdk</span><span>.</span><span>incubator</span><span>.</span><span>concurrent</span><span>;</span>
  <span>requires</span> <span>org</span><span>.</span><span>slf4j</span><span>;</span>
  <span>requires</span> <span>static</span> <span>lombok</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="2-why-virtual-threads">2. Why Virtual Threads?</h2>

<p>For people who already follow us, we asked the same question in the article on <a href="https://blog.rockthejvm.com/kotlin-coroutines-101/">Kotlin Coroutines</a>. However, it is essential to briefly introduce the problem virtual threads are trying to solve.</p>

<p>The JVM is a multithreaded environment. As we may know, the JVM gives us an abstraction of OS threads through the type <code>java.lang.Thread</code>. <strong>Until Project Loom, every thread in the JVM is just a little wrapper around an OS thread</strong>. We can call the such implementation of the <code>java.lang.Thread</code> type as <em>platform thread</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with platform threads is that they are expensive from a lot of points of view. First, they are costly to create. Whenever a platform thread is made, the <strong>OS must allocate a large amount of memory (megabytes) in the stack to store the thread context, native, and Java call stacks</strong>. This is due to the not resizable nature of the stack. Moreover, whenever the scheduler preempts a thread from execution, this enormous amount of memory must be moved around.</p>

<p>As we can imagine, this is a costly operation, in space and time. In fact, the massive size of the stack frame limits the number of threads that can be created. We can reach an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> quite easily in Java, continually instantiating new platform threads till the OS runs out of memory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>stackOverFlowErrorExample</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100_000</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Thread</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
      <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>InterruptedException</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>RuntimeException</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}).</span><span>start</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The results depend on the OS and the hardware, but we can easily reach an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> in a few seconds:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[0.949s][warning][os,thread] Failed to start thread &#34;Unknown thread&#34; - pthread_create failed (EAGAIN) for attributes: stacksize: 1024k, guardsize: 4k, detached.
[0.949s][warning][os,thread] Failed to start the native thread for java.lang.Thread &#34;Thread-4073&#34;
Exception in thread &#34;main&#34; java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create native thread: possibly out of memory or process/resource limits reached
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example shows how we wrote concurrent programs that were constrained until now.</p>

<p>Java has been a language that has tried to strive for simplicity since its inception. In concurrent programming, we should write programs as if they were sequential. In fact, <strong>the more straightforward way to write concurrent programs in Java is to create a new thread for every concurrent task</strong>. This model is called <em>one task per thread</em>.</p>

<p>In such an approach, every thread can use its own local variable to store information. The need to share mutable states among threads, the well-known “hard part” of concurrent programming, drastically decreases. However, using such an approach, we can easily reach the limit of the number of threads we can create.</p>

<p>As we said in the article concerning Kotlin Coroutines, many approaches have risen in recent years to overcome the above problem. The first attempt was to introduce a model of programming based on callback. For each asynchronous statement, we also give a callback to call once the statement finishes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>callbackHell</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>a</span><span>(</span><span>aInput</span><span>,</span> <span>resultFromA</span> <span>-&gt;</span> 
    <span>b</span><span>(</span><span>resultFromA</span><span>,</span> <span>resultFromB</span> <span>-&gt;</span> 
      <span>c</span><span>(</span><span>resultFromB</span><span>,</span> <span>resultFromC</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>d</span><span>(</span><span>resultFromC</span><span>,</span> <span>resultFromD</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
          <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>out</span><span>.</span><span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;A, B, C, D: $resultFromA, $resultFromB, $resultFromC, $resultFromD&#34;</span><span>)))));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above code is a simple example of callback hell. The code is not easy to read and understand. Moreover, it is not easy to write.</p>

<p>To overcome the problems of callbacks, reactive programming, and async/await strategies were introduced.</p>

<p>The reactive programming initiatives try to overcome the lack of thread resources by building a custom DSL to declaratively describe the data flow and let the framework handle concurrency. However, DSL is tough to understand and use, losing the simplicity Java tries to give us.</p>

<p>Also, the async/await approach, such as Kotlin coroutines, has its own problems. Even though it aims to model the <em>one task per thread</em> approach, it can’t rely on any native JVM construct. For example, Kotlin coroutines based the whole story on <em>suspending functions</em>, i.e., functions that can suspend a coroutine. However, the suspension is wholly based upon non-blocking IO, which we can achieve using libraries based on Netty, but not every task can be expressed in terms of non-blocking IO. Ultimately, we must divide our program into two parts: one based on non-blocking IO (suspending functions) and one that does not. This is a challenging task; it takes work to do it correctly. Moreover, we lose again the simplicity we want in our programs.</p>

<p>The above are reasons why the JVM community is looking for a better way to write concurrent programs. Project Loom is one of the attempts to solve the problem. So, let’s introduce the first brick of the project: <em>virtual threads</em>.</p>

<h2 id="3-how-to-create-a-virtual-thread">3. How to Create a Virtual Thread</h2>

<p>As we said, virtual threads are a new type of thread that tries to overcome the resource limitation problem of platform threads. They are an alternate implementation of the <code>java.lang.Thread</code> type, which <strong>stores the stack frames in the heap (garbage-collected memory) instead of the stack</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the initial memory footprint of a virtual thread tends to be very small, a few hundred bytes instead of megabytes. In fact, the stack chunk can resize at every moment. So, we don’t need to allocate a gazillion of memory to fit every possible use case.</p>

<p>Creating a new virtual thread is very easy. We can use the new factory method <code>ofVirtual</code> on the <code>java.lang.Thread</code> type. Let’s first define a utility function to create a virtual thread with a given name:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>Runnable</span> <span>runnable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>ofVirtual</span><span>()</span>
    <span>.</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>runnable</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll use the same example in the Kotlin Coroutine article to show how virtual threads work. Let’s describe our morning routine. Every morning, we take a bath:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>bathTime</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span>
    <span>&#34;Bath time&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to take a bath&#34;</span><span>);</span>
      <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofMillis</span><span>(</span><span>500L</span><span>));</span>
      <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the bath&#34;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another task that we do is to boil some water to make tea:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>boilingWater</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span>
    <span>&#34;Boil some water&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to boil some water&#34;</span><span>);</span>
      <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
      <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the water&#34;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fortunately, we can race the two tasks to speed up the process and go to work earlier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>concurrentMorningRoutine</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>bathTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>bathTime</span><span>();</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>boilingWater</span> <span>=</span> <span>boilingWater</span><span>();</span>
  <span>bathTime</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
  <span>boilingWater</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We joined both virtual threads, so we can be sure that the <code>main</code> thread will not terminate before the two virtual threads. Let’s run the program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>08:34:46.217 [boilWater] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,boilWater]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to take a bath
08:34:46.218 [boilWater] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,boilWater]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m going to boil some water
08:34:46.732 [bath-time] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,boilWater]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m done with the bath
08:34:47.231 [boilWater] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,boilWater]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m done with the water
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output is what we expected. The two virtual threads run concurrently, and the <code>main</code> thread waits for them to terminate. We’ll explain all the information printed by the log in a while. For now, let’s focus solely on thread name and execution interleaving.</p>

<p>Besides the factory method, we can use a new implementation of the <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code> tailored on virtual threads, called <code>java.util.concurrent.ThreadPerTaskExecutor</code>. Its name is quite evocative. It creates a new virtual thread for every task submitted to the executor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>concurrentMorningRoutineUsingExecutors</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>executor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Executors</span><span>.</span><span>newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>bathTime</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>executor</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span>
        <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to take a bath&#34;</span><span>);</span>
          <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofMillis</span><span>(</span><span>500L</span><span>));</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the bath&#34;</span><span>);</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>boilingWater</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>executor</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span>
        <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to boil some water&#34;</span><span>);</span>
          <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the water&#34;</span><span>);</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>bathTime</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>boilingWater</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way we start threads is a little different since we’re using the <code>ExecutorService</code>. Every call to the <code>submit</code> method requires a <code>Runnable</code> or a <code>Callable&lt;T&gt;</code> instance. The <code>submit</code> returns a  <code>Future&lt;T&gt;</code> instance that we can use to join the underlying virtual thread.</p>

<p>The output is more or less the same as before:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>08:42:09.164 [] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to take a bath
08:42:09.164 [] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m going to boil some water
08:42:09.676 [] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m done with the bath
08:42:10.175 [] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m done with the water
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see, threads created this way do not have a name, and debugging errors without a name can be difficult. We can overcome this problem just by using the <code>newThreadPerTaskExecutor</code> factory method that takes a <code>ThreadFactory</code> as a parameter:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>concurrentMorningRoutineUsingExecutorsWithName</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>final</span> <span>ThreadFactory</span> <span>factory</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>ofVirtual</span><span>().</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;routine-&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>).</span><span>factory</span><span>();</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>executor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Executors</span><span>.</span><span>newThreadPerTaskExecutor</span><span>(</span><span>factory</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>bathTime</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>executor</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span>
        <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to take a bath&#34;</span><span>);</span>
          <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofMillis</span><span>(</span><span>500L</span><span>));</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the bath&#34;</span><span>);</span>
         <span>});</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>boilingWater</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>executor</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(</span>
        <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to boil some water&#34;</span><span>);</span>
          <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the water&#34;</span><span>);</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>bathTime</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>boilingWater</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A <code>ThreadFactory</code> is a factory that creates threads with the same configuration. In our case, we give the prefix <code>routine-</code> to the name of the threads, and we start the counter from 0. The output is the same as before, but now we can see the name of the threads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>08:44:35.390 [routine-1] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,routine-1]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m going to boil some water
08:44:35.390 [routine-0] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,routine-0]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to take a bath
08:44:35.900 [routine-0] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,routine-0]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the bath
08:44:36.399 [routine-1] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,routine-1]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the water
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we know how to create virtual threads let’s see how they work.</p>

<h2 id="4-how-virtual-threads-work">4. How Virtual Threads Work</h2>

<p>How do virtual threads work? The figure below shows the relationship between virtual threads and platform threads:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.rockthejvm.com/images/virtual-threads/java-virtual-threads.png" alt="Java Virtual Threads Representation"/></p>

<p><strong>The JVM maintains a pool of platform threads</strong>, created and maintained by a dedicated <code>ForkJoinPool</code>. Initially, the number of platform threads equals the number of CPU cores, and it cannot increase more than 256.</p>

<p>For each created virtual thread, the JVM schedules its execution on a platform thread, temporarily copying the stack chunk for the virtual thread from the heap to the stack of the platform thread. <strong>We said that the platform thread becomes the carrier thread of the virtual thread</strong>.</p>

<p>The logs we’ve seen so far showed us precisely the above situation. Let’s analyze one of them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>08:44:35.390 [routine-1] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,routine-1]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m going to boil some water
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exciting part is on the left side of the <code>|</code> character. The first part identifies the virtual thread in execution: <code>VirtualThread[#23,routine-1]</code> reports the thread identifier, the <code>#23</code> part, and the thread name. Then, we have the indication on which carrier thread the virtual thread executes: <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2</code> represents the platform thread called <code>worker-2</code> of the default <code>ForkJoinPool</code>, called <code>ForkJoinPool-1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>The first time the virtual thread blocks on a blocking operation, the carrier thread is released</strong>, and the stack chunk of the virtual thread is copied back to the heap. This way, the carrier thread can execute any other eligible virtual threads. Once the blocked virtual thread finishes the blocking operation, the scheduler schedules it again for execution. The execution can continue on the same carrier thread or a different one.</p>

<p>We can easily see that the number of available carrier threads is equal to the number of CPU cores by default running a program that creates and starts a number of virtual threads greater than the number of cores. On a Mac, you can retrieve the number of cores by running the following command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sysctl hw.physicalcpu hw.logicalcpu
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are interested in the second value, which counts the number of logical cores. On my machine, I have 2 physical cores and 4 logical cores. Let’s define a function to retrieve the number of logical cores in Java:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>int</span> <span>numberOfCores</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Runtime</span><span>.</span><span>getRuntime</span><span>().</span><span>availableProcessors</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we can create a program that makes the desired number of virtual threads, i.e., the number of logical cores plus one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>viewCarrierThreadPoolSize</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>final</span> <span>ThreadFactory</span> <span>factory</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>ofVirtual</span><span>().</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;routine-&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>).</span><span>factory</span><span>();</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>executor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Executors</span><span>.</span><span>newThreadPerTaskExecutor</span><span>(</span><span>factory</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>IntStream</span><span>.</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>numberOfCores</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>executor</span><span>.</span><span>submit</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Hello, I&#39;m a virtual thread number &#34;</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
          <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
        <span>}));</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We expect the 5 virtual threads to be executed on 4 carrier threads, and one of the carrier threads should be reused at least once. Running the program, we can see that our hypothesis is correct:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>08:44:54.849 [routine-0] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,routine-0]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | Hello, I&#39;m a virtual thread number 0
08:44:54.849 [routine-1] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,routine-1]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | Hello, I&#39;m a virtual thread number 1
08:44:54.849 [routine-2] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#24,routine-2]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3 | Hello, I&#39;m a virtual thread number 2

08:44:54.849 [routine-3] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#25,routine-3]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-4 | Hello, I&#39;m a virtual thread number 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are four carrier threads, <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1</code>, <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2</code>, <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3</code>, and <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-4</code>, and the <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-4</code> is reused twice. Awesome!</p>

<p>The above log should ring a bell in the astute reader. How the JVM schedules virtual threads on their carrier threads? Is there any preemption? Does the JVM use cooperative scheduling instead? Let’s answer these questions in the next session.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-scheduler-and-cooperative-scheduling">5. The Scheduler and Cooperative Scheduling</h2>

<p>Virtual threads are scheduled using a FIFO queue consumed by a dedicated <code>ForkJoinPool</code>. The default scheduler is defined in the <code>java.lang.VirtualThread</code> class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// SDK code</span>
<span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>VirtualThread</span> <span>extends</span> <span>BaseVirtualThread</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Configuring the pool dedicated to carrier threads is possible using the above system properties. The default pool size (parallelism) equals the number of CPU cores, and the maximum pool size is at most 256. The minimum number of core threads not blocked allowed is half the pool size.</p>

<p>In Java, <strong>virtual threads implement cooperative scheduling</strong>. As we saw for <a href="https://blog.rockthejvm.com/kotlin-coroutines-101/#6-cooperative-scheduling">Kotlin Coroutines</a>, it’s a virtual thread that decides when to yield the execution to another virtual thread. In detail, the control is passed to the scheduler, and <strong>the virtual thread is <em>unmounted</em> from the carrier thread</strong> when it reaches a blocking operation.</p>

<p>We can empirically verify this behavior using the <code>sleep()</code> method and the above system properties. First, let’s define a function creating a virtual thread that contains an infinite loop. Let’s say we want to model an employee that is working hard on a task:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>workingHard</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span>
      <span>&#34;Working hard&#34;</span><span>,</span>
      <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m working hard&#34;</span><span>);</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>alwaysTrue</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>// Do nothing</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofMillis</span><span>(</span><span>100L</span><span>));</span>
        <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with working hard&#34;</span><span>);</span>
      <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see, the IO operation, the <code>sleep()</code> method, is after the infinite loop. We also defined an <code>alwaysTrue()</code> function, which returns <code>true</code> and allows us to write an infinite loop without using the <code>while (true)</code> construct that is not permitted by the compiler.</p>

<p>Then, we define a function to let our employees take a break:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>takeABreak</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span>
      <span>&#34;Take a break&#34;</span><span>,</span>
      <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to take a break&#34;</span><span>);</span>
        <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
        <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the break&#34;</span><span>);</span>
      <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can compose the two functions and let the two thread race:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>workingHardRoutine</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>workingHard</span> <span>=</span> <span>workingHard</span><span>();</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>takeABreak</span> <span>=</span> <span>takeABreak</span><span>();</span>
  <span>workingHard</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
  <span>takeABreak</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before running the <code>workingHardRoutine()</code> function, we set the three system properties:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.parallelism=1
-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.maxPoolSize=1
-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.minRunnable=1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above settings force the scheduler to use a pool configured with only one carrier thread. Since the <code>workingHard</code> virtual thread never reaches a blocking operation, it will never yield the execution to the <code>takeABreak&#34;</code> virtual thread. In fact, the output is the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>21:28:35.702 [Working hard] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Working hard]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m working hard
--- Running forever ---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>workingHard</code> virtual thread is never unmounted from the carrier thread, and the <code>takeABreak</code> virtual thread is never scheduled.</p>

<p>Let’s now change things to let the cooperative scheduling work. We define a new function simulating an employee that is working hard but stops working every 100 milliseconds:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>workingConsciousness</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span>
      <span>&#34;Working consciousness,
      () -&gt; {
        log(&#34;</span><span>I</span><span>&#39;</span><span>m</span> <span>working</span> <span>hard</span><span>&#34;);
        while (alwaysTrue()) {
          sleep(Duration.ofMillis(100L));
        }
        log(&#34;</span><span>I</span><span>&#39;</span><span>m</span> <span>done</span> <span>with</span> <span>working</span> <span>hard</span><span>&#34;</span><span>);</span>
      <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, the execution can reach the blocking operation, and the <code>workingHard</code> virtual thread can be unmounted from the carrier thread. To verify this, we can race the above thread with the <code>takeABreak</code> thread:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>workingConsciousnessRoutine</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>workingConsciousness</span> <span>=</span> <span>workingConsciousness</span><span>();</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>takeABreak</span> <span>=</span> <span>takeABreak</span><span>();</span>
  <span>workingConsciousness</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
  <span>takeABreak</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, we expect the <code>takeABreak</code> virtual thread to be scheduled and executed on the only carrier thread when the <code>workingConsciousness</code> reaches the blocking operation. The output confirms our expectations:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>21:30:51.677 [Working consciousness] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Working consciousness]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m working hard
21:30:51.682 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to take a break
21:30:52.688 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the break
--- Running forever ---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As expected, the two virtual threads share the same carrier thread.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the <code>workingHardRoutine()</code> function. If we change the carrier pool size to 2, we can see that both the <code>workingHard</code> and the <code>takeABreak</code> virtual threads are scheduled on the two carrier threads so they can run concurrently. The new setup is the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.parallelism=2
-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.maxPoolSize=2
-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.minRunnable=2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we might expect, the output is the following. While the <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1</code> is stuck in the infinite loop, the <code>ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2</code> is executing the <code>takeABreak</code> virtual thread:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>21:33:43.641 [Working hard] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Working hard]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m working hard
21:33:43.641 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#24,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m going to take a break
21:33:44.655 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#24,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m done with the break
--- Running forever ---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that cooperative scheduling is helpful when working in a highly collaborative environment. Since a virtual thread releases its carrier thread only when reaching a blocking operation, cooperative scheduling and virtual threads will not improve the performance of CPU-intensive applications. The JVM already gives us a tool for those tasks: Java parallel streams.</p>

<h2 id="6-pinned-virtual-threads">6. Pinned Virtual Threads</h2>

<p>We said that the JVM <em>mounts</em> a virtual thread to a platform thread, its carrier thread, and executes it until it reaches a blocking operation. Then, the virtual thread is unmounted from the carrier thread, and the scheduler decides which virtual thread to schedule on the carrier thread.</p>

<p>However, <strong>there are some cases where a blocking operation doesn’t unmount the virtual thread from the carrier thread</strong>, blocking the underlying carrier thread. In such cases, we say the virtual is <em>pinned</em> to the carrier thread. It’s not an error but a behavior that limits the application’s scalability. Note that if a carrier thread is pinned, the JVM can always add a new platform thread to the carrier pool if the configurations of the carrier pool allow it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are only two cases in which a virtual thread is pinned to the carrier thread:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When it executes code inside a <code>synchronized</code> block or method;</li>
  <li>When it calls a native method or a foreign function (i.e., a call to a native library using JNI).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see an example of pinned virtual thread. We want to simulate an employee that needs to go to the bathroom. The bathroom has only one WC, so the access to the toilet must be synchronized:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Bathroom</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>synchronized</span> <span>void</span> <span>useTheToilet</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m going to use the toilet&#34;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
    <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;I&#39;m done with the toilet&#34;</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we define a function simulating an employee that uses the bathroom:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>Bathroom</span> <span>bathroom</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Bathroom</span><span>();</span>

<span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>goToTheToilet</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span>
      <span>&#34;Go to the toilet&#34;</span><span>,</span>
      <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bathroom</span><span>.</span><span>useTheToilet</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the office, there are Riccardo and Daniel. Riccardo has to go to the bathroom while Daniel wants a break. Since they’re working on different issues, they could complete their task concurrently. Let’s define a function that tries to execute Riccardo and Daniel concurrently:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>twoEmployeesInTheOffice</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>riccardo</span> <span>=</span> <span>goToTheToilet</span><span>();</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>daniel</span> <span>=</span> <span>takeABreak</span><span>();</span>
  <span>riccardo</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
  <span>daniel</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To see the effect of synchronization and the pinning of the associated <code>riccardo</code> virtual thread, we limit the carrier pool to one thread, as we did previously. The execution of the <code>twoEmployeesInTheOffice</code> produces the following output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>16:29:05.548 [Go to the toilet] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Go to the toilet]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to use the toilet
16:29:06.558 [Go to the toilet] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Go to the toilet]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the toilet
16:29:06.559 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to take a break
16:29:07.563 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the break
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see, the tasks are entirely linearized by the JVM. As we said, the blocking <code>sleep</code> operation is inside the <code>synchronized</code> <code>useTheToilet</code> method, so the virtual thread is not unmounted. So, the <code>riccardo</code> virtual thread is pinned to the carrier thread, and the <code>daniel</code> virtual thread finds no available carrier thread to execute. In fact, it is scheduled when the <code>riccardo</code> virtual thread is done with the bathroom.</p>

<p>It’s possible to trace these situations during the execution of a program by adding a property to the run configuration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=full/short
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>full</code> value prints the full stack trace of the pinned virtual thread, while the <code>short</code> value prints only less information. The execution of the <code>twoEmployeesInTheOffice</code> with the above configuration set to the <code>short</code>  value produces the following interesting output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>16:29:05.548 [Go to the toilet] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Go to the toilet]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to use the toilet
Thread[#22,ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1,5,CarrierThreads]
    virtual.threads.playground/in.rcard.virtual.threads.App$Bathroom.useTheToilet(App.java:188) &lt;== monitors:1
16:29:06.558 [Go to the toilet] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Go to the toilet]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the toilet
16:29:06.559 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to take a break
16:29:07.563 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the break
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we guessed, the <code>riccardo</code> virtual thread was pinned to its carrier thread. We can also see the name of the carrier thread here. Amazing.</p>

<p>We can change the configuration of the carrier pool to allow the JVM to add a new carrier thread to the pool when needed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.parallelism=1
-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.maxPoolSize=2
-Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.minRunnable=1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also removed the property <code>jdk.tracePinnedThreads</code> to avoid printing the pinned stacktrace. Execution with the new configuration produces the following output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>16:32:05.235 [Go to the toilet] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Go to the toilet]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m going to use the toilet
16:32:05.235 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m going to take a break
16:32:06.243 [Go to the toilet] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,Go to the toilet]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | I&#39;m done with the toilet
16:32:06.243 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m done with the break
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The JVM added a new carrier thread to the pool when it found no carrier thread. So the <code>daniel</code> virtual thread is scheduled on the new carrier thread, executing concurrently and interleaving the two logs.</p>

<p>Even though soon also <code>synchronized</code> blocks will probably unmount a virtual thread from its carrier thread, it is better to migrate those blocks to the <code>Lock</code> API, using <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock</code>. Such locks don’t pin the virtual thread, making the cooperative scheduling work again.</p>

<p>Let’s create a version of our <code>Bathroom</code> class using the <code>Lock</code> API:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Bathroom</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>Lock</span> <span>lock</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ReentrantLock</span><span>();</span>

<p>Now, let’s change the previous functions to use this new version of the <code>Bathroom</code> class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>Thread</span> <span>goToTheToiletWithLock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>virtualThread</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Go to the toilet&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bathroom</span><span>.</span><span>useTheToiletWithLock</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>@SneakyThrows</span>

  <span>daniel</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The execution of the <code>twoEmployeesInTheOfficeWithLock</code> produces the expected output, which shows the two threads running concurrently:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>16:35:58.921 [Take a break] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,Take a break]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | I&#39;m going to take a break

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can run the above method also with the <code>jdk.tracePinnedThreads</code> property set to see that no thread is pinned to its carrier thread during the execution.</p>

<h2 id="7-threadlocal-and-thread-pools">7. <code>ThreadLocal</code> and Thread Pools</h2>

<p>When using threads before Java 19 and Project Loom, creating a thread using the constructor was relatively uncommon. Instead, we preferred to use a thread pool or an executor service configured with a thread pool. In fact, those threads were what we now call platform threads, and the reason was that creating such threads was quite expensive operation.</p>

<p>As we said at the beginning of this article, with virtual threads, it’s not the case anymore. Creating a virtual thread is very cheap, both in space and time. Also, <strong>they were designed with the idea of using a different virtual thread for each request</strong>. So, it’s worthless to use a thread pool or an executor service to create virtual threads.</p>

<p>As for <code>ThreadLocal</code>, the possible high number of virtual threads created by an application is why using <code>ThreadLocal</code> may not be a good idea.</p>

<p>What is a <code>ThreadLocal</code>? A <code>ThreadLocal</code> is a construct that allows us to store data accessible only by a specific thread. Let’s see an example. First of all, we want to create a <code>ThreadLocal</code> that holds a <code>String</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>ThreadLocal</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ThreadLocal</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, we create two different platform threads that use both the <code>ThreadLocal</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>platformThreadLocal</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>thread1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>ofPlatform</span><span>().</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-1&#34;</span><span>).</span><span>start</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-1&#34;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
    <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Hey, my name is &#34;</span> <span>+</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>thread2</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>ofPlatform</span><span>().</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-2&#34;</span><span>).</span><span>start</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-2&#34;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
    <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Hey, my name is &#34;</span> <span>+</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>
  <span>thread1</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
  <span>thread2</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we run the above function, the output is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>14:57:05.334 [thread-2] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - Thread[#22,thread-2,5,main] | Hey, my name is thread-2
14:57:05.334 [thread-1] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - Thread[#21,thread-1,5,main] | Hey, my name is thread-1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see, each thread stores a different value in the <code>ThreadLocal</code>, which is not accessible to other threads. The thread called <code>thread-1</code> retrieves the value <code>thread-1</code> from the <code>ThreadLocal</code>; The thread <code>thread-2</code> retrieves the value <code>thread-2</code> instead. There is no race condition at all.</p>

<p>The same properties of <code>ThreadLocal</code> still stand when we speak about virtual threads. In fact, we can replicate the same example above using virtual threads, and the result will be the same:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@SneakyThrows</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>virtualThreadLocal</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>virtualThread1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>ofVirtual</span><span>().</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-1&#34;</span><span>).</span><span>start</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-1&#34;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
    <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Hey, my name is &#34;</span> <span>+</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>virtualThread2</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>ofVirtual</span><span>().</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-2&#34;</span><span>).</span><span>start</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;thread-2&#34;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>Duration</span><span>.</span><span>ofSeconds</span><span>(</span><span>1L</span><span>));</span>
    <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Hey, my name is &#34;</span> <span>+</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>
  <span>virtualThread1</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
  <span>virtualThread2</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we might expect, the output is very similar to the previous one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>15:08:37.142 [thread-1] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#21,thread-1]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 | Hey, my name is thread-1
15:08:37.142 [thread-2] INFO in.rcard.virtual.threads.App - VirtualThread[#23,thread-2]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 | Hey, my name is thread-2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice. So, is it a good idea to use <code>ThreadLocal</code> with virtual threads? Well, you now need to be careful. The reason is that we can have a huge number of virtual threads, and each virtual thread will have its own <code>ThreadLocal</code>. This means that <strong>the memory footprint of the application may quickly become very high</strong>. Moreover, the <code>ThreadLocal</code> will be useless in a one-thread-per-request scenario since data won’t be shared between different requests.</p>

<p>However, some scenarios could be help use something similar to <code>ThreadLocal</code>. For this reason, Java 20 will introduce <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/429">scoped values</a>, which enable the sharing of immutable data within and across threads. However, this is a topic for another article.</p>

<h2 id="8-some-virtual-threads-internals">8. Some Virtual Threads Internals</h2>

<p>In this section, we’ll introduce the implementation of continuation in Java virtual threads. We’re not going into too much detail, but we’ll try to give a general idea of how the virtual threads are implemented.</p>

<p>A virtual thread cannot run itself, but it stores the information of what must be run. In other words, <strong>it’s a pointer to the advance of an execution that can be yielded and resumed later</strong>.</p>

<p>The above is the definition of <em>continuations</em>. We’ve already seen how Kotlin coroutines implement continuations (<a href="https://blog.rockthejvm.com/kotlin-coroutines-101/#3-suspending-functions">Kotlin Coroutines - A Comprehensive Introduction - Suspending Functions</a>). In that case, the Kotlin compiler generates continuation from the coroutine code. Kotlin’s coroutines have no direct support in the JVM, so they are supported using code generation by the compiler.</p>

<p>However, for virtual threads, we have the JVM support directly. So, continuations execution is implemented using a lot of native calls to the JVM, and it’s less understandable when looking at the JDK code. However, we can still look at some concepts at the roots of virtual threads.</p>

<p>As a continuation, a virtual thread is a state machine with many states. The relations among these states are summarized in the following diagram:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.rockthejvm.com/images/virtual-threads/virtual-thread-states.png" alt="Java Virtual Threads States"/></p>

<p>A virtual thread is <em>mounted</em> on its carrier thread when it is in the states colored green in the above diagram. In states colored in light blue, the virtual thread is <em>unmounted</em> from its carrier thread. The pinned state is colored violet.</p>

<p>We get a virtual thread in the <code>NEW</code> status when we call the <code>unstarted</code> method on the object returned by the <code>Thread.ofVirtual()</code> method. The core information is mainly in the <code>java.lang.VirtualThread</code> class. At the core, the JVM calls the <code>VirtualThread</code>constructor:</p>

<p>As we can see, a scheduler is chosen if not specified. The default scheduler is the one we described in the previous section. After that, a continuation is created, which is a <code>VThreadContinuation</code> object. This object is the one that stores the information of what has to be run as a <code>Runnable</code> object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// JDK core code</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above code also shows how the <code>jdk.tracePinnedThreads</code> flag works. The <code>VTHREAD_SCOPE</code> is a <code>ContinuationScope</code> object, a class used to group continuations. In other words, it’s a way to group continuations related to each other. In our case, we have only one <code>ContinuationScope</code> object, the <code>VTHREAD_SCOPE</code> object. This object is used to group all the virtual threads.</p>

<p>Last, the method sets the <code>runContinuation</code> field, a <code>Runnable</code> object used to run the continuation. This method is called when the virtual thread is started.</p>

<p>Once we call the <code>start</code> method, the virtual thread is moved to the <code>STARTED</code> status:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// JDK core code</span>
<span>@Override</span>
<span>void</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>ThreadContainer</span> <span>container</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>The <code>submitRunContinuation()</code> is the method scheduling the <code>runContinuation</code> runnable to the virtual thread scheduler:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The execution of the <code>runContinuation</code> runnable moves the virtual thread to the <code>RUNNING</code> status, both if it’s in the <code>STARTED</code> status or in the <code>RUNNABLE</code> status:</p>

<p>From this point on, the state of the virtual threads depends on the execution of the continuation, made through the method <code>Continuation.run()</code>. The method performs a lot of native calls, and it’s not easy to follow the execution flow. However, the first thing it makes is to set as mounted the associated virtual thread:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// JDK core code</span>
<span>public</span> <span>final</span> <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>mount</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// A lot of omissis</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every time the virtual thread reaches a blocking point, the state of the thread is changed to <code>PARKING</code>. The reaching of a blocking point is signaled through the call of the <code>VirtualThread.park()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// JDK core code</span>
<span>void</span> <span>park</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>currentThread</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>this</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// complete immediately if parking permit available or interrupted</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>getAndSetParkPermit</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>interrupted</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// park the thread</span>
    <span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>PARKING</span><span>);</span>
    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>yieldContinuation</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// park on the carrier thread when pinned</span>
            <span>parkOnCarrierThread</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>currentThread</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>this</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>RUNNING</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once in the <code>PARKING</code> state, the <code>yieldContinuation()</code> method is called. This method is the one that performs the actual parking of the virtual thread and tries to unmount the virtual thread from its carrier thread:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// JDK core code</span>
<span>private</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>yieldContinuation</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>boolean</span> <span>notifyJvmti</span> <span>=</span> <span>notifyJvmtiEvents</span><span>;</span>

    <span>unmount</span><span>();</span>
    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Continuation</span><span>.</span><span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>VTHREAD_SCOPE</span><span>);</span>

<p>The <code>Continuation.yield(VTHREAD_SCOPE)</code> call is implemented with many JVM native calls. If the method returns <code>true</code>, then the <code>parkOnCarrierThread</code>is called. This method sets the virtual threads as pinned on the carrier thread:</p>

<p>From there, the method <code>VirtualThread.afterYield()</code> is called. This method sets the <code>PARKED</code> state to the virtual thread, and the continuation is scheduled again for execution through the method <code>lazySubmitRunContinuation()</code> and setting the state to <code>RUNNABLE</code>:</p>

<p>This closes the circle. As we can see, it takes a lot of work to follow the life cycle of a virtual thread and its continuation. A lot of native calls are involved. We hope that the JDK team will provide better documentation of the virtual threads implementation in the future.</p>

<h2 id="9-conclusions">9. Conclusions</h2>

<p>Finally, we come to the end of this article. In the beginning, we introduced the reason behind the introduction of virtual threads in the JVM. Then, we saw how to create and use it with some examples. We made some examples of pinned threads, and finally, we saw how some old best practices are no longer valid when using virtual threads.</p>

<p>Project Loom is still actively under development, and there are a lot of other exciting features in it. As we said, structural concurrency and scoped values are some of them. Project Loom will be a game changer in the Java world. This article will help you better understand virtual threads and how to use them.</p>
