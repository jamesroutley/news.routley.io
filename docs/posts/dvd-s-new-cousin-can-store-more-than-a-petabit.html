Choi" data-page-title="DVD’s New Cousin Can Store More Than a Petabit - IEEE Spectrum"><div><p>A novel disc the size of a DVD can hold more than 1 million gigabits—roughly as much as is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/27/laser-powered-chip-internet-data-transfer/" target="_blank">transmitted per second over the entire world’s Internet</a>—by storing data in three dimensions as opposed to two, a new study finds.<br/></p><p>Optical discs such as CDs and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fivedimensional-dvd-could-store-16-terabytes" target="_self">DVDs</a> encode data using a series of microscopic pits. These pits, and the islands between them, together represent the 0s and 1s of binary code that computers use to symbolize information. CD, DVD, and Blu-ray players use lasers to read the data encoded in these discs.</p><p>“The use of ultrahigh-density optical data storage technology in big data centers is now possible.” <strong>—Min Gu, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology</strong></p><p>Although optical discs are low in cost and highly durable, they are limited by the amount of data they can hold, which is usually stored in a single layer. Previously, scientists investigated encoding data on optical discs in many layers in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/racetrack-memory" target="_self">three dimensions</a> to boost their capacity. However, a key barrier that prior research faced was how the optics used to read and write this data were limited to roughly the size of the wavelengths of light they used.</p><p>Now scientists in China have developed a way to encode data on 100 layers in optical discs. In addition, the data is recorded using spots as small as 54 nanometers wide, roughly a tenth of the size of the wavelengths of visible light used to read and write the data.</p><p>All in all, a DVD-size version of the new disc has a capacity of up to 1.6 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/frequency-comb" target="_self">petabits</a>—that is, 1.6 million gigabits. This is some 4,000 times as much data density as a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-samsung-bdp1000" target="_self">Blu-ray disc</a> and 24 times as much as the currently most advanced hard disks. The researchers suggest their new optical disc can enable a data center capable of exabit storage—a billion gigabits—to fit inside a room instead of a stadium-size space.</p><p>“The use of ultrahigh-density optical data storage technology in big data centers is now possible,” says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Gu" target="_blank">Min Gu</a>, professor of <a href="https://www.atse.org.au/news-and-events/article/min-gu-appointed-executive-chancellor-in-shanghai/" target="_blank">optical-electrical and computer engineering</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Shanghai_for_Science_and_Technology" target="_blank">University of Shanghai for Science and Technology</a>.</p><h3>How to store a petabit on one disc</h3><p>The strategy the researchers used to write the data relies on a pair of lasers. The first, a green 515-nanometer laser, triggers spot formation, whereas the second, a red 639-nm laser, switches off the writing process. By controlling the time between firing of the lasers, the scientists could produce spots smaller than the wavelengths of light used to create them.</p><p>The procedure used to create blank discs is compatible with conventional DVD mass production and can be completed within 6 minutes.</p><p>To read the data, the researchers again depended on a pair of lasers. The first, a blue 480-nm beam, can make spots fluoresce, while the second, an orange 592-nm light, switches off the fluorescence process. Precise control over the firing of these lasers can single out which specific nanometer-scale spot ends up fluorescing.</p><p>This new strategy depends on a novel light-sensitive material called AIE-DDPR that is capable of all these varied responses to different wavelengths of light. “It has been a 10-year effort searching for this kind of material,” Gu says. “The difficulty has been how the writing and reading processes affect each other in a given material—in particular, in a three-dimensional geometry.”</p><p>The scientists encoded data on layers each separated by 1 micrometer. They found that the writing quality stayed comparable across all the layers. “Personally, I was surprised that nanoscale writing-recoding and reading processes both work well in our newly invented material,” Gu says.</p><p>The researchers note that the entire procedure used to create blank discs made using AIE-DDPR films is compatible with conventional DVD mass production and can be completed within 6 minutes. Gu says these new discs may therefore prove to be manufacturable at commercial scales.</p><p>Currently, he says, the new discs have a writing speed of about 100 milliseconds and an energy consumption of microjoules to millijoules. </p><p>Still, Gu says, the researchers would like to see their new discs used in big data centers. As a result, they’re working to improve their new method’s writing speed and energy consumption. He suggests this may be possible using new, more energy-efficient recording materials. He says more layers in each disc may be possible in the future, using better lenses and fewer aberrations in their optics.</p><p>The scientists detailed <u><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06980-y" target="_blank">their findings</a></u> online 21 February in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p></div></div></div>
