Tricky Dick was also doing Watergate stuff that would force him to resign a year later. The previous president Lyndon B. Johnson died. OPEC started an oil embargo. Pink Floyd released the greatest album cover ever (“The Dark Side of the Moon”). James Blunt — who def has the funniest bio on X (</span><a href="https://x.com/jamesblunt?lang=en" rel="">“Proof that one song is all you need”</a><span>) — wasn’t born yet but would randomly release a song called “1973” in 2007 (well, he says it’s because “1973” rhymes with </span><a href="https://x.com/JamesBlunt/status/1485182825070567432" rel="">“I will always be”</a><span>). </span></p><p><span>Most relevant for this article, the US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#:~:text=The%20GPS%20project%20was%20launched,are%20credited%20with%20inventing%20it." rel="">Global Positioning System (GPS) program to create a robust satellite navigation system</a><span>. The program was designed for the military at the height of the Cold War (aiming missiles, tracking troop movements).</span></p><p>A prototype satellite was launched in 1978 and the constellation was fully operational with 24 satellites by 1993 (curiously, Blunt hasn’t written a song about either of those years).</p><p>An important detail for the early GPS days is how the US government split the network between military and civilian use. The catalyst for this change was a tragedy: in 1983, a Korean commercial airplane was flying from New York to Seoul and was shot down over Soviet airspace. </p><p>President Ronald Reagan determined that the commercial availability of GPS would have likely prevented the attack and instructed the DoD to make GPS available for civilian use. They did so by creating two networks: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Standard Positioning Service (SPS):</strong><span> Designed for civilian and commercial use, and accurate within 100 meters of a location. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Precision Positioning Service (PPS):</strong><span> Designed for military use and accurate within 10 meters of a location.</span></p></li></ul><p>Why was the PPS 10x more accurate than the SPS? Because the DoD purposely scrambled the SPS so that enemy forces couldn’t take the civilian service and get the same capabilities as the US military.</p><p>The private sector soon began experimenting with GPS technology. It was free to use but required (pretty expensive) antenna and receiver equipment. Early adopters included the oil &amp; gas industry as well as customers that owned yachts and private planes (aka rich folk with a lot of cheddar).</p><p>Two people interested in the GPS consumer market were Gary Burrell and Min Kao. Burrell was born in Kansas and had a Masters in electrical engineering from Wichita State University. Kao was born in Taiwan and moved to America to get advanced degrees including a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee.</p><p>In 1989 — when Kao was 50 and Burrell was 52 — they were both working as engineers at avionics firm AppliedSignals. The pair got to chatting and decided to launch a company that would sell GPS navigation devices.</p><p><span>“The idea for Garmin was conceived during a casual dinner conversation with [my colleague Burrell],” says Kao about the company&#39;s founding moment in an </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/20/garmin-founder-min-kao-on-the-twists-and-turns-of-gps_n_2165986.html" rel="">interview with </a><em><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/20/garmin-founder-min-kao-on-the-twists-and-turns-of-gps_n_2165986.html" rel="">The Huffington Post</a></em><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/20/garmin-founder-min-kao-on-the-twists-and-turns-of-gps_n_2165986.html" rel=""> in 2012</a><span>. “The GPS constellation was still under construction, and it was being developed primarily for military purposes, but Gary and I began discussing its potential as the base technology for a wide array of consumer products. Our conversation became more animated when we envisioned creating products that would help guide pilots, boaters, drivers, and hikers safely and efficiently on their journeys.”</span></p><p>They raised $4m from their own savings, family and friends to open a factory in Kansas under the name ProNav. It was the only money they ever had to raise because they came out the gate like gangbusters. </p><p>The first product was released in 1990 and was a GPS navigation device for small boats and planes. It was an instant smash hit, with even the US Army purchasing their GPS devices for use in the Gulf War. A year later, they opened up a manufacturing plant in Taiwan.</p><p>This early success was followed by a name change to Garmin, which combined the co-founders’ first names. The portmanteau signified that they “were personally invested in its success or failure” (side note: they definitely did the right order of names because “MinGar” would not have survived as a corporate entity for more than 6 months). </p><p>By 1995, Garmin was already making $100m+ a year. Crucially, Kao and Burrell were hardcore technologists and not slick-backed hair MBAs. While Corporate America was going asset-light and outsourcing manufacturing overseas, Garmin brought more of its business in-house. They were engineering-first and owned their own distributors, warehouses, marketing teams and customer support call centres. Further, they re-invested funds into building new factories (Kansas, Taiwan), hiring R&amp;D talent and applying for patents.</p><p>Garmin’s approach had financial costs and took time but also allowed the company to quickly capitalize on new GPS-related opportunities. </p><p>One such opportunity was a portable car navigator called the StreetPilot. Launched in 1998, the device — which looks quite comical now but probably gave pizza delivery drivers a massive chub — set Garmin up for an explosive decade of growth. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png" width="1456" height="622" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:622,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:3433498,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68c3f37f-c3e6-4868-aeba-a6ae140c7ff4_2586x1104.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption>1) Gary Burrell and Min Kao; 2) Handheld GPS 50 (1991); 3) StreetPilot Car Navigation (1998); 4) Forerunner, the world’s first GPS trainer (2003)</figcaption></figure></div><p>In May 2000, President Bill Clinton put into effect a new policy that completely changed Garmin’s fortunes. </p><p><span>According to this </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp7tYrF7HeI" rel="">profile video of Garmin by </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp7tYrF7HeI" rel="">CNBC</a></em><span>, the President “issued an order for the military to stop scrambling civilian GPS technology, making it far more accurate and opening the GPS device market to all sorts of competition.”</span></p><p>The impetus for Clinton’s decision was that the military had figured out other ways to jam enemy mis-use of the GPS network. And, of course, there were massive civilian opportunities for innovation and business. </p><p>Even as the DotCom Bubble was bursting, Garmin was well-positioned as a GPS play (pun intended) and IPO’d in December 2000.</p><p>Its public debut kicked off an incredible 8-year run that would see revenue 10x from $346m in 2000 to $3.5B in 2008 (when car navigation GPS devices — aka personal navigation devices (PND) — made up 70% of sales). </p><p>There were competitors such as Magellan, Honeywell and TomTom but Garmin became the go-to consumer brand for GPS in the car.</p><p>The sales boom was catalyzed by:</p><ul><li><p>growing awareness of Garmin</p></li><li><p>automakers trying to soup up their vehicles</p></li><li><p>improved accuracy of GPS navigation </p></li><li><p>integration of WiFi for routing and traffic data</p></li><li><p>lower input costs (growth in consumer demand for electronics led to a decrease in costs for items Garmin required such as microchips, LCD screens, antennas, batteries etc.)</p></li><li><p>the experience curve (which is when the cost of making a product declines due to higher volumes and more learnings)</p></li></ul><p>The earliest GPS devices from the 1980s cost north of $10,000.

Garmin sales wouldn’t fall any further but — as mentioned earlier — it took a decade for Garmin’s sales to get back to $3.5B. If you adjust for inflation, Garmin didn’t get back to its 2008 revenue high-water mark until 2023. </p><p>The largest peak-to-trough drawdown for Garmin’s stock was ~90% (taking its market cap to under $3B in Q4 2008, with additional pain from the Great Financial Crisis).</p><p>Fortunately, the company’s salvation was already cooking internally. Remember how we talked about Garmin’s commitment to R&amp;D? Just as they had found a way to take the GPS from the ocean (boats) to air (planes) to the street (cars), Garmin’s R&amp;D team had identified fitness as a niche market all the way back in 2003.</p><p><span>Here’s the origin story according to </span><em><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/16/garmin-survived-gps-revolution/" rel="">Fortune</a></em><span>: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>For all the time, effort, and money companies plow into the endless hunt for innovation, many of their best ideas come from within. A Procter &amp; Gamble chemist in the 19th century figured a bar of soap that floated in the tub would enliven the bathing experience, and Ivory Soap was born. In the 1970s, a 3M employee, craving a better way to mark pages in his hymnal, modified an uncommercialized adhesive invented a few years earlier by a colleague; Post-it Notes became an iconic 3M success story. And at Garmin, a suburban Kansas maker of navigational devices for boats, planes, and cars, a group of running-obsessed employees applied their know-how to their hobby—a move that revitalized the company when it badly needed a win. </em></p><p><em>It was the early 2000s, and Garmin had grown from its niche of making consumer devices utilizing the government’s global positioning system, or GPS, technology. Together with rival TomTom, Garmin dominated the market for in-car navigational devices, game-changing gadgets that marked the beginning of the end for foldable maps. GPS for personal fitness wasn’t popular before the Garmin jogging klatch began noodling. “They said, ‘We do all these GPS things. Why don’t we have a GPS product for runners?’ ” recalls Cliff Pemble, Garmin’s CEO and a 31-year company veteran. In 2003, Garmin offered its first fitness wearable, the Forerunner 101. What began as an employee side project has come to define the company nearly two decades on—especially after a lethal technology combination of the iPhone and Google Maps laid waste to Garmin’s core automotive business.</em></p></blockquote><p>The transition from car navigation to fitness GPS was far from seamless, though.</p><p><span>Garmin’s first instinct to take on the iPhone/Google Maps disruption was to make its own mobile device. In 2008, the company collaborated with Asus to release the G60 </span><a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-CA/p/30018" rel="">Nuviphone</a><span>, a GPS-enabled phone with a 3.5 inch screen running on Windows Mobile (lol). </span></p><p>The Nuviphone cost $300 and if you bought it instead of just a fully-featured iPhone that was under $500 subsidized by carriers, then you were a completely lost cause and hopefully re-evaluated your entire life afterwards. However, very few people chose the “lost cause and need to re-evaluate your life” route and Garmin discontinued the product in 2010. Around this time, Garmin also took a few shots at making subscription-based apps for iPhone and Android. Nothing stuck.</p><p>While these attempts at new mobile business lines didn’t take off, the aforementioned Forerunner — the pager-sized device that became the world’s first GPS-powered trainer — had catalyzed a fitness segment including watches and trackers that reached $400m in 2008 (10%+ of Garmin’s total sales).</p><p>Building off that base, Garmin kept improving the form factor and integrating more features (activity tracking, training plans for niche sports, sleep coaching, stored maps, better battery life, lights).</p><p>One notable outcome from Garmin’s approach is that it’s able to price discriminate to a very fine T. Customers have so many options to pay for the exact functionality they need. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg" width="684" height="930.7724550898204" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1818,&#34;width&#34;:1336,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:684,&#34;bytes&#34;:427693,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f6ba55f-e5a8-4565-a8ec-c13ed1d9a9d9_1336x1818.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Garmin’s fitness segment crossed $1B for the first time in 2015.

We persevered though, and over the years, we’ve developed deep relationships with some of the world’s leading OEMs, like Cessna, Embraer, BMW, and Chrysler.”</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Vertically-integrated:</strong><span> </span><em>“From the beginning though, Gary and I believed in our business model of vertical integration — a philosophy that keeps all design, manufacturing, marketing and warehouse processes in-house. By doing so, we have been able to have greater control over timelines, quality and service. It might have been easier in the short term to offload many of these functions, but in the long run, we&#39;ve learned that by controlling the entire process, we’ve had higher levels of innovation, reduced risks, lower costs, and greater scalability.”</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Cater to customer needs:</strong><span> </span><em>“My partner, Gary, liked to say, &#39;we live and die by customers&#39; perception of our products&#39;. By concentrating on great products that delight customers, our brand takes care of itself.” </em><span>[Side note: Garmin has also spent decades working in regulated industries such as aviation and cars, so the company understands the needs of regulators around privacy and sensitive data; this understanding helps it to port GPS-related technology from one regulated industry to another]</span></p></li></ul><p><span>So far, this foundation has worked for Garmin to survive Biggie Big Tech (iPhone/Google Maps and Apple Watch). It’ll have to keep drawing from this tradition because the competition is relentless and has a seeming endless appetite to take a dump on Garmin’s lawns.

Today, Nordic firms are faster to digitize than their European counterparts (eg. much higher cloud computing usage).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Government policy:</strong><span> Personal tax rate is high but corporate tax is in line with America. High income taxes fund social safety net programs that help de-risk the entrepreneurial route (on that note: the Heritage Foundation ranks Denmark, Norway, Sweden in the top ten of countries worldwide for economic freedom).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Patient shareholders:</strong><span> 4/5ths of “large Nordic companies have long-term ownership, compared with 3/5ths in Europe and only 1/5th in America”, which allows for long-term thinking (private business families — Ikea, LEGO, Maersk, Wallenbergs — are also prominent in region and stymie foreign takeovers)</span></p></li></ul><p>Nordic companies have obviously taken Ls (eg. recent collapse of battery maker Northvolt; previous clapping of Nokia by iPhone). But still impressive results! </p><p>***</p><p><strong>TikTok Ban (?):</strong><span> This TikTok situation is wild. I’m writing this on Friday morning and here is a catch-up:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>The US Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/17/nx-s1-5258396/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban" rel="">upheld a law</a><span> that forces TikTok — which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance (with the CCP on the company’s board) — to either sell the app or it will be banned in America on January 19th (Sunday). The Court determined that the app’s national security risks outweighed 1st Amendment Free Speech considerations.</span></p></li><li><p>Functionally, a ban means that the iOS App Store and Google Play Store will stop allowing new downloads of the app and block updates (so the app will slowly degrade).</p></li><li><p>TikTok said it would just shut down the app (from a PR perspective, this would make the most noise and get a groundswell of users being real PO’d).</p></li><li><p><span>President Donald Trump takes office on January 20th and there is talk that he wants to give TikTok </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-ban-biden-trump-bytedance" rel="">up to 90 days more to try to sell</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>There is reporting that the Chinese government — which is the ultimate decider — may allow Elon to buy TikTok. The price would be in the $50B-$100B range. This is very speculative. It’s not clear how financing would be done and whether an app sale would include the algorithm (which the Chinese government has previously said it would not sell). </p></li><li><p>Prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) have the probability of a full TikTok shutdown by May at 80%+.</p></li><li><p>One data point for the other ~20% (aka Trump brokering a deal) is that the TikTok CEO has been invited to the Presidential Inauguration (to sit on the dais with other Big Tech CEOs). </p></li><li><p>In a total hypothetical, Elon buying TikTok and combining it with X/xAI would immediately create a $100-200B company. </p></li></ul><p><span>I’ve been on the “US should ban TikTok” </span><a href="https://www.readtrung.com/p/family-guys-takeover-of-tiktok-explained" rel="">train for a long time and wrote about it here</a><span>. </span></p><p>The simplest argument is that having a geopolitical rival own a key communication channel is kind of absurd. During the Cold War, it would have been unfathomable for the Soviet Union to own ABC/CBS/NBC. TikTok&#39;s algorithm has been shown to boost pro-CCP and throttle anti-CCP content. Not to mention how basically every single foreign media and tech social platform is blocked in China.</p><p><span>With over 150m+ users in the US, many creators (and related businesses) will definitely be impacted by the ban. But it’s worth noting that when India banned TikTok a few years back, most users </span><a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/america-india-tiktok-ban/" rel="">quickly migrated to Instagram and YouTube and the disruption was short-lived</a><span>. </span></p><p>There have been a number of credible TikTok acquisition offers and the fact that the CCP won’t allow the sale — and is willing to incinerate $100B in value — is basically all you need to know about the app’s strategic significance.</p><p>Since the situation is so fluid, there are definitely updates to come. In the meantime, here is a series of hysterical links related to the app’s upcoming ban. Specifically, I want to highlight a social app called Xiaohongshu, which translates to &#34;RedNote&#34; or really &#34;Little Red Book&#34; (the app’s founder says the name refers to the color of his alma-mater Stanford but it’s hard to miss the fact the “Little Red Book” is also the collection of Mao sayings that tens of millions of Chinese citizens had to memorize during the Cultural Revolution).</p><p>Over the past week, 1m+ TikTok users — using hashtag #TikTokRefugees — have migrated to Little Red Book. This app is more comparable to Instagram/Pinterest, but TikTok-ers have gone to post there anyways. Some notable posts from this cultural exchange:</p><ul><li><p><span>Some legit </span><a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/tiktok-refugees-rednote-xiaohongshu-chinese-users/" rel="">wholesome</a><span> cultural exchange.</span></p></li><li><p><span>But also: American users trying to stick it to the US government by downloading a new Chinese app after the Supreme Court blocked another Chinese app, only to find that the new Chinese app severely represses </span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rednote-tiktok-alternate-doesnt-allow-164815191.html" rel="">speech on

The main thrust is that he’s dialling back Meta’s censorship regime including getting rid of third-party fact-checking (replacing it with X’s Community Notes system), moving content moderation teams from California to Texas (because of political bias in his view) and allowing people to cover topics previously throttled on Facebook, Instagram and Threads (trans, immigration and a lot of other political chatter). While he acknowledged that this could lead to more bad stuff on the platform, it also means that Meta won&#39;t be nuking millions of legitimate posts.</p><p>Zuck Master Flex went on Rogan to explain his free speech stance and why he is making the changes (and someone left an amazing comment on the video: “Zuck looked at Jack Harlow and said, ‘yep, that’s my look now.’”). One reason was that the Biden administration was really pressing its thumb to censor speech and probably violating the 1st Amendment (particularly around COVID issues). Many critics note this looks like a cynical ploy to suck up to the incoming Trump administration. Yes, obviously it is. To wit: Zuck put Trump’s friend and UFC founder Dana White on the board and also made veteran Republican operator Joel Kaplan the head of Meta’s global policy team (replacing left-leaning Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM of Britain). He also ended various DEI policies around hiring and vendor relationships.</p><p>But also, Meta is a $1.5T company and it’s in his interest to have a productive relationship with government in power (especially with ongoing anti-trust cases). I do think Zuck’s position on allowing free-er speech has always been his preference. So, we&#39;ll see if he stays consistent. Either way, it basically took Elon changing Twitter/X and taking all the slings and arrows for two years — and then Trump getting re-elected — before Zuck felt he could make the move.</p><p>With Zuck bringing the 3.5B users on all Meta platforms closer to X-style moderation after nearly a decade of extreme censorship pressure from government, NGOs and mainstream media to police the platform in the most Orwellian way possible…it’s pretty clear that Elon’s purchase of X was a true fork-in-the-road moment.</p><p>I’ll write more on that but wanted to share memes from the funniest running joke of Meta’s pivot. On the Rogan podcast, Zuck — who has obviously been getting jacked and training MMA — said that corporate America needs to bring back “masculine energy”. And that it’s important to have the balance with feminine energy at the workplace. </p><p><span>Anyway, here are some very related posts (including this first </span><a
