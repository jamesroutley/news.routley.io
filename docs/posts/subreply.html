         It seems like many people are having the same issues that I have with Subreply about flow/organization of threads: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32445450" rel="external">news.ycombinator.c...</a>

        I like the idea of this community. The problem with content is that few people are willing to pay for good quality, well researched, tech news, so I pay for medium and use Hacker news and then spend some time on lobsters occasionally. I would like to read tech blogs, so if you have any recommendations, I would appreciate them.

        I vaguely remember it being posted to HN in the past, but I couldn&#39;t remember the name no matter how hard I tried. Saw it again on HN today, and my password manager let me know I had an account on here - that I&#39;d used a bit 2 years ago and then completely forgotten about!

        I tried to look in my password manager at that time, but then I remembered I purposely disabled saving for Subreply because I use my own password generator/deriver. Oh well..

        Oh my goodness, I&#39;ve been trying to re-discover Subreply for a long time (at least more than 2 years), wondering why I didn&#39;t bookmark it, and even misremembering it as substack (my mind is a mess 😵‍💫). But today I found it again! Thanks to HN 🥲 (I believe the first time I discovered Subreply was also on HN 😅).

        Laptop is in service. I don&#39;t know what my next laptop will be, but M2 Air is a mess. I wish it had a native resolution at 2x like M1 Pro. But I don&#39;t like M1 Pro because is heavy (1.6 kg). I&#39;m looking at Lenovo Yoga and LG Gram at 14-inches to run Fedora.

        Yeah the latest Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 with Ryzen 6000 series are amazing. High-refresh rate OLED panels, RDNA 2 graphics, good design, stellar battery life. A friend of mine has been trying to get his hands on one but sadly they&#39;re out of stock everywhere!

        I don&#39;t know what the second-hand market is like in Bucharest but here if you wait for a couple of months you can get really good deals on new Apple stuff (I got the 14-inch MBP for EUR1500 a few months ago). But it&#39;s true that if your keyboard is broken and you need an immediate replacement that is not really an option.

        Instead of daily newspapers, there could be use in weekly, monthly and yearly event reviews. Maybe with some analyses but each should keep concise.

        Ultimately had to remove Obsidian because they charge for Sync services. I suddenly remember SugarSync and how I left them because they started charging. Long live SkyDrive! Back to Resophnotes then.

        I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m a bit infrequent here myself these days. (edit: because it&#39;s hard to follow conversation threads <a href="https://subreply.com/Lucian" rel="author">@Lucian</a>, also it appears edits reset the post timestamp, I originally posted two weeks ago)

        A 1L (32 oz) HydroFlask (approx. $50): the best water bottle I&#39;ve ever had, can keep anything cool regardless of the temperature. Nothing ear (1) earphones ($99), good earphones with great noise-cancelling and amazing price. A Moment telephoto objective ($50) to use with my phone.
