    <h1>Launch HN: Delve (YC W24) – HIPAA compliance as a service</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey, HN! We&#39;re Karun and Selin, co-founders of Delve (<a href="https://getdelve.com">https://getdelve.com</a>). We help companies get HIPAA compliant fast, with 1-click infrastructure, streamlined legal policies, and real-time monitoring. Here’s a quick demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/mQbb5mprsUA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/mQbb5mprsUA</a>.</p><p>HIPAA is a US federal law passed back in 1996 that sets standards for protecting sensitive health information. Here’s an article that breaks it down pretty simply: <a href="https://www.getdelve.com/blog/quick-guide-to-hipaa">https://www.getdelve.com/blog/quick-guide-to-hipaa</a>.</p><p>Most companies that process health information in the US need to become HIPAA compliant, a process that can be long and expensive. At our previous health tech company, we spent 6 weeks (and tens of thousands of dollars) on getting compliant. We had to complete a lot of manual work, even after purchasing an industry-standard compliance solution, and felt like we were hitting checkboxes with little confidence in our security. We realized that many parts of the compliance process could be streamlined and simplified, which led us to building Delve.</p><p>To get HIPAA compliant, you need (1) secure infrastructure, (2) legal policies, and (3) logging/monitoring. At Delve, we help startups with all three. We provide 1-click HIPAA compliant infrastructure deployed in your cloud and a CI/CD pipeline to update infrastructure from git push (think Heroku but HIPAA compliant). Then, we provide legal policies, paperwork, and a complete task list customized to your infrastructure setup. Finally, we have a real-time monitoring dashboard to help oversee compliance, track system activity, and review logs.</p><p>One thing we noticed the first time we ever got HIPAA compliant was that we had to use many tools along the way. We bought an industry-standard HIPAA compliance solution, hired a HIPAA DevOps contractor to help configure secure infrastructure, and worked with lawyers to adapt the boilerplate legal policies that our compliance solution had provided. When building Delve, we worked hard to give you everything you need in one place, reducing the hassle and cost.</p><p>We currently charge on an annual flat-fee basis. However, we’re still exploring our pricing model (flat-fee vs. usage-based vs. combination of both), and if you have any thoughts to share on that, we’d love to hear them.</p><p>We’re really excited about making it easier to build in healthcare and removing compliance bottlenecks. Thrilled to share this with you and hear your comments!</p></div></td></div></div>
