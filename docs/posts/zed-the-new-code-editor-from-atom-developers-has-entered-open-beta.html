    <h1>Zed, the new code editor from Atom developers, has entered open beta</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re Zed Industries, a small and passionate team on a mission to build the world’s best text editor—for you, and for your team.</p><p>Zed isn’t our first editor. It’s the culmination of more than a decade of experience building tools for developers. We created the hackable text editor, Atom, and the pioneering software platform that launched an entirely new generation of desktop apps, Electron. We also built Tree-sitter, an advanced syntax parsing framework used by the most popular editors in the world. Building tools that matter is in our DNA.</p><p>Now, we’re building something new again with that same drive and a new vision. We believe the best software is handcrafted, with unparalleled attention to detail. We believe software development is better when it’s a shared experience. We believe there’s a better way to write software—and this is just the start of the adventure.</p></div></div>
