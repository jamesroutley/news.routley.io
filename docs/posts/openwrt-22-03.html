 OpenWrt 22.03.0, r19685-512e76967f
 -----------------------------------------------------</pre>



<p>
The OpenWrt community is proud to announce the first stable release of the 
OpenWrt 22.03 stable version series. It incorporates over 3800 
commits since branching the previous OpenWrt 21.02 release and has been under 
development for about one year.

The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices.  
It is a complete replacement for the vendor-supplied firmware of a wide range 
of wireless routers and non-network devices. See the 
<a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_fwdownload?dataflt%5B0%5D=supported%20current%20rel_%3D22.03.0" title="toh:views:toh_fwdownload" data-wiki-id="toh:views:toh_fwdownload">Table of Hardware</a> for supported devices. 
For more information about OpenWrt project organization, see the 
<a href="https://openwrt.org/about" title="https://openwrt.org/about" rel="ugc nofollow">About OpenWrt pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
An upgrade from OpenWrt 21.02 to OpenWrt 22.03 is supported in many cases with 
the help of the sysupgrade utility which will also attempt to preserve the 
configuration. A configuration backup is advised nonetheless when upgrading to 
OpenWrt 22.03. (see “Upgrading” below).

<p>
Firewall4 is used by default, superseding the iptables-based firewall3 implementation in the OpenWrt default images. Firewall4 uses nftables instead of iptables to configure the Linux netfilter ruleset.
</p>

<p>
Firewall4 keeps the same the UCI firewall configuration syntax and should work as a drop-in replacement for fw3 with most common setups, emitting nftables rules instead of iptables ones.
</p>

<p>
Including custom firewall rules through /etc/firewall.user still works, but requires marking the file as compatible first, otherwise it is ignored. Firewall4 additionally allows to include nftables snippets. The <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/firewall/firewall_configuration" title="docs:guide-user:firewall:firewall_configuration" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:firewall:firewall_configuration">firewall documentation</a> explains how to include custom firewall rules with firewall4. Some community packages that add firewall rules might not work for now, and will need to be adapted to fw4: this will happen gradually throughout the lifetime of the 22.03 release series.
</p>

<p>
The legacy iptables utilities are not included in the default images anymore, but can be added back using opkg or the <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/imagebuilder" title="docs:guide-user:additional-software:imagebuilder" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:additional-software:imagebuilder">Image Builder</a> if needed. The transitional packages <code>iptables-nft</code>, <code>arptables-nft</code>, <code>ebtables-nft</code> and <code>xtables-nft</code> can be used to create nftables rules using the old iptables command line syntax.
</p>

<p>
OpenWrt 22.03 supports over 1580 devices. Support for over 180 new devices was added in addition to the device support by OpenWrt 21.02.
OpenWrt 22.03 supports more than 15 devices capable of Wifi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax) using the MediaTek MT7915 wifi chip.
</p>

<p>
The following targets or boards were migrated from swconfig to DSA with OpenWrt 22.03 in addition to the systems already migrated with OpenWrt 21.02:

<p>
The LuCI bootstrap design supports a dark mode. The default design activates dark mode depending on the browser settings. Change it manually at “System” → “System” → “Language and Style”.

<p>
OpenWrt 22.03 uses <a href="https://musl.libc.org/time64.html" title="https://musl.libc.org/time64.html" rel="ugc nofollow">musl 1.2.x</a>, which changed the <code>time_t</code> type from 32 bit to 64 bit on 32 bit systems, on 64 bit system it was always 64 bit long.
When a Unix time stamp is stored in a signed 32 bit integer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem"> it will overflow on 19 January 2038</a>. With the change to 64 bit this will happen 292 billion years later.
This is a change of the musl libc ABI and needs a recompilation of all user space applications linked against musl libc.
For 64 bit systems this was done when the ABI was defined many years ago, the glibc ARC ABI already has a 64 bit <code>time_t</code>.

<p>
Core components have the following versions in 22.03.0-rc6:
</p>


<p>
In addition to the listed applications, many others were also updated see the <a href="https://openwrt.org/releases/22.03/changelog-22.03.0" title="releases:22.03:changelog-22.03.0" data-wiki-id="releases:22.03:changelog-22.03.0">detailed Changelog</a> for more information.

<p>
Sysupgrade can be used to upgrade a device from OpenWrt 21.02 to 22.03, and configuration will be preserved in most cases.
Upgrades from a previous 22.03.0 release candidate are also supported.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://openwrt.org/lib/images/smileys/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:"/> Sysupgrade from 19.07 to 22.03 is not supported.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://openwrt.org/lib/images/smileys/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:"/> There is no migration path for targets that switched from swconfig to DSA. In that case, sysupgrade will refuse to proceed with an appropriate error message:</p>

<p>
None so far.
