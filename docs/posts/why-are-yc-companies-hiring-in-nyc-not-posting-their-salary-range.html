    <h1>Ask HN: Why are YC companies hiring in NYC not posting their salary range?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I saw a few ads here for hiring over the last month for YC companies in NYC that did not post their salary range, and clicking through to the post on their portal the range was also nowhere to be found.</p><p>I can&#39;t comment on those posts, so I wasn&#39;t able to do any type of callout. I thought I remember being able to comment on them, but I think that functionality was removed ...</p><p>Why is this acceptable?</p></div></div></div>
