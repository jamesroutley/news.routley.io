    <h1>Five Nurses who work on the same floor at hospital have brain tumors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Boston-area hospital is investigating after five nurses who have worked on the same floor have developed brain tumors. </p><p>Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital said that in total, 11 employees from the fifth-floor maternity unit identified health concerns. Five had brain tumors, all of which are benign. Two of those have the most common, benign type — meningioma, according to the hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, which is about 10 miles west of Boston.</p><p>“The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor,” the hospital’s Jonathan Sonis, associate chief medical officer, and Sandy Muse, chief nursing officer, said in a statement.</p><p>The hospital said its investigation was completed in collaboration with government health and safety officials and it considered multiple possible sources. It ruled out disposable masks, the water supply, nearby x-rays, and chemotherapy treatment on the floor below, the hospital said.</p><p>“Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team ... and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility,&#34; the administrators said. </p><figure><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 1x"/><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg" alt="Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass" height="958" width="1436"/></picture><figcaption data-testid="caption"><span data-testid="caption__container">An exterior of Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass.</span><span data-testid="caption__source">Google Maps</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Massachusetts Nurses Association, the union that bargains for nurses&#39; compensation at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, said it will continue to investigate.  </p><p>&#34;Right now, the best way we can help is to complete an independent, scientific investigation,&#34; MNA spokesperson Joe Markman said in a statement Friday. &#34;That effort is underway and may take additional weeks.&#34;</p><p>The union indicated that nurses came forward with workplace health concerns, which led to the discovery of those with tumors.</p><p>“The hospital only spoke to a small number of nurses, and their environmental testing was not comprehensive,” he said in his statement. “The hospital cannot make this issue go away by attempting to provide a predetermined conclusion.” </p><p>A spokesperson for a state agency was unable to provide conclusive information on the matter by deadline.
