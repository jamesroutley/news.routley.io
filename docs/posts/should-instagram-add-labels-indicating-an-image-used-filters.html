    <h1>Ask HN: Should Instagram add labels indicating an image used filters?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I think we Instagram should indicate whether or not an image had filters applied to them. This will still allow folks to enhance images, but at the same time inform users that the image has been enhanced and improved. Therefore informing the viewer, what you&#39;re seeing is a mixing of reality and illusion.</td></div></div>
