    <h1>eBay is laying off 9 percent of its workforce</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest tech giant impacted by the economy is eBay, which <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ensuring-ebays-long-term-success/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:announced;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">announced</a> earlier today that it is reducing its workforce by around 1,000 roles. That apparently equates to roughly 9 percent of the company&#39;s full-time employees. US employees are asked to work from home on January 24, and those affected will be notified &#34;shortly.&#34; Unlike <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-lays-off-170-workers-in-latest-round-of-cuts-211541127.html" data-ylk="slk:Discord;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Discord</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-is-laying-off-11-percent-of-its-workforce-globally-022034243.html" data-ylk="slk:Riot Games;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Riot Games</a>, though, eBay&#39;s post stopped short at sharing severance or benefit details. The company also plans to scale back the number of contractors over the coming months.</p><p>eBay&#39;s impact scale matches that of <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-is-cutting-a-quarter-of-its-workforce-074331467.html" data-ylk="slk:Unity;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Unity</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ceo-says-more-layoffs-expected-throughout-the-year-in-internal-memo-044016588.html" data-ylk="slk:Google;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Google</a> from earlier this month, which doesn&#39;t paint a pretty picture for the <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/linkedins-new-ai-feature-helps-people-find-jobs-by-grouping-them-into-tailored-categories-104032853.html" data-ylk="slk:tech scene;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">tech scene</a> right at the beginning of 2024. Like its peers, eBay blamed this round of layoff on having hired too many people in recent years. &#34;While we are making progress against our strategy, our overall headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business,&#34; president and CEO Jamie Iannone said in the memo. Hopefully LinkedIn&#39;s new <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/linkedins-new-ai-feature-helps-people-find-jobs-by-grouping-them-into-tailored-categories-104032853.html" data-ylk="slk:AI-powered categorization tool;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">AI-powered categorization tool</a> will come in handy for those in need.</p></div></div>
