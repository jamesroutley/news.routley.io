    <h1>Researching file formats 5: Radiance RGBE Image Format</h1>

<p><span>08 Sep 2023</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>This format was one that I started researching, but was only accidentally part of the set I was given, so this one will never have an FDD! But I learned a bit about the format before that was determined, so it merits having a blog post anyway.</p>

<p>Radiance RGBE Image Format: This looks to be the first popular HDR image storage format.</p>

<p>I came across these incredibly sick book covers and equally powerful book series website that is still being kept up to date called <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/resources/GraphicsGems/">GRAPHICS GEMS</a>!  Love when I can buy a book or get all the contents online for free! (Shamelessly I must add that if you like that too, you can see or buy my audio/film/video formats series by visiting the <a href="https://mediaguides.archivesoftomorrow.com/">Media Guides Series website</a>!)</p>

<p>New word for me:
“mantissa”
Use it in a sentence, why dontcha? Okay: “The basic idea is to store a 1-byte mantissa for each of
three primaries, and a common 1-byte exponent” (from the spec: <a href="https://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf">https://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>The computing definition: “the part of a floating-point number that represents the significant digits of that number, and that is multiplied by the base raised to the exponent to give the actual value of the number.”</p>

<p>Another new word for me:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)">“metamerism”</a>
“a perceived matching of colors with different (nonmatching) spectral power distributions”
Sometimes you know the concept but not the word behind it.</p>

<p>And sometimes I feel like I’ve been able to understand a lot about color spaces while still understanding basically nothing about color spaces.</p>

<p>Maybe working on this I’ll finally understand ray-tracing………….. I dunno.</p>

<p>There are at least two versions of this format, so it could be considered a family rather than just one format.</p>

<p>While researching, I got to enjoy <a href="http://anyhere.com/gward/snaps/SG02/index.html">these photos taken during SIGGRAPH 2002</a>, among others. They are just normal image files though, not RGBE files. Still, glad people were having a good time.</p>
