<p>This newslet­ter is a fun one, with lots to explore and think about. First, I’ll review my upcom­ing releases, then share some inter­est­ing work from other peo­ple. I’ll also describe a recent encounter that I found both allur­ing and unnerving … !</p>
<h2 id="releases"><a href="#releases">Upcoming releases</a></h2>
<p>Remember, here’s the drumbeat ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>August 2:</strong> digital release of <a href="https://www.mcdbooks.com/news/behold-the-suitcase-clone">The Suitcase Clone</a></li>
<li><strong>September 6:</strong> print release of Sourdough’s new edition, with The Suitcase Clone bundled</li>
<li><strong>October 4:</strong> print release of Penumbra’s new edition, with Ajax Penumbra 1969 bundled</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll be able to find those every­where books and e-books are sold.</p>
<p>The Suit­case Clone’s audio­book edi­tion is also due on August 2, and the fine folks at Macmil­lan Audio are run­ning a sweepstakes to win a free copy! <a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/thesuitcasecloneaudiosweepstakes/"><strong>You can enter here</strong></a>; the sweep­stakes runs from today through August 1.</p>
<p>Here’s a peek behind the audiobook scenes. Ear­lier this year, I corresponded with the audio­book’s pro­ducer, who asked if I had any notions for the nar­ra­tor’s voice. I wrote back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this nar­ra­tor is very amused by humans and their <span>vexations — </span><wbr/>by life, the universe, and <span>everything — </span><wbr/>so, a sense of irony, of play, will be more appro­pri­ate than an entirely seri­ous read. Not that it should sound silly; rather, I’m think­ing of lis­ten­ing to some­one speak­ing and, even though you can’t see their face, you feel some­how that they’re just on the verge of smiling … </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, the pro­ducer sent me three clips to review, each a dif­fer­ent per­former read­ing a short pas­sage from the novella. Then, we dis­cussed which audi­tion we liked best … and dis­cov­ered we were in agreement! Pavi Proczko was our pick; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/macaudio-2/the-suitcase-clone-by-robin-sloan-audiobook-excerpt/s-GVy3qoLwqRc?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">you can hear his per­for­mance of the novella’s intro­duc­tion here</a>.</p>

<h3>A new voice</h3>
<p>I had the plea­sure to look at an early copy of a new book of poetry, writ­ten by Chuck Ladd, titled <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/chuck-ladd/a-quiet-place-in-oklahoma/hardcover/product-87k626.html?q=&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=4">A Quiet Place in Okla­homa</a>. Chuck’s col­lec­tion is deft, meditative, and, on cer­tain pages, laugh-out-loud funny. It’s the kind of work that invites every­body in, even those new to poetry.</p>
<p>By the end, A Quiet Place in Okla­homa shines as brightly as Camelot.</p>

</figure>
<p>This book is the project of two pub­lic school teach­ers in Texas: Chuck Ladd is, of course, the poet; Alex Sim­mons is the edi­tor and publisher. It’s a beau­ti­ful piece of work, in form and con­tent both, and it made me laugh. What’s bet­ter than that?</p>
<p>My copy is <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/chuck-ladd/a-quiet-place-in-oklahoma/hardcover/product-87k626.html?q=&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=4">the hard­cover edi­tion</a>; there’s <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/chuck-ladd/a-quiet-place-in-oklahoma/paperback/product-ny4z4y.html?q=&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=4">a neat paperback</a> avail­able, too.</p>
<p>(If there is any­one read­ing this newslet­ter who works at a regional press in Texas or Okla­homa: I think you ought to snap this one up!)</p>
<h3>Being counted</h3>
<p>Dan Bouk’s new book, Democracy’s Data, will be pub­lished by MCD in August.</p>
<p>This is the kind of project that begins with a very spe­cific sub­ject that you’re not quite con­vinced can be <span>inter­est­ing — </span><wbr/>the … 1940 … <span>Census? — </span><wbr/>and then uses it as a pry bar to crack open cos­mic ques­tions: about democracy, government, families, and lots more.</p>

</picture>
<figcaption><a href="https://www.shroudedincloaksofboringness.com/democracysdata/">Democracy&#39;s Data</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the book’s core is a ques­tion that couldn’t be more rel­e­vant to the 21st century, not just in terms of democracy, but also the inter­net and its vast, watchful plat­forms:</p>
<p>What the hell does it even mean for a <span>person — </span><wbr/>a real, whole, complex, sov­ereign <span>person — </span><wbr/>to be <em>counted</em>?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you more about the book later this <span>year — </span><wbr/>odds are, I won’t shut up about <span>it — </span><wbr/>but, for now, I’ll say that <a href="https://www.shroudedincloaksofboringness.com/democracysdata/">Dan’s web­site and newslet­ter</a> are worth following, if only for the vision of a scholar at the top of their game: rigorous, revelatory, engaged with the world, <span>and — </span><wbr/>never to be <span>overlooked — </span><wbr/>writ­ing with grace and style.</p>
<h3>The kind of essay that makes you want to View Source</h3>
<p>Robin Rendle’s new essay is so clev­erly constructed! <a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/in-praise-of-shadows/">Here, he gives us an argu­ment about pho­tog­ra­phy</a> … in which the text occludes all the photographs.</p>
<p>I would call this a “tap essay”, like <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/">Fish</a>. Note the care­ful struc­tur­ing of the <span>text — </span><wbr/>its allo­ca­tion to dif­fer­ent “cards”—and the rhythm, which is almost oral. Terrific.</p>
<p>Readers so inclined should View Source on Robin’s essay: look at that CSS and JavaScript, so light and sturdy! It’s ener­giz­ing to know that such a snappy pre­sen­ta­tion is avail­able so “cheaply” in mod­ern browsers. I am taking notes.</p>
<h3>Digital slipperiness</h3>
<p>I appre­ci­ated Hal­lie Bateman’s <a href="https://mailchi.mp/76bdf7d431bc/i-quit-my-job-16513235?e=54627c1d04">reflections on the chal­lenges of shar­ing art</a> on Insta­gram circa 2022:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, as Insta­gram has become a less hos­pitable place for artists, I’ve strug­gled to main­tain a pres­ence there that feels gen­uine to me. I don’t want to make TikTok-style process videos, or make art respond­ing to heart­break­ing world events. I don’t want to make comics about my per­sonal life, or even share updates on cur­rent projects. The algo­rithm now guar­an­tees a luke­warm response to nearly any still image I post, and I don’t want to get discouraged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve come to believe the fun­da­men­tal prop­erty of dig­i­tal media is slipperiness. Dif­fer­ent plat­forms are different kinds of slippery at dif­fer­ent times. Insta­gram is presently: extremely <span>slip­pery — </span><wbr/>squirming its way out of all its old con­tracts and expectations, strug­gling to become some­thing basi­cally unrecog­niz­able to its long­time users. Bummer. (And, I’m sure I’m not the only user whose ad load has increased 5X or more. It reeks of desperation.)</p>
<p>I think per­son­i­fi­ca­tion here can be useful. Think of the friend who is dazzling, attractive, <span>protean — </span><wbr/>and unsteady, and unreliable. They are magnetic; you enjoy being around them, reflect­ing their glow! But, if you are wise, you know how to bracket and buffer the rela­tion­ship.</p>
<p>Think also of the friend who demon­strates solid integrity; upon whom you can rely totally. There are other forms of media that fit this figure; it won’t sur­prise you to hear that I think the print book is one.</p>
<p>It’s okay for peo­ple, and media, to be different; to have dif­fer­ent strengths and weaknesses. It’s just impor­tant to under­stand who and what you’re dealing with.</p>
<h3>Seeking solid ground</h3>
<p>Here is my <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/">pro­posal for a new protocol</a>, one that might open up some inter­est­ing new pos­si­bil­i­ties on the inter­net. This was my lab newslet­ter back in June; it received a warm, engaged response, and I have con­tin­ued to develop the <span>idea — </span><wbr/>along with the code back­ing it <span>up — </span><wbr/>so I thought I’d share it here, too.</p>
<p>Whether or not my pro­posal goes anywhere, I want to report that I found writ­ing in this <span>way — </span><wbr/><em>imagining</em> in this <span>way — </span><wbr/>both chal­leng­ing and ener­giz­ing, and I’d rec­om­mend it to anyone; par­tic­u­larly those any­ones who feel uncom­fort­able inside the the inter­net of the 2020s.</p>
<p>Digital media is slip­pery because it’s mutable, and if it’s mutable, it means new <span>forms — </span><wbr/>new ways of <span>relating — </span><wbr/>are always pos­si­ble. Why not take the time, and do the work, to imag­ine some­thing new?</p>

<p>Here’s my tale of an odd dis­cov­ery online, which offers</p>
<ul>
<li>a puzzle,</li>
<li>a naturally-occuring Borges story, and/or perhaps</li>
<li>a preview of media ecology in the decade to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was lis­ten­ing to Spo­tify’s rec­om­mendations, an algo­rithmic radio sta­tion that had picked up where my short playlist left off, when an inter­est­ing track came on. Its whompy brass reminded me faintly of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwZBrZkbKAE">Too Many Zooz</a>.</p>
<p><em>Nice sound</em>, I thought. <em>I wonder what else this artist has pro­duced … </em></p>
<p>The answer was: vir­tu­ally noth­ing. “Danni Richardson” appeared to be one of those artists with just a hand­ful of tracks avail­able on Spo­tify, of which this one, titled Romilda Geb­bia, was by far the stand­out hit, with 91,000 plays.</p>
<p><em>Oh, well</em>, I thought. <em>Back to the algo­rithmic radio sta­tion.</em></p>
<p>Except: the next track was the same. I don’t mean that it was Romilda Geb­bia again. This one was nom­i­nally dif­fer­ent: Veneranda Caputa, by Brett Byrne. The track’s par­tic­u­lars, its tim­ings and timbres, sounded … reshuffled, some­how. But its core was unmistakable.</p>
<p>Both tracks a mere 45 sec­onds <span>long — </span><wbr/>more vibes than songs.</p>
<p><em>That’s very weird</em>, I thought. <em>Onward.</em></p>
<p>Except: the next track was the same. And the next! AND THE NEXT!</p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2IaWgbhpPbS3Z9DYgf1rqg?si=12699cca4cf441e8">I’ve col­lected these tracks in a playlist</a> so you can lis­ten for yourself, and hear the strange repetition. There are far more ver­sions than the ten I’ve pinned <span>here — </span><wbr/>definitely dozens, pos­si­bly <span>hun­dreds — </span><wbr/>and Spo­tify’s algo­rithm will obe­di­ently deliver them to you in the Rec­om­mended section, down below the playlist.</p>
<p>In all of them, you can detect the under­ly­ing composition, its essen­tial elements: call that Romilda Prime.</p>
<p>Part of the story here is clear. Some mystery pro­ducer devel­oped a scrap of a song that sounded appeal­ing, and rather than put all their wood behind a sin­gle arrow, they decided to make <span>dozens — </span><wbr/><span>hun­dreds? — </span><wbr/>of vari­a­tions and inject them all into the system, all in dif­fer­ent places. The artist names and track titles are nonsense; to me, they carry the clear fla­vor of AI text generation. For album art, our mys­tery pro­ducer has used the most banal stock pho­tog­ra­phy you have ever <span>seen — </span><wbr/>almost impressively boring.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it’s all ques­tions.</p>
<p>How did our mys­tery pro­ducer make these variations? Was it a long after­noon with Able­ton Live, swap­ping out instruments, fid­dling with the piano roll? Or is this an automated, indus­trial process? Do they have the abil­ity to run a command, <code>python generate_vari­a­tions.py --base=romilda-prime</code>, step away, and return to a folder of crisp new MP3s?</p>
<p>What are the eco­nom­ics of this project? These variations have done pretty well; the ones I inspected each have some­where between 50,000 and 200,000 plays. If Spo­tify pays a third of a cent per stream, and there are 30 vari­a­tions with those numbers, that’s in the ball­park of $10,000. (Of course, a mys­tery pro­ducer capable of pup­peteer­ing all these fake artists is also capa­ble of buy­ing fake streams … )</p>
<p>One pre­sumes our mys­tery pro­ducer would not just do this once. So, have they dis­patched a whole fleet of these hazy “song clouds”? Are there other “primes” lurk­ing in Spo­tify’s catalog, with dozens or hun­dreds of vari­a­tions? How could you pos­si­bly find them? You couldn’t, except by accident.</p>
<p>(I have seen spec­u­la­tion that it is Spo­tify itself cre­at­ing these song clouds, and I will just say that, for my part, I doubt this. Mostly because, as a big, resourceful, cre­ative organization … I think it would do a bet­ter job with the names and the album art!)</p>
<p>I wonder, at last, about the rela­tion­ship of this par­tic­u­lar “prime” to Spo­tify’s algorithm. I’ve never seen the rec­om­mendations set­tle so quickly into such a deep groove; once the algorithm got the taste of Romilda Prime in its mouth, there was no get­ting it out. Is that a mat­ter of chance? Maybe our mys­tery pro­ducer has spun this wheel many times, and it’s only with Romilda Prime that they hit the jackpot. They found a sound that is per­fectly seductive, not to humans, necessarily, but to the one lis­tener who counts most: the algo­rithm.</p>
<p>So … like a lot of things in 21st-century media, I both love this and hate it.</p>
<p>I love it, because it’s so strange, so dizzying, <span>and — </span><wbr/>credit where due–because our mys­tery pro­ducer is truly going with the grain of the medium, in a way that no one merely “making albums” does, at all. What could be more 21st century, more “liquid mod­ernity”, than releas­ing your music as a haze of vari­a­tions into the swirling cur­rents of the algo­rithm?</p>
<p>I hate it, because of course it trou­bles every intu­ition I have about what it means to be an <span>artist — </span><wbr/>the very idea of authorship! There’s some­thing espe­cially cyn­i­cal about the spe­cific exe­cu­tion here, too. I can eas­ily imag­ine another ver­sion of this project that uses inter­est­ing track titles and gen­er­a­tive album art, so that grop­ing around for the hid­den “prime” might feel more like piec­ing together a puzzle, less like leaf­ing through junk mail.</p>
<p>It’s the media ver­sion of a phe­nom­enon that’s com­mon across the food deliv­ery services. Here’s a pic­ture snapped in my neighborhood:</p>

<h3>A new voyage</h3>
<p>My band <a href="https://ooo.ghostbows.ooo/">The Cot­ton Modules</a>, formed with the com­poser Jesse Solomon Clark, also goes with the grain of the 21st century: our process com­bines AI tools with human skill and imagination, metab­o­liz­ing a huge archive of recorded music into some­thing gen­uinely new and exciting.</p>
<p>Currently, Jesse and I are work­ing on our sec­ond album. Last week, we sent a newslet­ter <a href="https://ooo.ghostbows.ooo/news/summer-2022/">describing its sci-fi storyline</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Centuries from now, colonists climb aboard a mas­sive space­ship bound for Bethel 66 J, a promis­ing exoplanet. The ship car­ries an arse­nal of ter­raform­ing equipment, a liv­ing seed bank, and a com­plete archive of Earth culture. As it crosses the orbit of Jupiter, pick­ing up speed, the ship’s pas­sen­gers climb into their cryo-chambers. They’ll pass the light years in slumber, watched over by two caretaker AIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not the first of these voyages, but it is absolutely the worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ooo.ghostbows.ooo/news/summer-2022/">The newslet­ter continues</a>, explain­ing (a) the diegetic role our new album plays on this worst of all space voyages, along with (b) the feel­ing behind the whole project.</p>
<p>The newslet­ter also includes a demo track that will only be avail­able for a lim­ited time. Fans of colony ships and/or coastal feel­ings might appre­ci­ate the vibe!</p>

<p>I had the plea­sure recently of host­ing Gabrielle Zevin at Green Apple Books in San Fran­cisco for the launch of her new novel.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomor­row is a tale of a cre­ative part­ner­ship across two decades, set in the video game industry. That back­drop was deeply appeal­ing to me, but/and the con­tours of the medium are less impor­tant than those of the rela­tion­ship. The book is beau­ti­fully done: confident, absorbing, and, in parts, quite experimental.</p>

</figure>
<p>Gabrielle’s novel made me think often of the eucatastrophe.</p>
<p>That’s a term invented by Tolkien: the crash of good fortune. He called it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the con­so­la­tion of fairy-stories, the joy of the happy ending: or more cor­rectly of the good catastrophe, the sudden joy­ous “turn” (for there is no true end to any fairy-tale): this joy, which is one of the things which fairy-stories can pro­duce supremely well, is not essen­tially “escapist,” nor “fugitive.” In its fairy-<span>tale — </span><wbr/>or <span>otherworld — </span><wbr/>setting, it is a sud­den and mirac­u­lous grace: never to be counted on to recur. It does not deny the exis­tence of dyscatastrophe, of sor­row and failure: the pos­si­bil­ity of these is nec­es­sary to the joy of deliverance; it denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) uni­ver­sal final defeat and in so far is evangelium, giv­ing a fleet­ing glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The end of The Return of the King is a series of eucatastro­phes.</p>
<p>I would say that both Penum­bra and Sour­dough resolve into eucatastro­phes, and my new novel is, in some ways, about what lies beyond eucatastrophe.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomor­row is richly eucatastrophic. Gabrielle does not (as Tolkien says) deny the exis­tence of sor­row and failure; not for a sec­ond. But/and, it is the book’s bursts of kind­ness and <span>openness — </span><wbr/>the way those things <em>work</em> in the world of the novel, exhibit real power, bend the plot in sur­pris­ing <span>ways — </span><wbr/>that will, I believe, stick with me.</p>
<h2 id="miyazaki"><a href="#miyazaki">The Great Miyazaki Watch of 2022</a></h2>
<p>I recently re-watched, in chrono­log­i­cal order, all the movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki. These movies, along with Miyazaki’s manga ver­sion of Nausicaä of the Val­ley of the Wind, have influ­enced me as much as any­thing else on this planet, and I wanted to begin to make that influ­ence more conscious and structured, rather than totally uncon­scious and … blobby?</p>
<p>Accordingly: as I watched, I took notes.</p>
<p>I’d seen all but two of the movies before.</p>
<p>One of those new to me was The Cas­tle of Cagliostro, the first movie Miyazaki directed, before the found­ing of Stu­dio Ghibli. I slept on this one for too long! If it doesn’t have the emo­tional and mythic res­o­nances of the movies that came later, it sub­sti­tutes pure style:</p>

<p>The other movie new to me was Porco Rosso, which fea­tures a dash­ing pilot cursed to look like a humanoid pig. I noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They never tell us how he got cursed! The <span>omission — </span><wbr/>the lack of <span>pathos — </span><wbr/>is radical. A rejec­tion of “the trauma plot”. The ambi­gu­ity at the <span>end — </span><wbr/>fabulous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Amer­i­can ver­sion of this movie would be so much less inter­est­ing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pig is an ace pilot, and you could be for­given for think­ing the movie’s heart is its fan­tas­ti­cal <span>dogfights — </span><wbr/>but I think that’s wrong. Its core, not only emo­tional but also moral and aesthetic, is earthbound: the detailed scene in which Porco Rosso’s air­plane is rebuilt in Milan.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of this in Miyazaki’s movies: the drama and delight of work.</p>

<p>Of course … it’s also cool when Porco flies the plane through the canals of Milan.</p>

<p>The other thing I noticed, watch­ing the movies in quick succession, was the steady boom-boom-boom of the eucatastro­phes going off!</p>
<p>Kiki’s Deliv­ery Ser­vice is the key example. I noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is so much kindness in so many of Miyazaki’s movies. Plots ani­mated by kind­ness. If peo­ple were not kind and open: noth­ing would happen!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The great twists in Miyazaki movies are that peo­ple and crea­tures turn out to be friendlier than you expect. The dog in the big house in Kiki.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plots ani­mated by kindness: not sac­cha­rine or dull, but soar­ing and magnetic. Sto­ries about kind­ness that draw potent chem­i­cals into your blood just as surely as the thrillers do! That make your heart thrum, pull your cheeks tight. That tell you about the world, and what’s pos­si­ble in it.</p>
<p>This kind of art is just as deadly seri­ous as the baddest, sad­dest stream­ing TV series you have ever seen. Believe it.</p>

<p>This newslet­ter’s illus­tra­tions are the work of Theodor Kittelsen, drawn from <a href="https://www.nasjonalmuseet.no/en/collection/producer/56283/theodor-kittelsen">the col­lec­tion</a> at the National Museum of Norway. What a range: from rich paint­ings to moody etch­ings to draw­ings almost like cartoons! It’s totally compelling, and there is a LOT to look at; don’t miss the “Show more” buttons, seem­ingly neverending, at the bot­tom of the page.</p>
