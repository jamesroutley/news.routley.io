employees.</p><p><b>Members of Congress</b> will still be paid as their pay is required by the American constitution, the letter adds. </p><p>As for the <b>military</b>, they are required to work during a shutdown but won&#39;t be paid until after. </p><p>&#34;The effects of a government shutdown on <b>business activity</b> are uncertain, and
their magnitude would depend on the duration of a shutdown and on decisions
made by the Administration,&#34; the letter adds. </p>

      US senators have failed to pass a last-minute bill to avert a government shutdown, which almost guarantees that funding will cut off at midnight ET (04.00 GMT)
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      If the shutdown does come about, it will be the first since 2018; we would expect to see essential government workers continue on in their roles as normal, but those deemed non-essential put on unpaid leave 
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Services deemed non-essential include the food assistance programme, federally-funded pre-school, the issuing of student loans, food inspections, and operations at national parks

      President Trump has threatened &#34;irreversible&#34; cuts if shutdown happens, and has placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of Democrats

      <p>At Katmai National Park in Alaska, the annual competition known
as Fat Bear Week is being held now to avoid being cancelled in the event of
a government shutdown.</p><p>Voting began last week and ends - in just a moment - at 21:00 ET (01:00 GMT) tonight.</p><p>The contest pitting the park’s bears against each other to
determine adequate fatness to withstand the winter was moved to the
last week in September. The shift “avoids any uncertainty regarding the National
Park Service budget and a possible federal government shutdown”, organisers
say.</p><p>Voters are asked to pick the bear that &#34;best exemplifies fatness and
success in brown bears&#34;. It’s currently down to two finalists, Chunk and bear No. 856.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="A large brown bear walks in a river looking down." src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/9/30/6bb4b920-dbfc-4b8b-b221-e18610f1f21f.jpg.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/9/30/6bb4b920-dbfc-4b8b-b221-e18610f1f21f.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/9/30/6bb4b920-dbfc-4b8b-b221-e18610f1f21f.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/9/30/6bb4b920-dbfc-4b8b-b221-e18610f1f21f.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/9/30/6bb4b920-dbfc-4b8b-b221-e18610f1f21f.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/9/30/6bb4b920-dbfc-4b8b-b221-e18610f1f21f.jpg.webp 800w" width="1000" height="563"/></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Katmai National Park and Preserve</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Fat Bear Week 2025 contestant No. 856 pictured after gaining weight in September 2025 in preparation for winter hibernation</p></figcaption></figure>

      <p>Unlike the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian has enough
money to keep its museums open for a week.</p><p>“Smithsonian will use prior-year funds to remain open to the
public at least through Monday, October 6, 2025,” the institution says.</p><p>The Smithsonian includes more than a dozen museums and galleries
that hosted nearly 17 million visitors in 2024. The most popular are the National
Museums of Natural History and American History and the National Air and Space
Museum.</p>
