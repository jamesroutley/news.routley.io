<h3 dir="auto">Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature</h3>
<p dir="auto"><code>--no-quarantine</code> is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=saqachfa" rel="nofollow">updated macOS runtime protection</a> to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don&#39;t &#34;<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/rosetta-2-on-a-mac-with-apple-silicon-secebb113be1/1/web/1" rel="nofollow">permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached</a>&#34;. Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the above in mind, it&#39;s time to deprecate the <code>--no-quarantine</code> flag from <code>brew</code>. It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What is the motivation for the feature?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?</h3>
<p dir="auto">We will provide a safer experience for our users, and stop making it easier to bypass OS-level security.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What alternatives to the feature have been considered?</h3>
<p dir="auto">None. Macs with Apple silicon are the platform that will be supported in the future, and Apple is making it harder to bypass Gatekeeper as is.</p></div></div><div><!--$--><p><span data-direction="ne" role="tooltip" aria-hidden="true" id=":R4daklmb:">UnixEU</span><span data-direction="ne" role="tooltip" aria-hidden="true" id=":R4laklmb:">notDavid, LeoNatan, deadpanmuesli, aleksey-ge, ZuidVolt and 2 more</span><span data-direction="ne" role="tooltip" aria-hidden="true" id=":R65aklmb:">erik-bershel and lmerz1</span></p><!--/$--></div></div></div></div></div>
