	History
	</h2>
	<p>
	<abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> was initially standardised in <a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/CharCodeHist/X3.4-1963/index.html">X3.4-1963</a> (which just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?) which assigned meanings to 100 of the
	potential 128 codepoints presented by a 7-bit<sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-4" name="footnote-ref-23995-4" href="#footnote-23995-4" title="ASCII is often thought of as an 8-bit code, but it’s not: it’s 7-bit. That’s why virtually every ASCII message you see starts every octet with a zero. 8-bits is a convenient number for transmission purposes (thanks mostly to being a power of two), but early 8-bit systems would be far more-likely to use the 8th bit as a parity check, to help detect transmission errors. Of course, there’s also nothing to say you can’t just transmit a stream of 7-bit characters back to back!">4</a></sup>

	If you’ve already guessed where I’m going with this, you might be interested to look at the X3.4-1963 table and see that yes, many of the same elegant design choices I’ll be talking
	about later <em>already existed</em> back in 1963. That’s really cool!
	</p>
	<h2>
	Table
	</h2>
	<p>
	In case you’re not yet intimately familiar with it, let’s take a look at an <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> table. I’ve
	colour-coded some of the bits I think are most-beautiful:
	</p>
	<p id="image-23995-0">
	<a href="#lightbox-p-image-23995-0" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2024/07/ascii-table-with-highlighting.svg" alt="ASCII table with Decimal, Hex, and Character columns."/></a>That table only shows decimal and hexadecimal values for each
	character, but we’re going to need some binary too, to really appreciate some of the things that make <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> sublime and clever.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Control codes
	</h3>
	<p>
	The first 32 “characters” (and, arguably, the final one) aren’t things that you can <em>see</em>, but commands sent between machines to provide additional instructions. You might be
	familiar with carriage return (<code>0D</code>) and line feed (<code>0A</code>) which mean “go back to the beginning of this line” and “advance to the next line”,
	respectively<sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-5" name="footnote-ref-23995-5" href="#footnote-23995-5" title="Back when data was sent to teletype printers these two characters had a distinct different meaning, and sometimes they were so slow at returning their heads to the left-hand-side of the paper that you’d also need to send a few null bytes e.g. 0D 0A 00 00 00 00 to make sure that the print head had gotten settled into the right place before you sent more data: printers didn’t have memory buffers at this point! For compatibility with teletypes, early minicomputers followed the same carriage return plus line feed convention, even when outputting text to screens. Then to maintain backwards compatibility with those systems, the next generation of computers would also use both a carriage return and a line feed character to mean “next line”. And so, in the modern day, many computer systems (including Windows most of the time, and many Internet protocols) still continue to use the combination of a carriage return and a line feed character every time they want to say “next line”; a redundancy build for a chain of backwards-compatibility that ceased to be relevant decades ago but which remains with us forever as part of our digital heritage.">5</a></sup>.
	Many of the others don’t see widespread use any more – they were designed for very different kinds of computer systems than we routinely use today – but they’re all still there.
	</p>
	<p>
	32 is a power of two, which means that you’d rightly expect these control codes to mathematically share a particular “pattern” in their binary representation with one another, distinct
	from the rest of the table. And they do! <strong>All of the control codes follow the pattern <code>00_____</code>:</strong> that is, they begin with two zeroes. So when you’re reading
	7-bit <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr><sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-6" name="footnote-ref-23995-6" href="#footnote-23995-6" title="Got 8 binary digits in front of you? The first digit is probably zero. Drop it. Now you’ve got 7-bit ASCII. Sorted.">6</a></sup>, if it starts with
	<code><strong>00</strong></code>, it’s a non-printing character. Otherwise it’s a printing character.
	</p>
	<p>
	Not only does this pattern make it easy for humans to read (and, with it, makes the code less-arbitrary and more-beautiful); it also helps if you’re an ancient slow computer system
	comparing one bit of information at a time. In this case, you can use a decision tree to make shortcuts.
	</p>
	<figure id="attachment_24000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24000">
	<a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_24000" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2024/07/punched-paper-tape-rolls-640x316.jpg" alt="Two rolls of punched paper tape." width="640" height="316" srcset="/_q23u/2024/07/punched-paper-tape-rolls-640x316.jpg 640w, https://danq.me/_q23u/2024/07/punched-paper-tape-rolls-1280x631.jpg 1280w, https://danq.me/_q23u/2024/07/punched-paper-tape-rolls-980x483.jpg 980w, https://danq.me/_q23u/2024/07/punched-paper-tape-rolls-1960x966.jpg 1960w" sizes="100vw"/></a>

		That there’s one exception in the control codes: <em>DEL</em> is the <em>last</em> character in the table, represented by the binary number <code><strong>1111111</strong></code>. This
		is a historical throwback to paper tape, where the keyboard would punch some permutation of seven holes to represent the ones and zeros of each character. You can’t <em>delete</em>
		holes once they’ve been punched, so the only way to mark a character as invalid was to rewind the tape and punch out <em>all</em> the holes in that position: i.e. all
		<code><strong>1</strong></code>s.
	</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<h3>
	Space
	</h3>
	<p>
	The first printing character is space; it’s an <em>invisible</em> character, but it’s still one that has meaning to humans, so it’s not a control character (this sounds obvious today,
	but it was actually the source of some semantic argument when the <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> standard was first being
	discussed).
	</p>
	<p>
	Putting it numerically <em>before any other printing character</em> was a very carefully-considered and deliberate choice. The reason: <em>sorting</em>. For a computer to sort a list
	(of files, strings, or whatever) it’s easiest if it can do so <em>numerically</em>, using the same character conversion table as it uses for all other purposes<sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-7" name="footnote-ref-23995-7" href="#footnote-23995-7" title="I’m hugely grateful to section 13.8 of Coded Character Sets, History and Development by Charles E. Mackenzie (1980), the entire text of which is available freely online, for helping me to understand the importance of the position of the space character within the ASCII character set. While most of what I’ve written in this blog post were things I already knew, I’d never fully grasped its significance of the space character’s location until today!">7</a></sup>.
	The space character must naturally come before other characters, or else John Smith won’t appear before Johnny Five in a computer-sorted list as you’d expect him to.
	</p>
	<p>
	Being the first printing character, space also enjoys a beautiful and memorable binary representation that a human can easily recognise: <code><strong>0100000</strong></code>.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Numbers
	</h3>
	<p>
	The position of the Arabic numbers 0-9 is no coincidence, either. Their position means that they start with zero at the nice round binary value <code><strong>0110000</strong></code>
	(and similarly round hex value <code><strong>30</strong></code>) and continue sequentially, giving:

	The last four digits of the binary are a representation of the <em>value</em> of the decimal digit depicted. <strong>And</strong> the last digit of the hexadecimal representation
	<em>is</em> the decimal digit. That’s just brilliant!
	</p>
	<p>
	If you’re using this post as a way to teach yourself to “read” binary-formatted <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> in your head,
	the rule to take away here is: if it begins <code><strong>011</strong></code>, treat the remainder as a binary representation of an <em>actual number</em>. You’ll probably be
	right: if the number you get is above 9, it’s probably some kind of punctuation instead.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Shifted Numbers
	</h3>
	<p>
	Subtract <code><strong>0010000</strong></code> from each of the numbers and you get the <em>shifted numbers</em>. The first one’s occupied by the space character already, which is a
	shame, but for the rest of them, the characters are <em>what you get if you press the shift key and that number key at the same time</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	“No it’s not!” I hear you cry. Okay, you’re probably right. I’m using a 105-key ISO/UK QWERTY keyboard and… only <em>four</em> of the nine digits 1-9 have their shifted variants
	properly represented in <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
	That, I’m afraid, is because <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> was based not on modern computer keyboards but on the shifted
	positions of a Remington No. 2 mechanical typewriter – whose shifted layout was the closest compromise we could find as a standard at the time, I imagine. But hey, you got to learn
	something about typewriters today, if that’s any consolation.

	<h3>
	Letters
	</h3>
	<p>
	Like the numbers, the letters get a <em>pattern</em>. After the <code>@</code>-symbol at <code><strong>1000000</strong></code>, the uppercase letters all begin
	<code><strong>10</strong></code>, followed by the <em>binary representation of their position in the alphabet</em>. 1 = A = <code><strong>10<span>00001</span></strong></code>, 2 = B = <code><strong>10<span>00010</span></strong></code>, and so on up to 26 = Z =
	<code><strong>10<span>11010</span></strong></code>. If you can learn the numbers of the positions of the letters in the alphabet, and you can count
	in binary, you now know enough to be able to read any <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> uppercase letter that’s been encoded as
	binary<sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-8" name="footnote-ref-23995-8" href="#footnote-23995-8" title="I’m sure you know this already, but in case you’re one of today’s lucky 10,000 to discover that the reason we call the majuscule and minuscule letters “uppercase” and “lowercase”, respectively, dates to 19th century printing, when moveable type would be stored in a box (a “type case”) corresponding to its character type. The “upper” case was where the capital letters would typically be stored.">8</a></sup>.
	</p>
	<p>
	And once you know the uppercase letters, the lowercase ones are easy too. Their position in the table means that they’re all exactly <code><strong>0100000</strong></code>
	<em>higher</em> than the uppercase variants; i.e. all the lowercase letters begin <code><strong>11</strong></code>! 1 = a = <code><strong>11<span>00001</span></strong></code>, 2 = b = <code><strong>11<span>00010</span></strong></code>, and 26 = z =
	<code><strong>11<span>11010</span></strong></code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you’re wondering why the uppercase letters come <em>first</em>, the answer again is sorting: also the fact that the <em>first</em> implementation of <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>, which we saw above, was put together before it was certain that computer systems would <em>need</em> separate
	character codes for upper and lowercase letters (you could conceive of an alternative implementation that instead sent control codes to instruct the recipient to switch case, for
	example). Given the ways in which the technology is now used, I’m glad they eventually made the decision they did.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Beauty
	</h2>
	<p>
	There’s a strange and subtle charm to <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>. Given that we all use it (or things derived from it)
	literally <em>all the time</em> in our modern lives and our everyday devices, it’s easy to think of it as just some arbitrary encoding.
	</p>
	<p>
	But the choices made in <em>deciding what</em> streams of ones and zeroes would represent which characters expose a refined logic. It’s aesthetically pleasing, and littered with
	historical artefacts that teach us a hidden history of computing. And it’s built atop patterns that are sufficiently sophisticated to facilitate powerful processing while being coherent
	enough for a human to memorise, learn, and understand.
