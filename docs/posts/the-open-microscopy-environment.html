            <p>OME Files is a package of tools for reading and writing the standard OME-TIFF file format and working with the OME data model, which builds upon what began as a native C++ implementation of Bio-Formats. Potential uses include export of images using OME-TIFF, saving of acquired image data in OME-TIFF, reading metadata and image data from OME-TIFF for visualization and analysis, or use of the data model metadata APIs for handling metadata.</p>
