    <h1>Using a Laptop as an HDMI Monitor for an SBC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>Though I spend the majority of my time working with microcontroller class
devices, I also have an embarassingly robust collection of single board
computers (SBC), including a few different <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry
Pi</a> models, the <a href="https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglev-starlight/tree/main">BeagleV Starlight
Beta</a> (RIP), and
more. Typically when setting up these devices for whatever automation task I
have planned for them, I’ll use “headless mode” and configure initial user and
network credentials when writing the operating system to the storage device
using a tool like <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#raspberry-pi-imager">Raspberry Pi’s
Imager</a>.</p>
<p>However, sometimes direct physical access to the SBC with a monitor and keyboard
is useful for initial configuration, maintenance operations, or workloads that
have a visual component. As someone who doesn’t use any external monitors<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
for my daily development, digging up an HDMI monitor, finding somewhere to put
it, and connecting it to the device is an annoying process. Furthermore, if I’m
on the go I almost certainly don’t have easy access to an external monitor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I rarely ever do this because I have a handful of HDMI to USB
capture cards, ranging from extremely <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Express-AXHDCAP-Broadcasting-Conference/dp/B0C2MDTY8P">cheap variants from
Amazon</a>,
to the higher quality <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/cam-link-4k">Elgato Cam Link
4k</a>. These are typically used for
live streaming a video feed from DSLR / mirrorless cameras or gaming consoles,
but they also serve as a great option for capturing video from any other device
that has HDMI output. On my System76 Linux daily driver laptop, I can use any
number of different video playback applications to display the HDMI output via
the capture card. For longer term use cases, I can breathe new life into one of
my old laptops, using the capture card to effectively convert it into a monitor.</p>

<a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> will give you even more control. You’ll still
need a USB keyboard, but I already use one with my laptop, so temporarily
plugging it into the SBC for configuration while I use the laptop as a monitor
is minimally disruptive. However, if you find yourself regularly needing to
connect to multiple machines, it might be time to consider getting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM
