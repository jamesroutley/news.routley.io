The aircraft was operated by two pilots and four flight attendants.</p><p>As the aircraft reached the cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, both pilots took their headsets off and the cockpit loudspeaker volume was increased. The PIC then asked permission to rest from the SIC and was granted. A few seconds later, the PIC slept and the SIC then took over the PIC duty as PM.</p><p>The PIC woke up and at 0122 UTC, asked whether the SIC wanted to rest. The SIC responded that he did not want to rest. Both pilots then had a non-related-duty conversation for about 30 seconds and then the PIC continued to sleep.</p><p><a href="https://airlive.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ID6723.jpg" data-dt-img-description="" data-large_image_width="913" data-large_image_height="462"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI5MTMiIGhlaWdodD0iNDYyIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTEzIDQ2MiI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-src="https://airlive.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ID6723.jpg" alt="" width="913" height="462" data-srcset="https://airlive.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ID6723.jpg 913w, https://airlive.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ID6723-300x152.jpg 300w, https://airlive.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ID6723-600x304.jpg 600w" data-sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px"/></a></p><p>Around 20 minutes later, the SIC readback a Jakarta ACC instruction. A few moments later, the SIC then inadvertently fell asleep. 12 minutes after the last recorded transmission from the SIC, the Jakarta ACC asked BTK6723 how long the aircraft need to fly on the current heading (250Â°). There was no reply from the pilots.</p><p>28 minutes after the last recorded transmission from the SIC, the PIC woke up and was aware that the aircraft was not in the correct flight path. The PIC then saw the SIC was sleeping and woke him up. About the same time, the PIC responded to the call from another pilot and Jakarta ACC. The PIC advised the Jakarta ACC that BTK6723 experienced radio communication problem and currently the problem has been resolved. The flight then continued and landed at Jakarta uneventfully.</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
