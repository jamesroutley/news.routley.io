    <h1>A series of tricks and techniques I learned doing tiny GLSL demos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the past two months or so, I spent some time making tiny GLSL demos. I wrote
an article about the first one, <a href="https://blog.pkh.me/p/45-code-golfing-a-tiny-demo-using-maths-and-a-pinch-of-insanity.html">Red Alp</a>. There, I went into details about the
whole process, so I recommend to check it out first if you&#39;re not familiar with
the field.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/demo-tricks/thumb.jpg" alt="preview of the 4 demos"/></p>
<p>We will look at 4 demos: <a href="#Moonlight">Moonlight</a>, <a href="#Entrance3">Entrance 3</a>,
<a href="#Archipelago">Archipelago</a>, and <a href="#Cutie">Cutie</a>. But this time, for each
demo, we&#39;re going to cover one or two things I learned from it. It won&#39;t be a
deep dive into every aspect because it would be extremely redundant. Instead,
I&#39;ll take you along a journey of learning experiences.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In Red Alp, I used volumetric raymarching to go through the clouds and fog, and
it took quite a significant part of the code to make the absorption and emission
convincing. But there is an alternative technique that is surprisingly simpler.</p>
<p>In the raymarching loop, the color contribution at each iteration becomes <span>1/d</span>
or <span>c/d</span> where <span>d</span> is the density of the material at the current ray position,
and <span>c</span> an optional color tint if you don&#39;t want to work in grayscale level.
Some variants exist, for example <span>1/d^2</span>, but we&#39;ll focus on <span>1/d</span>.</p>
<h3>1/d explanation</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s see how it looks in practice with a simple cube raymarch where we use this
peculiar contribution:</p>
<figure>
  <canvas width="480" height="340" data-fragment="/frag/demo-tricks/onecube.frag"></canvas>
  <figcaption>One glowing and rotating cube</figcaption>
</figure>
<pre><code>void main() {
    float d, t;
    vec3 o, p,
         u = normalize(vec3(P+P-R,R.y)); // screen to world coordinate

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; i++) {
        p = u * t; // ray position

        p.z -= 3.; // take a step back

        // Rodriguez rotation with an arbitrary angle of π/2
        // and unaligned axis
        vec3 a = normalize(cos(T+vec3(0,2,4)));
        p = a*dot(a,p)-cross(a,p);

        // Signed distance function of a cube of size 1
        p = abs(p)-1.;
        d = length(max(p,0.)) + min(max(p.x,max(p.y,p.z)),0.);

        // Maxed out to not enter the solid
        d = max(d,.001);

        t += d; // stepping forward by that distance

        // Our mysterious contribution to the output
        o += 1./d;
    }

    // Arbitrary scale within visible range
    O = vec4(o/200., 1);
}
</code></pre>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The signed function of the cube is from the <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/">classic Inigo Quilez
page</a>. For the rotation you can refer to <a href="https://mini.gmshaders.com/p/3d-rotation">Xor</a> or
<a href="https://suricrasia.online/blog/shader-functions/">Blackle</a> article. For the general understanding of
the code, see my previous article on <a href="https://blog.pkh.me/p/45-code-golfing-a-tiny-demo-using-maths-and-a-pinch-of-insanity.html">Red Alp</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The first time I saw it, I wondered whether it was a creative take, or if it was
backed by physical properties.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s simplify the problem with the following figure:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/demo-tricks/ray.png" alt=""/>
  <figcaption>A ray passing by a radiating object</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The glowing object sends photons that spread all around it. The further we go
from the object, the more spread these photons are, basically following the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse square law</a> <span>1/r^2</span>, which gives the photons density,
where <span>r</span> is the distance to the target object.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we send a ray and want to know how many photons are present along the
whole path. We have to &#34;sum&#34;, or rather integrate, all these photons density
measures along the ray. Since we are doing a discrete sampling (the dots on the
figure), we need to interpolate the photons density <em>between</em> each sampling
point as well.</p>
<p>Given two arbitrary sampling points and their corresponding distance <span>d_n</span>
and <span>d_{n+1}</span>, any intermediate distance can be linearly interpolated with
<span>r=\mathrm{mix}(d_n,d_{n+1},t)</span> where <span>t</span> is within <span>[0,1]</span>. Applying the
inverse square law from before (<span>1/r^2</span>), the integrated photons density between
these 2 points can be expressed with this formula (in <span>t</span> range):</p>
<p>
v = \Delta t \int \frac{1}{\mathrm{mix}(d_n,d_{n+1},t)^2} dt
</p>
<p><span>t</span> being normalized, the <span>\Delta t</span> is here to covers the actual segment
distance. With the help of Sympy we can do the integration:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b, D, t = symbols(&#39;a b D t&#39;, real=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mix = a*(1-t) + b*t
&gt;&gt;&gt; D * integrate(1/mix**2, (t,0,1)).simplify()
 D
───
a⋅b
</code></pre>
<p>So the result of this integration is:</p>
<p>
v = \frac{\Delta t}{d_{n}d_{n+1}}.
</p>
<p>Now the key is that in the loop, <span>\Delta t</span> stepping is actually <span>d_{n+1}</span>, so
we end up with:</p>
<p>
v = \frac{\Delta t}{d_{n}\Delta t} = \frac{1}{d_n}
</p>
<p>And we find back our mysterious <span>1/d</span>. It&#39;s &#34;physically correct&#34;, assuming
vacuum space. Of course, reality is more complex, and we don&#39;t even need to
stick to that formula, but it was nice figuring out that this simple fraction is
a fairly good model of reality.</p>
<h3>Going through the object</h3>
<p>In the cube example we didn&#39;t go through the object, using <code>max(d, .001)</code>. But
if we were to add some transparency, we could have used <code>d = A*abs(d)+B</code>
instead, where <code>A</code> could be interpreted as absorption and <code>B</code> the pass-through,
or transparency.</p>
<figure>
  <canvas width="480" height="340" data-fragment="/frag/demo-tricks/onecube-alpha.frag"></canvas>
  <figcaption>One glowing, transparent, and rotating cube; A=0.4, B=0.1</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I first saw this formula mentioned in <a href="https://mini.gmshaders.com/p/volumetric">Xor article on volumetric</a>.
To understand it a bit better, here is my intuitive take: the <code>+B</code> causes a
potential penetration into the solid at the next iteration, which wouldn&#39;t
happen otherwise (or only very marginally). When inside the solid, the <code>abs(d)</code>
causes the ray to continue further (by the amount of the distance to the closest
edge). Then the multiplication by <code>A</code> makes sure we don&#39;t penetrate too fast
into it; it&#39;s the absorption, or &#34;damping&#34;.</p>
<p>This is basically the technique I used in Moonlight to avoid the complex
absorption/emission code.</p>

<h2>Entrance 3</h2>

</code></pre>

<p>This demo was probably one of the most challenging, but I&#39;m pretty happy with its
atmospheric vibe. It&#39;s kind of different than the usual demos for this size.</p>
<p>I initially tried with some voxels, but I couldn&#39;t make it work with the light
under 512 characters (the initialization code was too large, not the branchless
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_differential_analyzer_(graphics_algorithm)">DDA</a> stepping). It also had annoying limitations (typically the animation was
unit bound), so I fell back to a classic raymarching.</p>
<p>The first thing I did differently was to use an <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2dlinf/">L-∞ norm</a> instead of an
euclidean norm for the distance function: every solid is a cube so it&#39;s
appropriate to use simpler formulas.</p>
<p>For the light, it&#39;s not an illusion, it&#39;s an actual light: after the first
raymarch to a solid, the ray direction is reoriented toward the light and the
march runs again (it&#39;s the <code>V</code> macro). Hitting a solid or not defines if the
fragment should be lighten up or not.</p>
<h3>Mobile bugs</h3>
<p>A bad surprise of this demo was uncovering two driver bugs on mobile:</p>
<ul>
<li>One with tricky <a href="https://crbug.com/462233638">for-loop compounds on Snapdragon/Adreno</a> because I was trying
hard to avoid the macros and functions.</li>
<li>One with <a href="https://crbug.com/462288594">chained assignments on Imagination/PowerVR</a> (typically affect
Google Pixel Pro 10).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first was worked around with the <code>V</code> macro (actually saved 3 characters in
the process), but the 2nd one had to be unpacked and made me lose 2 characters.</p>
<h3>Isometry</h3>
<p>Another thing I studied was how to set up the camera in a non-perspective
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection">isometric or dimetric view</a>. I couldn&#39;t make sense of the maths from
the Wikipedia page (it just didn&#39;t work), but Sympy rescued me again:</p>
<pre><code># Counter-clockwise rotation
a, ax0, ax1, ax2 = symbols(&#39;a ax0:3&#39;)
c, s = cos(a), sin(a)
k = 1-c
rot = Matrix(3,3, [
    # col 1            col 2              # col 3
    ax0*ax0*k + c,     ax0*ax1*k + ax2*s, ax0*ax2*k - ax1*s, # row 1
    ax1*ax0*k - ax2*s, ax1*ax1*k + c,     ax1*ax2*k + ax0*s, # row 2
    ax2*ax0*k + ax1*s, ax2*ax1*k - ax0*s, ax2*ax2*k + c      # row 3
])

# Rotation by 45° on the y-axis
m45 = rot.subs({a:rad(-45), ax0:0, ax1:1, ax2:0})

# Apply the 2nd rotation on the x-axis to get the transform matrices for two
# classic projections
# Note: asin(tan(rad(30))) is the same as atan(sin(rad(45)))
isometric = m45 * rot.subs({a:asin(tan(rad(30))), ax0:1, ax1:0, ax2:0})
dimetric  = m45 * rot.subs({a:         rad(30),   ax0:1, ax1:0, ax2:0})
</code></pre>
<p>Inspecting the matrices and factoring out the common terms, we obtain the
following transform matrices:</p>
<p>
M_{iso} = \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}\begin{bmatrix}
   \sqrt{3} &amp; -1 &amp; \sqrt{2} \\
          0 &amp;  2 &amp; \sqrt{2} \\
  -\sqrt{3} &amp; -1 &amp; \sqrt{2}
\end{bmatrix} \text{ and } M_{dim} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
     2 &amp;       -1 &amp; \sqrt{3} \\
     0 &amp; \sqrt{6} &amp; \sqrt{2} \\
    -2 &amp;       -1 &amp; \sqrt{3}
\end{bmatrix}
</p>
<p>The ray direction is common to all fragments, so we use the central UV
coordinate (0,0) as reference point. We push it forward for convenience: (0,0,1),
and transform it with our matrix. This gives the central screen coordinate in
world space. Since the obtained point coordinate is relative to the world
origin, to go from that point to the origin, we just have to flip its sign. The
ray direction formula is then:</p>
<p>
d_{iso} = -M_{iso} \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}
\text{ and } d_{dim} = -M_{dim} \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = -\frac{1}{4} \begin{bmatrix}\sqrt{6} \\ 2 \\ \sqrt{6}\end{bmatrix}
</p>
<p>To get the ray origin of every other pixel, the remaining question is: what is
the smallest distance we need to step back the screen coordinates such that,
when applying the transformation, the view wouldn&#39;t clip into the ground at
<span>y=0</span>.</p>
<p>This requirement can be modeled with the following expression:</p>
<p>
M \begin{bmatrix}x \\ -1 \\ z\end{bmatrix} &gt; 0
</p>
<p>The -1 being the lowest y-screen coordinate (which we don&#39;t want into the
ground). The lazy bum in me just asks Sympy to solve it for me:</p>
<pre><code>x, z = symbols(&#34;x z&#34;, real=True)
u = m * Matrix([x, -1, z])
uz = solve(u[1] &gt; 0, z)
</code></pre>
<p>We get <span>z&gt;\sqrt{2}</span> for isometric, and <span>z&gt;\sqrt{3}</span> for dimetric.</p>
<p>With an arbitrary scale <code>S</code> of the coordinate we end up with the following:</p>
<pre><code>const float S = 50.;
vec2 u = (P+P-R)/R.y * S; // scaled screen coordinates

float A=sqrt(2.), B=sqrt(3.);

// Isometric
vec3 rd = -vec3(1)/B,
     ro = mat3(B,0,-B,-1,2,-1,A,A,A)/A/B * vec3(u, A*S + eps);

// Dimetric
vec3 rd = -vec3(B,A,B)/A/2.,
     ro = mat3(2,0,-2,-1,A*B,-1,B,A,B)/A/2. * vec3(u, B*S + eps);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>eps</code> is an arbitrary small value to make sure the y-coordinate ends up
above 0.</p>
<p>In Entrance 3, I used a rough approximation of the isometric setup.</p>

<p>For this infinite procedurally generated Japan, I wanted to mark a rupture with
my red/orange obsession. Technically speaking, it&#39;s actually fairly basic if
you&#39;re familiar with Red Alp. I used the same noise for the mountains/islands,
but the water uses a different noise.</p>
<p>The per octave noise curve is <code>w=exp(sin(x))</code>, with the particularity of
shifting the <code>x</code> coordinate with its derivative: <code>x-=w*cos(x)</code>. This is some
form of <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/warp/">domain warping</a> that gives the nice effect here. When I say <code>x</code>, I&#39;m
really referring to the x-axis position. It is not needed to work with the
z-component (xz forms the flat plane) because each octave of the fbm has a
rotation that &#34;mixes&#34; both axis, so <code>z</code> is actually backed in <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>Here I got cocky and thought I could manage to fit it in 512 chars. I failed,
by 90 characters. I did use the <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/">smoothmin</a> operator for the first time: every
limb of the body of Cutie is composed of two spheres creating a rounded cone
(two sphere of different size smoothly merged like metaballs).</p>

  <canvas width="480" height="340" data-fragment="/frag/demo-tricks/metaballs.frag"></canvas>
  <figcaption>2 spheres merging using the smin operator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then I used <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/simpleik/">simple IK kinetics</a> for the animation. Using leg parts
with a size of 1 helped simplifying the formula and make it shorter.</p>
<p>You may be wondering about the smooth visuals itself: I didn&#39;t use the depth
map but simply the number of iterations. Due to the nature of the raymarching
algorithm, when a ray passes close to a shape, it slows down significantly,
increasing the number of iterations. This is super useful because it exaggerate
the contour of the shapes naturally. It&#39;s wrapped into an exponential, but <code>i</code>
defines the output color directly.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s next</h2>
<p>I will continue making more of those, keeping my artistic ambition low because
of the 512 characters constraint I&#39;m imposing on myself.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/demo-tricks/512.jpg" alt="meme about the 512 chars limit"/></p>
<p>You may be wondering why I keep this obsession about 512 characters, and many
people called me out on this one. There are actually many arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tiny demo has to focus on one or two very scoped aspects of computer
graphics, which makes it perfect as a <strong>learning support</strong>.</li>
<li>It&#39;s part of the <strong>artistic performance</strong>: it&#39;s not just techniques and
visuals, the wizardry of the code is part of why it&#39;s so impressive. We&#39;re in
an era of visuals, people have been fed with the craziest VFX ever. But have
they seen them with a few hundreds bytes of code?</li>
<li>The constraint helps me <strong>finish the work</strong>: when making art, there is always
this question of when to stop. Here there is an intractable point where I just
cannot do more and I have to move on.</li>
<li>Similarly, it <strong>prevents my ambition</strong> from tricking me into some colossal
project I will never finish or even start. That format has a ton of
limitations, and that&#39;s its strength.</li>
<li>Working on such a tiny piece of code for days/weeks just <strong>brings me joy</strong>. I
do feel like a craftsperson, spending an unreasonable amount of time
perfecting it, for the beauty of it.</li>
<li>I&#39;m trying to build a portfolio, and it&#39;s important for me to keep it
<strong>consistent</strong>. If the size limit was different, I would have done things
differently, so I can&#39;t change it now. If I had hundreds more characters,
Red Alp might have had birds, the sky opening to lit a beam of light on the
mountains, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why 512 in particular? It happens to be the size of a toot on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bug">my Mastodon
instance</a> so I can fit the code there, and I found it to be a good
balance.</p>
