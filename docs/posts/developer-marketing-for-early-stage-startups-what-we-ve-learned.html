    <h1>Developer marketing for early-stage startups â€“ what weâ€™ve learned</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since starting PostHog in 2020, weâ€™ve learned a bunch about what does and doesnâ€™t work when it comes to marketing to engineers. There are plenty of articles about â€˜developer marketingâ€™ out there, but most of them are either generic or focused on later stage companies. </p><p>In this intro article, my intention is to share specific, actionable advice for early stage startups building dev tools. Iâ€™ve bucketed advice into pre- and post-product-market fit.</p><p>Iâ€™ve also included a couple of channels that we havenâ€™t nailed but know other successful dev tool companies consider important. Weâ€™re still learning, and definitely havenâ€™t figured everything out!</p><div><h2 id="-preproductmarket-fit"><a href="#-preproductmarket-fit"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>ðŸ¤” Pre-product-market fit</h2></div><div><h3 id="compete-on-content-depth-not-breadth"><a href="#compete-on-content-depth-not-breadth"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Compete on content depth, not breadth</h3></div><p>Trying to go head-to-head with much larger competitors on content output is a losing game, so focus on quality instead.

Theyâ€™ll also help keep you connected to your users and not focused on purely top-of-funnel or general types of content. This has made a huge difference to the breadth of product content weâ€™re able to cover. </p><p>Paid ads can be a useful tool for learning quickly if you are building a consumer app, but <em>not</em> for dev tools (see â€˜attribution mirageâ€™ above), which is why Iâ€™ve put them in post-PMF. It is very easy to spend tons of money on shit, especially in Google Ads. NEVER USE THE DEFAULT SETTINGS on Google, LinkedIn, and Twitter especially. </p><p>Hire a cheap agency â€“ $5k/mo is achievable, especially if they&#39;re just managing channels and creative, and not throwing in &#39;value add&#39; services like landing pages and SEO strategy. Don&#39;t hire an agency based in the US â€“ they are triple the price. We aim to be 7/10 at paid ads, not amazing. Focus that energy on your content instead. </p><p>Google is good for conversion, while LinkedIn ($$$), Twitter ($$), Reddit ($), and Quora ($) are good for general awareness. Avoid Product Hunt if you sell something that costs &gt; $10/month (youâ€™ll get loads of signups, but they hate spending money). Carbon Ads is very expensive and was a waste of time for us. </p><div><h3 id="its-ok-to-waste-money-on-sponsorships"><a href="#its-ok-to-waste-money-on-sponsorships"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Itâ€™s ok to waste money on sponsorships</h3></div><p>They are generally quite expensive, but unfortunately you need to spend money to learn here.
