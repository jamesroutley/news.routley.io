<section id="the-start-of-my-obsidian-journey">

<p>21 January 2021, that’s the date I created in my first note in my <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> vault. Back then, it was just an experiment in my ongoing quest to find the perfect note-taking tool. <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, and even the good ol’ <a href="https://www.zebrapen.com/blogs/enlightened-writing/4-reasons-to-keep-writing-with-a-pen-and-paper">pen and paper</a> took their turns on my desk. But ever since I started using Obsidian, I never used another tool again. Since that day, Obsidian has been my constant companion through learning adventures, career changes, study sessions, and moments of personal reflection. What started as a simple app transformed into an indispensable tool, the backstage manager of my life, keeping everything in check.</p>

<section id="obsidians-features">

<p>What really makes Obsidian unique? I think it boils down to 3 features:</p>
<section id="obsidian-allows-structure-to-grow-organically">
<h2 data-anchor-id="obsidian-allows-structure-to-grow-organically">1. Obsidian allows structure to grow organically</h2>
<p>Most note-taking tools require you to decide upon the structure of your note before you record the note. For example, say I am taking notes while going through one of deeplearning.ai’s excellent <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/">Generative AI LLM courses</a>, before writing down my notes, I might have to decide on my folder structure.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should structure my notes by their topic</p>
<pre><code>├── Instruction Fine Tuning
│   ├── Single Task
│   └── Multi Task
├── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
├── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA)
├── Model Evaluation Metrics
    └── LLM benchmarks</code></pre>
<p>Or perhaps I should structure my notes based by date so I can track my learning progress over time</p>
<pre><code>├── 2024-01-01
├── 2024-01-02
│   └── Instruction Fine Tuning
├── 2024-01-03
│   └── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
├── 2024-01-04
│   └── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA)
└── 2024-01-05</code></pre>
<p>Either way could be valid, depending on how I plan to revise and reorganise my notes in the future. But having to decide upon a structure upfront before I get the chance to start recording my notes never feels good.</p>
<section id="internal-links">
<h3 data-anchor-id="internal-links">Internal Links</h3>
<p>Obsidian offers a powerful feature to solve this problem - <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links">Internal Links</a>. Here is an example of Internal Links in action: <img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/obsidian/internal-link-example.png"/></p>
<p>By wrapping any idea/noun/topic in double <code>[[]]</code> brackets Obsidian creates a dedicated new notes for that item, as well as the connection between the note I am currently taking and the one that was just created. In this short paragraph, I have linked both a date <code>2024-01-02</code> and several key topics e.g. (<code>In-context learning</code>), which means that when I want to revisit or reorganise my notes, I can do so either by topic or by date.</p>

<div><p>With internal links, I enjoy keeping my notes in a flat hierachy but I have seen vaults that still prefer folders. Obsidian supports both preferences equally well 🙂</p></div><p>This flexibility enables me to build my vault out with an organic structure that adapts to my learning needs.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="obsidian-helps-me-link-atomic-ideas-into-greater-understanding">
<h2 data-anchor-id="obsidian-helps-me-link-atomic-ideas-into-greater-understanding">2. Obsidian helps me link atomic ideas into greater understanding</h2>
<p>Knowledge is a mosaic crafted from interconnected ideas.</p>
<div>
<ul role="tablist"><li role="presentation"><a id="tabset-1-1-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-1" role="tab" aria-controls="tabset-1-1" aria-selected="true">What my vault started as</a></li><li role="presentation"><a id="tabset-1-2-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-2" role="tab" aria-controls="tabset-1-2" aria-selected="false">What my vault grew into</a></li></ul>
<div>
<div id="tabset-1-1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tabset-1-1-tab">
<p><img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/obsidian/graph1.png"/></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view">graph view</a> of my Obsidian vault in my 1st year. Every node in this graph is a single note. It is clear that when I was first starting out, I was writing down disparate, unconnected notes. I was probably writing down a lot of interesting ideas, but I had not taken the time to connect these ideas to gain a broader understanding.</p>
</div>
<div id="tabset-1-2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tabset-1-2-tab">
<p><img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/obsidian/graph2.png"/></p>
<p>As I continued using Obsidian, I started to link notes together. This could be done either when the notew was first created, or when I scheduled time to review these notes again. Soon, I saw clusters of ideas organically forming into broader topics. My <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/2022scala/">deep dive into Scala</a>, my <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/2023-causal-inference/">exploration of Causal Inference</a> and a whole variety of subjects that interest me came out of these clusters. And today, I have a nice graphical topology of sorts that represents my learning journey and keeps me motivated.</p>

<section id="obsidians-choice-to-work-with-plain-text-files-make-it-future-proof">
<h2 data-anchor-id="obsidians-choice-to-work-with-plain-text-files-make-it-future-proof">3. Obsidian’s choice to work with plain text files make it future-proof</h2>
<p>Lastly, my favourite feature of Obsidian is that by deafault, it chooses to work with plain text files. This simple decision means that Obsidian notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be used offline</li>
<li>Can be editted with any text editor</li>
<li>Can be viewed with a variety of text readers</li>
<li>Can be easily synced on iCloud, Dropbox or using git</li>
<li>Is yours, forever!</li>
</ul>
<p>Obsidian’s CEO Steph Ango wrote a <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">dedicated blog post on this philosophy</a> that went deeper into this philosophy. He shared that <em>all software is ephemeral and Obsidian wants to give people ownership over their own data</em>, which is an approach that builds trust for its users.</p>
