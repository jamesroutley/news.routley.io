    <h1>Tailscale is pretty useful</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>March 04, 2025<!-- --> · <!-- -->3 minutes<!-- --> to read</p></header><section><p>It’s probably old news for most, but I’ve recently started using <a href="https://tailscale.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tailscale</a> and wanted to share my experience with it.</p>
<p>I’ve heard of Tailscale many times before, but didn’t get the appeal until recently. That happened when I started running a simple server from my trusty old Raspberry Pi version 1.</p>

<p>I know its local IP address and can <code>ssh</code> into it easily when I’m home, but when I’m outside, that’s not possible as it’s not exposed to the internet. For that reason, I have used DDNS<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> in the past. The bad news is that it’s no longer possible thanks to a cursed thing called CGNAT<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. I don’t want to derail this post too much, but unfortunately port forwarding is no longer a thing that you can do. (And maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to expose your home server to the internet to begin with.)</p>
<p>This reminded me of Tailscale, and I decided to give it a go. From what I could remember, it creates a virtual private network<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> so you can access your devices anywhere with domain shorthands created by Tailscale.</p>
<p>Long story short, it worked! I could connect from anywhere with <code>ssh raspberrypi</code> command. But my old Raspberry Pi was too weak to run it, so I ended up uninstalling it, and unrelatedly my pet project grew out and has its place in the cloud now.</p>
<hr/>
<p>To get started, you need to install the client software on the devices, which are mostly open-source<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. Then you need to log in with your account, which is an easy process. I won’t go into detail about how to install and use it, since this isn’t an ad, and such instructions can quickly go out-of-date.</p>
<p>Some additional and surprising benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exposing a port from your laptop to your phone: When developing a web application, once in a while you’ll have to test on an actual device. (You do that, right?) The kind of thing you’d reach for <a href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ngrok</a> for.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> You can use the Tailscale-generated domain name (e.g. <code>http://my-macbook-air:3000</code>) to effortlessly connect to your development server.</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1106/taildrop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taildrop</a>: There’s been a lot of times when I needed to move files from my Macbook to my Windows HTPC<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>, which is hard. I’d used Snapdrop<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>, which is excellent for the limitations it has to work around, but I was always on the lookout for a click-less solution. With Taildrop, you can drop files as easily as Airdrop, even when you’re not in close proximity!</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exit nodes</a>: I clarified that Tailscale is a different kind of VPN, but I still need a VPN service from time to time, and I don’t like having two clients for a similar job.[^8] With Tailscale, you can appoint a machine to be an exit node, ideally one in a VPS in a different country, so you can get comparable benefits to a VPN service.</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mullvad exit nodes</a>: Related to the previous point, I know that VPN services allow you to exit from a large list of countries, and don’t collect logs (if you believe them). With the <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tailscale-has-partnered-with-mullvad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mullvad partnership</a>, Tailscale allows you to have the best of both worlds. And from what I can understand, it’s essentially a two-tier VPN, like <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iCloud Private Relay</a>. Tailscale can’t see your traffic, and Mullvad doesn’t know who you are. If you’re a privacy nerd, you may find this to be a good setup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven’t yet tried exit nodes or Mullvad integration, so your actual experience may not turn out as I described.</p>
<p>I have used Tailscale only for personal reasons so far, using the free tier; they have enterprise plans for enterprise use cases that I have no idea about. I found it useful and wanted to share it in case it helps you too. I wasn’t paid by them, and if you don’t want to use their services for any reason, there’s an open-source server implementation called <a href="https://headscale.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Headscale</a>, which works with their client software.</p>
<p>If you have more use cases, feel free to share them with me!</p>
