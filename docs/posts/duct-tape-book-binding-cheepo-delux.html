    <h1>Duct Tape Book Binding â€“ Cheepo Delux</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><section id="intro" data-stepid="S88OYICFRD80H5E"><h2>Introduction: Duct Tape Book Binding - Cheepo Delux</h2><p>Quick and dirty, &#34;cheepo delux&#34; way of binding papers and reports in your home or office.</p></section><section id="step1" data-stepid="SSQ90RYFRD80H69"><h2>Step 1: Things You Need</h2><p>Things you will need:</p></section><section id="step2" data-stepid="SQC5Z83FS8O1P00"><h2>Step 2: Prepare Your Space</h2><p>The biggest problem I had getting the duct tape on the pages was keeping the sticky side from moving around. Whenever I tried to start one end, I would almost always end up with a nasty crooked edge that would make my cheepo binding uggo.</p></section><section id="step3" data-stepid="SDC1ZRJFS8O1P2N"><h2>Step 3: Its All in the Flippidy Flap Flap</h2><p>This is the most important step of the process, believe it or not. </p></section><section id="step4" data-stepid="SISIJLCFS8O1P65"><h2>Step 4: My Rant on Efficiency</h2><p>I really cannot stress how important it is for everyone to stop and think about the crucial principles that allow a certain approach to become effective. </p></section><section id="step5" data-stepid="SNK0GGLFS8O1P6L"><h2>Step 5: I Dont Have a Glue, What I&#39;m Doing Really...</h2><p>Next we apply the glue and start folding the tape over to top of the pages. Dont do this in one stroke. Slowly bend the tape over as if it was a hard plastic. Tryi to give it a new form by slightly bending it over the top of the pages. If you do it quickly, chances are you will end up with a crooked like of tape, or even worse, a pinch in the duct tape that will make the whole binding look stupid.</p></section><section id="step6" data-stepid="SH96986FS8O1PBD"><h2>Step 6: Clip It</h2><p>Use those clips that lack description to secure your binding. If you added a tough cover they will probably not leave an indentation, but I had to play around loads before figuring out how to do it nicely. In the end I just use one type of clip and push it all the way in, like the smaller ones shown in the pics.</p></section><section id="step7" data-stepid="SXDBWNIFS8O1PEW"><h2>Step 7: Results</h2><p>The bind is sturdy. I post some pics of the results here and around the end.</p></section><section id="step8" data-stepid="SYCJK3JFS8O1PUO"><h2>Step 8: Bind Mods - Title Gap</h2><p>Its very simple to add a gap that allows you to see the title of the papers or report that you are binding. its pretty self explanatory, so I leave this one to the images.</p></section><section id="step9" data-stepid="SAYQ4PQFS8O1PGE"><h2>Step 9: Bind Mods - Borders</h2><p>So&#39;<em><strong>me of the papers and reports that I bounded are the ones that I use over and over. Some of them end up tearing at the edges where my thumb flicks through them all the time. So I decided to add some reinforcement and I really like the results. </strong></em></p></section><section id="step10" data-stepid="SZJVX0YFS8O1Q9Z"><h2>Step 10: Final Remarks</h2><p>After a few months of playing around with binding techniques, I was confident enough to bind my dissertation when it was time for it to be reviewed.
