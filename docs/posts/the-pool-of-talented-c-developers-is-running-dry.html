    <h1>The pool of talented C&#43;&#43; developers is running dry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Software companies have a problem. There’s not enough candidates that can code C++. </p> 
<p>This was the consensus in a webinar from ProfitView, a crypto trading tools developer, on high frequency trading using C++. Anthony Peacock, formerly a<a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2022/01/quant-jobs-finance" target="_blank"> quant</a> at both Citi and <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2022/10/how-to-get-a-job-at-citadel" target="_blank">Citadel</a> said “it’s impossible to find people with a really high level of C++ skills which is exactly what every trading company wants.”  </p>
 
<p>This isn’t just a British or American issue, nor is it one specific to high frequency trading. Rainer Grimm, who has been a professional<a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2022/05/c-in-finance" target="_blank"> C++ trainer</a> since 2008, affirmed that C++ education in Germany is equally “terrible” and added that “there’s a big demand for C++ not only in this domain but also the automotive” industry. </p> 
<p>Where are all the C++ programmers? People are seemingly scared away from the language by a terrible stigma: the notion that it is a legacy program. With big names in tech such as Microsoft Azure CEO Mark Russinovich calling people to “deprecate” C++ “<a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2022/09/c-programming-language-safety" target="_blank">for the sake of security and reliability,”</a> in favour of Rust, this is hardly surprising.</p> 
<p>However, reports of C++&#39;s death may be premature. ProfitView CEO Richard Hickling, a former software engineer at Barclays and Bank of America, said “the death of C++ has been reported many times.” Hickling pointed to Java, which has long “seemed to be replacing C++ itself,” but hasn&#39;t. </p> 
<p>So where have all the C++ developers gone? The Stack Overflow Survey 2022 reported almost a drop of almost two percentage points in respondents this past year using C++ (from 24.3% to 22.5%), even while the percentage of professional developers using it rose. The good news, though, is that 34.7% of respondents learning to code are using C++, placing it in the top 6 programming languages of that category.</p> 
<p>The real problem is that C++ is neither easy nor loved. Rust got an 87% approval rate in the &#34;most loved&#34; category of the Stack Overflow Survey. However, only 9.3% of respondents used Rust at all and only 8.8% did so professionally. C++, meanwhile, languished at 48%.</p> 
<p>Even so, C++ regularly appears in the top 4 of the TIOBE index, earning it a place in their “big 4.” </p> 
<p>The reality is that there are plenty of <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/jobs/c%2B%2B-developer?q=c%2B%2B+developer&amp;countryCode=GB&amp;radius=40&amp;radiusUnit=km&amp;pageSize=10&amp;currencyCode=GBP&amp;language=en" target="_blank">C++ jobs </a>available in finance, and that compared to other languages there are comparatively few people to fill them. The language may be hard. But it&#39;s also worth it. </p>
