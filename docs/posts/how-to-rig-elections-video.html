<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>Enter the fascinating world of corruption, chicanery, low-tech fraud, and forensic tools that uncover it. The story is told through the eyes of a Russian election official who has participated in campaigns of all levels in the past 4 years and fought for justice (mostly unsuccessfully). Watch a demo how to tamper with a security bag and learn how to use statistics to detect ballot stuffing [1]. See the obstacles faced by Russians wanting a change. See how the government “wins” the elections.</p>
