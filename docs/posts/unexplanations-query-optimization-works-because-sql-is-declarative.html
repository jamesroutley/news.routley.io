    <h1>Unexplanations: query optimization works because sql is declarative</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Here is a simple sql query.</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>select
</span><span>  </span><span>users</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,
</span><span>  (
</span><span>    </span><span>select </span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>likes</span><span>)
</span><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> posts
</span><span>    </span><span>where </span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>user_id </span><span>= </span><span>users</span><span>.</span><span>id
</span><span>  ) </span><span>as</span><span> post_count
</span><span>from</span><span> users;
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we read this query literally, we&#39;re asking to perform two nested loops - the first over users and the second over posts. Executed naively this would take <code>O(|users| * |posts|)</code> time, but a query planner can apply <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/materialize-decorrelation">clever transformations</a> to turn this query into a hashjoin and groupby/aggregate, for a total cost of <code>O(|users| + |posts|)</code> time.</p>
<pre><code><span>postgres&gt; explain select users.id, (select sum(posts.likes) from posts where posts.user_id = users.id) from users;
</span><span>
</span><span>                             QUERY PLAN
</span><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><span> Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..90649.75 rows=2550 width=12)
</span><span>   SubPlan 1
</span><span>     -&gt;  Aggregate  (cost=35.52..35.53 rows=1 width=8)
</span><span>           -&gt;  Seq Scan on posts  (cost=0.00..35.50 rows=10 width=4)
</span><span>                 Filter: (user_id = users.id)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Ok, postgres just runs two nested loops - it&#39;s not very good at subquery optimization yet. Let&#39;s try a more aggressive query planner.</p>
<pre><code><span>cockroach&gt; explain select users.id, (select sum(posts.likes) from posts where posts.user_id = users.id) from users;
</span><span>
</span><span>            tree           |       field       |   description
</span><span>---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------
</span><span>                           | distributed       | true
</span><span>                           | vectorized        | false
</span><span>  render                   |                   |
</span><span>   └── group               |                   |
</span><span>        │                  | aggregate 0       | id
</span><span>        │                  | aggregate 1       | sum(likes)
</span><span>        │                  | group by          | id
</span><span>        └── render         |                   |
</span><span>             └── hash-join |                   |
</span><span>                  │        | type              | left outer
</span><span>                  │        | equality          | (id) = (user_id)
</span><span>                  │        | left cols are key |
</span><span>                  ├── scan |                   |
</span><span>                  │        | table             | users@primary
</span><span>                  │        | spans             | FULL SCAN
</span><span>                  └── scan |                   |
</span><span>                           | table             | posts@primary
</span><span>                           | spans             | FULL SCAN
</span></code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s better.</p>
<p>Compilers for most programming languages can&#39;t perform such dramatic transformations, but compilers for sql can. If we ask why, most people answer that it&#39;s because sql is declarative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Declarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed.</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#Definition">wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we rewrote the query above in an imperative language like python, the structure would be totally different.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span># extra whitespace for clarity
</span><span>(
</span><span>  (
</span><span>    user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>, 
</span><span>    </span><span>sum</span><span>((
</span><span>      post</span><span>.</span><span>likes
</span><span>      </span><span>for </span><span>post </span><span>in </span><span>posts 
</span><span>      </span><span>if </span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>user_id </span><span>== </span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id
</span><span>    ))</span><span>,
</span><span>  )
</span><span>  </span><span>for </span><span>user </span><span>in </span><span>users
</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Huh, that kinda looks the same as the sql query. Maybe list comprehensions are also declarative? </p>
<p>Let&#39;s try again.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>result </span><span>= </span><span>[]
</span><span>for </span><span>user </span><span>in </span><span>users:
</span><span>  total </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>  </span><span>for </span><span>post </span><span>in </span><span>posts:
</span><span>    </span><span>if </span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id </span><span>== </span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>user_id:
</span><span>      total </span><span>+= </span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>likes
</span><span>  result</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>((user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>, </span><span>total))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that looks imperative! Although all we&#39;ve done is desugar the list comprehensions and inline the definition of <code>sum</code>, which from the compilers point of view isn&#39;t that much of a change.</p>
<p>But in the imperative version the python compiler can&#39;t optimize away the nested loops! Whereas in the declarative version the python compiler, uh, still can&#39;t optimize away the nested loops.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem here is that python is just too loosey-goosey. Wikipedia says that haskell is a declarative language - let&#39;s try that instead.</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell"><code data-lang="haskell"><span>[
</span><span>  (
</span><span>    id user</span><span>, 
</span><span>    sum [
</span><span>      likes post
</span><span>      </span><span>|</span><span> post </span><span>&lt;-</span><span> posts</span><span>,
</span><span>      user_id post </span><span>==</span><span> id user
</span><span>    ]
</span><span>  ) 
</span><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> user </span><span>&lt;-</span><span> users
</span><span>]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Time that sucker - it&#39;s still quadratic. But ghc is a much more sophisticated compiler than most sql optimizers. Why can&#39;t it do the same transformations?</p>
<hr/>
<p>It looks like &#34;query optimization works because sql is declarative&#34; is just getting us confused.</p>
<p>I like to call this kind of answer an <strong>unexplanation</strong>. It sounds like an explanation. It&#39;s satisfying enough that many people will accept it and repeat it. And if an answer is repeated often enough then everyone knows that the answer is correct.</p>
<p>But if you try to use that answer to actually <strong>do</strong> anything then it falls apart. It&#39;s not wrong, exactly, but it&#39;s not precise enough to make useful predictions.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Instead of waving around vague adjectives, let&#39;s imagine we wrote compiler that can take these nested list comprehensions...</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>result </span><span>= </span><span>(
</span><span>  (
</span><span>    user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>, 
</span><span>    </span><span>sum</span><span>((
</span><span>      post</span><span>.</span><span>likes
</span><span>      </span><span>for </span><span>post </span><span>in </span><span>posts 
</span><span>      </span><span>if </span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>user_id </span><span>== </span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id
</span><span>    ))</span><span>,
</span><span>  )
</span><span>  </span><span>for </span><span>user </span><span>in </span><span>users
</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>...and turn them into this efficient join:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>totals </span><span>= </span><span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)
</span><span>for </span><span>post </span><span>in </span><span>posts:
</span><span>  totals[post</span><span>.</span><span>user_id] </span><span>+= </span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>likes
</span><span>result </span><span>= </span><span>[]
</span><span>for </span><span>user </span><span>in </span><span>users:
</span><span>  result</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>((user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>, </span><span>totals[user</span><span>.</span><span>id]))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Is this transformation correct? </p>
<p>Before you answer, let&#39;s look at the rest of the code.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>class </span><span>User</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>id</span><span>):

</span><span>  </span><span>@</span><span>property
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>id</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):
</span><span>    </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_id </span><span>+= </span><span>1
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_id
</span></code></pre>
<p>Getting <code>user.id</code> also adds one to the id.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>class </span><span>Likes</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>count</span><span>):

</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__add__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>likes</span><span>):
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>Likes</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>count </span><span>+ </span><span>(</span><span>2 </span><span>* </span><span>likes</span><span>.</span><span>count))
</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__radd__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>int</span><span>):
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>Likes</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>count </span><span>+ </span><span>(</span><span>2 </span><span>* </span><span>int</span><span>))
</span><span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Addition of <code>Likes</code> is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property">commutative</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property">associative</a>.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>class </span><span>Post</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>user_id</span><span>, </span><span>likes</span><span>):

</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_likes
</span></code></pre>
<p>Getting <code>post.likes</code> changes how addition behaves for the <code>Likes</code> class in future calls.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>class </span><span>Posts</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>posts</span><span>):

</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__iter__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):
</span><span>    random</span><span>.</span><span>shuffle</span><span>(users)
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>__iter__</span><span>()
</span></code></pre>
<p>Iterating over <code>posts</code> randomly shuffles the contents of <code>users</code>.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>class </span><span>Id</span><span>:
</span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>int</span><span>):

</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_id </span><span>== </span><span>other</span><span>.</span><span>_id
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>Id</code> class hashes by identity but compares by value, so the groups in <code>totals</code> will get split up in some non-deterministic way.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>users </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>User</span><span>(i) </span><span>for </span><span>i </span><span>in </span><span>itertools</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>())
</span></code></pre>
<p>Lastly, there are an infinite number of users. The original query returns a generator that can be consumed lazily, but the transformed query never returns.</p>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve seen the rest of the code, it&#39;s clear that in this case the transformed query won&#39;t produce the same results as the original query.</p>
<p>Since python is dynamically typed and late bound, the compiler can&#39;t know in advance if we&#39;re going to call code as unreasonable as above, so it can&#39;t possibly reason about whether the transformation is valid or not.</p>
<hr/>
<p>So our minimum requirements for interesting program transformations include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Static typing (so that we know what values look like).</li>
<li>Static dispatch (so that we know which functions will be called).</li>
<li>Some way to reason about the properties of functions (eg that <code>a == b</code> implies <code>hash(a) == hash(b)</code> or that addition is commutative).</li>
<li>Some way to reason about which values are finite and which functions terminate.</li>
<li>Some way to reason about the time and space cost of functions (so that we can predict if a given transformation is worthwhile).</li>
<li>Some way to reason about the effects caused by calling functions (eg by only allowing pure functions, or by tracking effects and aliasing in the type system).</li>
</ol>
<p>Python fails on all of these requirements.</p>
<p>Haskell satisfies 1-3 pretty well, but we can still write tricky code that makes 4 and 5 difficult (eg space leaks are notoriously hard for humans to reason about, let alone for the compiler which doesn&#39;t understand the intent of the code). And haskell&#39;s pure functions mostly satisfy 6, but they can still throw exceptions.</p>
<pre data-lang="haskell"><code data-lang="haskell"><span>user_id (</span><span>Post</span><span> uid likes) </span><span>= </span><span>if</span><span> (uid </span><span>== </span><span>0</span><span>) </span><span>then</span><span> (error </span><span>&#34;Oh no&#34;</span><span>) </span><span>else</span><span> uid
</span></code></pre>
<p>Although, to be fair, sql functions can also throw exceptions. We try not to think about it.</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>sqlite</span><span>&gt; </span><span>select </span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>/</span><span>0</span><span>) </span><span>from</span><span> (</span><span>select </span><span>1 </span><span>as</span><span> bar) </span><span>as</span><span> foo </span><span>where </span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>;
</span><span>0
</span><span>
</span><span>postgres</span><span>&gt; </span><span>select </span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>/</span><span>0</span><span>) </span><span>from</span><span> (</span><span>select </span><span>1 </span><span>as</span><span> bar) </span><span>as</span><span> foo </span><span>where </span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>;
</span><span>ERROR:  division by zero
</span></code></pre>
<p>So on the one hand, despite being arguably declarative, haskell makes it very difficult to automatically perform these kinds of program transformations. And on the other hand we could design a language with mutable variables and control flow that satisfied 1-6 (perhaps using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">effect types</a> or <a href="https://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2022_02/article2.pdf">mutable value semantics</a>) and such a language probably would be amenable to sql-like optimizations.</p>
<p>Drawing a broader lesson, the original &#39;explanation&#39; seemed quite reasonable on the surface but the vagueness of the term &#39;declarative&#39; was doing a lot of work. Operationalizing the question by imagining how we would try to implement a query optimizer for various different languages forced us to deal with the concrete details. The more concrete we get, the harder it is for fuzzy thinking to hide.</p>
<p>This is important not because we actually want to run a query optimizer on python, but because it helps us think clearly about the design of future query languages and programming languages.</p>
