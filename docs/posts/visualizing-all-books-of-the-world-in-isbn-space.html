    <h1>Visualizing all books of the world in ISBN-Space</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><small><time datetime="2025-01-31T00:00:00.000Z">Jan 31, 2025</time></small></p><p>Libraries have been trying to collect humanity’s knowledge almost since the invention of writing. In the digital age, it might actually be possible to create a comprehensive collection of all human writing that meets certain criteria. That’s what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_library">shadow libraries</a> do - collect and share as many books as possible.</p><p>One shadow library, Anna’s Archive (which I will not link here directly due to copyright concerns), recently posed a question: <em>How could we effectively visualize 100,000,000 books or more at once?</em> There’s lots of data to view: Titles, authors, which countries the books come from, which publishers, how old they are, how many libraries hold them, whether they are available digitally, etc.</p><p>International Standard Book Numbers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN">ISBNs</a>) are 13-digit numbers that are assigned to almost all published books. Since the first three digits are fixed (currently only <code>978-</code> and <code>979-</code>) and the last digit is a checksum, this means <b>the total ISBN13-Space only has two billion slots</b>. Here is my interactive visualization of that space:</p><p><a href="https://phiresky.github.io/isbn-visualization/" target="_blank">Click here to view the visualization in full screen (esp. on mobile)</a>.</p><p>You can choose a few different datasets, look for individual books, filter by publication year, and even create a custom visualization based on multiple datasets using custom shaders. If you zoom in all the way, you get a nice bookshelf-like representation.</p><p>Here’s how I did it.</p><h2 id="the-inherent-structure-of-isbns">The inherent structure of ISBNs</h2><p>The <code>978-</code>/<code>979-</code> prefix of an ISBN comes from the fact that ISBN13s are a subset of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number">European Article Numbers</a>, which have a three-digit prefix. This fixed prefix is affectionately called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookland">Bookland</a>. We can thus ignore it almost completely.</p><p>Large blocks of 10k to 100 million ISBNs are assigned by the <em>International ISBN Agency</em> to international organizations. Then, each country has their own method of subdividing their blocks into publishers.</p><p>The important part is that ISBN blocks are always assigned by <b>prefix</b>. For example, <code>978-4</code> is assigned to Japan, and Japan assigned <code>978-4-312</code> to one publisher. That publisher then assigns the articles <code>000000-99999</code>, leading to an ISBN of <code>978-4-312-99999-X</code>, where X is a checksum. The longer the country prefix is, the fewer books can be assigned within it. For example, while Japan has a space of 100 million ISBNs, Singapore has a prefix of <code>978-9971-</code>, allowing only 100 thousand ISBNs.</p><h3 id="space-filling-curves">Space-filling curves</h3><p>When you strip ISBNs of their pre-and suffix, they are a single decimal number between 0 and 2 billion. We need some way to project this one-dimensional space into a two-dimensional space. The easiest way would be to simply fill pixels row-wise from the top, which results in an image like this:</p><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/year-2024-in-review/oclc_isbns_smaller.png" title=""/><figcaption>ISBN-Space presented linearly. Whiter pixels contain more books. You can see the line-stretched structure.</figcaption></figure><p>The issue with this is that smaller regions are stretched more and more horizontally, at the extreme a region is 1000 pixels wide and 1 pixel high. This makes it hard to see the inherent structure of ISBNs.</p><p>Thus, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42652577">as people on Hacker News discussed</a>, a better way to fill an image is using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve">space-filling curve</a>.</p><p>The commonly suggested Hilbert-curve is nice, but it leads to artifacts:</p><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/year-2024-in-review/hilbert.png" title=""/><figcaption>Left: a Hilbert curve. Right: ISBN-space projected into a hilbert curve. You can see that the regions look like they have spatial structure, but this is purely an artifact of the curve used. (credit: Wikipedia, Hypha A)</figcaption></figure><p>While the Hilbert curve helps make regions more <span>&#34;<!-- -->square<!-- -->&#34;</span> (smaller regions do not get wider and wider), it introduces structure where there is none. Since structures that are not actually part of data are a huge issue in data visualization, we want to avoid this.</p><h3 id="the-bookshelf-curve">The <span>&#34;<!-- -->Bookshelf<!-- -->&#34;</span>-Curve</h3><p>ISBNs are inherently decimal, and we can use this to create a space-filling curve that is both simple to implement, easy to understand, and visually appealing:</p><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/year-2024-in-review/bookshelf-curve.drawio.svg" title=""/><figcaption>The space-filling curve I call <span>&#34;<!-- -->Bookshelf-Curve<!-- -->&#34;</span> because each second layer looks like an upright bookshelf, and each other layer like a stack of books.</figcaption></figure><p>The first decimal layer contains the digits 0-9 next to each other, the next one has them on top of each other, recursively.

I spent a lot of time trying and failing to render text into images/canvas in JS without having to implement my own text wrapping and layouting engine. The best approach was to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25760896/2639190">embed the HTML as a <code>&lt;foreignObject /&gt;</code> within an SVG</a>, then render that to a canvas using <code>drawImage</code>, then converting that to an image and loading it as a texture.</p><p>This works, but it caused <code>20ms</code> lags every time, synchronously in the rendering process. I struggled to move this to a WebWorker, but it turns out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/79196371/2639190">it’s impossible to draw an SVG in a WebWorker</a>.</p><p>After all this frustrating effort, it turns out I could fix most of my performance concerns by just reducing the HTML elements, limiting DOM content added per frame, and especially removing a stack of <code>text-shadow</code> CSS filters, which are apparently horrible for performance.</p><h2 id="barcodes">Barcodes</h2><p>At max zoom, you will also notice that each book has a barcode. I mainly added these to reinforce the concept of what we are looking at: Books ordered by ISBN. I started with some libraries to render bar codes, but it turns out there’s actually a TTF font that just renders a 13-digit number as a barcode! It even calculates the check digit itself: <a href="https://graphicore.github.io/librebarcode/">https://graphicore.github.io/librebarcode/</a>. Pretty convenient, and performant too, due to all the optimization OSs do for text rendering.</p><h2 id="publisher-ranges">Publisher ranges</h2><p>Each <span>&#34;<!-- -->group<!-- -->&#34;</span> (usually countries) has a large range, and each publisher has a smaller range within a group. I decided to visualize this using randomly assigned colors unique for each group and publisher:</p><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/year-2024-in-review/publishers.png" title=""/><figcaption>Looking at publishers shows their range size. If a publisher has multiple ranges the color is the same.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to allow highlighting all ranges of a publisher simultaneously, I simply give each publisher a unique ID and store this as the RGB components:</p><pre><code><span>ivec4</span><span> data </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getIntegerRGB</span><span>(</span><span>texture2D</span><span>(</span><span>$dataset_publishers</span><span>,</span><span> vUv</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>

The publisher colors clash with the heatmap color scale, and country ranges are hard to see.</p><h2 id="flight">Flight</h2><p>If you search for a book or click on the minimap, you will fly there. Calculating a good looking flight path is actually much trickier than it seems. I’m not sure how Google Earth does it. After getting a mediocre result by fitting a parabola, I nerd sniped a friend of mine to get him to do it, here’s what he said:</p><blockquote><p><span>&#34;<!-- -->Somehow you’re pretending reality is polar coordinates and converting that to cartesian coordinates?<!-- -->&#34;</span> - <span>&#34;<!-- -->Yes it transforms the points into a space which has the property that for a certain zoom level (which you potentially can’t reach at all) all coordinates lie on one point but all ground points are still the same distance away… aka a semicircle (or less) where the edge of the circle has the xy points zoomed in at maximum… in other words, a space that represents the speed and spatiality of the original space in one… in which the direct route is then theoretically the fastest route…. Unfortunately, this only applies if the increase in speed depends linearly on the zoom level…. but this is not the case with normal zooming… there it is rather quadratic… so every zoom level further up makes you move twice as fast to the right left… but this somehow results in a strange non-linear space with strange properties and I haven’t managed to define a distance metric in there, let alone the shortest path between two points<!-- -->&#34;</span></p><p>– my friend rambling about calculating flight paths</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/year-2024-in-review/blub-space.png" title=""/><figcaption>Blub-space transformation for smooth flight paths. This is what he sent me to try and explain it.</figcaption></figure><p>The end result isn’t perfect and it feels a bit overengineered at 500 lines of code, but it works better than my original approach.</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><h3 id="backend">Backend</h3><p>Since we can just store our image tiles as PNG and our data trees as JSON, we don’t need any backend! We just need a static file host, like Github Pages to dump some HTML, JS, CSS, PNG, and JSON.</p><h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3><p>I used ThreeJS, React, MobX. This is a very comfortable combination to create reactive declarative GPU-accelerated 2D/3D-scenes, with easy reusability of components. I can recommend it.</p><h3 id="processing-scripts">Processing Scripts</h3><p>There’s a set of processing scripts, mostly written in JS (directly writing out JSON and PNG files), but one of them written in Rust since it has to read in a 250GByte source file, writing output to SQLite.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We now have a very flexible way of visualizing all books that have been published with an ISBN. I enjoyed working on this project a lot. In the end, it was made possible by what would in software be called a bad choice - using an identifier that can only barely fit enough elements. If you tried the same with UUIDs, you’d have purely vast emptiness ;)</p><p>The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/phiresky/isbn-visualization">https://github.com/phiresky/isbn-visualization</a>.</p></div></div>
