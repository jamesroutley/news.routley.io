    <h1>Apple might have to pay that €13B EU tax bill after all</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Apple managed to escape a whopping €13 billion ($13.9 billion) tax bill in the European Union a few years ago, though now the advocate general of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) is asking judges to take another look. </p>
<p><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-11/cp230171en.pdf" rel="nofollow">According</a> [PDF] to the CJEU&#39;s Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella, a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/15/apple_13bn_irish_tax_ruling_overturned/">2020 ruling</a> that absolved Apple of the expense should be set aside due to &#34;a series of errors in law&#34; when it made the ruling.</p>
<p>&#34;The General Court failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors,&#34; the AG&#39;s office said.</p>

    

<p>For those having trouble recalling the nature of the disagreement, it reaches back a few years, beginning with a decision in 2018 that told Apple to hand over the aforementioned €13 billion to Irish tax officials after the European Commission <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/09/19/apple_alleged_state_aid_ireland/">decided</a> Apple and Irish authorities had together broken state aid rules.</p>

        


        

<p>Ireland, where Apple has its European headquarters, is known for its favorable tax rules that have attracted a number of large US-based tech companies to set up shop on the Emerald Isle. Apple, EU officials report, split itself into two entities – Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations International (AOE) – after obtaining permission from Irish tax authorities. </p>
<p>Those officials gave that permission in two rulings issued in 1991 and 2007, the AG&#39;s office said. In 2016, the European Commission figured those two rulings allowed Apple to exclude profits derived from intellectual property licenses held by ASI and AOE. That meant Apple didn&#39;t have to pay as much tax in Europe as one might expect, and the EC was OK with that at the time.</p>

        

<p>Then, as we said, in 2018, the commission had a change of heart, felt rules had been broken, and wanted that €13 billion in tax from Apple.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2020, and the General Court of the European Union decided Apple didn&#39;t actually need to pay the tax due to the arrangement the iPhone maker had in Ireland seemingly being above board. We got a hint of how the EC planned to appeal against that general court decision, and extract billions from Apple, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/01/european_commission_outlines_its_appeal/">in 2021</a>, and the filing by Pitruzzella&#39;s office makes largely the same argument.</p>
<p>Whether Apple will end up having to cough up the cash again (a considerable amount - the iGiant&#39;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/" rel="nofollow">calendar Q3 profit</a> this year amounted to $23 billion) is unknown. As the AG&#39;s office notes, its opinions aren&#39;t binding on the CJEU, and will require the court to review the case and issue a new decision. </p>
<h3>US hiring discrimination charges mean pocket-change payout for Apple</h3>
<p>The iMaker will also cough up $25 million (with an M) the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-25-million-landmark-agreement-apple-resolve-employment" rel="nofollow">announced</a> this week, settling claims the tech titan &#34;illegally discriminated in hiring and recruitment against US citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the United States does not expire.&#34;</p>
<p>According to the DoJ, Apple violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/laws-and-policy/legislation/immigration-and-nationality-act" rel="nofollow">INA</a>) when recruiting for jobs that fell under the permanent labor certification program (<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent" rel="nofollow">PERM</a>), a US Department of Labor scheme that allows employers to sponsor workers for permanent residence status, provided program requirements are met. Among those requirements are rules that employers can&#39;t illegally discriminate in hiring or recruitment based on citizenship or immigration status. </p>

        

<p>According to the DoJ, that&#39;s just what Apple did. </p>

</ul>
<p>&#34;The department&#39;s investigation found that Apple did not advertise positions Apple sought to fill through the PERM program on its external job website … [and] required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications,&#34; the DoJ said. </p>
<p>&#34;These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire.&#34; </p>
<p>Basically, if a US company wants to sponsor an employee&#39;s green card, so that the staffer can get permanent residency in America, the biz usually (but not always) has to apply for a PERM certificate from the Dept of Labor so that the foreign worker&#39;s immigration process can be completed. To get that PERM cert, the business has to demonstrate that no US citizen or someone already with a green card is available and qualified to do that employee&#39;s role in America and thus the foreigner needs permanent status in the country to fill the position.</p>
<p>By demonstrate, we mean that the employer is expected to re-advertise that foreign staffer&#39;s job widely so that US persons have a chance to come forward to show they ought to have it instead; if you put barriers up, such as only accepting mailed applications or hiding the job ads in little-seen corners of the internet, it&#39;s not a fair situation, and that makes Uncle Sam unhappy. And the government is upset at the iPhone giant doing stuff like that, allegedly.</p>
<p>We reached out to Apple for comment, and haven&#39;t heard back. Cook and Co did <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/apple-to-pay-up-to-25-million-to-settle-u-s-discrimination-charges-3f81fad4?st=df2t03ajuss4fo1&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" rel="nofollow">tell</a> the Wall Street Journal that its violation of government standards was an accident. </p>
<p>&#34;When we realized we had unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard, we agreed to a settlement addressing their concerns,&#34; an Apple spokesperson said. &#34;We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US.&#34;</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s payout will be split between $6.75 million in civil penalties and an $18.25 million back pay fund for discrimination victims. As noted above, Apple made $23 billion in profit in one quarter alone. That $25 million fine amounts to a tenth of one percent of its Q3 net income. ®</p>
