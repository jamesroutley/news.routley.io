    <h1>So You&#39;ve Decided to Move from Unity to Unreal Engine</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
      <h3>Alright
        fine! Here&#39;s 20 minutes of rapid fire tips and a video about the Class
        Viewer (turn on the Class Viewer). And Chris Murphy&#39;s Video about
        Features You Probably Don&#39;t Know About.</h3>
      <h3>I
        suggest watching these through immediately, even though it&#39;s a bit
        overwhelming, just to get a sense of what sorts of things are there,
        and then coming back and looking again later when you&#39;re more equipped
        to directly utilise the scoops.</h3>

            <h3>Isn&#39;t Epic going to end up screwing me over in some way?</h3>
            You should never trust a big corporation, but probably not. Epic&#39;s
            EULA stipulates that <span>if the EULA
              changes, you don&#39;t have to agree to the new terms</span>;
            as long as you stay on the version of Unreal you&#39;re on. Combined
            with
            full access to the source code, this probably means you&#39;re pretty
            safe.

            <h3>Unreal and Unity are not game engines in the same sense.</h3>
            Unreal, idTech, Cryengine, Source, Snowdrop, etc are game engines
            that emerged <span>from</span>
            the process of game development. Unity and Godot didn&#39;t, which is
            fine,
            but not the same thing, and using them is fundamentally different.</td>

            It&#39;s free until you make a million bucks USD, and only after <span>that</span>
            is it 5% gross, and only in quarters where you made more than
            $10,000
            USD. So most folks never end up paying anything. There are no
            subscription fees or anything. To clarify, if you make a million
            bucks,
            and then one dollar, you only owe them five cents.</td>

            <h3>What&#39;s the deal with platforms? Consoles? Epic Launcher? </h3>
            You
            can put your games on any platform or console, they&#39;re all well
            supported, and nothing is mandatory. If you sell on EGS, which you
            don&#39;t have to, those sales
            don&#39;t contribute to the revenue thresholds above. Porting to
            consoles
            is easier here than on other engines. </td>
          <td>
            <h3>Porting to consoles isn&#39;t an outsource job here.</h3>
            It
            can be, of course, but Unreal is built to target every platform from
            one project. Fortnite is on Switch, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation,
            PC, and maybe something else, and that is <span>all
              built out of one project</span>.
            You can do this too. For the most part it &#34;just works&#34;. Stuff like
            &#34;make the textures lower res on the Switch, depending on the asset&#34;
            is
            all built-in and easy. <a href="https://cohost.org/joewintergreen/post/2839494-game-dev-post-porti">I
              did the Switch port of Adios in a week.</a> </td>

            Blueprint actually rules. Look, I get it - why would a visual

            <h3>Do I have to put the Unreal logo on my stuff?</h3>
            No, in fact if you want to use it, you have to <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/branding">fill out a form</a>
            and they can reject you. You do still have to put a &#34;this uses
            Unreal

            <h3>You won&#39;t use the Asset Store as much.</h3>
            It&#39;s
            called the Unreal Engine Marketplace, and there&#39;s a lot of good
            stuff
            and a lot of bad stuff on there. In general, you need it less than
            you
            do on Unity. Like you don&#39;t need Rewired; Unreal&#39;s input systems are
            solid and work on every platform. There&#39;ll be a lot of stuff like
            that.</td>

            This isn&#39;t true. It<span> was</span>
            sort of true in the first half of UE3. By UE4 it wasn&#39;t true in any
            sense. Somebody&#39;s lyin&#39;. </td>

            They have some
            non-controlling amount of shares. The way I&#39;ve had this explained to
            me
            is Tim Sweeney owns the majority and nobody else gets any real say
            in
            anything. Tencent did invest though and do own part of it. </td>
          <td>
            <h3>Upgrading to the latest version is not a big deal.</h3>
            Most
            times you upgrade to the next version of Unreal you won&#39;t run into
            any
            issues. Some folks like to hold off a little just to be sure.
            Psychonauts 2 started on 4.11 and shipped on 4.26. Staying up to
            date
            is good here.</td>

            <span><span><span></span></span></span>That&#39;s all
            fine. The fancy graphics in Unreal are easy to disable, and you
            still get the benefit of their fancy tooling. </td>

            <h3>Unreal doesn&#39;t suddenly remove important features. </h3>
            When
            Epic deprecates a massive feature, it tends to stick around for a
            long
            time before actually being removed, and then you&#39;ll have an upgrade
            path provided.</td>
          <td>
            <h3>Can I make a 2D game?</h3>
            Yeah,
            totally. Just make a game as usual but with an orthographic camera.
            If
            you want sprites instead of animated meshes, there&#39;s a system called
            Paper2D for dealing with sprites, and it doesn&#39;t get a lot of
            updates
            or do much with animation, but there&#39;s also a system called PaperZD
            (on
            the marketplace) that does a lot more. As of 5.3, all the latest
            lighting features work with orthographic - lumen, virtual
            shadowmaps,
            etc.</td>

            <h3>Unreal introduces new systems carefully.</h3>
            If something new comes into Unreal, usually it&#39;s initially marked <span>Experimental</span>.
            This means Epic don&#39;t recommend relying on it for production.
            Eventually it will lose that label, and then it&#39;s safe to use in a
            shipping game. </td>
          <td>
            <h3>Can I make a game that&#39;s playable in the browser?</h3>
            Not
            really! There used to be HTML5 support, but it got deprecated a few
            years ago. Other than Pixel Streaming, you don&#39;t have much recourse
            here unless you want to implement it yourself. So that sucks.</td>

            <h3>Unreal doesn&#39;t have multiple rendering pipelines with their own
              asset requirements.</h3>
            You
            do have access to multiple renderers in Unreal, with different
            features
            - there are Deferred and Forward renderers for both Desktop and
            Mobile
            with various quirks (eg, you only get MSAA on Forward). But your
            assets
            don&#39;t care about this - the renderers all look the same, and you can
            switch between them at will to figure out what best fits your
            project. </td>

            <h3>I heard you can&#39;t make a build that&#39;s less than a billion megs!</h3>
            Out
            of the box in UE5.3, if you disable all unnecessary plugins and
            package
            a nearly-empty project, it&#39;s like 120mb. On UE4 that was more like
            75mb. There&#39;s a lot more you can do to reduce file size - this is
            just
            what I&#39;ve done personally. If you search, you should find some good
            tips for this. </td>

            You
            know how in Batman Arkham Asylum you sometimes have to wait in front
            of
            a door while it security-scans you, but actually it&#39;s loading the
            next
            chunk of level while you stand there throwing batarangs and it&#39;ll
            take
            longer to scan you on a slower machine? That&#39;s not something
            Rocksteady
            did, that&#39;s just Unreal&#39;s level streaming system they used for Gears
            of
            War. You can just use that. </td>

            There&#39;s a way to go, but things have gotten a hell of a lot better,
            especially in 5.3. Check out that link for some scoops on the tools
            CubeGrid and MeshTool, which are both excellent and work well
