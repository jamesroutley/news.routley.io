    <h1>Hack GPON â€“ how to access, change and edit fibre ONTs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content-wrap"> <div id="main-content" role="main">  <hr/> <p>Most ONTs run customized firmware which implement vendor and ISP-specific integrations and are locked down in functionality to match service requirements. ONTs often perform differently depending on the OLT and the settings applied by the ISP; for convenience it is often desirable to switch from an external ONT to an SFP or vice-versa, but most OLTs perform so many checks on the ONT that a simple replacement is almost impossible.</p> <div role="alert"> <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24"><use xlink:href="#svg-warning"></use></svg> <p><span> <b>Warning</b> Playing with ONTs can cause your serial number/PLOAM password to be banned and faults to the optics, ONTs and OLTs. Always pay close attention to the calibration of the laser, under no circumstances should the calibration be changed.</span> </p></div> <div role="alert"> <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24"><use xlink:href="#svg-warning"></use></svg> <p><span> <b>Warning</b> The material and information contained on this website is for general information purposes only.
