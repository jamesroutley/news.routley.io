    <p>
      In the United States, where we have more land than people, it is not at
      all difficult for persons in good health to make money. In this
      comparatively new field there are so many avenues of success open, so many
      vocations which are not crowded, that any person of either sex who is
      willing, at least for the time being, to engage in any respectable
      occupation that offers, may find lucrative employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who really desire to attain an independence, have only to set their
      minds upon it, and adopt the proper means, as they do in regard to any
      other object which they wish to accomplish, and the thing is easily done.
      But however easy it may be found to make money, I have no doubt many of my
      hearers will agree it is the most difficult thing in the world to keep it.
      The road to wealth is, as Dr. Franklin truly says, &#34;as plain as the road
      to the mill.&#34; It consists simply in expending less than we earn; that
      seems to be a very simple problem. Mr. Micawber, one of those happy
      creations of the genial Dickens, puts the case in a strong light when he
      says that to have annual income of twenty pounds per annum, and spend
      twenty pounds and sixpence, is to be the most miserable of men; whereas,
      to have an income of only twenty pounds, and spend but nineteen pounds and
      sixpence is to be the happiest of mortals. Many of my readers may say, &#34;we
      understand this: this is economy, and we know economy is wealth; we know
      we can&#39;t eat our cake and keep it also.&#34; Yet I beg to say that perhaps
      more cases of failure arise from mistakes on this point than almost any
      other. The fact is, many people think they understand economy when they
      really do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      True economy is misapprehended, and people go through life without
      properly comprehending what that principle is. One says, &#34;I have an income
      of so much, and here is my neighbor who has the same; yet every year he
      gets something ahead and I fall short; why is it? I know all about
      economy.&#34; He thinks he does, but he does not. There are men who think that
      economy consists in saving cheese-parings and candle-ends, in cutting off
      two pence from the laundress&#39; bill and doing all sorts of little, mean,
      dirty things. Economy is not meanness. The misfortune is, also, that this
      class of persons let their economy apply in only one direction. They fancy
      they are so wonderfully economical in saving a half-penny where they ought
      to spend twopence, that they think they can afford to squander in other
      directions. A few years ago, before kerosene oil was discovered or thought
      of, one might stop overnight at almost any farmer&#39;s house in the
      agricultural districts and get a very good supper, but after supper he
      might attempt to read in the sitting-room, and would find it impossible
      with the inefficient light of one candle. The hostess, seeing his dilemma,
      would say: &#34;It is rather difficult to read here evenings; the proverb says
      &#39;you must have a ship at sea in order to be able to burn two candles at
      once;&#39; we never have an extra candle except on extra occasions.&#34; These
      extra occasions occur, perhaps, twice a year. In this way the good woman
      saves five, six, or ten dollars in that time: but the information which
      might be derived from having the extra light would, of course, far
      outweigh a ton of candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the trouble does not end here. Feeling that she is so economical in
      tallow candies, she thinks she can afford to go frequently to the village
      and spend twenty or thirty dollars for ribbons and furbelows, many of
      which are not necessary. This false connote may frequently be seen in men
      of business, and in those instances it often runs to writing-paper. You
      find good businessmen who save all the old envelopes and scraps, and would
      not tear a new sheet of paper, if they could avoid it, for the world. This
      is all very well; they may in this way save five or ten dollars a year,
      but being so economical (only in note paper), they think they can afford
      to waste time; to have expensive parties, and to drive their carriages.
      This is an illustration of Dr. Franklin&#39;s &#34;saving at the spigot and
      wasting at the bung-hole;&#34; &#34;penny wise and pound foolish.&#34; Punch in
      speaking of this &#34;one idea&#34; class of people says &#34;they are like the man
      who bought a penny herring for his family&#39;s dinner and then hired a coach
      and four to take it home.&#34; I never knew a man to succeed by practising
      this kind of economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      True economy consists in always making the income exceed the out-go. Wear
      the old clothes a little longer if necessary; dispense with the new pair
      of gloves; mend the old dress: live on plainer food if need be; so that,
      under all circumstances, unless some unforeseen accident occurs, there
      will be a margin in favor of the income. A penny here, and a dollar there,
      placed at interest, goes on accumulating, and in this way the desired
      result is attained. It requires some training, perhaps, to accomplish this
      economy, but when once used to it, you will find there is more
      satisfaction in rational saving than in irrational spending. Here is a
      recipe which I recommend: I have found it to work an excellent cure for
      extravagance, and especially for mistaken economy: When you find that you
      have no surplus at the end of the year, and yet have a good income, I
      advise you to take a few sheets of paper and form them into a book and
      mark down every item of expenditure. Post it every day or week in two
      columns, one headed &#34;necessaries&#34; or even &#34;comforts&#34;, and the other headed
      &#34;luxuries,&#34; and you will find that the latter column will be double,
      treble, and frequently ten times greater than the former. The real
      comforts of life cost but a small portion of what most of us can earn. Dr.
      Franklin says &#34;it is the eyes of others and not our own eyes which ruin
      us. If all the world were blind except myself I should not care for fine
      clothes or furniture.&#34; It is the fear of what Mrs. Grundy may say that
      keeps the noses of many worthy families to the grindstone. In America many
      persons like to repeat &#34;we are all free and equal,&#34; but it is a great
      mistake in more senses than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      That we are born &#34;free and equal&#34; is a glorious truth in one sense, yet we
      are not all born equally rich, and we never shall be. One may say; &#34;there
      is a man who has an income of fifty thousand dollars per annum, while I
      have but one thousand dollars; I knew that fellow when he was poor like
      myself; now he is rich and thinks he is better than I am; I will show him
      that I am as good as he is; I will go and buy a horse and buggy; no, I
      cannot do that, but I will go and hire one and ride this afternoon on the
      same road that he does, and thus prove to him that I am as good as he is.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend, you need not take that trouble; you can easily prove that you
      are &#34;as good as he is;&#34; you have only to behave as well as he does; but
      you cannot make anybody believe that you are rich as he is. Besides, if
      you put on these &#34;airs,&#34; add waste your time and spend your money, your
      poor wife will be obliged to scrub her fingers off at home, and buy her
      tea two ounces at a time, and everything else in proportion, in order that
      you may keep up &#34;appearances,&#34; and, after all, deceive nobody. On the
      other hand, Mrs. Smith may say that her next-door neighbor married Johnson
      for his money, and &#34;everybody says so.&#34; She has a nice one-thousand dollar
      camel&#39;s hair shawl, and she will make Smith get her an imitation one, and
      she will sit in a pew right next to her neighbor in church, in order to
      prove that she is her equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      My good woman, you will not get ahead in the world, if your vanity and
      envy thus take the lead. In this country, where we believe the majority
      ought to rule, we ignore that principle in regard to fashion, and let a
      handful of people, calling themselves the aristocracy, run up a false
      standard of perfection, and in endeavoring to rise to that standard, we
      constantly keep ourselves poor; all the time digging away for the sake of
      outside appearances. How much wiser to be a &#34;law unto ourselves&#34; and say,
      &#34;we will regulate our out-go by our income, and lay up something for a
      rainy day.&#34; People ought to be as sensible on the subject of money-getting
      as on any other subject. Like causes produces like effects. You cannot
      accumulate a fortune by taking the road that leads to poverty. It needs no
      prophet to tell us that those who live fully up to their means, without
      any thought of a reverse in this life, can never attain a pecuniary
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men and women accustomed to gratify every whim and caprice, will find it
      hard, at first, to cut down their various unnecessary expenses, and will
      feel it a great self-denial to live in a smaller house than they have been
      accustomed to, with less expensive furniture, less company, less costly
      clothing, fewer servants, a less number of balls, parties, theater-goings,
      carriage-ridings, pleasure excursions, cigar-smokings, liquor-drinkings,
      and other extravagances; but, after all, if they will try the plan of
      laying by a &#34;nest-egg,&#34; or, in other words, a small sum of money, at
      interest or judiciously invested in land, they will be surprised at the
      pleasure to be derived from constantly adding to their little &#34;pile,&#34; as
      well as from all the economical habits which are engendered by this
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old suit of clothes, and the old bonnet and dress, will answer for
      another season; the Croton or spring water taste better than champagne; a
      cold bath and a brisk walk will prove more exhilarating than a ride in the
      finest coach; a social chat, an evening&#39;s reading in the family circle, or
      an hour&#39;s play of &#34;hunt the slipper&#34; and &#34;blind man&#39;s buff&#34; will be far
      more pleasant than a fifty or five hundred dollar party, when the
      reflection on the difference in cost is indulged in by those who begin to
      know the pleasures of saving. Thousands of men are kept poor, and tens of
      thousands are made so after they have acquired quite sufficient to support
      them well through life, in consequence of laying their plans of living on
      too broad a platform. Some families expend twenty thousand dollars per
      annum, and some much more, and would scarcely know how to live on less,
      while others secure more solid enjoyment frequently on a twentieth part of
      that amount. Prosperity is a more severe ordeal than adversity, especially
      sudden prosperity. &#34;Easy come, easy go,&#34; is an old and true proverb. A
      spirit of pride and vanity, when permitted to have full sway, is the
      undying canker-worm which gnaws the very vitals of a man&#39;s worldly
      possessions, let them be small or great, hundreds, or millions. Many
      persons, as they begin to prosper, immediately expand their ideas and
      commence expending for luxuries, until in a short time their expenses
      swallow up their income, and they become ruined in their ridiculous
      attempts to keep up appearances, and make a &#34;sensation.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      I know a gentleman of fortune who says, that when he first began to
      prosper, his wife would have a new and elegant sofa. &#34;That sofa,&#34; he says,
      &#34;cost me thirty thousand dollars!&#34; When the sofa reached the house, it was
      found necessary to get chairs to match; then side-boards, carpets and
      tables &#34;to correspond&#34; with them, and so on through the entire stock of
      furniture; when at last it was found that the house itself was quite too
      small and old-fashioned for the furniture, and a new one was built to
      correspond with the new purchases; &#34;thus,&#34; added my friend, &#34;summing up an
      outlay of thirty thousand dollars, caused by that single sofa, and
      saddling on me, in the shape of servants, equipage, and the necessary
      expenses attendant upon keeping up a fine &#39;establishment,&#39; a yearly outlay
      of eleven thousand dollars, and a tight pinch at that: whereas, ten years
      ago, we lived with much more real comfort, because with much less care, on
      as many hundreds. The truth is,&#34; he continued, &#34;that sofa would have
      brought me to inevitable bankruptcy, had not a most unexampled title to
      prosperity kept me above it, and had I not checked the natural desire to
      &#39;cut a dash&#39;.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      The foundation of success in life is good health: that is the substratum
      fortune; it is also the basis of happiness. A person cannot accumulate a
      fortune very well when he is sick. He has no ambition; no incentive; no
      force. Of course, there are those who have bad health and cannot help it:
      you cannot expect that such persons can accumulate wealth, but there are a
      great many in poor health who need not be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, then, sound health is the foundation of success and happiness in life,
      how important it is that we should study the laws of health, which is but
      another expression for the laws of nature! The nearer we keep to the laws
      of nature, the nearer we are to good health, and yet how many persons
      there are who pay no attention to natural laws, but absolutely transgress
      them, even against their own natural inclination. We ought to know that
      the &#34;sin of ignorance&#34; is never winked at in regard to the violation of
      nature&#39;s laws; their infraction always brings the penalty. A child may
      thrust its finger into the flames without knowing it will burn, and so
      suffers, repentance, even, will not stop the smart. Many of our ancestors
      knew very little about the principle of ventilation. They did not know
      much about oxygen, whatever other &#34;gin&#34; they might have been acquainted
      with; and consequently they built their houses with little seven-by-nine
      feet bedrooms, and these good old pious Puritans would lock themselves up
      in one of these cells, say their prayers and go to bed. In the morning
      they would devoutly return thanks for the &#34;preservation of their lives,&#34;
      during the night, and nobody had better reason to be thankful. Probably
      some big crack in the window, or in the door, let in a little fresh air,
      and thus saved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons knowingly violate the laws of nature against their better
      impulses, for the sake of fashion. For instance, there is one thing that
      nothing living except a vile worm ever naturally loved, and that is
      tobacco; yet how many persons there are who deliberately train an
      unnatural appetite, and overcome this implanted aversion for tobacco, to
      such a degree that they get to love it. They have got hold of a poisonous,
      filthy weed, or rather that takes a firm hold of them. Here are married
      men who run about spitting tobacco juice on the carpet and floors, and
      sometimes even upon their wives besides. They do not kick their wives out
      of doors like drunken men, but their wives, I have no doubt, often wish
      they were outside of the house. Another perilous feature is that this
      artificial appetite, like jealousy, &#34;grows by what it feeds on;&#34; when you
      love that which is unnatural, a stronger appetite is created for the
      hurtful thing than the natural desire for what is harmless. There is an
      old proverb which says that &#34;habit is second nature,&#34; but an artificial
      habit is stronger than nature. Take for instance, an old tobacco-chewer;
      his love for the &#34;quid&#34; is stronger than his love for any particular kind
      of food. He can give up roast beef easier than give up the weed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young lads regret that they are not men; they would like to go to bed boys
      and wake up men; and to accomplish this they copy the bad habits of their
      seniors. Little Tommy and Johnny see their fathers or uncles smoke a pipe,
      and they say, &#34;If I could only do that, I would be a man too; uncle John
      has gone out and left his pipe of tobacco, let us try it.&#34; They take a
      match and light it, and then puff away. &#34;We will learn to smoke; do you
      like it Johnny?&#34; That lad dolefully replies: &#34;Not very much; it tastes
      bitter;&#34; by and by he grows pale, but he persists and he soon offers up a
      sacrifice on the altar of fashion; but the boys stick to it and persevere
      until at last they conquer their natural appetites and become the victims
      of acquired tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I speak &#34;by the book,&#34; for I have noticed its effects on myself, having
      gone so far as to smoke ten or fifteen cigars a day; although I have not
      used the weed during the last fourteen years, and never shall again. The
      more a man smokes, the more he craves smoking; the last cigar smoked
      simply excites the desire for another, and so on incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the tobacco-chewer. In the morning, when he gets up, he puts a quid
      in his mouth and keeps it there all day, never taking it out except to
      exchange it for a fresh one, or when he is going to eat; oh! yes, at
      intervals during the day and evening, many a chewer takes out the quid and
      holds it in his hand long enough to take a drink, and then pop it goes
      back again. This simply proves that the appetite for rum is even stronger
      than that for tobacco. When the tobacco-chewer goes to your country seat
      and you show him your grapery and fruit house, and the beauties of your
      garden, when you offer him some fresh, ripe fruit, and say, &#34;My friend, I
      have got here the most delicious apples, and pears, and peaches, and
      apricots; I have imported them from Spain, France and Italy—just see
      those luscious grapes; there is nothing more delicious nor more healthy
      than ripe fruit, so help yourself; I want to see you delight yourself with
      these things;&#34; he will roll the dear quid under his tongue and answer,
      &#34;No, I thank you, I have got tobacco in my mouth.&#34; His palate has become
      narcotized by the noxious weed, and he has lost, in a great measure, the
      delicate and enviable taste for fruits. This shows what expensive, useless
      and injurious habits men will get into. I speak from experience. I have
      smoked until I trembled like an aspen leaf, the blood rushed to my head,
      and I had a palpitation of the heart which I thought was heart disease,
      till I was almost killed with fright. When I consulted my physician, he
      said &#34;break off tobacco using.&#34; I was not only injuring my health and
      spending a great deal of money, but I was setting a bad example. I obeyed
      his counsel. No young man in the world ever looked so beautiful, as he
      thought he did, behind a fifteen cent cigar or a meerschaum!
    </p>

      These remarks apply with tenfold force to the use of intoxicating drinks.
      To make money, requires a clear brain. A man has got to see that two and
      two make four; he must lay all his plans with reflection and forethought,
      and closely examine all the details and the ins and outs of business. As
      no man can succeed in business unless he has a brain to enable him to lay
      his plans, and reason to guide him in their execution, so, no matter how
      bountifully a man may be blessed with intelligence, if the brain is
      muddled, and his judgment warped by intoxicating drinks, it is impossible
      for him to carry on business successfully. How many good opportunities
      have passed, never to return, while a man was sipping a &#34;social glass,&#34;
      with his friend! How many foolish bargains have been made under the
      influence of the &#34;nervine,&#34; which temporarily makes its victim think he is
      rich. How many important chances have been put off until to-morrow, and
      then forever, because the wine cup has thrown the system into a state of
      lassitude, neutralizing the energies so essential to success in business.
      Verily, &#34;wine is a mocker.&#34; The use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage,
      is as much an infatuation, as is the smoking of opium by the Chinese, and
      the former is quite as destructive to the success of the business man as
      the latter. It is an unmitigated evil, utterly indefensible in the light
      of philosophy; religion or good sense. It is the parent of nearly every
      other evil in our country.

    <h2>
      DON&#39;T MISTAKE YOUR VOCATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The safest plan, and the one most sure of success for the young man
      starting in life, is to select the vocation which is most congenial to his
      tastes. Parents and guardians are often quite too negligent in regard to
      this. It very common for a father to say, for example: &#34;I have five boys.
      I will make Billy a clergyman; John a lawyer; Tom a doctor, and Dick a
      farmer.&#34; He then goes into town and looks about to see what he will do
      with Sammy. He returns home and says &#34;Sammy, I see watch-making is a nice
      genteel business; I think I will make you a goldsmith.&#34; He does this,
      regardless of Sam&#39;s natural inclinations, or genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are all, no doubt, born for a wise purpose. There is as much diversity
      in our brains as in our countenances. Some are born natural mechanics,
      while some have great aversion to machinery. Let a dozen boys of ten years
      get together, and you will soon observe two or three are &#34;whittling&#34; out
      some ingenious device; working with locks or complicated machinery. When
      they were but five years old, their father could find no toy to please
      them like a puzzle. They are natural mechanics; but the other eight or
      nine boys have different aptitudes. I belong to the latter class; I never
      had the slightest love for mechanism; on the contrary, I have a sort of
      abhorrence for complicated machinery. I never had ingenuity enough to
      whittle a cider tap so it would not leak. I never could make a pen that I
      could write with, or understand the principle of a steam engine. If a man
      was to take such a boy as I was, and attempt to make a watchmaker of him,
      the boy might, after an apprenticeship of five or seven years, be able to
      take apart and put together a watch; but all through life he would be
      working up hill and seizing every excuse for leaving his work and idling
      away his time. Watchmaking is repulsive to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by nature, and best
      suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed. I am glad to believe
      that the majority of persons do find their right vocation. Yet we see many
      who have mistaken their calling, from the blacksmith up (or down) to the
      clergyman. You will see, for instance, that extraordinary linguist the
      &#34;learned blacksmith,&#34; who ought to have been a teacher of languages; and
      you may have seen lawyers, doctors and clergymen who were better fitted by
      nature for the anvil or the lapstone.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      SELECT THE RIGHT LOCATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      After securing the right vocation, you must be careful to select the
      proper location. You may have been cut out for a hotel keeper, and they
      say it requires a genius to &#34;know how to keep a hotel.&#34; You might conduct
      a hotel like clock-work, and provide satisfactorily for five hundred
      guests every day; yet, if you should locate your house in a small village
      where there is no railroad communication or public travel, the location
      would be your ruin. It is equally important that you do not commence
      business where there are already enough to meet all demands in the same
      occupation. I remember a case which illustrates this subject. When I was
      in London in 1858, I was passing down Holborn with an English friend and
      came to the &#34;penny shows.&#34; They had immense cartoons outside, portraying
      the wonderful curiosities to be seen &#34;all for a penny.&#34; Being a little in
      the &#34;show line&#34; myself, I said &#34;let us go in here.&#34; We soon found
      ourselves in the presence of the illustrious showman, and he proved to be
      the sharpest man in that line I had ever met. He told us some
      extraordinary stories in reference to his bearded ladies, his Albinos, and
      his Armadillos, which we could hardly believe, but thought it &#34;better to
      believe it than look after the proof&#39;.&#34; He finally begged to call our
      attention to some wax statuary, and showed us a lot of the dirtiest and
      filthiest wax figures imaginable. They looked as if they had not seen
      water since the Deluge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;What is there so wonderful about your statuary?&#34; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;I beg you not to speak so satirically,&#34; he replied, &#34;Sir, these are not
      Madam Tussaud&#39;s wax figures, all covered with gilt and tinsel and
      imitation diamonds, and copied from engravings and photographs. Mine, sir,
      were taken from life. Whenever you look upon one of those figures, you may
      consider that you are looking upon the living individual.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing casually at them, I saw one labeled &#34;Henry VIII,&#34; and feeling a
      little curious upon seeing that it looked like Calvin Edson, the living
      skeleton, I said: &#34;Do you call that &#39;Henry the Eighth?&#39;&#34; He replied,
      &#34;Certainly; sir; it was taken from life at Hampton Court, by special order
      of his majesty; on such a day.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have given the hour of the day if I had resisted; I said,
      &#34;Everybody knows that &#39;Henry VIII.&#39; was a great stout old king, and that
      figure is lean and lank; what do you say to that?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Why,&#34; he replied, &#34;you would be lean and lank yourself if you sat there
      as long as he has.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting such arguments. I said to my English friend, &#34;Let
      us go out; do not tell him who I am; I show the white feather; he beats
      me.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed us to the door, and seeing the rabble in the street, he called
      out, &#34;ladies and gentlemen, I beg to draw your attention to the
      respectable character of my visitors,&#34; pointing to us as we walked away. I
      called upon him a couple of days afterwards; told him who I was, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;My friend, you are an excellent showman, but you have selected a bad
      location.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied, &#34;This is true, sir; I feel that all my talents are thrown
      away; but what can I do?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;You can go to America,&#34; I replied. &#34;You can give full play to your
      faculties over there; you will find plenty of elbowroom in America; I will
      engage you for two years; after that you will be able to go on your own
      account.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted my offer and remained two years in my New York Museum. He then
      went to New Orleans and carried on a traveling show business during the
      summer. To-day he is worth sixty thousand dollars, simply because he
      selected the right vocation and also secured the proper location. The old
      proverb says, &#34;Three removes are as bad as a fire,&#34; but when a man is in
      the fire, it matters but little how soon or how often he removes.

    <h2>
      AVOID DEBT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Young men starting in life should avoid running into debt. There is
      scarcely anything that drags a person down like debt. It is a slavish
      position to get in, yet we find many a young man, hardly out of his
      &#34;teens,&#34; running in debt. He meets a chum and says, &#34;Look at this: I have
      got trusted for a new suit of clothes.&#34; He seems to look upon the clothes
      as so much given to him; well, it frequently is so, but, if he succeeds in
      paying and then gets trusted again, he is adopting a habit which will keep
      him in poverty through life. Debt robs a man of his self-respect, and
      makes him almost despise himself. Grunting and groaning and working for
      what he has eaten up or worn out, and now when he is called upon to pay
      up, he has nothing to show for his money; this is properly termed &#34;working
      for a dead horse.&#34; I do not speak of merchants buying and selling on
      credit, or of those who buy on credit in order to turn the purchase to a
      profit. The old Quaker said to his farmer son, &#34;John, never get trusted;
      but if thee gets trusted for anything, let it be for &#39;manure,&#39; because
      that will help thee pay it back again.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beecher advised young men to get in debt if they could to a small
      amount in the purchase of land, in the country districts. &#34;If a young
      man,&#34; he says, &#34;will only get in debt for some land and then get married,
      these two things will keep him straight, or nothing will.&#34; This may be
      safe to a limited extent, but getting in debt for what you eat and drink
      and wear is to be avoided. Some families have a foolish habit of getting
      credit at &#34;the stores,&#34; and thus frequently purchase many things which
      might have been dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all very well to say; &#34;I have got trusted for sixty days, and if I
      don&#39;t have the money the creditor will think nothing about it.&#34; There is
      no class of people in the world, who have such good memories as creditors.
      When the sixty days run out, you will have to pay. If you do not pay, you
      will break your promise, and probably resort to a falsehood. You may make
      some excuse or get in debt elsewhere to pay it, but that only involves you
      the deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good-looking, lazy young fellow, was the apprentice boy, Horatio. His
      employer said, &#34;Horatio, did you ever see a snail?&#34; &#34;I—think—I—have,&#34;
      he drawled out. &#34;You must have met him then, for I am sure you never
      overtook one,&#34; said the &#34;boss.&#34; Your creditor will meet you or overtake
      you and say, &#34;Now, my young friend, you agreed to pay me; you have not
      done it, you must give me your note.&#34; You give the note on interest and it
      commences working against you; &#34;it is a dead horse.&#34; The creditor goes to
      bed at night and wakes up in the morning better off than when he retired
      to bed, because his interest has increased during the night, but you grow
      poorer while you are sleeping, for the interest is accumulating against
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money is in some respects like fire; it is a very excellent servant but a
      terrible master. When you have it mastering you; when interest is
      constantly piling up against you, it will keep you down in the worst kind
      of slavery. But let money work for you, and you have the most devoted
      servant in the world. It is no &#34;eye-servant.&#34; There is nothing animate or
      inanimate that will work so faithfully as money when placed at interest,
      well secured. It works night and day, and in wet or dry weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in the blue-law State of Connecticut, where the old Puritans
      had laws so rigid that it was said, &#34;they fined a man for kissing his wife
      on Sunday.&#34; Yet these rich old Puritans would have thousands of dollars at
      interest, and on Saturday night would be worth a certain amount; on Sunday
      they would go to church and perform all the duties of a Christian. On
      waking up on Monday morning, they would find themselves considerably
      richer than the Saturday night previous, simply because their money placed
      at interest had worked faithfully for them all day Sunday, according to
      law!
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not let it work against you; if you do there is no chance for success
      in life so far as money is concerned. John Randolph, the eccentric
      Virginian, once exclaimed in Congress, &#34;Mr. Speaker, I have discovered the
      philosopher&#39;s stone: pay as you go.&#34; This is, indeed, nearer to the
      philosopher&#39;s stone than any alchemist has ever yet arrived.

    <h2>
      PERSEVERE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When a man is in the right path, he must persevere. I speak of this
      because there are some persons who are &#34;born tired;&#34; naturally lazy and
      possessing no self-reliance and no perseverance. But they can cultivate
      these qualities, as Davy Crockett said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;This thing remember, when I am dead: Be sure you are right, then go
      ahead.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is this go-aheaditiveness, this determination not to let the &#34;horrors&#34;
      or the &#34;blues&#34; take possession of you, so as to make you relax your
      energies in the struggle for independence, which you must cultivate.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many have almost reached the goal of their ambition, but, losing faith
      in themselves, have relaxed their energies, and the golden prize has been
      lost forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, no doubt, often true, as Shakespeare says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads
      on to fortune.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      If you hesitate, some bolder hand will stretch out before you and get the
      prize. Remember the proverb of Solomon: &#34;He becometh poor that dealeth
      with a slack hand; but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perseverance is sometimes but another word for self-reliance. Many persons
      naturally look on the dark side of life, and borrow trouble. They are born
      so. Then they ask for advice, and they will be governed by one wind and
      blown by another, and cannot rely upon themselves. Until you can get so
      that you can rely upon yourself, you need not expect to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have known men, personally, who have met with pecuniary reverses, and
      absolutely committed suicide, because they thought they could never
      overcome their misfortune. But I have known others who have met more
      serious financial difficulties, and have bridged them over by simple
      perseverance, aided by a firm belief that they were doing justly, and that
      Providence would &#34;overcome evil with good.&#34; You will see this illustrated
      in any sphere of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take two generals; both understand military tactics, both educated at West
      Point, if you please, both equally gifted; yet one, having this principle
      of perseverance, and the other lacking it, the former will succeed in his
      profession, while the latter will fail. One may hear the cry, &#34;the enemy
      are coming, and they have got cannon.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Got cannon?&#34; says the hesitating general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Yes.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Then halt every man.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wants time to reflect; his hesitation is his ruin; the enemy passes
      unmolested, or overwhelms him; while on the other hand, the general of
      pluck, perseverance and self-reliance, goes into battle with a will, and,
      amid the clash of arms, the booming of cannon, the shrieks of the wounded,
      and the moans of the dying, you will see this man persevering, going on,
      cutting and slashing his way through with unwavering determination,
      inspiring his soldiers to deeds of fortitude, valor, and triumph.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      WHATEVER YOU DO, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Work at it, if necessary, early and late, in season and out of season, not
      leaving a stone unturned, and never deferring for a single hour that which
      can be done just as well now. The old proverb is full of truth and
      meaning, &#34;Whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.&#34; Many a man
      acquires a fortune by doing his business thoroughly, while his neighbor
      remains poor for life, because he only half does it. Ambition, energy,
      industry, perseverance, are indispensable requisites for success in
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune always favors the brave, and never helps a man who does not help
      himself. It won&#39;t do to spend your time like Mr. Micawber, in waiting for
      something to &#34;turn up.&#34; To such men one of two things usually &#34;turns up:&#34;
      the poorhouse or the jail; for idleness breeds bad habits, and clothes a
      man in rags. The poor spendthrift vagabond says to a rich man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;I have discovered there is enough money in the world for all of us, if it
      was equally divided; this must be done, and we shall all be happy
      together.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;But,&#34; was the response, &#34;if everybody was like you, it would be spent in
      two months, and what would you do then?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Oh! divide again; keep dividing, of course!&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was recently reading in a London paper an account of a like philosophic
      pauper who was kicked out of a cheap boarding-house because he could not
      pay his bill, but he had a roll of papers sticking out of his coat pocket,
      which, upon examination, proved to be his plan for paying off the national
      debt of England without the aid of a penny. People have got to do as
      Cromwell said: &#34;not only trust in Providence, but keep the powder dry.&#34; Do
      your part of the work, or you cannot succeed. Mahomet, one night, while
      encamping in the desert, overheard one of his fatigued followers remark:
      &#34;I will loose my camel, and trust it to God!&#34; &#34;No, no, not so,&#34; said the
      prophet, &#34;tie thy camel, and trust it to God!&#34; Do all you can for
      yourselves, and then trust to Providence, or luck, or whatever you please
      to call it, for the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEPEND UPON YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXERTIONS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye of the employer is often worth more than the hands of a dozen
      employees. In the nature of things, an agent cannot be so faithful to his
      employer as to himself. Many who are employers will call to mind instances
      where the best employees have overlooked important points which could not
      have escaped their own observation as a proprietor. No man has a right to
      expect to succeed in life unless he understands his business, and nobody
      can understand his business thoroughly unless he learns it by personal
      application and experience. A man may be a manufacturer: he has got to
      learn the many details of his business personally; he will learn something
      every day, and he will find he will make mistakes nearly every day. And
      these very mistakes are helps to him in the way of experiences if he but
      heeds them. He will be like the Yankee tin-peddler, who, having been
      cheated as to quality in the purchase of his merchandise, said: &#34;All
      right, there&#39;s a little information to be gained every day; I will never
      be cheated in that way again.&#34; Thus a man buys his experience, and it is
      the best kind if not purchased at too dear a rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold that every man should, like Cuvier, the French naturalist,
      thoroughly know his business. So proficient was he in the study of natural
      history, that you might bring to him the bone, or even a section of a bone
      of an animal which he had never seen described, and, reasoning from
      analogy, he would be able to draw a picture of the object from which the
      bone had been taken. On one occasion his students attempted to deceive
      him. They rolled one of their number in a cow skin and put him under the
      professor&#39;s table as a new specimen. When the philosopher came into the
      room, some of the students asked him what animal it was. Suddenly the
      animal said &#34;I am the devil and I am going to eat you.&#34; It was but natural
      that Cuvier should desire to classify this creature, and examining it
      intently, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Divided hoof; graminivorous! It cannot be done.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that an animal with a split hoof must live upon grass and grain,
      or other kind of vegetation, and would not be inclined to eat flesh, dead
      or alive, so he considered himself perfectly safe. The possession of a
      perfect knowledge of your business is an absolute necessity in order to
      insure success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the maxims of the elder Rothschild was one, all apparent paradox:
      &#34;Be cautious and bold.&#34; This seems to be a contradiction in terms, but it
      is not, and there is great wisdom in the maxim. It is, in fact, a
      condensed statement of what I have already said. It is to say; &#34;you must
      exercise your caution in laying your plans, but be bold in carrying them
      out.&#34; A man who is all caution, will never dare to take hold and be
      successful; and a man who is all boldness, is merely reckless, and must
      eventually fail. A man may go on &#34;&#39;change&#34; and make fifty, or one hundred
      thousand dollars in speculating in stocks, at a single operation. But if
      he has simple boldness without caution, it is mere chance, and what he
      gains to-day he will lose to-morrow. You must have both the caution and
      the boldness, to insure success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rothschilds have another maxim: &#34;Never have anything to do with an
      unlucky man or place.&#34; That is to say, never have anything to do with a
      man or place which never succeeds, because, although a man may appear to
      be honest and intelligent, yet if he tries this or that thing and always
      fails, it is on account of some fault or infirmity that you may not be
      able to discover but nevertheless which must exist.
    </p>

      There is no such thing in the world as luck. There never was a man who
      could go out in the morning and find a purse full of gold in the street
      to-day, and another to-morrow, and so on, day after day: He may do so once
      in his life; but so far as mere luck is concerned, he is as liable to lose
      it as to find it. &#34;Like causes produce like effects.&#34; If a man adopts the
      proper methods to be successful, &#34;luck&#34; will not prevent him. If he does
      not succeed, there are reasons for it, although, perhaps, he may not be
      able to see them.

    <h2>
      USE THE BEST TOOLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Men in engaging employees should be careful to get the best. Understand,
      you cannot have too good tools to work with, and there is no tool you
      should be so particular about as living tools. If you get a good one, it
      is better to keep him, than keep changing. He learns something every day;
      and you are benefited by the experience he acquires. He is worth more to
      you this year than last, and he is the last man to part with, provided his
      habits are good, and he continues faithful. If, as he gets more valuable,
      he demands an exorbitant increase of salary; on the supposition that you
      can&#39;t do without him, let him go. Whenever I have such an employee, I
      always discharge him; first, to convince him that his place may be
      supplied, and second, because he is good for nothing if he thinks he is
      invaluable and cannot be spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I would keep him, if possible, in order to profit from the result of
      his experience. An important element in an employee is the brain. You can
      see bills up, &#34;Hands Wanted,&#34; but &#34;hands&#34; are not worth a great deal
      without &#34;heads.&#34; Mr. Beecher illustrates this, in this wise:
    </p>
    <p>
      An employee offers his services by saving, &#34;I have a pair of hands and one
      of my fingers thinks.&#34; &#34;That is very good,&#34; says the employer. Another man
      comes along, and says &#34;he has two fingers that think.&#34; &#34;Ah! that is
      better.&#34; But a third calls in and says that &#34;all his fingers and thumbs
      think.&#34; That is better still. Finally another steps in and says, &#34;I have a
      brain that thinks; I think all over; I am a thinking as well as a working
      man!&#34; &#34;You are the man I want,&#34; says the delighted employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those men who have brains and experience are therefore the most valuable
      and not to be readily parted with; it is better for them, as well as
      yourself, to keep them, at reasonable advances in their salaries from time
      to time.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      DON&#39;T GET ABOVE YOUR BUSINESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Young men after they get through their business training, or
      apprenticeship, instead of pursuing their avocation and rising in their
      business, will often lie about doing nothing. They say; &#34;I have learned my
      business, but I am not going to be a hireling; what is the object of
      learning my trade or profession, unless I establish myself?&#39;&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Have you capital to start with?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;No, but I am going to have it.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;How are you going to get it?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;I will tell you confidentially; I have a wealthy old aunt, and she will
      die pretty soon; but if she does not, I expect to find some rich old man
      who will lend me a few thousands to give me a start. If I only get the
      money to start with I will do well.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no greater mistake than when a young man believes he will succeed
      with borrowed money. Why? Because every man&#39;s experience coincides with
      that of Mr. Astor, who said, &#34;it was more difficult for him to accumulate
      his first thousand dollars, than all the succeeding millions that made up
      his colossal fortune.&#34; Money is good for nothing unless you know the value
      of it by experience. Give a boy twenty thousand dollars and put him in
      business, and the chances are that he will lose every dollar of it before
      he is a year older. Like buying a ticket in the lottery; and drawing a
      prize, it is &#34;easy come, easy go.&#34; He does not know the value of it;
      nothing is worth anything, unless it costs effort. Without self-denial and
      economy; patience and perseverance, and commencing with capital which you
      have not earned, you are not sure to succeed in accumulating. Young men,
      instead of &#34;waiting for dead men&#39;s shoes,&#34; should be up and doing, for
      there is no class of persons who are so unaccommodating in regard to dying
      as these rich old people, and it is fortunate for the expectant heirs that
      it is so. Nine out of ten of the rich men of our country to-day, started
      out in life as poor boys, with determined wills, industry, perseverance,
      economy and good habits. They went on gradually, made their own money and
      saved it; and this is the best way to acquire a fortune. Stephen Girard
      started life as a poor cabin boy, and died worth nine million dollars.
      A.T. Stewart was a poor Irish boy; and he paid taxes on a million and a
      half dollars of income, per year. John Jacob Astor was a poor farmer boy,
      and died worth twenty millions. Cornelius Vanderbilt began life rowing a
      boat from Staten Island to New York; he presented our government with a
      steamship worth a million of dollars, and died worth fifty million. &#34;There
      is no royal road to learning,&#34; says the proverb, and I may say it is
      equally true, &#34;there is no royal road to wealth.&#34; But I think there is a
      royal road to both. The road to learning is a royal one; the road that
      enables the student to expand his intellect and add every day to his stock
      of knowledge, until, in the pleasant process of intellectual growth, he is
      able to solve the most profound problems, to count the stars, to analyze
      every atom of the globe, and to measure the firmament this is a regal
      highway, and it is the only road worth traveling.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in regard to wealth. Go on in confidence, study the rules, and above
      all things, study human nature; for &#34;the proper study of mankind is man,&#34;
      and you will find that while expanding the intellect and the muscles, your
      enlarged experience will enable you every day to accumulate more and more
      principal, which will increase itself by interest and otherwise, until you
      arrive at a state of independence. You will find, as a general thing, that
      the poor boys get rich and the rich boys get poor. For instance, a rich
      man at his decease, leaves a large estate to his family. His eldest sons,
      who have helped him earn his fortune, know by experience the value of
      money; and they take their inheritance and add to it. The separate
      portions of the young children are placed at interest, and the little
      fellows are patted on the head, and told a dozen times a day, &#34;you are
      rich; you will never have to work, you can always have whatever you wish,
      for you were born with a golden spoon in your mouth.&#34; The young heir soon
      finds out what that means; he has the finest dresses and playthings; he is
      crammed with sugar candies and almost &#34;killed with kindness,&#34; and he
      passes from school to school, petted and flattered. He becomes arrogant
      and self-conceited, abuses his teachers, and carries everything with a
      high hand. He knows nothing of the real value of money, having never
      earned any; but he knows all about the &#34;golden spoon&#34; business. At
      college, he invites his poor fellow-students to his room, where he &#34;wines
      and dines&#34; them. He is cajoled and caressed, and called a glorious good
      follow, because he is so lavish of his money. He gives his game suppers,
      drives his fast horses, invites his chums to fetes and parties, determined
      to have lots of &#34;good times.&#34; He spends the night in frolics and
      debauchery, and leads off his companions with the familiar song, &#34;we won&#39;t
      go home till morning.&#34; He gets them to join him in pulling down signs,
      taking gates from their hinges and throwing them into back yards and
      horse-ponds. If the police arrest them, he knocks them down, is taken to
      the lockup, and joyfully foots the bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Ah! my boys,&#34; he cries, &#34;what is the use of being rich, if you can&#39;t
      enjoy yourself?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      He might more truly say, &#34;if you can&#39;t make a fool of yourself;&#34; but he is
      &#34;fast,&#34; hates slow things, and doesn&#39;t &#34;see it.&#34; Young men loaded down
      with other people&#39;s money are almost sure to lose all they inherit, and
      they acquire all sorts of bad habits which, in the majority of cases, ruin
      them in health, purse and character. In this country, one generation
      follows another, and the poor of to-day are rich in the next generation,
      or the third. Their experience leads them on, and they become rich, and
      they leave vast riches to their young children. These children, having
      been reared in luxury, are inexperienced and get poor; and after long
      experience another generation comes on and gathers up riches again in
      turn. And thus &#34;history repeats itself,&#34; and happy is he who by listening
      to the experience of others avoids the rocks and shoals on which so many
      have been wrecked.

      &#34;In England, the business makes the man.&#34; If a man in that country is a
      mechanic or working-man, he is not recognized as a gentleman. On the
      occasion of my first appearance before Queen Victoria, the Duke of
      Wellington asked me what sphere in life General Tom Thumb&#39;s parents were
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;His father is a carpenter,&#34; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Oh! I had heard he was a gentleman,&#34; was the response of His Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Republican country, the man makes the business. No matter whether
      he is a blacksmith, a shoemaker, a farmer, banker or lawyer, so long as
      his business is legitimate, he may be a gentleman. So any &#34;legitimate&#34;
      business is a double blessing it helps the man engaged in it, and also
      helps others. The Farmer supports his own family, but he also benefits the
      merchant or mechanic who needs the products of his farm. The tailor not
      only makes a living by his trade, but he also benefits the farmer, the
      clergyman and others who cannot make their own clothing. But all these
      classes often may be gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great ambition should be to excel all others engaged in the same
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The college-student who was about graduating, said to an old lawyer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;I have not yet decided which profession I will follow. Is your profession
      full?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;The basement is much crowded, but there is plenty of room up-stairs,&#34; was
      the witty and truthful reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      No profession, trade, or calling, is overcrowded in the upper story.
      Wherever you find the most honest and intelligent merchant or banker, or
      the best lawyer, the best doctor, the best clergyman, the best shoemaker,
      carpenter, or anything else, that man is most sought for, and has always
      enough to do. As a nation, Americans are too superficial—they are
      striving to get rich quickly, and do not generally do their business as
      substantially and thoroughly as they should, but whoever excels all others
      in his own line, if his habits are good and his integrity undoubted,
      cannot fail to secure abundant patronage, and the wealth that naturally
      follows. Let your motto then always be &#34;Excelsior,&#34; for by living up to it
      there is no such word as fail.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every man should make his son or daughter learn some useful trade or
      profession, so that in these days of changing fortunes of being rich
      to-day and poor tomorrow they may have something tangible to fall back
      upon. This provision might save many persons from misery, who by some
      unexpected turn of fortune have lost all their means.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      LET HOPE PREDOMINATE, BUT BE NOT TOO VISIONARY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many persons are always kept poor, because they are too visionary. Every
      project looks to them like certain success, and therefore they keep
      changing from one business to another, always in hot water, always &#34;under
      the harrow.&#34; The plan of &#34;counting the chickens before they are hatched&#34;
      is an error of ancient date, but it does not seem to improve by age.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      DO NOT SCATTER YOUR POWERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Engage in one kind of business only, and stick to it faithfully until you
      succeed, or until your experience shows that you should abandon it. A
      constant hammering on one nail will generally drive it home at last, so
      that it can be clinched. When a man&#39;s undivided attention is centered on
      one object, his mind will constantly be suggesting improvements of value,
      which would escape him if his brain was occupied by a dozen different
      subjects at once. Many a fortune has slipped through a man&#39;s fingers
      because he was engaged in too many occupations at a time. There is good
      sense in the old caution against having too many irons in the fire at
      once.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      BE SYSTEMATIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      Men should be systematic in their business. A person who does business by
      rule, having a time and place for everything, doing his work promptly,
      will accomplish twice as much and with half the trouble of him who does it
      carelessly and slipshod. By introducing system into all your transactions,
      doing one thing at a time, always meeting appointments with punctuality,
      you find leisure for pastime and recreation; whereas the man who only half
      does one thing, and then turns to something else, and half does that, will
      have his business at loose ends, and will never know when his day&#39;s work
      is done, for it never will be done. Of course, there is a limit to all
      these rules. We must try to preserve the happy medium, for there is such a
      thing as being too systematic. There are men and women, for instance, who
      put away things so carefully that they can never find them again. It is
      too much like the &#34;red tape&#34; formality at Washington, and Mr. Dickens&#39;
      &#34;Circumlocution Office,&#34;—all theory and no result.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the &#34;Astor House&#34; was first started in New York city, it was
      undoubtedly the best hotel in the country. The proprietors had learned a
      good deal in Europe regarding hotels, and the landlords were proud of the
      rigid system which pervaded every department of their great establishment.
      When twelve o&#39;clock at night had arrived, and there were a number of
      guests around, one of the proprietors would say, &#34;Touch that bell, John;&#34;
      and in two minutes sixty servants, with a water-bucket in each hand, would
      present themselves in the hall. &#34;This,&#34; said the landlord, addressing his
      guests, &#34;is our fire-bell; it will show you we are quite safe here; we do
      everything systematically.&#34; This was before the Croton water was
      introduced into the city. But they sometimes carried their system too far.
      On one occasion, when the hotel was thronged with guests, one of the
      waiters was suddenly indisposed, and although there were fifty waiters in
      the hotel, the landlord thought he must have his full complement, or his
      &#34;system&#34; would be interfered with. Just before dinner-time, he rushed down
      stairs and said, &#34;There must be another waiter, I am one waiter short,
      what can I do?&#34; He happened to see &#34;Boots,&#34; the Irishman. &#34;Pat,&#34; said he,
      &#34;wash your hands and face; take that white apron and come into the
      dining-room in five minutes.&#34; Presently Pat appeared as required, and the
      proprietor said: &#34;Now Pat, you must stand behind these two chairs, and
      wait on the gentlemen who will occupy them; did you ever act as a waiter?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;I know all about it, sure, but I never did it.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the Irish pilot, on one occasion when the captain, thinking he was
      considerably out of his course, asked, &#34;Are you certain you understand
      what you are doing?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat replied, &#34;Sure and I knows every rock in the channel.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment, &#34;bang&#34; thumped the vessel against a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Ah! be-jabers, and that is one of &#39;em,&#34; continued the pilot. But to
      return to the dining-room. &#34;Pat,&#34; said the landlord, &#34;here we do
      everything systematically. You must first give the gentlemen each a plate
      of soup, and when they finish that, ask them what they will have next.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat replied, &#34;Ah! an&#39; I understand parfectly the vartues of shystem.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon in came the guests. The plates of soup were placed before them.
      One of Pat&#39;s two gentlemen ate his soup; the other did not care for it. He
      said: &#34;Waiter, take this plate away and bring me some fish.&#34; Pat looked at
      the untasted plate of soup, and remembering the instructions of the
      landlord in regard to &#34;system,&#34; replied: &#34;Not till ye have ate yer supe!&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course that was carrying &#34;system&#34; entirely too far.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      READ THE NEWSPAPERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Always take a trustworthy newspaper, and thus keep thoroughly posted in
      regard to the transactions of the world. He who is without a newspaper is
      cut off from his species. In these days of telegraphs and steam, many
      important inventions and improvements in every branch of trade are being
      made, and he who don&#39;t consult the newspapers will soon find himself and
      his business left out in the cold.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      BEWARE OF &#34;OUTSIDE OPERATIONS&#34;
    </h2>
    <p>
      We sometimes see men who have obtained fortunes, suddenly become poor. In
      many cases, this arises from intemperance, and often from gaming, and
      other bad habits. Frequently it occurs because a man has been engaged in
      &#34;outside operations,&#34; of some sort. When he gets rich in his legitimate
      business, he is told of a grand speculation where he can make a score of
      thousands. He is constantly flattered by his friends, who tell him that he
      is born lucky, that everything he touches turns into gold. Now if he
      forgets that his economical habits, his rectitude of conduct and a
      personal attention to a business which he understood, caused his success
      in life, he will listen to the siren voices. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;I will put in twenty thousand dollars. I have been lucky, and my good
      luck will soon bring me back sixty thousand dollars.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days elapse and it is discovered he must put in ten thousand dollars
      more: soon after he is told &#34;it is all right,&#34; but certain matters not
      foreseen, require an advance of twenty thousand dollars more, which will
      bring him a rich harvest; but before the time comes around to realize, the
      bubble bursts, he loses all he is possessed of, and then he learns what he
      ought to have known at the first, that however successful a man may be in
      his own business, if he turns from that and engages ill a business which
      he don&#39;t understand, he is like Samson when shorn of his locks his
      strength has departed, and he becomes like other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a man has plenty of money, he ought to invest something in everything
      that appears to promise success, and that will probably benefit mankind;
      but let the sums thus invested be moderate in amount, and never let a man
      foolishly jeopardize a fortune that he has earned in a legitimate way, by
      investing it in things in which he has had no experience.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      DON&#39;T INDORSE WITHOUT SECURITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      I hold that no man ought ever to indorse a note or become security, for
      any man, be it his father or brother, to a greater extent than he can
      afford to lose and care nothing about, without taking good security. Here
      is a man that is worth twenty thousand dollars; he is doing a thriving
      manufacturing or mercantile trade; you are retired and living on your
      money; he comes to you and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;You are aware that I am worth twenty thousand dollars, and don&#39;t owe a
      dollar; if I had five thousand dollars in cash, I could purchase a
      particular lot of goods and double my money in a couple of months; will
      you indorse my note for that amount?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      You reflect that he is worth twenty thousand dollars, and you incur no
      risk by endorsing his note; you like to accommodate him, and you lend your
      name without taking the precaution of getting security. Shortly after, he
      shows you the note with your endorsement canceled, and tells you, probably
      truly, &#34;that he made the profit that he expected by the operation,&#34; you
      reflect that you have done a good action, and the thought makes you feel
      happy. By and by, the same thing occurs again and you do it again; you
      have already fixed the impression in your mind that it is perfectly safe
      to indorse his notes without security.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the trouble is, this man is getting money too easily. He has only to
      take your note to the bank, get it discounted and take the cash. He gets
      money for the time being without effort; without inconvenience to himself.
      Now mark the result. He sees a chance for speculation outside of his
      business. A temporary investment of only $10,000 is required. It is sure
      to come back before a note at the bank would be due. He places a note for
      that amount before you. You sign it almost mechanically. Being firmly
      convinced that your friend is responsible and trustworthy; you indorse his
      notes as a &#34;matter of course.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the speculation does not come to a head quite so soon as was
      expected, and another $10,000 note must be discounted to take up the last
      one when due. Before this note matures the speculation has proved an utter
      failure and all the money is lost. Does the loser tell his friend, the
      endorser, that he has lost half of his fortune? Not at all. He don&#39;t even
      mention that he has speculated at all. But he has got excited; the spirit
      of speculation has seized him; he sees others making large sums in this
      way (we seldom hear of the losers), and, like other speculators, he &#34;looks
      for his money where he loses it.&#34; He tries again. endorsing notes has
      become chronic with you, and at every loss he gets your signature for
      whatever amount he wants. Finally you discover your friend has lost all of
      his property and all of yours. You are overwhelmed with astonishment and
      grief, and you say &#34;it is a hard thing; my friend here has ruined me,&#34;
      but, you should add, &#34;I have also ruined him.&#34; If you had said in the
      first place, &#34;I will accommodate you, but I never indorse without taking
      ample security,&#34; he could not have gone beyond the length of his tether,
      and he would never have been tempted away from his legitimate business. It
      is a very dangerous thing, therefore, at any time, to let people get
      possession of money too easily; it tempts them to hazardous speculations,
      if nothing more. Solomon truly said &#34;he that hateth suretiship is sure.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      So with the young man starting in business; let him understand the value
      of money by earning it. When he does understand its value, then grease the
      wheels a little in helping him to start business, but remember, men who
      get money with too great facility cannot usually succeed. You must get the
      first dollars by hard knocks, and at some sacrifice, in order to
      appreciate the value of those dollars.

    <h2>
      ADVERTISE YOUR BUSINESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      We all depend, more or less, upon the public for our support. We all trade
      with the public—lawyers, doctors, shoemakers, artists, blacksmiths,
      showmen, opera stagers, railroad presidents, and college professors. Those
      who deal with the public must be careful that their goods are valuable;
      that they are genuine, and will give satisfaction. When you get an article
      which you know is going to please your customers, and that when they have
      tried it, they will feel they have got their money&#39;s worth, then let the
      fact be known that you have got it. Be careful to advertise it in some
      shape or other because it is evident that if a man has ever so good an
      article for sale, and nobody knows it, it will bring him no return. In a
      country like this, where nearly everybody reads, and where newspapers are
      issued and circulated in editions of five thousand to two hundred
      thousand, it would be very unwise if this channel was not taken advantage
      of to reach the public in advertising. A newspaper goes into the family,
      and is read by wife and children, as well as the head of the home; hence
      hundreds and thousands of people may read your advertisement, while you
      are attending to your routine business. Many, perhaps, read it while you
      are asleep. The whole philosophy of life is, first &#34;sow,&#34; then &#34;reap.&#34;
      That is the way the farmer does; he plants his potatoes and corn, and sows
      his grain, and then goes about something else, and the time comes when he
      reaps. But he never reaps first and sows afterwards. This principle
      applies to all kinds of business, and to nothing more eminently than to
      advertising. If a man has a genuine article, there is no way in which he
      can reap more advantageously than by &#34;sowing&#34; to the public in this way.
      He must, of course, have a really good article, and one which will please
      his customers; anything spurious will not succeed permanently because the
      public is wiser than many imagine. Men and women are selfish, and we all
      prefer purchasing where we can get the most for our money and we try to
      find out where we can most surely do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may advertise a spurious article, and induce many people to call and
      buy it once, but they will denounce you as an impostor and swindler, and
      your business will gradually die out and leave you poor. This is right.
      Few people can safely depend upon chance custom. You all need to have your
      customers return and purchase again. A man said to me, &#34;I have tried
      advertising and did not succeed; yet I have a good article.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, &#34;My friend, there may be exceptions to a general rule. But how
      do you advertise?&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;I put it in a weekly newspaper three times, and paid a dollar and a half
      for it.&#34; I replied: &#34;Sir, advertising is like learning—&#39;a little is
      a dangerous thing!&#39;&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      A French writer says that &#34;The reader of a newspaper does not see the
      first mention of an ordinary advertisement; the second insertion he sees,
      but does not read; the third insertion he reads; the fourth insertion, he
      looks at the price; the fifth insertion, he speaks of it to his wife; the
      sixth insertion, he is ready to purchase, and the seventh insertion, he
      purchases.&#34; Your object in advertising is to make the public understand
      what you have got to sell, and if you have not the pluck to keep
      advertising, until you have imparted that information, all the money you
      have spent is lost. You are like the fellow who told the gentleman if he
      would give him ten cents it would save him a dollar. &#34;How can I help you
      so much with so small a sum?&#34; asked the gentleman in surprise. &#34;I started
      out this morning (hiccuped the fellow) with the full determination to get
      drunk, and I have spent my only dollar to accomplish the object, and it
      has not quite done it. Ten cents worth more of whiskey would just do it,
      and in this manner I should save the dollar already expended.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      So a man who advertises at all must keep it up until the public know who
      and what he is, and what his business is, or else the money invested in
      advertising is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some men have a peculiar genius for writing a striking advertisement, one
      that will arrest the attention of the reader at first sight. This fact, of
      course, gives the advertiser a great advantage. Sometimes a man makes
      himself popular by an unique sign or a curious display in his window,
      recently I observed a swing sign extending over the sidewalk in front of a
      store, on which was the inscription in plain letters,
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      &#34;DON&#39;T READ THE OTHER SIDE&#34;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course I did, and so did everybody else, and I learned that the man had
      made all independence by first attracting the public to his business in
      that way and then using his customers well afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genin, the hatter, bought the first Jenny Lind ticket at auction for two
      hundred and twenty-five dollars, because he knew it would be a good
      advertisement for him. &#34;Who is the bidder?&#34; said the auctioneer, as he
      knocked down that ticket at Castle Garden. &#34;Genin, the hatter,&#34; was the
      response. Here were thousands of people from the Fifth avenue, and from
      distant cities in the highest stations in life. &#34;Who is &#39;Genin,&#39; the
      hatter?&#34; they exclaimed. They had never heard of him before. The next
      morning the newspapers and telegraph had circulated the facts from Maine
      to Texas, and from five to ten millions off people had read that the
      tickets sold at auction For Jenny Lind&#39;s first concert amounted to about
      twenty thousand dollars, and that a single ticket was sold at two hundred
      and twenty-five dollars, to &#34;Genin, the hatter.&#34; Men throughout the
      country involuntarily took off their hats to see if they had a &#34;Genin&#34; hat
      on their heads. At a town in Iowa it was found that in the crowd around
      the post office, there was one man who had a &#34;Genin&#34; hat, and he showed it
      in triumph, although it was worn out and not worth two cents. &#34;Why,&#34; one
      man exclaimed, &#34;you have a real &#39;Genin&#39; hat; what a lucky fellow you are.&#34;
      Another man said, &#34;Hang on to that hat, it will be a valuable heir-loom in
      your family.&#34; Still another man in the crowd who seemed to envy the
      possessor of this good fortune, said, &#34;Come, give us all a chance; put it
      up at auction!&#34; He did so, and it was sold as a keepsake for nine dollars
      and fifty cents! What was the consequence to Mr. Genin? He sold ten
      thousand extra hats per annum, the first six years. Nine-tenths of the
      purchasers bought of him, probably, out of curiosity, and many of them,
      finding that he gave them an equivalent for their money, became his
      regular customers. This novel advertisement first struck their attention,
      and then, as he made a good article, they came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I don&#39;t say that everybody should advertise as Mr. Genin did. But I
      say if a man has got goods for sale, and he don&#39;t advertise them in some
      way, the chances are that some day the sheriff will do it for him. Nor do
      I say that everybody must advertise in a newspaper, or indeed use
      &#34;printers&#39; ink&#34; at all. On the contrary, although that article is
      indispensable in the majority of cases, yet doctors and clergymen, and
      sometimes lawyers and some others, can more effectually reach the public
      in some other manner. But it is obvious, they must be known in some way,
      else how could they be supported?
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      BE POLITE AND KIND TO YOUR CUSTOMERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Politeness and civility are the best capital ever invested in business.
      Large stores, gilt signs, flaming advertisements, will all prove
      unavailing if you or your employees treat your patrons abruptly. The truth
      is, the more kind and liberal a man is, the more generous will be the
      patronage bestowed upon him. &#34;Like begets like.&#34; The man who gives the
      greatest amount of goods of a corresponding quality for the least sum
      (still reserving for himself a profit) will generally succeed best in the
      long run. This brings us to the golden rule, &#34;As ye would that men should
      do to you, do ye also to them&#34; and they will do better by you than if you
      always treated them as if you wanted to get the most you could out of them
      for the least return. Men who drive sharp bargains with their customers,
      acting as if they never expected to see them again, will not be mistaken.
      They will never see them again as customers. People don&#39;t like to pay and
      get kicked also.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the ushers in my Museum once told me he intended to whip a man who
      was in the lecture-room as soon as he came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;What for?&#34; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Because he said I was no gentleman,&#34; replied the usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Never mind,&#34; I replied, &#34;he pays for that, and you will not convince him
      you are a gentleman by whipping him. I cannot afford to lose a customer.
      If you whip him, he will never visit the Museum again, and he will induce
      friends to go with him to other places of amusement instead of this, and
      thus you see, I should be a serious loser.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;But he insulted me,&#34; muttered the usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#34;Exactly,&#34; I replied, &#34;and if he owned the Museum, and you had paid him
      for the privilege of visiting it, and he had then insulted you, there
      might be some reason in your resenting it, but in this instance he is the
      man who pays, while we receive, and you must, therefore, put up with his
      bad manners.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      My usher laughingly remarked, that this was undoubtedly the true policy;
      but he added that he should not object to an increase of salary if he was
      expected to be abused in order to promote my interest.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      BE CHARITABLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course men should be charitable, because it is a duty and a pleasure.
      But even as a matter of policy, if you possess no higher incentive, you
      will find that the liberal man will command patronage, while the sordid,
      uncharitable miser will be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon says: &#34;There is that scattereth and yet increaseth; and there is
      that withholdeth more than meet, but it tendeth to poverty.&#34; Of course the
      only true charity is that which is from the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best kind of charity is to help those who are willing to help
      themselves. Promiscuous almsgiving, without inquiring into the worthiness
      of the applicant, is bad in every sense. But to search out and quietly
      assist those who are struggling for themselves, is the kind that
      &#34;scattereth and yet increaseth.&#34; But don&#39;t fall into the idea that some
      persons practice, of giving a prayer instead of a potato, and a
      benediction instead of bread, to the hungry. It is easier to make
      Christians with full stomachs than empty.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      DON&#39;T BLAB
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some men have a foolish habit of telling their business secrets. If they
      make money they like to tell their neighbors how it was done. Nothing is
      gained by this, and ofttimes much is lost. Say nothing about your profits,
      your hopes, your expectations, your intentions. And this should apply to
      letters as well as to conversation. Goethe makes Mephistophilles say:
      &#34;Never write a letter nor destroy one.&#34; Business men must write letters,
      but they should be careful what they put in them. If you are losing money,
      be specially cautious and not tell of it, or you will lose your
      reputation.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
      PRESERVE YOUR INTEGRITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is more precious than diamonds or rubies. The old miser said to his
      sons: &#34;Get money; get it honestly if you can, but get money:&#34; This advice
      was not only atrociously wicked, but it was the very essence of stupidity:
      It was as much as to say, &#34;if you find it difficult to obtain money
      honestly, you can easily get it dishonestly. Get it in that way.&#34; Poor
      fool! Not to know that the most difficult thing in life is to make money
      dishonestly! Not to know that our prisons are full of men who attempted to
      follow this advice; not to understand that no man can be dishonest,
      without soon being found out, and that when his lack of principle is
      discovered, nearly every avenue to success is closed against him forever.
      The public very properly shun all whose integrity is doubted. No matter
      how polite and pleasant and accommodating a man may be, none of us dare to
      deal with him if we suspect &#34;false weights and measures.&#34; Strict honesty,
      not only lies at the foundation of all success in life (financially), but
      in every other respect. Uncompromising integrity of character is
      invaluable. It secures to its possessor a peace and joy which cannot be
      attained without it—which no amount of money, or houses and lands
      can purchase. A man who is known to be strictly honest, may be ever so
      poor, but he has the purses of all the community at his disposal—for
      all know that if he promises to return what he borrows, he will never
      disappoint them. As a mere matter of selfishness, therefore, if a man had
      no higher motive for being honest, all will find that the maxim of Dr.
      Franklin can never fail to be true, that &#34;honesty is the best policy.&#34;
    </p>
    <p>
      To get rich, is not always equivalent to being successful. &#34;There are many
      rich poor men,&#34; while there are many others, honest and devout men and
      women, who have never possessed so much money as some rich persons
      squander in a week, but who are nevertheless really richer and happier
      than any man can ever be while he is a transgressor of the higher laws of
      his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inordinate love of money, no doubt, may be and is &#34;the root of all
      evil,&#34; but money itself, when properly used, is not only a &#34;handy thing to
      have in the house,&#34; but affords the gratification of blessing our race by
      enabling its possessor to enlarge the scope of human happiness and human
      influence. The desire for wealth is nearly universal, and none can say it
      is not laudable, provided the possessor of it accepts its
      responsibilities, and uses it as a friend to humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of money-getting, which is commerce, is a history of
      civilization, and wherever trade has flourished most, there, too, have art
      and science produced the noblest fruits. In fact, as a general thing,
      money-getters are the benefactors of our race. To them, in a great
      measure, are we indebted for our institutions of learning and of art, our
      academies, colleges and churches. It is no argument against the desire
      for, or the possession of wealth, to say that there are sometimes misers
      who hoard money only for the sake of hoarding and who have no higher
      aspiration than to grasp everything which comes within their reach. As we
      have sometimes hypocrites in religion, and demagogues in politics, so
      there are occasionally misers among money-getters. These, however, are
      only exceptions to the general rule. But when, in this country, we find
      such a nuisance and stumbling block as a miser, we remember with gratitude
      that in America we have no laws of primogeniture, and that in the due
      course of nature the time will come when the hoarded dust will be
      scattered for the benefit of mankind. To all men and women, therefore, do
      I conscientiously say, make money honestly, and not otherwise, for
      Shakespeare has truly said, &#34;He that wants money, means, and content, is
      without three good friends.&#34;

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&#34;Defects,&#34; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
