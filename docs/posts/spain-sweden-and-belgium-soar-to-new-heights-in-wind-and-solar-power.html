    <h1>Spain, Sweden, and Belgium Soar to New Heights in Wind and Solar Power</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>A renewable revolution</b> is taking place in Spain, Sweden, and Belgium, as these European countries set new records in wind and solar energy production.</p><p><b>Why it matters:</b> This groundbreaking shift towards cleaner energy highlights the effectiveness of renewable energy policies, underscoring the need for continued investment and innovation in these sustainable sources.</p><p><b>Spain&#39;s soaring success</b> has seen its solar generation reach an all-time high in April, with 4.2 TWh accounting for 22% of electricity generation <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/05/18/lightning-pace-portugal-produces-over-50-of-electricity-from-wind-and-solar-for-first-time?ref=nexlumina.com">according to Euronews</a>. Furthermore, wind and solar combined formed 46% of Spain&#39;s electricity production.</p><p><b>Sweden&#39;s renewable rise</b> reached an all-time high in February, with 27% of electricity generated from wind and solar. Neighboring Finland saw a record 29% of generation from these renewable sources in April.</p><p><b>Belgium&#39;s breakthrough</b> last month also saw clean energy sources, including wind and solar, achieve 2 TWh and comprise 29% of its electricity production, setting a new all-time high.</p><p><b>Key Data Points:</b></p><ul><li>Spain&#39;s all-time high solar generation in April: 4.2 TWh (22% of electricity generation)</li><li>Wind and solar combined in Spain: 46% of electricity production</li><li>Sweden&#39;s all-time high in February: 27% of electricity from wind and solar</li><li>Finland&#39;s record in April: 29% of generation from wind and solar</li><li>Belgium&#39;s all-time high for wind and solar: 2 TWh (29% of electricity generation)</li></ul><p>As these European countries continue to break records in wind and solar energy production, their commitment to renewable energy transitions sets an example for other nations.
