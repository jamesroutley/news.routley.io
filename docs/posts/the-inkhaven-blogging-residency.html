                            <blockquote>
                                &#34;Whenever I see a new person who blogs every day, it&#39;s very rare that that never goes anywhere or they don&#39;t get good. That&#39;s like my best leading indicator for who&#39;s going to be a good blogger.&#34;
                                
                            </blockquote>
                            
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    If you want to be excellent at something, it&#39;s extremely useful to do it every day. Athletes, musicians, and writers famously live by this advice. Separately, one of the world&#39;s strongest motivators is to be surrounded by ambitious, like-minded people.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the month of November, we&#39;re running a residency for talented writers to hone their craft by writing and <b>publishing a blogpost every single day</b>. We provide food and housing at-cost, so that you can focus on writing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We&#39;ll offer whatever we can to improve the writing experience and help the resident writers grow stronger. In fact, we&#39;ve interviewed many successful writers about what&#39;s helped them, and we&#39;ll aim to offer many of the things they described, through mentorship opportunities from celebrated writers, craft-honing workshops, and professional feedback. But all that will be optional. <b>Your commitments are simply to be here and write.</b>
                                </p>

                                    Note: In the quote above, Scott Alexander makes an observation about a correlation he has observed. With this program we will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodharting</a> on that correlation. Hopefully increasing the leading variable will produce more of the lagging variable, but of course, perhaps it will merely bring the correlation to zero.

                                    We&#39;d love to have excellent writers and/or relevant professionals contribute to Inkhaven.
                                </p>

                                    <li>Perhaps you&#39;re a professional in an area closely related to writing – an editor, a writing coach, a person who has helped run writers&#39; workshops or retreats in the past – and you&#39;re available for some part of November for paid work.</li>
                                    <li>Perhaps you&#39;re a successful writer and you&#39;d like to spend time in the Inkhaven environment, get some writing done yourself, and help the residents with feedback on their writing, or teach a class.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    If you&#39;d like to contribute to Inkhaven in some way, express interest with the link below, and we&#39;ll get back to you!
