    <h1>Google Chrome U2F API decommission: What the change means</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With advancement often comes change. Some changes are exciting, like providing new features and broader support, while other changes can be a minimal bump in the road or, in extreme cases, cause adverse effects on end users. With Yubico’s commitment to keeping our customers updated on the latest in changes to security protocols, we wanted to be sure you are aware that Chrome has deprecated the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) API, and will be removing it entirely with the Chrome v. 98 update in February 2022. </p>



<p>If your organization is currently utilizing U2F in your product or web-based service, with some planning and simple code updates, you’ll continue to be able to provide user continuity and get your services switched to the WebAuthn API in Chrome, all while maintaining compatibility with existing YubiKeys. If you’re impacted by this change, and want to learn more, read below for details on how  to mitigate this issue. Additionally, please <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/15793/529952?utm_source=Yubico&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=529952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register</a> for our February 22nd webinar where we will dive deep into this topic in an interactive WebAuthn session.</p>



<p><strong>What does this mean, and how will it affect my users?</strong></p>



<p>The important aspect to note is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/authentication-standards/fido-u2f/">U2F</a> means two things in Chrome: it is an authentication protocol as well as an API. The forthcoming update means only the U2F API is being deprecated and that  <strong>authentication with the U2F protocol will continue to be supported with the </strong><a href="https://www.yubico.com/authentication-standards/webauthn/"><strong>WebAuthn</strong></a><strong> API</strong>. </p>



<p>The original way of implementing U2F with Chrome was through the U2F API. Since that time, the WebAuthn protocol has been adopted. These two protocols might not look related, but U2F is the precursor to WebAuthn. The WebAuthn spec was designed with backward compatibility in mind so that U2F will work with WebAuthn.<br/></p>



<p>The U2F API depreciation means that services will need to migrate to the WebAuthn API to continue supporting phishing-resistant, multi-factor authentication (MFA) with the YubiKey on their services. Furthermore,  adopting the WebAuthn API will increase the number of places that a user can utilize their YubiKey as it is supported by other major browsers such as Safari and Edge.</p>



<p>In November 2021, with Chrome version 95, users on services that implemented the Chrome U2F API began seeing a warning that the service they are using is using the U2F API that is being deprecated by Chrome.</p>

<p><strong>When is the update happening?</strong></p>



<p>The U2F API will be fully deprecated and removed with Chrome v. 98, which is scheduled for release this month (February 2022). At that time, the U2F API will stop working, however there are options for time extensions which we have listed below</p>



<p>If unaddressed, this change will cause different errors for the end user depending on how errors are being handled by the service and the end user will be prevented from authenticating to the service using their U2F devices. </p>



<p>For more details, Google has outlined the Chrome versions and timeline <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/deps-rems-95/#deprecate-u2f-api-crypto%20token">here</a>.  </p>



<p><strong>How do I migrate?</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned previously, the WebAuthn API is backward compatible with U2F credentials. To migrate, there are a few steps that service owners need to take to ensure their users can continue to use existing U2F credentials.</p>



<p><strong>What if I need more time?</strong></p>



<p><strong>If you need more time to migrate, there are a few ways of getting an extension for your service to continue using the U2F API until July 2022 through Google</strong>. Options are to enroll in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/-6366963973195038719">deprecation trial</a> or be an enterprise that has turned on <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#U2fSecurityKeyApiEnabled">U2fSecurityKeyApiEnabled</a>.</p>
