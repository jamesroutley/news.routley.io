    <h1>IKEA made a smart air quality sensor to track indoor pollution</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IKEA already has a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-starkvind-smart-air-purifier-table-080021160.html" data-ylk="cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">side table that doubles as an air purifier</a>, but now it has a way to gauge just how clean that air really is. The home store has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://about.ikea.com/en/newsroom/2023/02/14/ikea-launches-vindstyrka-a-smart-sensor-to-measure-indoor-air-quality" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">introduced</a> a smart indoor air quality sensor, the Vindstyrka, that gauges particulate matter levels (those smaller than 2.5 micrometers), humidity, temperature and the load of gaseous pollutants. Ideally, you&#39;ll know if your cleaning or cooking habits are making you sick.</p>
<p>Vindstyrka works by itself, but it unsurprisingly becomes more useful when connected to IKEA&#39;s <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-unveils-the-dirigera-matter-ready-hub-and-new-smart-home-app-132535402.html" data-ylk="cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">Dirigera smart home hub</a>. You can check air quality through the company&#39;s app, and have the monitor control other devices. It can tell a Starkvind purifier to ramp up the fan speed based on particulate levels, for instance.</p>
<p>IKEA plans to release Vindstyrka in all its markets starting in April. The company hasn&#39;t revealed pricing as we write this, but the feature set suggests it will be more affordable than high-end air quality monitors (such as Airthings&#39; $299 View Plus) that also track CO2, radon and air pressure. It may be a viable option if the temperature and humidity sensors <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html" data-ylk="cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">built into your smart speaker</a> aren&#39;t enough.</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
