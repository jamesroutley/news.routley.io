  <p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C. </strong>— Today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously to dramatically limit the rates that prison telecoms charge for phone and video calls from prisons and jails. The new order more than halves the per-minute rate caps for all prison and jail phone calls across the country. It also establishes interim per-minute rate caps for video calls, marking the first time the FCC has set rules for prison communication beyond phone calls. Finally, it prohibits all fees, including deposit fees. <strong>Worth Rises estimates that the new rules will impact 83% of incarcerated people (about 1.4 million) and save impacted families at least $500 million annually. </strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Improves the well-being and reentry success of incarcerated people who will have more access to their support systems</p></li><li><p>Increases the the financial stability of millions of Americans with incarcerated loved ones and strengthens their families</p></li><li><p>Reins in and right-sizes the prison telecom industry that has preyed on incarcerated people and their loved ones for decades</p></li><li><p>Reverses the mass surveillance project that correctional agencies and their industry partners have expanded rapidly in recent years</p></li></ul>
