    <h1>3TOFU: Verifying Unsigned Releases</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This article introduces the concept of &#34;3TOFU&#34; -- a harm-reduction process when downloading software that cannot be verified cryptographically.</p>

<blockquote><p>
⚠ NOTE: This article is about harm reduction.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to download and run binaries (or code) whose authenticity you cannot verify (using a cryptographic signature from a key stored offline). However, sometimes we cannot avoid it. If you&#39;re going to proceed with running untrusted code, then following the steps outlined in this guide may reduce your risk.

<p>TOFU stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use">Trust On First Use</a>. It&#39;s a (<a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/238912/213165">often abused</a>) concept of downloading a person or org&#39;s signing key and just blindly trusting it (instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">verifying it</a>).</p>
<h2>3TOFU</h2>
<p>3TOFU is a process where a user downloads something three times at three different locations. If-and-only-if all three downloads are identical, then you trust it.</p>

<div id="attachment_3658"><p><a href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/3tofu_deepcrack1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3658" decoding="async" src="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/x3tofu_deepcrack1.jpg.pagespeed.ic.pydobQcA0l.jpg" alt="Photo of Paul Kocher holding a very large circuit board" width="328" height="248" srcset="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/x3tofu_deepcrack1.jpg.pagespeed.ic.pydobQcA0l.jpg 328w, https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/x3tofu_deepcrack1-300x227.jpg.pagespeed.ic.DL8sCuRvlL.jpg 300w, https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/x3tofu_deepcrack1-150x113.jpg.pagespeed.ic.3Qh7dcRyKK.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3658">The EFF&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker">Deep Crack</a> proved DES to be insecure and pushed a switch to 3DES.</p></div>
<p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">Crypto Wars</a> of the 1990s, it was illegal to export cryptography from the United States. In 1996, after intense public pressure and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States">legal challenges</a>, the government officially permitted export with the 56-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">DES cipher</a> -- which was a known-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard#Chronology">vulnerable</a> cipher.</p>
<p>But there was a simple way to use insecure DES to make secure messages: <strong>just use it three times</strong>.</p>
<p>3DES (aka &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES">Triple DES</a>&#34;) is the process encrypting a message using the insecure symmetric block cipher (DES) three times on each block, to produce an actually secure message (from known attacks at the time).</p>
<p>3TOFU (aka &#34;Triple TOFU&#34;) is the process of downloading a payload using the insecure method (TOFU) three times, to obtain the payload that&#39;s magnitudes less likely to be maliciously altered.</p>

<p>To best mitigate targeted attacks, 3TOFU should be done:</p>
<ol>
<li>On <strong>three distinct days</strong></li>
<li>On <strong>three distinct machines</strong> (or VMs)</li>
<li>Exiting from <strong>three distinct countries</strong></li>
<li>Exiting using <strong>three distinct networks</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, I&#39;ll usually execute</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TOFU #1/3</strong> in TAILS (via <strong>Tor</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>TOFU #2/3</strong> in a Debian VM (via <strong>VPN</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>TOFU #3/3</strong> on my daily laptop (via <strong>ISP</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The possibility of an attacker maliciously modifying something you download over your ISP&#39;s network are quite high, depending on which country you live-in.</p>
<p>The possibility of an attacker maliciously modifying something you download onto a VM with a freshly installed OS over an encrypted VPN connection (routed internationally and exiting from another country) is much less likely, but still possible -- especially for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">well-funded adversary</a>.</p>
<p>The possibility of an attacker maliciously modifying something you download onto a VM running a hardened OS (like <a href="https://www.whonix.org/">Whonix</a> or <a href="https://tails.net/">TAILS</a>) using a hardened browser (like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a>) over an anonymizing network (like Tor) is quite unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>The possibility for someone to execute a network attack on all three downloads is very near-zero</strong> -- especially if the downloads were spread-out over days or weeks.</p>
<h2>3TOFU bash Script</h2>
<p>I provide the following bash script as an example snippet that I run for each of the 3TOFUs.</p>

<p>The TOFU output above shows that the release signing key from the TAILS project is a 4096-bit RSA key with a full fingerprint of &#34;<code>A490 D0F4 D311 A415 3E2B  B7CA DBB8 02B2 58AC D84F</code>&#34;. The key file itself has a sha256 hash of &#34;<code>8c641252767dc8815d3453e540142ea143498f8fbd76850066dc134445b3e532</code>&#34;.</p>
<p>When doing a 3TOFU, save the output of each execution. After collecting output from all 3 executions (intentionally spread-out over 3 days or more), diff the output.</p>
<p>If the output of all three TOFUs match, then the confidence of the file&#39;s authenticity is very high.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many developers think that hosting their releases on a server with https is sufficient to protect their users from obtaining a maliciously-modified release. But https won&#39;t protect you if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your DNS or publishing infrastructure is compromised (<a href="https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/main/supply-chain-security/compromises">it happens</a>), or</li>
<li>An attacker has just one (subordinate) CA in the user&#39;s PKI root store (<a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/234052/where-can-i-find-a-list-of-all-government-agencies-with-cas-in-pki-root-stores">it happens</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking, publishing infrastructure compromises are detected and resolved within days and MITM attacks using compromised CAs are targeted attacks (to avoid detection). Therefore, a 3TOFU verification should thwart these types of attacks.</p>
<blockquote><p>
⚠ Note on hashes: Unfortunately, many well-meaning developers erroneously think that cryptographic hashes provide authenticity, but cryptographic hashes do not provide authenticity -- they provide integrity. </p>
<p>Integrity checks are useful to detect corrupted data on-download; it does not protect you from maliciously altered data unless those hashes are cryptographically signed with a key whose private key isn&#39;t stored on the publishing infrastructure.
</p></blockquote>

<p>There are some things you can do to further improve the confidence of the authenticity of a file you download from the internet.</p>
<div id="attachment_3143"><p><a href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/03/tails-logo-square-inverted.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3143" decoding="async" src="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/03/xtails-logo-square-inverted.png.pagespeed.ic.CyNCbvYFAk.png" alt="TAILS Logo" width="250"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3143"><a href="https://tails.net/">TAILS</a> is by far the best OS to use for security-critical situations.</p></div>
<h2>Distinct Domains</h2>
<p>If possible, download your payload from as many distinct domains as possible.</p>
<p>An adversary may successfully compromise the publishing infrastructure of a software project, but it&#39;s far less likely for them to compromise the project website (eg &#39;<code>tails.net</code>&#39;) <em>and</em> their forge (eg &#39;<code>github.com</code>&#39;) <em>and</em> their mastodon instance (eg &#39;<code>mastodon.social</code>&#39;).</p>
<h2>Use TAILS</h2>
<p>If you are a high-risk target (investigative journalist, activist, or political dissident) then you should definitely use <a href="https://tails.net/">TAILS</a> for one of your TOFUs.</p>
<h2>Signature Verification</h2>
<p>It&#39;s always better to verify the authenticity of a file using cryptographic signatures than with 3TOFU.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some companies like <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1623134/how-to-cryptographically-verify-the-authenticity-and-integrity-of-microsoft-wind">Microsoft don&#39;t sign their releases</a>, so the only option to verify the authenticity of something like a Windows <code>.iso</code> is with 3TOFU.</p>
<p>Still, whenever you encounter some software that is not signed using an offline key, please do us all a favor and <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/761">create a bug report</a> asking the <a href="https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/issues/5750">developer to sign</a> their releases with PGP (or minisign or signify or <em>something</em>).</p>
<h2>4TOFU</h2>
<p>3TOFU is easy because <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor is free</a> and most people have access to a VPN (corporate or <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/vpn/">commercial</a> or an <a href="https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/2015/05/31/tor-vpn-in-tails-to-bypass-tor-blocking/">ssh socks proxy</a>).</p>
<p>But, if you&#39;d like, you could also add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">i2p</a> or some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_circumvention#Software">other proxy network</a> into the mix (and do 4TOFU).</p>
