                    You can captivate someone not by what you say, but by how
                    you listen.
                </p>

                <!-- <hr /> -->

                <p>
                    A long time ago, I had a conversation with my girlfriend.
                    <q>How was your day?</q>

                    <q>Not great, my group has an assignment due next week and
                        someone hasn&#39;t even started their part.</q>

                    Normally, I would respond in one of two ways:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>1. Talk about myself</strong>
                    <q>That sucks, last semester I had to do a group
                        assignment. I hated it. One guy had no idea what he was
                        doing while another one was ...</q>

                    Humans are wired to be egocentric. When we hear something
                    related to a past experience, it triggers memories and
                    associations — which we then want to talk about. Shifting
                    the attention from her to me. This is my default state when
                    I&#39;m not focused. I&#39;m not really listening. I&#39;m just waiting
                    for my turn to speak.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>2. Try to fix them</strong>
                    <q>Have you tried asking the lecturer if you can get
                        marked just for your section? Or if that person can be
                        removed from the group?</q>

                    I give advice, but I&#39;m still not really listening. I hear a
                    problem and reflexively throw out weak solutions. Problems
                    she brings up in conversation are hard to solve — otherwise
                    she wouldn&#39;t bother. Anything I suggest after hearing only a
                    couple of sentences has probably already been considered.
                    This response also assumes she wants advice. Often, she
                    doesn&#39;t. She just wants someone to listen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a third approach I accidentally stumbled upon
                    <mark>that would captivate her. It wasn&#39;t from telling a
                        grand story or giving some profound insight into her
                        problems. It&#39;s just from trying to better understand
                        her.</mark>
                    It looks something like:
                    <q>That sucks. What&#39;s your relationship like with that
                        person?</q>
                </p>

                <hr/>

                <h2>How to</h2>

                <h3>Pre-conversation</h3>

                <p>
                    At the end of a day, right before I saw her, a flood of
                    things I wanted to tell her would rush into my head. How my
                    day went, some funny video I found on YouTube, plans for the
                    weekend... The same things would be going through her head.
                    The result is two people primed to talk, not to listen. So,
                    just before I saw her,
                    <mark>instead of thinking about what I want to say, I would
                        think how I&#39;m going to listen.</mark>
                </p>

                <h3>Focused listening</h3>

                <p>
                    When listening to understand,
                    <mark>I&#39;m attempting to fully comprehend what she intends to
                        say — which could be different than what she actually
                        says.</mark>
                    This is because it&#39;s hard to move everything from your head
                    into someone else&#39;s. Often, the talker needs help from the
                    listener.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I would start by giving my undivided attention. I made this
                    easier by turning off my phone, positioning my
                    <a href="https://talk.bradwoods.io/blog/body-language/">body language</a>
                    towards her and made a conscious effort to have consistent
                    eye contact. This did two things: cue my mind to focus and
                    communicate she has my full attention — encouraging her to
                    talk more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That focus allowed me to perceive more than I would from
                    passive listening. I wouldn&#39;t just hear her words but the
                    way she said them and how her body language changed. Along
                    with the facts, I would feel the emotion behind them.
                </p>

                <p>I ignore the usual thoughts that come into my head:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>how I would respond to her situation,</li>
                    <li>passing judgement,</li>
                    <li>becoming defensive if we had opposing opinions and</li>
                    <li>
                        calling out her contradictions — people are rarely
                        consistent and I&#39;m no different.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Understanding doesn&#39;t require any of these.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It&#39;s counter-productive to interrupt her but if something
                    was confusing or hard to hear, I would to get clarification.
                    Better that than letting her continue after I miss something
                    important. All of this isn&#39;t easy. It requires a lot of
                    energy. But, like a muscle, gets stronger with practice.
                </p>

                <h3>Prompts &amp; Questions</h3>

                <p>
                    There is so much under the surface of what people say.
                    <q>Not great, my group has an assignment due next week and
                        someone hasn&#39;t even started their part.</q>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Why haven&#39;t they started?</li>
                    <li>Has anyone talked to them about it?</li>
                    <li>How much is the assignment worth?</li>
                    <li>Is the rest of the group worried?</li>
                    <li>Is there a plan?</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I use prompts and open questions to dig into her experience.
                    Aiming to collect more than just the facts, but also her
                    thoughts and feelings:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <q>Tell me more about ...</q>
                    </li>
                    <li><q>How did that make you feel?</q></li>
                    <li><q>What did you think when ...</q></li>
                    <li><q>Why do you think it&#39;s happening?</q></li>
                    <li><q>What have you done?</q></li>
                    <li><q>What are you going to do?</q></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Paraphrasing</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout the conversation, I put her words into my own
                    with cues like:
                    <q>Are you saying...</q>
                    <q>It sounds like...</q>
                    I don&#39;t paraphrase everything — just what I think the
                    intended message is. For example, if she expressed
                    desperation when she said <em>next week</em>, I would
                    paraphrase:
                    <q>It sounds like you won&#39;t finish by the due date.</q>
                    However, if her face showed anger when she said
                    <em>someone</em>, I would say:
                    <q>Are you saying this person is relying on everyone else
                        to do their work?</q>
                </p>

                <p>Paraphrasing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>confirms my understanding,</li>
                    <li>
                        gives her an opportunity to clarify what I misunderstood
                        or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        gives her an opportunity to give more detail on an
                        important point.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It&#39;s also a sign I&#39;m listening — motivating her to keep
                    talking.
                </p>

                <hr/>

                <h2>Value</h2>

                <p>
                    Earlier I mentioned giving advice isn&#39;t a good idea.
                    Listening to understand provides a way to help while
                    avoiding it. Have you ever been to a lecture, understood
                    everything, then attempted to solve a problem based on the
                    content and been unable? It&#39;s because thoughts are
                    deceptive. They give the illusion you know more than you do.
                    It&#39;s only when you process thoughts, through solving a
                    problem, writing or talking, does what you think you know
                    reduce to what you actually know. Listening to understand
                    provides a space for her to talk though her thoughts. To
                    reflect, think critically and solve her own problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I provide a space just for her, not myself. When I
                    listen without trying to <em>fix</em> her, the way she
                    looked and talked to me changed. She feels safe to drop her
                    defences and share everything she&#39;s thinking and feeling. To
                    be herself.
                    <mark>It gave her an opportunity to be heard in a way I don&#39;t
                        think she experienced before — and craved ever
                        since.</mark>
                    It gave us both a feeling of
                    <a href="https://talk.bradwoods.io/blog/connect/">connection</a>.
