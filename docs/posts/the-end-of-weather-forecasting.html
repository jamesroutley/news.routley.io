<p>Got a heads up on this from a senior scientist who emailed today:</p>



<p><em>“If this happens, weather forecasting as we know it will end.”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/03/doge-noaa-weather-building-leases-trump" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/03/doge-noaa-weather-building-leases-trump">Axios:</a></p>



<p>The Trump administration has informed NOAA that two pivotal centers for <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/02/major-storm-severe-outbreak-weather-service-layoffs">weather forecasting</a>will soon have their leases canceled, sources told Axios. </p>



<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>One of the buildings is the nerve center for generating national weather forecasts. </p>



<ul>
<li>It was designed to integrate multiple forecasting centers in one building to improve operating efficiency. It houses telecommunications equipment to send weather data and forecasts across the U.S. and abroad.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>The NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction is on the lease cancellation list, according to a NOAA employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. </p>



<ul>
<li>Two ex-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials also confirmed the list.</li>



<li>The building houses the National Weather Service’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction, or NCEP, which includes the Environmental Modeling Center. It <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/wrn/1pgr_NCWCP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened in 2012</a>and has about 268,000 square feet of space.</li>



<li>The modeling center runs the computer models used in day-to-day weather forecasting, and ensures that weather data correctly goes into these models and that they are operating correctly. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The lease cancellation</strong> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622990/trump-doge-government-layoffs-doge-weather-forecasts-noaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported by The Verge</a>. The National Weather Service didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>



<ul>
<li>The NOAA employee told Axios the cancellations — along with recent layoffs, early retirements, and travel and hiring limitations — point to an effort to dismantle the agency.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/doge-department-of-government-efficiency">Department of Government Efficiency</a> (DOGE) has been working through the General Services Administration to cancel government leases of office space.</p>



<ul>
<li>The NOAA employee told Axios a nightmare scenario could unfold if the College Park building was shuttered, but the agency still was tasked with the same missions as at present.</li>



<li>In that case, NOAA would have to somehow replicate its functionality somewhere else in a process that could take a year or more and leave critical forecasting gaps.</li>



<li>It would also require new congressional appropriations to get that done.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>The cancellation notice for the College Park facility isn’t final, as a spreadsheet detailing all the properties on the cancellation list has an end date of “TBD” for that building, according to the NOAA staff member.</p>
