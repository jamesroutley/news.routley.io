  <h3>Why change?</h3>

 <p>In Spring 2020, <a href="https://slint-ui.com#founders">we</a> started SixtyFPS
 to create a new GUI framework for Desktop and Embedded devices.</p>
 <p>In almost two years we&#39;ve made thirteen releases, won many users, built a community of contributors, signed a few customers, and collected 3k GitHub Stars ü§£.</p>

 <p>We chose the name SixtyFPS because we wanted to convey our goal of achieving fluid animations always. This is commonly associated
 with a refresh rate of 60 frames per second.</p>

 <p>Many onlookers take this name literally: Whenever our project shows
 up on social media, we get comments about our name: that it appears outdated considering that
 nowadays screens often run at higher refresh rates.</p>

 <p>We considered changing the name and decided to discuss this in the open source community to collect ideas.
 We opened a <a href="https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/sixtyfps/discussions/636">discussion on GitHub</a> and received many
 great suggestions.</p>

 <p><a href="https://github.com/karoofish">@karoofish</a> suggested <code>slant</code>, which became the highest voted suggestion
 and we liked it a lot. We ran this with some friends, including some native speakers, and some suggested that it can have a slightly
 negative meaning in some context. All we needed was a little iteration.</p>

 <p>Our new name derives from <em><b>S</b>traightforward, <b>Li</b>ghtweight, <b>N</b>ative <b>T</b>oolkit</em>,
 which are our design goals. <em>Slint</em>.</p>

 <p>A huge thank you to everybody who got involved, especially @karoofish!</p>

 <h3>What&#39;s Slint?</h3>
 <p>For those who have never heard of <s>SixtyFPS</s> Slint before, it&#39;s a GUI toolkit implemented
 in the Rust programming language.</p>

 <p>At its core is the declarative Slint mark-up language, which represents the entire user interface.
 The Slint language took some inspiration from Qt&#39;s QML. This was natural,
 since we were coming from that ecosystem. We decided to build it with strong typing from the ground up, a
 designer-friendly unit system and full tooling support. Write the user interface
 in Slint markup and the business logic in a &#34;real&#34; programming language.</p>

 <p>You can use Slint with different programming languages, like Rust, C++, and JavaScript. We&#39;ve designed our APIs for those languages
 to be intuitive and idiomatic, not just some automatically generated bindings. We&#39;ve designed the toolkit so that we can add Python, Go
 or other languages to the mix.</p>

 <p>Our own compiler parses the Slint language and compiles straight to native Rust or C++ code, with
 native performance and efficient memory layout. You can also load <code>.slint</code> files dynamically at run-time
 with our run-time interpreter.</p>

 <p>Our tooling includes a Language Server Protocol implementation that integrates into various IDEs and editors. It
 provides auto completion, semantic syntax-highlighting, and a cool live-preview, as demonstrated in the following
 video clip.</p>

 <h3>Slint version 0.2.0</h3>

 <p>The purpose of the 0.2.0 release is to reflect this name change.</p>

 <p>We also took the opportunity to make some important changes to our API, that we&#39;ve
 collected since the 0.1.0 release last year thanks to your feedback.</p>

 <p>
Here&#39;s how you can upgrade your application:
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Make sure that you meet our updated tooling requirements: Rust 1.56 or later. If you&#39;re using C++, a compiler that supports C++ 20.</li>
   <li>If you&#39;re using Rust, change your <code>Cargo.toml</code> to depend on <code>slint</code> instead of <code>sixtyfps</code>. If you&#39;re using C++, change your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> to find the <code>Slint</code> package and link against the <code>Slint::Slint</code> target.</li>
   <li>In your application code, rename all occurrences of the <code>sixtyfps</code> module/namespace with <code>slint</code>. For API changes, see our <a href="https://slint-ui.com/docs/rust/slint/docs/migration/index.html">Rust</a> (+ <a href="https://slint-ui.com/docs/rust/slint_interpreter/migration/index.html">Interpreter</a>) and <a href="https://slint-ui.com/docs/cpp/cpp_migration.html">C++</a> migration guides.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>In this release we also threw in a new feature:
 You can now integrate custom OpenGL code before or after the rendering of a Slint scene.
 The new <a href="https://slint-ui.com/demos/opengl_underlay">OpenGL Underlay example</a> shows
 how to do that in Rust and C++.</p>

 <h3>New website and design</h3>

 <p>You may have noticed that the location of our website, the design, and the logo have changed. We took the opportunity to refresh our branding, with help from <a href="https://benediktwisbauer.cargo.site">Benedikt Wisbauer</a>. We also moved the organization on GitHub.

 </p><p>You can find our new GitHub repository here: <a href="https://github.com/slint-ui/slint">github.com/slint-ui/slint</a>.</p>

 <p>We hope that you can connect with our new name, branding, and our latest release. üöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
