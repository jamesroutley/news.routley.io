    <h1>Muse 2.0 - Tool for Thought on iPad and Mac</h1>

        <h3>The principles behind Muse</h3>
        <p>Muse is your creative sanctuary for thinking work. Use it to push yourself mentally and emotionally as far as you can go to find a pure, original, fresh result that is yours and yours alone.</p>
        <p>To that end, here are some principles we used in designing Muse as a tool purpose-built for thinking.</p>
        <p><strong>Thinking is messy.</strong> Embrace the non-linear chaos of creativity. Don’t force labels, organization, or structure too early.</p>
        <p><strong>Ideas come from other ideas.</strong> Breakthroughs come from discovering new connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information.</p>
        <p><strong>Ideas love a sanctuary.</strong> Creativity is an act of vulnerability. Deep thinking needs a dedicated space that gives you confidence to express half-formed ideas, without fear of mistakes or judgement.</p>
        <p><strong>Thinking and productivity need different tools.</strong> Thinking tools should be purpose-built for their role as pioneers in the creative process, with the ability to seamlessly hand off content to production tools when the time comes.
        </p><p><strong>Tap the information firehose, but keep it at a distance.</strong> A thinking tool should help you take advantage of social media, email, and the web — without drowning out your own voice and original ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>People think best away from their desks.</strong> Reading in a relaxed posture in your armchair, sketching in a notebook in your favorite cafe, taking a long walk in the park — these are where some of our best ideas and freshest thinking emerge.</p>
