Introduction    This is the first in a 4-part series on HTAP (Hybrid Transaction and Analytical Processing) databases. By now you know I am nuts about concurrency and its use in OSs, DBs, calculations and everything in between. I will cover a few weaknesses and strengths in these DB systems, some notable implemementations in production systems and then write some fake version of Pluscal to describe what I think it should look like in an abstract code implementation. Note I use math as its the most powerful language I know and pluscal as its the best tool for describing these types of systems where concurrency is everywhere. So lets begin with a drawing of the Primary-row store with an in-memory column store .            Please note this diagram is adapted from the paper &#34;HTAP databases: A Survey&#34;, by Zhang et al. 2024. The contents of this blog are inspired by insights from this brilliant paper as well. However I will not go into the depth that the paper provides. The reader ...

 The present post is about Caches and the Buffer Pool Manager for a database named SparrowDB  that I am building. The programming language is Rust. The DB is a SQL relational database I wish to take from scratch to distributed. If you wish to come along for the ride, I will post weekly on my thoughts, struggles and completed work. Disclaimer: A lot of what I know and some parts of this blog comes from lessons by Andy Pavlo from CMU who made a youtube course, and I highly recommend you learn from him if you desire to work with database internals.    Cache Policies :       There are several types of caches we could consider eg. course-grained and fine-grained, but we will only consider the former category. Furthermore we will only use LRU-K in this project, but I wish to give an honourable mention to frequency based cache policies such as Q2 and LFU. The LRU-K is an improvement on the LRU policy as it avoids thrashing in the database cache where we evict a page only to read it again in t...

Introduction    This is the second in a 4-part series on HTAP (Hybrid Transaction and Analytical Processing) databases. In the previous blog post ( link opens in separate window ) in this series I described the architecture known as &#34;Primary-row store with an in-memory column store&#34;  and discussed a simple design of such a system and the concurrency that would be required when designing it. I will now describe a separate system architecture for HTAP known as &#34;Distributed row store with a replicated column store&#34; , see the image below for the architecture. This blog will cover weaknesses and strengths in this architecture, some notable implemementations in production systems and some pseudocode model in fake Pluscal to describe what I think it should look like. Again this is my mental model, you are encouraged to make your own and mine is purposely high level. As an aside, Pluscal is a math based language for describing concurrent systems. I use it as its more genera...
