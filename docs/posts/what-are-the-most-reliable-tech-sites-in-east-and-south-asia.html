    <h1>Ask HN: What are the most reliable tech sites in east and south Asia?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Almost all of my tech news comes via HN, SubStack, Twitter and Reddit, but  they only occasionally cite blogs or reports from China, Japan, South Korea or India - countries where a significant proportion of technology is built, designed, or supported from.</p><p>While there is a lot of tech news related to what is going on in those countries (often for the wrong reasons), itâ€™s hard to gage what the tech ecosystem is up to without knowing where to look.</p><p>Language barriers aside (which are becoming less of an issue anyway), where would one go for reliable and direct news around semiconductor developments in Taiwan, or the weird products that emerge out of Shenzhen through AliExpress?</p><p>Is there an HN of India? Or Indonesia?</p></div></div></div>
