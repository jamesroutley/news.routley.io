<p>The generative AI legal tech startup <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/">Harvey</a><span> has raised $21 million in a Series A funding round led by Sequoia Capital. </span></p>
<p><span>When I first </span><a href="https://www.lawnext.com/2022/11/stealth-legal-ai-startup-harvey-raises-5m-in-round-led-by-openai.html">wrote about Harvey in November</a><span>, the previously stealth startup had just emerged with news that it had raised $5 million in funding led by the startup fund of OpenAI, the company that is the developer of the GPT AI technology. </span></p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global">Allen &amp; Overy</a><span>, one of the world’s largest law firms, </span><a href="https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/ao-announces-exclusive-launch-partnership-with-harvey">announced</a><span> that it had integrated Harvey </span><span>into its global practice, where it would be used by more than 3,500 lawyers across 43 offices operating in multiple languages.</span></p>
<p>Then, in March, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-announces-strategic-alliance-with-harvey-positioning-pwcs-legal-business-solutions-at-the-forefront-of-legal-generative-ai.html">PwC announced a global partnership</a> with Harvey, providing PwC’s Legal Business Solutions professionals exclusive access among the Big 4 to Harvey’s platform.</p>
<p>Now, Sequoia has confirmed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sequoia-funding-round-legal-generative-artificial-intelligence-startup-harvey-2023-4">previous reports</a> that it has led a $21 million round of funding for Harvey, all while the product has yet to become commercially available except by invitation.</p>
<p>“Harvey is the first and best instantiation of a new breed of company: the AI super app,” Sequoia partners <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a> wrote <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-harvey-putting-llms-to-work/">on Sequoia’s website</a>. “Harvey is in the business of giving people superpowers. First, lawyers. Next, professional services. Eventually, all of knowledge work.”</p>
<p><span>Harvey was founded last year by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/winston-weinberg/">Winston Weinberg</a><span>, formerly an associate at law firm O’Melveny &amp; Myers, and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabepereyra/">Gabriel Pereyra</a><span>, formerly a research scientist at DeepMind and a machine learning engineer at Meta AI, and claims to have been the first company built on top of GPT-4. </span></p>
<p>“We at Sequoia are delighted to be in business with Gabe, Winston and the entire team at Harvey,” Grady and Curnin wrote. “We look forward to helping them unlock the power of LLMs at work and, in doing so, usher in a new era of superhuman productivity.”</p>
