<p>From the moon landing to the James Webb Space Telescope and many other
scientific missions, software is critical for the US <a href="https://www.nasa.gov">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>
(NASA). Sharing information has also been in the DNA of the space
agency from the beginning. As a result, NASA also contributes to and
releases open-source software and open data. In a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/nasa/">keynote</a> at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/">FOSDEM 2023</a>, 
Science Data Officer Steve Crawford talked about NASA and
open-source software, including the challenges NASA has faced in using open
source and the 
agency&#39;s recent initiatives to lower 
barriers. 
</p>

<p>Software has always been a big part of NASA&#39;s work. Who hasn&#39;t seen the
<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/320/margaret-hamilton/">photo
of computer scientist Margaret Hamilton</a> next to a hard-copy stack of
the Apollo software she and her team at MIT produced? The stack of
code is as tall as she is. In 2016, the original <a href="https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11">Apollo 11 Guidance Computer
source code</a> for the command and lunar modules was published on GitHub
in the public domain. You can even compile the code and <a href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc">run it in a simulator</a>. 
</p>

<p>Sharing its discoveries has also always been a part of NASA&#39;s heritage,
Crawford 
emphasized. He showed section 203(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space
Act of 1958, which created NASA.  It states that the agency shall &#34;provide for
the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information
concerning its activities and the results thereof&#34;. 
</p>

<h4>From open development to spin-offs</h4>

<p>In recent years, more and more of this sharing was also in the form of
releasing software. For instance, when NASA&#39;s drone copter Ingenuity made
it first flight on Mars in 2021 as part of the Perseverance mission, it
used an open-source flight-control framework, <a href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime">F Prime</a>. NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) released the framework in 2017 under the Apache 2.0
license. One of the example deployments even runs on the Raspberry Pi. But
the NASA mission also used a lot of open-source dependencies. To celebrate
Ingenuity&#39;s first flight, GitHub recognized the more than 12,000 people who
contributed to these dependencies <a href="https://github.com/readme/featured/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter">with a
badge on their profile</a>. 
</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Another high-profile mission that Crawford talked about is the James
Webb Space Telescope, launched in December 2021. It&#39;s a collaboration with
the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and
the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990. Its <a href="https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst">calibration software</a> is
developed openly on GitHub, enabling scientists to test their projects. The
software library is developed in Python and makes use of <a href="https://www.astropy.org">Astropy</a>, which handles common
astronomy tasks, such as converting between different coordinate systems
and reading and writing files with astronomical data. NASA not only uses
open-source projects in F Prime and the James Webb  
Space Telescope&#39;s calibration software, but in a lot of other projects 
too.  Some of those projects can be seen in Crawford&#39;s slide above.
</p>

<p>Crawford listed a lot of other open-source software NASA has released in
its long history, calling it &#34;just a small sampling&#34;. He also noted that
some of these projects became spin-offs. For instance, in 2008 NASA <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2012/it_2.html">started a project
called Project Nebula</a> to standardize its web sites. It then evolved into
something that was addressing more general needs. This caused NASA to join
forces with Rackspace to create the open-source cloud-computing
infrastructure project <a href="https://www.openstack.org">OpenStack</a>,
which is currently managed by the non-profit OpenStack Foundation. 
</p>

<h4>Astronomical challenges</h4>

<p>While the previous examples may be some high-profile successes,
open source at NASA doesn&#39;t come without its challenges. &#34;Civil servants
can&#39;t release anything copyrightable&#34;, Crawford said, referring to the fact
that under US copyright law, a work prepared by an officer or employee of
the United States Government as part of that person&#39;s official duties is in
the public domain. 
</p>

<p>Of course NASA has contributed to many open-source projects, but
according to Crawford people often do this &#34;not in their official capacity
as NASA employees&#34;. In 2003 NASA created a license to enable the release of
software by civil servants, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Open_Source_Agreement">NASA Open
Source Agreement</a>. This <a href="https://opensource.org/license/nasa1-3-php/">license 
has been approved by the
Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI), but the Free Software Foundation <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#NASA">doesn&#39;t consider
it a free-software license</a> because it does not allow changes to the
code that come from third-party free-software projects. &#34;It isn&#39;t widely
used in the community and 
complicates the reuse of NASA software with this license&#34;, Crawford said. 
</p>

<p>Another challenge is NASA&#39;s famous bureaucracy, Crawford admitted: &#34;NASA
does not always engage well with the open-source community.&#34; As an example,
he showed how curl&#39;s main developer Daniel Stenberg <a href="https://twitter.com/bagder/status/1379897937141063686">received an
email</a> from NASA&#39;s Commercial IT Acquisition Team, asking him to supply
country of origin information for curl, as well as a list of all
&#34;authorized resellers&#34;.  Stenberg <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/02/07/closing-the-nasa-loop/">noted</a>
the keynote (which he barely missed attending) in a recent blog post.
</p>

<h4>Lowering barriers for open-source software</h4>

<p>There are some initiatives brewing at NASA that should make these
challenges a thing of the past, though. In his talk, Crawford presented
NASA&#39;s <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview">Open-Source
Science Initiative</a> (OSSI). Its goal is to support scientists to help them
integrate open-science principles into the entire research workflow. Just a
few weeks before Crawford&#39;s talk, NASA&#39;s Science Mission Directorate
published its <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy">new
policy on scientific information</a>. 
</p>

<p>Crawford summarized this policy with &#34;as open as possible, as restricted
as necessary, always secure&#34;, and he made this more concrete: &#34;Publications
should be made openly available with no embargo period, including research
data and software. Data should be released with a Creative Commons Zero
license, and software with a commonly used permissive license, such as
Apache, BSD, or MIT. The new policy also encourages using and contributing
to open-source software.&#34; Crawford added that NASA&#39;s policies will be
updated to make it clear that employees can contribute to open-source
projects in their official capacity. 
</p>

<p>This new policy should lower the barriers between open-source software
and NASA. Funding for external open-source projects has already improved:
in 2021-2022 NASA 
selected 16 proposals 
to support 22 different open-source projects financially. This included the
Python projects <a href="https://numpy.org">NumPy</a> (used by Astropy), <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>, and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>, as well as the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> programming language. 
</p>

<p>As part of its Open-Source Science Initiative, NASA has started its
five-year <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science">Transform
to Open Science (TOPS) mission</a>. This is a $40-million mission to speed
up adoption of open-science practices; it starts with the White House and
all major US federal agencies, including NASA, declaring 2023 as the &#34;<a href="https://open.science.gov">Year of Open Science</a>&#34;. One of NASA&#39;s
strategic goals with TOPS is to enable five major scientific discoveries
through open-science principles, Crawford said. 
</p>

<h4>Keep contributing</h4>

<p>Open-source software will clearly play an important role in open
science, and was already instrumental in various breakthrough
discoveries. When scientists created the first image of a black hole in 2019 from data generated by the Event Horizon Telescope, Dr. Katie Bouman
who led the development of the imaging algorithm <a href="https://numfocus.org/case-studies/first-photograph-black-hole">was
explicit about it</a>: &#34;We&#39;re deeply grateful to all the open source
contributors who made our work possible.&#34; This was also the message
Crawford ended his talk with: &#34;Keep contributing, building, and sustaining
your code.&#34; After his &#34;Thank you for your contributions&#34;, his words were
followed by big applause from a room full of open-source developers.
