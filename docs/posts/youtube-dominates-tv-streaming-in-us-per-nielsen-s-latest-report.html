				<p id="speakable-summary">Nielsen today <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2024/colder-weather-and-nfl-playoffs-drive-increased-tv-usage-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its January report on viewing usage across linear TV and streaming, which revealed that YouTube is once again the overall top streaming service in the U.S., with 8.6% of viewing on television screens. Netflix, meanwhile, saw 7.9% of TV usage. The new data points to YouTube’s dominance in the TV streaming arena and marks 12 consecutive months of the platform being in the top spot.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-number-one-streamer-nielsen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> celebrating the achievement, the Google-owned streaming service announced that viewers now watch a daily average of over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on their televisions, which could indicate that there’s a preference for user-generated videos among U.S. consumers rather than traditional TV shows. <a href="https://www.inmobi.com/company/press/gen-z-significantly-prefers-user-generated-content-older-millennials-lean-toward-streaming-inmobi-insights-survey-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sixty-one percent</a> of Gen Z reported that they favor user-generated content over other content formats.</p>
<p>Plus, creators are seeing an increase in viewership come from TVs. According to the company, the number of top YouTubers that receive the most watch time on TVs has sky-rocketed by more than 400%. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hopescope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HopeScope</a>, a creator who reviews viral products, notably saw a 172% jump in TV watch time in 2023. This could be good news for family-friendly YouTubers who have to compete with TikTok for kids’ attention. Children ages 4 through 18 spent a global average of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/kids-spent-60-more-time-on-tiktok-than-youtube-last-year-20-tried-openais-chatgpt/">112 minutes daily</a> on TikTok in 2023, per a recent study.</p>
<p>Although YouTube may have precedence in the living room, TikTok continues to dominate on mobile devices. The short-form video app recently began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/tiktok-testing-30-minute-uploads-inch-into-youtubes-territory/">testing</a> the ability for TikTokers to upload 30-minute videos, which could step on YouTube’s toes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/tiktok-launches-a-reimagined-app-for-the-apple-vision-pro/">TikTok</a> also entered the spatial reality space, launching a native app on the Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/youtube-and-other-apps-missing-from-apple-vision-pro-launch/">YouTube</a> decided to not build a dedicated app for the device.</p>
<p>YouTube has reached a few other milestones in recent months, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/google-says-youtube-now-has-over-100-million-subscribers/">100 million users</a> who pay for YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. Additionally, <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube TV</a> now has more than 8 million subscribers and YouTube Shorts recently achieved over 70 billion daily views.</p>
