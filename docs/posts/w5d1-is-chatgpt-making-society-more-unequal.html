    <h1>W5D1 - Is ChatGPT making society more unequal?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_2083531">
    
      <div><p>Every now and again I re-read Tyler Cowen&#39;s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/are-computers-making-society-more-unequal">interview</a> in the New Yorker titled &#34;Are computers making society more unequal?&#34;, in particular this quote.</p><blockquote><p>You’ll need to be really good at judging, and being dispassionate, and you’ll have to have a sense of what computers can and cannot do. It’s about working with the machine: knowing when to hold back, when to intervene.</p></blockquote><p>I had the chance to listen to him on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JZtPE8LU-4">podcast</a> How Do You Use ChatGPT. In particular, he mentioned how ChatGPT will be egalitarian at the start, say by writing good college essays for everyone. Over time, however, leverage will flow to those best able to start projects and allocate resources. Hence the title of this post.</p></div>
