    <p>So last month, I totally forgot how the alphabet worked and thought the next letter after I was K. It&#39;s not, apparently. </p>
<p>Anyway, let me just warn you, while this is technically a scheme post, ummm... well, let&#39;s go into it.</p>

<p>When you don&#39;t know what to do... phone a friend?</p>

#</a>The story</h2>
<p>This month, I started a new job (yay!) and it is going amazing. There is one main thing that I&#39;m struggling with, though, and that is managing my time and energy. It&#39;s something that I struggled with a lot at Recurse as well. </p>
<p>Both environments are very flexible, in that there are no enforced hours. There are no specific times I should be at my desk to work. I am more or less doing 9-5 -- every now and then there are meetings between 5 and 7. Those are usually planned in advance, and I&#39;m not expected to work more hours on those days, but rather, to compensate those hours elsewhere. That&#39;s obviously great. </p>
<p>But recently, I&#39;ve found myself doing stuff like scheduling doctors&#39; appointments, biking there when I could have taken public transportation had I planned my time better, forgetting breakfast and lunch, and then feeling exhausted, but also kind of crappy when I can&#39;t also manage an amount of work that I feel is satisfactory.</p>
<p>I also have had trouble getting myself to eat food in appropriate quantities and at appropriate times (let&#39;s not even talk about the quality of the food), and given myself massive headaches. Even outside of work, I&#39;ve struggled with evaluating how much energy a day is going to take out of me, and often ended the day completely exhausted.</p>
<p>I do some stuff to plan and organize my time - bullet journaling, for instance, has been a huge help in 2022, and I think I will write about it before the end of the year. I think I am better at managing my energy now than I have been at other points in the past, mainly because now at least I am aware of it. But I need a better franework.</p>

#</a>My plan</h2>
<p>This is my &#34;scheme&#34; for the month of J, to get better at managing my energy: asking you all for your own schemes and experiences. </p>
<p>Have you found ways to manage your energy better? Please send them to me. I&#39;m so serious. I&#39;ll listen to anything, no matter how small. Even if it&#39;s not something I can personally apply, I&#39;ll be grateful.</p>

#</a>PS</h2>
<p>This is totally not a cop-out for not having a scheme blog post planned out this month... Or maybe it is, but I&#39;m still being 100% sincere. Plus, the reason I didn&#39;t have one is because of what I described, so it kind of works, I think. And also, like I&#39;ve said before, this is my blog, so whatever, boom. </p>
<p>Anyway. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Please reach me at ornella dot friggit at protonmail dot com or at the usual social medias, even if we don&#39;t know each other personally. Thank you!!!</p>
