    <h1>Embracer Games Archive is preserving 75000 video games and needs contributions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div> <p>For us at Embracer Games Archive, games are an important part of our shared history. Games are works of art that have influenced and inspired people and culture over the past decades. Our ambition is to be a small part of the greater work being done to preserve gaming history through our archive of physical games.</p> <p>The inspiration for the archive originated from Embracer&#39;s CEO, Lars Wingefors, a seasoned professional in the gaming industry and a private collector himself. As both the game collection and the Embracer Group expanded, the concept emerged to establish an archive that would imbue the games within the collection with a more profound significance.</p> <p>Being a patron of video games history, the goal of the archive is to be a part of the community that preserves and documents games history by collaborating with institutions, grass root movements, journalists, researchers, publishers and studios â€“ not only for the Embracer group but for the whole industry. By doing so we promote and help build the heritage of games which is something that will benefit the entire games industry in the long run..</p> </div> </div></div>
