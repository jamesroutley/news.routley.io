Nearly 400 miles from London, rain-lashed, more deer than people: All the reasons not to move there were the reasons George Orwell moved there. Directions to houseguests ran several paragraphs and could include a plane, trains, taxis, a ferry, another ferry, then miles and miles on foot down a decrepit, often impassable rural lane. It’s safe to say the man wanted to get away. From what?</p><div data-flatplan-ignore="true"><section data-event-module="magazine promo"><div><h2>Explore the May 2024 Issue</h2><p>Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.</p></div><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2024/05/" target="_blank" data-action="click button - magazine promo" data-label="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2024/05/" data-event-element="view more">View More</a></section></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Orwell himself could be sentimental about his longing to escape (“Thinking always of my island in the Hebrides,” he’d once written in his wartime diary) or wonderfully blunt. In the aftermath of Hiroshima, he wrote to a friend:</p><div><blockquote>This stupid war is coming off in abt 10–20 years, &amp; this country will be blown off the map whatever else happens. The only hope is to have a home with a few animals in some place not worth a bomb.</blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It helps also to remember Orwell’s immediate state of mind when he finally fully moved to Jura, in May 1946. Four months before Hiroshima, his wife, Eileen, had died; shortly after the atomic bomb was dropped, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780451526342"><i>Animal Farm</i></a> was published.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1947/03/the-prevention-of-literature/655342/">From the March 1947 issue: George Orwell’s ‘The Prevention of Literature’</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Almost at once, in other words, Orwell became a widower, terrified by the coming postwar reality, and famous—the latter a condition he seems to have regarded as nothing but a bother. His newfound sense of dread was only adding to one he’d felt since 1943, when news of the Tehran Conference broke. The meeting had been ominous to Orwell: It placed in his head the idea of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin divvying up the postwar world, leading to a global triopoly of super-states. The man can be forgiven for pouring every ounce of his grief, self-pity, paranoia (literary lore had it that he thought Stalin might have an ice pick with his name on it), and embittered egoism into the predicament of his latest protagonist, Winston Smith.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Unsurprisingly, given that it culminated in both his masterpiece and his death, Orwell’s time on the island has been picked over by biographers, but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781913393779"><i>Orwell’s Island: George, Jura and </i>1984</a>, by Les Wilson, treats it as a subject worthy of stand-alone attention. The book is at odds with our sense of Orwell as an intrepid journalist. It is a portrait of a man jealously guarding his sense of himself as a creature elementally apart, even as he depicts the horrors of a world in which the human capacity for apartness is being hunted down and destroyed.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Wilson is a former political journalist, not a critic, who lives on neighboring Islay, famous for its whiskeys. He is at pains to show how Orwell, on Jura, overcame one of his laziest prejudices: The author went from taking every opportunity to laugh at the Scots for their “burns, braes, kilts, sporrans, claymores, bagpipes” (who is better at the derisive list than Orwell?) to complaining about the relative lack of Gaelic-language radio programming.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Scottish</i> had come to mean something more to him than kailyard kitsch. These were a people holding out against a fully amalgamated identity, beginning with the Kingdom of Great Britain and extending to modernity itself. On Jura at least, crofters and fishermen still lived at a village scale. As to whether Jura represented, as has been suggested, suicide by other means—Orwell was chronically ill, and Barnhill, his cottage, was 25 miles from the island’s one doctor—Wilson brushes this aside. In fact, he argues that Jura was “kinder to Orwell’s ravaged lungs than smog-smothered London,” where inhabitants were burning scavenged wood to stay warm.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At Barnhill, Orwell set up almost a society in miniature, devoting his 16-acre homestead to his ideal of self-sufficiency. Soon after moving there, he was joined by his sister, his 2-year-old adopted son, and a nanny. Amid the general, often biting, austerity of postwar Europe, they enjoyed a private cornucopia, subsisting on, as Wilson says, a diet of “fish, lobster, rabbit, venison and fresh milk and eggs,” and were often warmed by peat that Orwell himself had cut. He intended to live there for the rest of his life, raising his son and relishing an existence as a non-cog in a noncapitalist machine.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/1984-george-orwell/590638/">From the July 2019 issue: Doublethink is stronger than Orwell imagined</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">He lived without electricity or phone; shot rabbits “for the pot,” as Wilson says; raised geese to be slaughtered and plucked; and fished the surrounding waters in a dinghy. He fashioned a tobacco pouch from animal skin and a mustard spoon out of deer bone, and served his aghast guests a seaweed blancmange. Over time, absconding to Jura and writing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780451524935"><i>1984</i></a> became aspects of a single premonition: a coming world of perpetual engulfment by the forces of bigness. As Orwell’s latest biographer, D. J. Taylor, has pointed out in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781639364510"><i>Orwell: The New Life</i></a>, Orwell’s novels before <i>Animal Farm </i>followed a common template of a sensitive young person going up against a heartless society, destined to lose. Eileen is the one who helped him—either by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/08/16/orwell-animal-farm-wife-biography/">suggesting that <i>Animal Farm</i> be told as a fable</a> or by lightening his touch, depending on whom you talk to—find a newly engaging, even playful (in its way), register.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The loss of Eileen and return of the self-pitying Orwell alter ego are certainly linked. And indeed, in <i>1984</i> he produces his most Orwellian novel, in both senses—only now both protagonist and situation are presented in the absolute extreme<i> </i>: The young man is the bearer (if we believe his tormentor, O’Brien) of the last shred of human autonomy, in a society both totally corrupt and laying total claim to his being.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What this absolutism produced, of course, was not another fusty neo-Edwardian novel à la Orwell’s earlier <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781015176485"><i>Keep the Aspidistra Flying</i></a>, but a wild, aggrieved tour de force of dystopian erotica. Odd though it may sound, given the novel’s unremitting torments, <i>1984</i> quickly became a best seller, in no small part because its first readers, especially in America, found it comforting—a source of the release you might feel, in a darkened theater, when you remember that you yourself are not being chased by a man with a chain saw. The reader could glance up, notice no limitless police powers or kangaroo inquisitions, and say: <i>We</i> are not <i>them</i>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Such complacency is hard to come by in 2024. Thinking of Orwell, famous though he is for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1947/03/the-prevention-of-literature/655342/">his windowpane prose</a> and the prescience of his essays, as the ultimate sane human being is not so easy either. Rereading <i>1984</i> in light of the Jura episode suggests that Orwell was an altogether weirder person, and his last novel an altogether weirder book, than we’ve appreciated.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span>Conventionally speaking, </span><i>1984</i> is not a good novel; it couldn’t be. Novels are about the conflict between an individual’s inner-generated aims and a prevailing social reality that denies or thwarts them. <i>1984</i> is the depiction of the collapse of this paradigm—the collapse of inner and outer in all possible iterations. Of course its protagonist is thinly drawn: Winston’s self lacks a social landscape to give it dimensionality.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In place of anything like a novel proper, we get a would-be bildungsroman breaking through to the surface in disparate fragments. These scraps are Winston’s yearnings, memories, sensual instincts, which have, as yet, somehow gone unmurdered by the regime. The entire state-sponsored enterprise of Pavlovian sadism in Oceania is devoted to snuffing out this remnant interiority.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The facsimile of a life that Winston does enact comes courtesy of a series of private spaces—a derelict church, a clearing in the woods, a room above a junk shop—the last of which is revealed to have been a regime-staged contrivance. The inexorable momentum of the novel is toward the final such private space, Winston’s last line of defense, and the last line of defense in any totalitarian society: the hidden compartment of his mind.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When all else fails, there is the inaccessibility of human mentality to others, a black box in every respect. Uncoincidentally, Winston’s final defense—hiding out in his head—had been Orwell’s first. While he struggled on Jura to finish <i>1984</i>, Orwell apparently returned to “Such, Such Were the Joys,” his long and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/08/george-orwell-such-such-schooldays">excoriating essay</a> about his miserable years at St. Cyprian’s boarding school. He’d been sent there at the age of 8, one of the shabby-genteel boys with brains in what was otherwise a class snob’s paradise. He was a bed wetter to boot, for which, Orwell writes, he was brutally punished. No wonder he found dignity in apartness. Taylor’s biography is brilliant about the connection between Orwell’s childhood reminiscence and <i>1984</i>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In the essay, Orwell portrays his alma mater as an environment that invaded every cranny of its pupils’ lives. Against this, he formed his sense of bearing “at the middle of one’s heart,” as he writes, “an incorruptible inner self” holding out against an autocratic headmistress. As a cop in Burma, a scullion in Paris, an amateur ethnographer in northern England, he was a man who kept his own company, even when in company, and whom others, as a consequence, found by and large inscrutable.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What was this man’s genius, if not taking the petty anxieties of Eric Blair, his given name, and converting them into the moral clarity of George Orwell? Fearful that his own cherished apartness was being co-opted into nonexistence, he projected his fear for himself onto something he called the “autonomous individual,” who, as he said in his 1940 essay “Inside the Whale,” “is going to be stamped out of existence.” To this he added:</p><div><blockquote>The literature of liberalism is coming to an end and the literature of totalitarianism has not yet appeared and is barely imaginable. As for the writer, he is sitting on a melting iceberg; he is merely an anachronism, a hangover from the bourgeois age, as surely doomed as the hippopotamus.</blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The fate of the autonomous individual, “the writer,” the literature of liberalism—he carried all of it to Jura, where he dumped it onto the head of poor Winston Smith.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Orwell typed for hours upstairs, sitting on his iron bedstead in a tatty dressing gown, chain-smoking shag tobacco. In May 1947, he felt he had a third of a draft, and in November, a completed one. In December, he was in a hospital outside Glasgow, diagnosed with “chronic” tuberculosis—not a death sentence, maybe, but his landlord on Jura suspected that Orwell now knew he was dying.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The following July, after grueling treatments and a stint in a sanatorium, he returned to Jura fitter but by no means cured, and under strict orders to take it easy. His rough draft, however, was a riot of scrawled-over pages. To produce a clean manuscript for the publisher, he would need to hire and closely supervise a typist, but no candidate was willing to trek to Jura, and Orwell was unwilling to leave it. He typed <i>1984</i> on his own, having all but spent himself writing it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“He should have been in bed,” Wilson says, and instead sat “propped up on a sofa” banging out 5,000 words a day. Among all of its gruesome set pieces, culminating in Room 101 in the Ministry of Love, the novel’s most decisive act of torment is a simple glance in the mirror. Winston is sure—it is one of his last consolations, before breaking completely—that some inherent principle exists in the universe to prevent a system based on nothing but cruelty and self-perpetuation from triumphing forever. O’Brien calmly assures Winston that he’s wrong, that he is “the last man,” and to prove it, and the obvious nonexistence of “the human spirit,” he forces Winston to look at himself:</p><div><blockquote>A bowed, greycoloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The creature’s face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird’s face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt.</blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The final membrane between inner and outer is dissolving. <i>1984</i> can read like Orwell’s reverse autobiography, in which, rather than a life being built up, it gets disassembled down to its foundational unit. The body is now wasting; the voice is losing expressive competence. Worse, the face will soon enough have nothing left to express, as the last of his adaptive neurocircuitry becomes property of Oceania.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>1984</i> is Orwell saying goodbye to himself, and an improbably convincing portrait of the erasure of the autonomous individual. He finished typing the novel by early December 1948. His final diary entry on Jura—dated that Christmas Eve—gave the weight of the Christmas goose “before drawing &amp; plucking,” then concluded: “Snowdrops up all over the place. A few tulips showing. Some wall-flowers still trying to flower.” The next month, he was back in a sanatorium; the next year, he was dead. He was 46 years old.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span><span>1</span><em><span>984</span></em> was published</span> 75 years ago. Surprisingly, it immediately surpassed <i>Animal Farm</i> as a critical and commercial success. One by one, Orwell’s contemporaries—V. S. Pritchett, Rebecca West, Bertrand Russell—acknowledged its triumph. A rare dissenter was Evelyn Waugh, who wrote to Orwell to say that he’d found the book morally inert. “You deny the soul’s existence (at least Winston does) and can only contrast matter with reason &amp; will.” The trials of its protagonist consequently failed to make Waugh’s “flesh creep.” What, he implied, was at stake here?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Talk about missing the point. Nowhere in Orwell’s work can one find evidence of anything essential, much less eternal, that makes us human. That’s why Winston, our meager proxy, is available for a thoroughgoing reboot. As the book implies, we’re creatures of contingency all the way down. Even a memory of a memory of freedom, autonomy, self-making, consciousness, and agency—in a word, of ourselves—can disappear, until no loss is felt whatsoever. Hence the terror of being “the last man”: You’re the living terminus, the lone bearer of what will be, soon enough, a dead language.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A precious language, indicating a way of being in the world worth keeping—if you’re George Orwell. From the evidence of Jura and <i>1984</i>, persisting as his own catawampus self—askew to the world—was a habit he needed to prove he couldn’t possibly kick. He could be the far-off yet rooted man who loved being a father; performing what he deemed “sane” tasks, such as building a henhouse; indulging his grim compulsions (smoking tobacco and writing books). The soul, eternal fabric of God, had no place in that equation.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Waugh wasn’t the only muddled reader of the book. In the aftermath of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_136188.htm">the Berlin blockade</a> and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/nato">creation of NATO</a>, followed by the Soviets’ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/bomb-soviet-tests/">detonation of their first atomic weapon</a>, readers—Americans, especially—might have been eager for an anti-Stalinist bedtime story. But Orwell had already written an anti-Stalinist bedtime story. If his time on Jura tells us anything, it’s that in <i>1984</i>, he was exhorting us to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/how-animal-farm-gave-hope-to-stalins-refugees/253831/">beware of concentrated power</a> and pay attention to public language, yes, but above all, guard your solitude against interlopers, Stalinist or otherwise.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In addition to the book’s top-down anxieties about the coming managerial overclass, a bottom-up anxiety about how fragile solitude is—irreducible to an abstract right or a material good—permeates <i>1984</i>. Paradoxically, Winston’s efforts to hold fast to the bliss of separateness are what give the book its unexpected turns of beauty and humanity. (“The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock.”) For all of Orwell’s intrepidness, his physical courage, his clarity of expression, his most resolutely anti-fascist instinct lay here: in his terror at the thought of never being alone.</p><hr/><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><em>This article appears in the May 2024 print edition with the headline “Orwell’s Escape.”</em></small></p><section><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="Orwell’s Island: George, Jura and ‘1984’"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781913393779" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="Orwell’s Island: George, Jura and ‘1984’" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Hj6n2vwtEHnezQEm-mqgcTpOqb0=/0x0:326x500/78x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/04/04/41pxLqu4HL._SL500_/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3NJOWm9xH2OLsAi0JHGx8jd1Phc=/0x0:326x500/156x240/media/img/book_reviews/2024/04/04/41pxLqu4HL._SL500_/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Hj6n2vwtEHnezQEm-mqgcTpOqb0=/0x0:326x500/78x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/04/04/41pxLqu4HL._SL500_/original.jpg" width="78" height="120"/></picture></a></div></section><div><hr/><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
