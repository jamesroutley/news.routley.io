    <h1>From Platforms to Microservices for FAIR Data and Analysis</h1>

<p>The “one platform<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to rule them all” is unlikely to be realized for scientific research in
any domain. Rather, instead of small and numerous on-premises silos for data + code + compute, we
are on track to achieve large and somewhat less numerous cloud-based silos.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>What’s the alternative? A focus on microservices – so-called to emphasize that they generally do
not stand alone, but rather are components of larger workflows/services – such as data-slicing and
data-summary-layer services that allow you to bring big data to code+compute by effectively
subsetting/streaming it.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>But how? One approach is to pursue domain-driven design that is devoid of architecture/orchestration
concerns but that yields domain events, wrapped by event-driven microservices that deal with
specific technology choices, wrapped finally by entrypoint interfaces driven by user/user-agent
personas and their use cases.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
