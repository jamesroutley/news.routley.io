    <h1>You shouldn’t use Google Chrome (2020)</h1>

<p>Until now <a href="https://zapek.com/blog/google-chrome/" data-type="post" data-id="75">I used Chrome </a>with a few settings tweak like disabling sending usage statistics, uBlock origin, no crash reports and so on.</p>



<p>Then, when checking why one my newly installed WordPress themes was using some Google fonts, I came upon Chrome sending this with a GET request:</p>



<pre><code>x-client-data: CJW2yQEIpLbJAQjEtskBCKmdygEI67jKAQisx8oBCPbHygEItMvKAQjc1coBCJeaywEYisHKAQ==</code></pre>



<p>If you check with Chrome’s own Network analyser tool, it’ll automatically explain what it is:</p>



<pre><code>message ClientVariations {
  // Active client experiment variation IDs.
  repeated int32 variation_id = [3300117, 3300132, 3300164, 3313321, 3316843, 3318700, 3318774, 3319220, 3320540, 3329303];
  // Active client experiment variation IDs that trigger server-side behavior.
  repeated int32 trigger_variation_id = [3317898];
}</code></pre>



<p>If you type <em>about:version</em> into Chrome’s URL bar, it’ll display something like:</p>

<p>Which is a long list of “variations”. Google claims this is used to allow rolling out features from their servers to only a small subsets of users (so they do need a kind of unique ID for that). So for example if you’re watching Youtube, you’d get the new UI refresh only if your ID is included.</p>



<p>Can that ID be used to track you? Yes it can. And if it can, you can be 99% sure that Google is doing it.</p>



<p>You cannot remove that feature. The suggested workarounds are to disable “send usage statistics” which restrain that ID to 13-bits (which, with your IP address is still more than enough to track you) or run Chrome with some obscure flag that makes it generate a new ID on startup, which is useless if your browser is running all the time.</p>



<p>As for me, I’m switching to a better browser.</p>
