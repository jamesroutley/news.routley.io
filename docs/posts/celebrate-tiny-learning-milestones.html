    <h1>Celebrate tiny learning milestones</h1>
    
    

<p>Hello! Today I want to talk about &ndash; how do you know you&rsquo;re getting better at programming?</p>

<p>One obvious approach is:</p>

<ol>
<li>make goals</li>
<li>periodically check if you achieved those goals</li>
<li>if you did, celebrate</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="i-kind-of-hate-goals">I kind of hate goals</h3>

<p>Goals can be useful, but a lot of the time I actually find them stressful and
not that helpful. For example, here are a few goals I wrote down for myself 9
years ago:</p>

<ul>
<li>write a nontrivial amount of C code that works and is used by actual people</li>
<li>contribute to an open source project in C</li>
<li>learn C++</li>
</ul>

<p>9 years later, I have done 0 of those things. With the &ldquo;goal&rdquo; framing, it&rsquo;s to
think of this as a bad thing! Like, I wanted to learn C++ and I didn&rsquo;t! I still
can&rsquo;t write C comfortably! Oh no! I guess I failed!</p>

<p>I find this framing depressing and unhelpful. In reality, I didn&rsquo;t have any real
reason to learn C++ then and I still don&rsquo;t now. So it makes sense that I
haven&rsquo;t learned it.</p>

<p>Instead of goals, I like to think about <strong>tiny milestones</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-a-milestone">what&rsquo;s a milestone?</h3>

<p>Usually when we talk about milestones we mean something big, like &ldquo;I graduated from university&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But in this post I want to talk about milestones in the sense of its etymology
&ndash; <strong>stones</strong> placed every <strong>mile</strong> on a highway, so that you can track your
progress along a path.</p>

<p>These happen much more often &ndash; maybe you used a new tool for the first time,
or you fixed a new type of bug that you&rsquo;ve never seen before, or you learned
about a new concept!</p>

<h3 id="a-few-of-my-tiny-c-milestones">a few of my tiny C milestones</h3>

<p>Here are a few examples of tiny milestones from the last 9 years that are
spiritually related to my original &ldquo;learn C/C++&rdquo; goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>wrote a very basic shell in C</li>
<li>wrote a tiny Linux kernel module</li>
<li>learned about <code>strace</code></li>
<li>learned how ELF binaries are organized (symbols, sections, etc)</li>
<li>learned what DWARF debugging symbols are and how they work</li>
<li>found a Mac kernel bug and managed to <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/01/28/mac-freeze/">write a program reproducing it in C</a></li>
<li>learned how to use <code>gdb</code> to inspect a C program&rsquo;s memory</li>
<li>implemented a buffer overflow exploit using <code>gdb</code> and <code>strace</code> (for a CTF)</li>
<li>wrote a <a href="https://computers-are-fast.github.io/">computers are fast</a> game</li>
<li>got a core dump for a crashing C++ program and managed to get a stack trace out of it</li>
<li>wrote an accurate bug report for a C++ program that had a memory leak, which resulted in the maintainers fixing the bug</li>
<li>learned about the RAII pattern (though in Rust, not C++)</li>
<li>pair programmed with a friend on implementing some Advent of Code problems in x86 assembly</li>
<li>in general I&rsquo;m comfortable writing very basic C programs as long as they
don&rsquo;t have to do anything fancy like &ldquo;memory management&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>And there were even some major milestones, like I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy">Ruby profiler</a> in Rust in 2018.</p>

<p>When I think about it this way, I feel really good about my skills! I&rsquo;ve
learned all kinds of stuff related to systems programming, it just happened in
a different way than I originally expected.</p>

<h3 id="changing-goals-isn-t-a-bad-thing">changing goals isn&rsquo;t a bad thing</h3>

<p>The reason I still haven&rsquo;t learned C isn&rsquo;t that I suck or that C is impossible
to learn. It&rsquo;s just that learning how to write C well was never actually
something I had a real reason to do.</p>

<p>Instead I learned Rust and Go and <code>strace</code> and <code>gdb</code> and about C structs and
symbols and the call stack and the heap and lots of other things. (as an aside, I loved this paper <a href="https://www.humprog.org/~stephen/research/papers/kell17some-preprint.pdf">Some were meant for C</a>
about how why C is still so important)</p>

<p>And that worked great! So I think it&rsquo;s much more healthy to be flexible about
your goals and to celebrate the milestones you do end up getting to instead of
feeling bad about goals that you &ldquo;failed&rdquo; at.</p>

<h3 id="celebrate-your-tiny-milestones">celebrate your tiny milestones</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s really helpful for me to <strong>celebrate</strong> tiny milestones like this. I celebrate
a lot by writing blog posts &ndash; I wrote the above list mostly by looking at my
list of old blog posts for things I&rsquo;d written about related to C.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t blog (it&rsquo;s definitely not for everyone!), it can be helpful to write down
this kind of thing in your <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag document</a> instead.</p>

<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s important to celebrate these milestones <em>somewhere</em>. It
gives me a real sense that I&rsquo;m making progress and it helps me stay motivated
to keep learning about the thing.</p>
