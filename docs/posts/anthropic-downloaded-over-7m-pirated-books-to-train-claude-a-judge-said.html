                <p>To build AI chatbot Claude, Anthropic &#34;destructively scanned&#34; millions of copyrighted books, wrote a judge on Monday.</p><p>Ruling in a closely-watched AI copyright case, Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California analyzed how Anthropic sourced data for model training purposes, including from digital and physical books.</p><p>Companies like Anthropic require vast amounts of input to develop their large language models, so they&#39;ve tapped sources from social media posts to videos to books. Authors, artists, publishers, and other groups contend that the use of their work for training amounts to theft.</p><p>Alsup detailed Anthropic&#39;s training process with books: The OpenAI rival spent &#34;many millions of dollars&#34; buying used print books, which the company or its vendors then stripped of their bindings, cut the pages, and scanned into digital files.</p><p>Alsup wrote that millions of original books were then discarded, and the digital versions stored in an internal &#34;research library.&#34;</p><p>The judge also wrote that Anthropic, which is backed by <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">Amazon</a> and <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-alphabet" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">Alphabet</a>, downloaded more than 7 million pirated books to train Claude. </p><p>Alsup wrote that Anthropic&#39;s cofounder, Ben Mann,<strong> </strong>downloaded &#34;at least 5 million copies of books from Library Genesis&#34; in 2021 — fully aware that the material was pirated. A year later, the company &#34;downloaded at least 2 million copies of books from the Pirate Library Mirror&#34; also knowing they were pirated.</p><p>Alsup wrote that Anthropic preferred to &#34;steal&#34; books to &#34;avoid &#39;legal/practice/business slog,&#39; as cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei put it.&#34;</p><p>Last year, a trio of authors sued Anthropic in a class-action lawsuit, saying that the company used pirated versions of their books without permission or compensation to train its large language models.</p><h2 id="db8b1eb0-1e60-4069-a4f5-23d6e4891183" data-toc-id="db8b1eb0-1e60-4069-a4f5-23d6e4891183">Judge says training Claude on books was fair use, but piracy wasn&#39;t</h2><p>Alsup ruled that Anthropic&#39;s use of copyrighted books to train its AI models was &#34;exceedingly transformative&#34; and qualified as fair use, a legal doctrine that allows certain uses of copyrighted works without the copyright owner&#39;s permission.</p><p>&#34;Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic&#39;s LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them — but to turn a hard corner and create something different,&#34; he wrote.</p>
              
              
              
            <p>The company&#39;s decision to digitize millions of print books it had purchased fell under fair use, Alsup wrote.</p><p>&#34;All Anthropic did was replace the print copies it had purchased for its central library with more convenient space-saving and searchable digital copies for its central library — without adding new copies, creating new works, or redistributing existing copies,&#34; he wrote.</p><p>An Anthropic spokesperson said that the company is pleased with Alsup&#39;s ruling on using books to train LLMs.</p><p>The spokesperson said in a statement that this approach is &#34;consistent with copyright&#39;s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.&#34;</p><p>But Alsup drew a firm line when it came to piracy.</p><p>&#34;Anthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,&#34; Alsup wrote. &#34;Creating a permanent, general-purpose library was not itself a fair use excusing Anthropic&#39;s piracy.&#34;</p><p>Judge Alsup&#39;s ruling that training AI models on copyrighted books is fair use is one of the first of ips kind.</p><p>His decision comes amid a wave of lawsuits from artists, filmmakers, authors, and news outlets against major AI players like <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-share-files-copyright-case-authors-guild-ilya-sutskever-2024-11" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">OpenAI</a>.</p><p>While creators say training AI models on their copyrighted work without permission infringes on their rights, AI execs argue they haven&#39;t violated copyright laws because the training falls under fair use.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-universal-midjourney-images-evidence-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-2025-6" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">Disney sued AI image generator Midjourney</a>, saying the tech company ripped off famous characters in properties ranging from &#34;Star Wars&#34; to &#34;The Simpsons.&#34;</p>
