&gt; 
&gt; ISO-2022-CN-EXT uses escape sequences to indicate character set changes
&gt; (as specified by RFC 1922).  While the SOdesignation has the expected
&gt; bounds checks, neither SS2designation nor SS3designation have its;

I hope Charles will share further detail with oss-security in due time,
but meanwhile his upcoming OffensiveCon talk abstract reveals a bit:

&gt; CHARLES FOL
&gt; ICONV, SET THE CHARSET TO RCE: EXPLOITING THE GLIBC TO HACK THE PHP ENGINE
&gt; 
&gt; Abstract
&gt; A few months ago, I stumbled upon a 24 years old buffer overflow in the
&gt; glibc. Despite being reachable in multiple well-known libraries or
&gt; programs, it proved rarely exploitable. Indeed, this was not a foos bug:
&gt; with hard-to-achieve preconditions, it did not even provide a nice
&gt; primitive. On PHP however, it lead to amazing results: a new
&gt; exploitation technique that affects the whole PHP ecosystem, and the
&gt; compromission of several applications.
&gt; 
&gt; This talk will first walk you through the discovery of the bug and its
&gt; limitations, before describing the conception of several remote binary
&gt; PHP exploits, and through them offer unique insight in the internal of
&gt; the engine of the web language, and the difficulties one faces when
&gt; exploiting it.
&gt; 
&gt; BIO
&gt; Charles Fol, also known as cfreal, is a security researcher at LEXFO /
&gt; AMBIONICS. He has discovered remote code execution vulnerabilities
&gt; targeting renowned CMS and frameworks such as Drupal, Magento, Symfony
&gt; or Laravel, but also enjoys binary exploitation, to escalate privileges
&gt; (Apache, PHP-FPM) or compromise security solutions (DataDog&#39;s Sqreen,
&gt; Fortinet SSL VPN, Watchguard). He is the creator for PHPGGC, the go-to
&gt; tool to exploit PHP deserialization, and an expert in PHP internals.

The event is on May 10-11th, so in 3 weeks from now.
