      <p>This is a continuation of our series exploring the paths that Recursers take to RC, what they do during their batch, and what happens after.</p>

<p>Bernie came to RC in 2019, and is currently working on her own blockchain project after winning a hackathon and receiving funding. </p>

<h2>Here is Bernie’s story:</h2>

<h3>Before RC</h3>

<p>I did a bootcamp in 2017 after dropping out of a PhD in sociology and philosophy. I was disillusioned with academia and the job prospects were terrible. I also liked traveling, so it seemed like engineering could be a viable remote job. I’ve always enjoyed math and science, and I received a targeted ad for a coding bootcamp when I was trying to decide what to do instead of my PhD - since I’ve always loved learning, I decided to give it a go. I finished the bootcamp, and did a year and a half with the best job that I’d ever had, where I got exposed to lots of different areas of software development since we were building 3D visualization software. I did a lot of vector math, and it exposed me to deeper ideas in programming. That’s really how I knew programming was for me and I decided to stick with it, and it also sparked a fresh interest in math and science.</p>

<p>I’d been there a year and a half and I felt like I’d learned a lot already. But I wanted to learn a language that wasn’t just JavaScript/TypeScript, and I realized that for me to continue to develop as a software engineer, I needed to learn other fundamentals like memory management and functional programming. I looked for bootcamps for non-junior engineers (and there weren’t a lot out there), and for programs with scholarships for women, which is how I found the Recurse Center.</p>

<h3>During RC</h3>

<p>I wanted to learn Rust because it seemed like it would teach me a lot of the things I wanted to learn. I was also interested in blockchain because I’ve always been interested in redistributive economics, and it seemed like a radical way to create new economic systems. My idea was to try and build a blockchain in Rust, and that’s what I did. I spent the first half of RC learning the language, and doing the Cryptopals challenges with other people. My detours at RC were that I got really into cryptography, followed by quantum science and quantum computing. </p>
<blockquote><p>I had the chance at RC to go deeper into the mathematical side of things, too – if you haven’t done that at university, you don’t get a lot of space to carve out time to learn something like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quantum science detour was really profound for me: I realized that I was deeply interested in it, and it shaped the direction I’d take in the future. I don’t think I would have had that insight without attending RC.</p>

<h3>After RC</h3>

<p>Straight after RC, I worked as a blockchain engineer, but I left that after a few months because the culture didn’t sit right with me. After that experience, I thought that I’d had enough of blockchain – it’s a world that has lots of potential, but I felt like most people there didn’t share my value system, so I decided to do something else. I worked at Sketch for a while, and left that a few months ago to pursue a new direction, and that’s when I entered a hackathon. I decided I shouldn’t be squeezed out of blockchain and that instead I should be an active participant in creating the future, so I decided to give it another go.</p>

<p>I ended up winning the hackathon, which came with some funding to continue working on the project, which is what I’ve been doing since. It’s a project built on the Internet Computer – a blockchain where the networking layer of the internet is also decentralized, which offers a more interesting alternative to something like IPFS. The app that I’m building is a location-based chat app, and I am partly building it with the idea that people will use it for community organizing. I also decided to pursue my interest in quantum science by learning more of the foundations, so last year I started a second remote degree in mathematics and physics.</p>

<p>I often have a voice in my head which tells me: “You’re not a good enough developer to be able to do this sort of low-level programming or solve these kinds of problems…” And now I’ve learned to reject it, to just sit here with a problem and bang my head against it until I arrive at a solution - that’s all anybody does, and I’m just as capable.</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s what I like to try to do: take on things that seem too difficult, break them down and then sit with them until I understand them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that I’ve managed to mostly be in really diverse spaces has really helped me in this regard. In my first job I was very lucky that my boss was a woman who was a really amazing developer. It was a diverse company in general, and it was so fulfilling to be in that environment. The bootcamp was also diverse, as was RC and Sketch. In a way, I think I’ve been insulated from some of the more toxic areas of tech, and I think that’s been really beneficial for my growth and my mentality; RC was a big part of that.</p>
