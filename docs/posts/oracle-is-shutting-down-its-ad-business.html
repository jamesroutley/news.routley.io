<div><p>Software giant Oracle shared that it is shutting down its ads business during its earnings call last night for the quarter ending March 31, as revenue declined to $300 million in the 2024 fiscal year.</p><p>“In Q4, we decided to exit the advertising business, which had declined to about $300 million in revenue in fiscal year ’24,” CEO Safra Catz told analysts, according to an earnings <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/06/11/oracle-orcl-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank">transcript</a>.</p><p>In August 2022, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-fall-of-oracle-advertising-and-marketing-business-2022-8" target="_blank">reported</a> that Oracle Advertising made $2 billion in revenue. At the time, revenue was only growing by 2% a year and many employees had been laid off as part of a reorganization in 2022, Business Insider reported.</p><p>Oracle spent billions on entering the advertising business, acquiring nearly a dozen ad technology companies for over a decade. Notable acquisitions include data firms DataLogix, bought in 2014 for $1.2 billion, and brand safety platform Moat, purchased in 2017 for a reported $850 million.</p><p>Oracle’s bet on the advertising industry was undermined when Meta, doing business as Facebook at the time, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/h/shutting-down-partner-categories/" target="_blank">shut down</a> its data to third parties including Oracle in 2018, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. That was a major loss to the kind of insights Oracle Advertising could share.</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation further restricted Oracle Advertising’s business. The company stopped offering third-party data targeting services across Europe in 2020, ADWEEK <a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/oracle-to-shutter-third-party-data-services-in-europe/" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p><p>This affected many of its data products in the region and led the company to shut down a publisher audience tool that relied on third-party data, AddThis, in Europe in 2019. Oracle Advertising killed AddThis entirely last year, AdExchanger <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/oracle-to-shut-down-addthis-completely-this-time/" target="_blank">reported</a>. The company is the subject of class action lawsuits over user privacy.</p><p> <em>An earlier version of this article referred to the company AddThis as NowThis</em>.</p></div>
