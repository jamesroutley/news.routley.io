<p>Sony has a pair of new Android Walkmans out, the <a href="https://www.sony.com/walkman/products/nw-a306">NW-A300</a> and <a href="https://www.sony-asia.com/walkman/products/nw-zx707">NW-ZX700</a>. Yes, that&#39;s right, <em>W</em><em>alkmans, </em>Sony&#39;s legendary music player brand from the 1980s. Apple may have given up on the idea of a smartphone-adjacent music player when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/goodbye-ipod-apple-stops-making-last-model/">killed the iPod Touch line</a> recently, but Sony still makes Android-powered Walkmans and has for a while. The first was in 2012 with the Android 2.3 Gingerbread-powered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/9/2690217/sony-walkman-z1000-media-player-coming-this-spring-tegra-2-and">NWZ-Z1000</a>, which looked like Sony just stripped the modem out of an Xperia phone and shoved it onto the market as a music player. Since then, Sony has made designs with more purpose-built hardware, and today there are a whole series of Android-powered Walkman music players out there. Sadly these new ones seem to only be for sale in Japan, the UK, and Europe, for now.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll start with the most consumer-friendly of the two, the NW-A300. This basic design debuted in 2019 with the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/walkman-mp3-players/p/nwa105-b">NW-A105</a>, but that shipped with Android 9. This is an upgraded version of that device with a less-ancient version of Android, a new SoC, and a scalloped back design. In Sony&#39;s home of Japan, the 32GB version is 46,000 yen (about $360), while in Europe, it&#39;s 399 euro (about $430).</p>
<p>The NW-A300 is a tiny little device that measures 56.6×98.5×12 mm, so pretty close to a deck of playing cards. And really, just <em>look </em>at these pictures. Sony might not be the consumer electronics juggernaut it used to be, but it still has an incredible product design department. I have no use for a standalone music player, but both of these Walkmans are so pretty that I just want to hold one.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The front is dominated by a 3.6-inch, 60 Hz, 1280×720 touchscreen LCD. There&#39;s 32GB of storage, and the device supports Wi-Fi 802.11AC and Bluetooth 5. That&#39;s about all Sony wants to talk about for <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/digital-music-players-nw-nwz-a-series/nw-a306/specifications">official specs</a>. It touts &#34;longer battery life&#34; but won&#39;t say how big the battery is, promising only &#34;36 hours* of 44.1 KHz FLAC playback, up to 32 hours* of 96 KHz FLAC High-Resolution Audio playback.&#34; Presumably, that&#39;s all with the screen off.</p>
<p>For more specs, we can visit <a href="https://thewalkmanblog.blogspot.com/2022/10/new-sony-a-and-zx-walkmans-are-coming.html">The Walkman Blog,</a> a wonderful site that is very serious about these little music players. In October, the site found documentation for the A300 listing a 1500 mAh battery. The system-on-a-chip in the older NW-A100 model was the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/i-mx-applications-processors/i-mx-8-applications-processors/i-mx-8m-mini-arm-cortex-a53-cortex-m4-audio-voice-video:i.MX8MMINI">NXP i.MX8M-Mini</a>, a wildly slow 28 nm SoC that has just four Arm Cortex-A53 CPUs and 4GB of RAM. You can say, &#34;This is just a music player,&#34; but that&#39;s not really true since it still runs full Android with an app store and everything. <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/19438461">Geekbench scores</a> show this has a new quad-core Qualcomm chip of some kind with 4GB of RAM, but we can&#39;t be sure of the model number. A newer chip with smaller transistors would probably account for a lot of that &#34;better battery life&#34; promise.</p>
<p>This is a music player, so of course, there&#39;s a headphone jack on the bottom of the unit. You&#39;ll also find a spot for a lanyard, a speedy USB-C 3.2 Gen1 port for quick music transfers, and a MicroSD slot for storing all your music. Buttons along the side of the device also give you every music control you could want, like a hold switch, previous, play/pause, next, volume controls, and power.</p>
