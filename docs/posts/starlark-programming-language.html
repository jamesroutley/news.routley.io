    <!-- <h1>Starlark</h1>
      <p class="tagline">A simple, thread-safe language with Python syntax, designed for embedding</p> -->

    <p>
      Starlark is a small language designed to be embedded in another application,
      to provide configuration or scripting abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starlark is a dialect of Python. Like Python, it is a dynamically typed
      language with high-level data types, first-class functions with lexical
      scope, and garbage collection. Independent Starlark threads execute in
      parallel, so Starlark workloads scale well on parallel machines.
      Starlark is a small and simple language with a familiar and highly
      readable syntax. You can use it as an expressive notation for structured
      data, defining functions to eliminate repetition, or you can use it to
      add scripting capabilities to an existing application.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Starlark</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deterministic evaluation</strong> - Executing the same code twice will give the same results.
      </li><li><strong>Hermetic execution</strong> - Execution cannot access the file system, network, system clock. It is
        safe to execute untrusted code.
      </li><li><strong>Parallel evaluation</strong> - Modules can be loaded in parallel. To guarantee a thread-safe
        execution, shared data becomes immutable.
      </li><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - We try to limit the number of concepts needed to
        understand the code. Users should be able to quickly read and write
        code, even if they are not experts. The language should avoid pitfalls
        as much as possible.
      </li><li><strong>Focus on tooling</strong> - We recognize that the source code will be read, analyzed, modified, by
        both humans and tools.
      </li><li><strong>Python-like</strong> - Python is a widely used language. Keeping the
        language similar to Python can reduce the learning curve and make the
        semantics more obvious to users.
    </li></ul>
