  <p>Continuing with the &#39;the program is the database&#39; theme from last month, I made a clojurescript dialect (called preimp) where the only source of mutable state is the source code itself.
It works well enough for spreadsheet-sized datasets:</p>

<p>I have much more interesting interactions planned. Hopefully for next month.</p>
<p>Doing this in clojurescript makes it easy to get things off the ground but creates a very low ceiling for how high-quality an experience I can make. So I&#39;m thinking of this as a two-pronged assault: on the one prong I&#39;m trying to make a language and programming environment that is ideal for <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/log/0020#data-soup">data soup problems</a>, and on the other I&#39;m hacking together something awful in clojurescript to see where I have to go.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I wrote some musings on how data is represented in programming systems:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/">HYTRADBOI</a> is clocking in so far at 169 attendees and 35 speakers. </p>
<p>If this slow trickle of sales continues we&#39;re looking at maybe 300 people total. More if there is a last-minute uptick. Perhaps a little more success than I was prepared for :S</p>
<hr/>
<p>I&#39;ve turned off the office hours link - now that the weather is drying out I&#39;ll be either coding, writing or climbing pretty much 100% of the time.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still open to unsolicited email though - async communication is much easier to fit into the gaps.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll also be in NYC May 5-13 and May 20-21.</p>

<li>I&#39;ve constantly infuriated that it is 2022 and javascript still doesn&#39;t support compound keys in Map.
