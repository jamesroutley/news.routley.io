  Ok, it is over.  End of an era for me.  No more self-hosted git.  I
  had a public git server running since 2011, and a public cvs server
  before that.  AI scrapers have hammered the poor, little server to
  death by flooding the cgit frontend with tons of pointless²
  requests.  Actually a few months ago already.
</p>
<p>
  Now I finally decided to not try rebuild the server, be it with or
  without cgit web frontend.  I don&#39;t feel like taking up the fight
  with the scrapers in my spare time, I leave that to people who are
  in a better position to do so.  Most repositories had mirrors on one
  or two of the large gitforges already.  Those are the primary
  repositories now.  Go look
  at <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/kraxel/projects">gitlab</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/kraxel?tab=repositories">github</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Last week I&#39;ve fixed all (I hope) dangeling links to the cgit
  repsitories to point to the forges instead.
</p>
<p>
  Now I&#39;m down to one self-hosted service, which is the webserver
  hosting mainly this blog and a few more little things.  In 2018 I&#39;ve
  migrated the blog from wordpress to jekyll, so it is all static
  pages.  Taking this out by AI scrapers overloading the machine should
  be next to impossible, and so far this has hold up.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless AI scrapers already managed to trigger one outage.
  Apparently millions of 404 answers where not enough to convince the
  bots that there is no cgit service (any more).  Apache had no
  problems to deliver those, but the logs have filled up the disk so
  fast that logrotate didn&#39;t manage to keep things under control with
  the default configuration.  Fixed config.  Knook wood.
