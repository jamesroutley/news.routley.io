The Maia chip, they said, is optimized for that work.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">&#34;We think this gives us a way that we can provide better solutions to our customers that are faster and lower cost and higher quality,&#34; said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president of Microsoft&#39;s cloud and AI group.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Microsoft also said that next year it will offer its Azure customers cloud services that run on the newest flagship chips from Nvidia <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(NVDA.O)</a> and Advanced Micro Devices <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMD.O" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(AMD.O)</a>. Microsoft said it is testing GPT 4 - OpenAI&#39;s most advanced model - on AMD&#39;s chips.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">&#34;This is not something that&#39;s displacing Nvidia,&#34; said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">He said the Maia chip would allow Microsoft to sell AI services in the cloud until personal computers and phones are powerful enough to handle them.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">&#34;Microsoft has a very different kind of core opportunity here because they&#39;re making a lot of money per user for the services,&#34; Bajarin said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Microsoft&#39;s second chip announced Tuesday is designed to be both an internal cost saver and an answer to Microsoft&#39;s chief cloud rival, Amazon Web Services.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">Named Cobalt, the new chip is a central processing unit (CPU) made with technology from Arm Holdings <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/O9Ty.F" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(O9Ty.F)</a>. Microsoft disclosed on Wednesday that it has already been testing Cobalt to power Teams, its business messaging tool.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">But Microsoft&#39;s Guthrie said his company also wants to sell direct access to Cobalt to compete with the &#34;Graviton&#34; series of in-house chips offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(AMZN.O)</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">&#34;We are designing our Cobalt solution to ensure that we are very competitive both in terms of performance as well as price-to-performance (compared with Amazon&#39;s chips),&#34; Guthrie said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">AWS will hold its own developer conference later this month, and a spokesman said that its Graviton chip now has 50,000 customers.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">&#34;AWS will continue to innovate to deliver future generations of AWS-designed chips to deliver even better price-performance for whatever customer workloads require,&#34; the spokesman said after Microsoft announced its chip.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">Microsoft gave few technical details that would allow gauging the chips&#39; competitiveness versus those of traditional chipmakers. Rani Borkar, corporate vice president for Azure hardware systems and infrastructure, said both are made with 5-nanometer manufacturing technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/2330.TW" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(2330.TW)</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">He added that the Maia chip would be strung together with standard Ethernet network cabling, rather than a more expensive custom Nvidia networking technology that Microsoft used in the supercomputers it built for OpenAI.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">&#34;You will see us going a lot more the standardization route,&#34; Borkar told Reuters.</p><p data-testid="Body">Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Jonathan Oatis</p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
