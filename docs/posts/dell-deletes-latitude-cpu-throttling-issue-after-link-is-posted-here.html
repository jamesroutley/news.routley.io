    <h1>Dell deletes Latitude CPU Throttling issue after link is posted here</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Dell deletes Latitude CPU Throttling issue after link is posted here.<p>Dell&#39;s new Latitude 5420/7420/7520 Notebooks have a ongoing issue where their CPU are severely throttled when running on any Linux distribution, even on Ubuntu OEM Certified System according to some reports at the forum.</p><p>After a link to the Dell forum post was ported to HN, the post mysteriously was deleted in the same day. Many users of this model posted to the forum thread since last year and so far no solution was provided and we only received very unenthusiastic responses from Dell support.</p><p>Shocking to see this apparent action to hide the problem.</p><p>Originally Here:
