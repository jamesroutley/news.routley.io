[laughing]</p><p>That&#39;s a lot of money.</p><p>[Evelyn] Yeah.</p><p>It still to this day,</p><p>a year and a half later,</p><p>boggles my mind</p><p>that I could be victim to a scam,</p><p>especially of this financial magnitude.</p><p>That seems incongruous</p><p>with the image I had of myself.</p><p>You&#39;ve probably noticed that online scams are everywhere.</p><p>You see them on job recruitment sites,</p><p>in your text messages,</p><p>on dating apps and across social media.</p><p>And while people are getting better at spotting these scams,</p><p>scammers are constantly advancing too.</p><p>Arguably, the most hurtful,</p><p>personal and financially damaging of these scams</p><p>is romance scams,</p><p>a type of investment scam</p><p>where the perpetrator spends weeks or months</p><p>getting to know the victim,</p><p>until ultimately conning them</p><p>out of as much money as they can get.</p><p>So what&#39;s it really like when you fall victim</p><p>to one of these scams?</p><p>How do they fool you?</p><p>And how much money can you really lose?</p><p>Today, we&#39;ll do a deep dive into relationship scams</p><p>and speak with Evelyn</p><p>who experienced this firsthand.</p><p>This is Incognito Mode.</p><p>[inquisitive music] [text whirring]</p><p>In 2024, cyber criminals stole</p><p>over $1 trillion from unsuspecting targets</p><p>around the world.</p><p>Americans were by far the biggest victims of cyber scams,</p><p>losing an average of $3,500 per incident,</p><p>more than double the losses reported in China.</p><p>The fastest-growing scams are investment scams,</p><p>which grew nearly 40% year over year.</p><p>These scams are based on gaining the victim&#39;s trust.</p><p>Most investment scams begin with an attacker</p><p>cold contacting people through texts,</p><p>social media, dating and other communication platforms.</p><p>You&#39;ve probably gotten these texts before.</p><p>They&#39;ll often simply say, Hi,</p><p>or something like, Hey, Josh,</p><p>it was fun catching up last week.</p><p>If the recipient responds to say</p><p>that the attacker has the wrong number,</p><p>the scammer seizes the opportunity</p><p>to strike up a conversation.</p><p>To do this at scale,</p><p>criminals will often message hundreds of Facebook users</p><p>at a time</p><p>or match with every profile on a dating app.</p><p>This is very similar to what happened to Evelyn,</p><p>who asked to appear under a pseudonym.</p><p>Wired&#39;s Joel Khalili</p><p>was the first to report Evelyn&#39;s story in 2023.</p><p>[Evelyn] I am a 50-year-old woman living in Los Angeles.</p><p>At the time of the scam, I was 48,</p><p>and had just gotten out</p><p>of a long 20-year relationship.</p><p>The breakup came out of nowhere for me.</p><p>Completely unraveled my life.</p><p>I had been not working.</p><p>I had an early retirement.</p><p>I had to up and move out of the house</p><p>we had been living in for 20 years</p><p>and start all over,</p><p>completely all over in my personal life,</p><p>in my career.</p><p>I was stressed out financially,</p><p>and so I wasn&#39;t feeling great.</p><p>I was on Hinge for just a couple of months</p><p>and matched with one of the profiles.</p><p>His name said Bruce.</p><p>And we started chatting.</p><p>We exchanged pleasantries</p><p>and talked about like,</p><p>What kind of movies do you like?</p><p>What kind of things do you like to do?</p><p>Just like the basic get-to-know-you kind of things.</p><p>Seemed like a nice guy,</p><p>and quickly became very, I guess, via text,</p><p>like affectionate,</p><p>saying, I really like chatting with you.</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna be chatting with anyone else,</p><p>like that kind of thing.</p><p>He said he lived in Sunnyvale, in California,</p><p>and that he also had a second home in Beverly Hills.</p><p>Huh, okay.</p><p>How did that make you think about him,</p><p>feel about him when you learned</p><p>like he has two homes in California,</p><p>presumably he&#39;s pretty well off, it sounds like?</p><p>[Evelyn] Yeah, even his few profile pics</p><p>kind of gave off the vibe that he had some money.</p><p>And the second home was more important</p><p>in that it anchored him also in Los Angeles,</p><p>&#39;cause I didn&#39;t wanna start a long-distance relationship.</p><p>Right. So he&#39;ll be in town</p><p>at some point.</p><p>At this point, you can probably better understand</p><p>why Evelyn kept chatting with Bruce.</p><p>He seemed smart, kind, caring.</p><p>And that&#39;s exactly what relationship scams are based on,</p><p>basic human feelings, like a desire for connection</p><p>or feeling stressed out about money.</p><p>Knowing this, it&#39;s no surprise that since the pandemic,</p><p>fraud has reached epidemic levels.</p><p>[Reporter] They hit a record high in 2021,</p><p>with people losing something like $550 million,</p><p>up nearly 80% from the year before.</p><p>A rise in social isolation</p><p>and more online interactions</p><p>created a perfect breeding ground</p><p>for online scams.</p><p>Gareth Norris, a lecturer in psychology</p><p>at Aberystwyth University,</p><p>published a paper in 2019</p><p>on the psychology of internet fraud.</p><p>According to Norris, scams in the digital age</p><p>are much more effective</p><p>because they happen behind a screen.</p><p>Behavior that might normally raise suspicions,</p><p>sweating or fidgeting,</p><p>is concealed.</p><p>Not only that, but scammers have become experts</p><p>at manipulating human psychology.</p><p>David Modic, a professor of computer and information science</p><p>at the University of University of Ljubkana,</p><p>says the chances that someone will fall for a scam</p><p>has no connection with intelligence.</p><p>Rather, it&#39;s about the ability of the scammer</p><p>to take advantage of personal context,</p><p>like a recent breakup,</p><p>to erode someone&#39;s self-control</p><p>and blind them to the warning signs.</p><p>Basically, scammers are really good</p><p>at getting people to do what they want.</p><p>And once they have you locked in,</p><p>it can be really hard to notice the warning signs,</p><p>no matter how intelligent you are</p><p>or tech savvy you think you may be.</p><p>At this point, had you only been talking to Bruce</p><p>via text message,</p><p>or had there been phone calls,</p><p>or video chats, or anything?</p><p>[Evelyn] Definitely no video chat.</p><p>Pretty quickly from our chatting on Hinge,</p><p>he asked if I use WhatsApp.</p><p>So we did,</p><p>and that&#39;s where all the conversation happened since.</p><p>And then it escalated</p><p>to him asking if I knew about cryptocurrency,</p><p>which I knew some.</p><p>And then he said he ran a studio on the side</p><p>that did some currency exchanges</p><p>and made money,</p><p>and if I would be interested</p><p>in putting some money in it.</p><p>Day trading or something,</p><p>but with cryptocurrency.</p><p>He led me to a third-party website,</p><p>as far as I knew.</p><p>The website, I believe, was C-E-G-A-M-A-S.com.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what it stood for.</p><p>He walked me step by step,</p><p>sometimes with screenshots,</p><p>sometimes just telling me like,</p><p>This is what you do to transfer the money.</p><p>This is where you put it in.</p><p>And it looked colorful,</p><p>but it looked legit.</p><p>It even had like the footers on the bottom,</p><p>it had a support chat,</p><p>and you know, it had all the bells and whistles</p><p>you would expect.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t like some 1990s website</p><p>or anything like that.</p><p>Right, I understand.</p><p>When did you start putting money in,</p><p>and how much was that?</p><p>[Evelyn] I think the first amount</p><p>was probably like $1,000 or $2,000,</p><p>&#39;cause I already had that much in my Coinbase account.</p><p>It was already like money</p><p>I didn&#39;t consider as having,</p><p>so I was fine using that</p><p>as my first transaction money.</p><p>It seemed low risk at that point?</p><p>[Evelyn] Exactly.</p><p>And so his logic was that,</p><p>Oh, I have a team of people</p><p>who have been studying the trends</p><p>and they know when to do the transactions</p><p>and when it&#39;s gonna hit higher.</p><p>So he would be like,</p><p>Okay, well, the next peak is gonna happen</p><p>in two days, or something like that,</p><p>which I&#39;m sure to a finance person,</p><p>it would be ridiculous</p><p>to hear that. [Andrew laughing]</p><p>But like there have been so many coins</p><p>that have been influenced</p><p>by the news and whatnot.</p><p>So I thought like, Okay, sure.</p><p>Where did things go from there?</p><p>[Evelyn] It made like</p><p>a couple hundred dollars or something,</p><p>which was like, Okay, I could see that.</p><p>So that happens a couple more times.</p><p>And then I said,</p><p>I wanna take some money out,</p><p>because I wanted to make sure</p><p>I could take money out.</p><p>He walked me through the steps,</p><p>and it was easy.</p><p>And I had screen grabbed that process</p><p>and written down notes on how to do it</p><p>because I thought I was being smart,</p><p>figuring things out</p><p>and like having a just-in-case emergency plan.</p><p>And so I was able to withdraw the money.</p><p>Do you remember how much you withdrew</p><p>or if you had any temptation</p><p>to just take it all out</p><p>and kind of be done with it,</p><p>since you were up already?</p><p>[Evelyn] Oh, Andrew, if only I had done that.</p><p>[both laughing]</p><p>But it&#39;s like a gambling person at a casino, I guess, right?</p><p>When you&#39;re up, you just keep on putting in the money.</p><p>I took the fact that I could take out money</p><p>as a sign that it was safe.</p><p>[transition whirring] [inquisitive music]</p><p>So how do scammers perform investment fraud?</p><p>Adrian Cheek, an independent security researcher</p><p>based in Canada,</p><p>says, The methods used in these scams</p><p>are almost always the same.</p><p>A cyber criminal organization</p><p>develops a template for a fake crypto trading site,</p><p>and in exchange for a kickback,</p><p>hands it to other criminal affiliates</p><p>who perform the scam.</p><p>Data gathered by Cheek suggests</p><p>that at least 439 distinct web addresses</p><p>have been used to host the CEG exchange,</p><p>It&#39;s absolutely textbook, he says.</p><p>A quick scan of the Crypto Scam Tracker</p><p>on California&#39;s Department of Financial Protection</p><p>and Innovation website</p><p>tells a similar story.</p><p>The scams reported are almost identical.</p><p>An unsuspecting target meets someone online</p><p>on a dating site, messaging app, or similar.</p><p>After chatting for a while,</p><p>the person they met brings up the possibility</p><p>of helping them invest in crypto</p><p>and introduces them to a trading website or app.</p><p>Some reported names include Capital Handels System,</p><p>Ice Crypto Trading app,</p><p>Topex, and GCC Money.</p><p>The apps or websites appear trustworthy</p><p>and may even impersonate the platforms</p><p>of legitimate financial institutions.</p><p>Once inside the portal,</p><p>targets can often see curated realtime market data</p><p>meant to show the potential of the investment.</p><p>And once the target funds their investment account,</p><p>they can start watching their balances grow.</p><p>So now you&#39;ve taken some money out.</p><p>What&#39;s your opinion of Bruce?</p><p>What&#39;s the vibe at that moment?</p><p>[Evelyn] Very friendly still.</p><p>We were still chatting on a regular basis.</p><p>And then, at some point,</p><p>we had chatted on the phone.</p><p>He had an accent,</p><p>but whatever, like people have accents,</p><p>I didn&#39;t think anything of it.</p><p>Of course, the whole time on the relationship side,</p><p>I had been wanting to see</p><p>when he was gonna come down to LA</p><p>so we could meet in person.</p><p>What I should&#39;ve at least pushed for</p><p>is the next step would&#39;ve been a video chat of some sort.</p><p>I don&#39;t know that would&#39;ve done anything</p><p>to change the outcome,</p><p>but I didn&#39;t even do that.</p><p>And it was always like,</p><p>Oh, in a couple of weeks.</p><p>And the whole scam didn&#39;t last that long</p><p>to a point where it was like he kept pushing it back</p><p>and I was getting like frustrated</p><p>or anything like that.</p><p>But it wasn&#39;t to a point where I was like,</p><p>Oh, okay, something&#39;s up,</p><p>you&#39;re hiding from me.</p><p>And then he&#39;s also pushing to invest more.</p><p>That part never died down.</p><p>In fact, it increased,</p><p>where he was saying like,</p><p>Hey, the more you put in to trade,</p><p>the higher your return,</p><p>which again also makes sense,</p><p>you need money to make money.</p><p>Right. He eventually wore me down,</p><p>and I ended up taking all my savings</p><p>and even tapping into my IRA-</p><p>Oh no. to, I guess,</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna say like to appease him,</p><p>because there was obviously a part of me</p><p>that wanted to do it,</p><p>but it eventually got to that point</p><p>and he succeeded</p><p>in talking me into putting in all that money</p><p>into this website</p><p>and, quote-unquote, trading with it.</p><p>The fact that I had withdrawn money</p><p>was like this big green light in front of me</p><p>in being like, Well, you know,</p><p>you might lose some money,</p><p>like let&#39;s say the timing was off or something,</p><p>but you can always take it all out</p><p>if something starts to go south.</p><p>So do you remember like how much, at that point,</p><p>you were in for between your savings</p><p>and what you took out of your IRA?</p><p>[Evelyn] Oh, we&#39;re talking like $300,000.</p><p>[whistling] Okay. [laughing]</p><p>That&#39;s a lot of money.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>So-- It was everything.</p><p>Oh, man, how did that go?</p><p>How did you feel, you know,</p><p>converting 300,000 actual dollars</p><p>into cryptocurrency at that point?</p><p>Were you excited?</p><p>[Evelyn] Yeah, unfortunately, I was excited.</p><p>While this is happening,</p><p>I had asked about his work,</p><p>and he sent me a photo of his office,</p><p>like, Hey, here are the guys working hard,</p><p>or something like that.</p><p>Only later, I reverse image search that photo</p><p>and realize that it was a two-year-old photo</p><p>from someone else&#39;s Twitter account.</p><p>[Andrew sighing]</p><p>And this was after you realized</p><p>like you&#39;ve been had by this guy?</p><p>[Evelyn] I think so,</p><p>or like I was starting to get suspicious,</p><p>like it was somewhere in the ramp up.</p><p>The photo tied to a company</p><p>that was charged with being fraudulent.</p><p>And of course that freaked me out.</p><p>What also freaked me out</p><p>was the first time I made a big transaction</p><p>with most of the money,</p><p>the return on it was some ridiculous amount.</p><p>I thought, No way, something&#39;s up.</p><p>And so it wasn&#39;t that you lost money,</p><p>it was that you made so much money</p><p>that you were like, This can&#39;t be real,</p><p>or, Why is everyone not just making money this way?</p><p>[Evelyn] Exactly.</p><p>Okay, so in the timeline,</p><p>we&#39;re at this point where you&#39;ve put in your life savings,</p><p>you&#39;re up a suspicious [laughing] amount.</p><p>What happens next from there?</p><p>[Evelyn] I tried without Bruce</p><p>to take out all of the money,</p><p>going through the steps</p><p>that I had noted and screenshotted,</p><p>and it didn&#39;t work.</p><p>So I thought, Okay, well,</p><p>maybe I have to do it in smaller chunks.</p><p>Maybe there&#39;s a limit or something.</p><p>So I try to take out a little bit of money,</p><p>like couple thousand dollars,</p><p>about the same amount probably that I did before,</p><p>I still couldn&#39;t do it.</p><p>So then I messaged the support,</p><p>saying like, Hey, what&#39;s going on?</p><p>And I get a message back saying,</p><p>You have to put in 15% of the value of your account</p><p>to prove that you are legitimate</p><p>in order to take out the money,</p><p>entirely. Oh boy, I&#39;m getting stressed</p><p>just [laughing] thinking about this moment.</p><p>Were you freaking out at this point?</p><p>[Evelyn] Oh yeah, my blood ran cold,</p><p>and I kept trying,</p><p>without the tech support anymore,</p><p>like, No, no, no, no, no, this isn&#39;t happening.</p><p>First of all, even if that was true,</p><p>I no longer had 10% of the value</p><p>of this ridiculously fake amount of money</p><p>[laughing] that I now had, allegedly. Yeah.</p><p>[Evelyn] I think it was when I got that information</p><p>and I turned to Bruce and said, What is this?</p><p>Like what does this mean?</p><p>Why can&#39;t I get any money out?</p><p>And his response was,</p><p>Oh, didn&#39;t I tell you?</p><p>Like, yeah, that&#39;s their policy</p><p>to weed out the scammers.</p><p>[Andrew] Ah, uh-huh.</p><p>[Evelyn] Yeah, once he said that,</p><p>I was like, Oh, you&#39;re in on this.</p><p>[Andrew laughing] This is bad.</p><p>And then he tried to convince me</p><p>to borrow money to get my money back.</p><p>So I just stopped communicating with him</p><p>and just tried to come to grips</p><p>with what I had done,</p><p>what I, on my own two feet,</p><p>walked into the bank to do.</p><p>I still drive by that bank on a regular basis</p><p>and I inwardly cringe,</p><p>because I did that.</p><p>And I, for a little bit,</p><p>could not bring myself to tell anybody.</p><p>It was so shameful,</p><p>it was so embarrassing.</p><p>Mainly it was embarrassing.</p><p>And I did eventually go to the police,</p><p>the local police,</p><p>and then I also filled out the FBI digital scam something,</p><p>some department of theirs.</p><p>Like the police [laughing] was very upfront</p><p>in saying, there&#39;s nothing we can do,</p><p>because the pictures you have,</p><p>the information, the phone numbers,</p><p>like all of that could be fake.</p><p>In the Hollywood ending,</p><p>there&#39;d be a duffle bag full of money</p><p>that they walk out with</p><p>and hand over to me.</p><p>Right.</p><p>[Evelyn] But none of that happened.</p><p>And he flat out said like,</p><p>The volume, the lack of information</p><p>that could be true</p><p>just wasn&#39;t there.</p><p>[text whirring] [inquisitive music]</p><p>So what happens if you try to go to the cops?</p><p>The likelihood that a victim</p><p>will get their money back is slim.</p><p>The only hope lies</p><p>in tracing the movement of cryptocurrency.</p><p>An analysis of the movements of the crypto</p><p>stolen from Evelyn,</p><p>conducted by Chainalysis,</p><p>a firm whose tools are used by law enforcement</p><p>to inform investigations,</p><p>reveals the lengths scammers will go</p><p>to cover their tracks.</p><p>After Evelyn handed over the crypto,</p><p>it was divided into different wallets</p><p>and eventually cashed out through a selection of exchanges</p><p>based in multiple countries,</p><p>where it was blended with funds</p><p>stolen from other victims</p><p>and converted on multiple occasions</p><p>into different crypto tokens.</p><p>Each of these hops</p><p>is designed to further blur the origin of the funds</p><p>and limit the likelihood</p><p>an exchange might identify wrongdoing</p><p>and freeze the assets.</p><p>This indicates a high level of organization,</p><p>says Phil Larrat,</p><p>director of Cybersecurity Investigations at Chainalysis.</p><p>The sheer volume of scams like this one,</p><p>coupled with the lack of resources</p><p>and technical expertise among long enforcement</p><p>means investigations are rare.</p><p>These scams are extremely hard to investigate,</p><p>prosecute and disrupt, says Nicola Staub,</p><p>a former cyber crime prosecutor,</p><p>and now CEO of security startup, Cybera.</p><p>The estimates vary,</p><p>but all told, only a minute percentage of victims</p><p>ever see their money again.</p><p>Others even get scammed again by recovery scammers</p><p>who ask for upfront payment</p><p>in return for helping retrieve lost funds.</p><p>[text whirring] [pensive music]</p><p>So who are these scammers?</p><p>Pulling off long-term investment scams</p><p>can take hours of communication</p><p>and relationship building.</p><p>And researchers say that criminal organizations</p><p>develop scripts and playbooks</p><p>that allow them to offload the work at scale</p><p>on to inexperienced scammers.</p><p>And these inexperienced scammers</p><p>are often victims themselves.</p><p>Many of them have been subjected to human trafficking</p><p>and are enslaved at compounds</p><p>controlled by criminal gangs.</p><p>In Southeast Asia, for example,</p><p>it is believed that hundreds of thousands of people</p><p>have been trafficked to giant scam centers.</p><p>They&#39;re then forced to scam victims abroad</p><p>and can be beaten or tortured if they refuse</p><p>or try to leave.</p><p>A 2022 ProPublica investigation</p><p>into human trafficking and cyber scamming</p><p>has also shed light on how victims are smuggled</p><p>and sold into forced labor.</p><p>One example is Fawn, a 22-year-old from China.</p><p>In March of 2021,</p><p>Fawn was offered a marketing position</p><p>with what he thought</p><p>was a well-known food delivery company in Cambodia.</p><p>The proposed salary was $1,000 a month</p><p>and was enticing by local standards.</p><p>Fawn was so excited</p><p>that he told his older brother about the opportunity,</p><p>who then quit his job and joined him.</p><p>By the time they realized that the offer was a sham,</p><p>it was too late,</p><p>their new bosses wouldn&#39;t let them leave the compound</p><p>where they had been put to work.</p><p>Fawn was taken captive in 2021</p><p>and sold twice in 2022.</p><p>Each time he was sold,</p><p>his new captors raised the amount</p><p>he&#39;d have to pay to buy his freedom,</p><p>his debt more than doubled from $7,000 to $15,500</p><p>in a country where the annual per capita income</p><p>is about $1,600.</p><p>ProPublica also found that human traffickers</p><p>use apps like Telegram</p><p>to sell their victims.</p><p>One ad reads, Selling a Chinese man in Sihanoukville,</p><p>just smuggled from China,</p><p>22 years old with ID card,</p><p>typing very slow.</p><p>The problem of human trafficking</p><p>is likely to get worse,</p><p>especially with the dismantling of USAID,</p><p>as many efforts addressing forced labor compounds</p><p>that fuel digital fraud,</p><p>like investment scams,</p><p>are being cut.</p><p>[inquisitive music]</p><p>[text whirring]</p><p>Scammers are often constrained by their language skills</p><p>and ability to keep up conversations</p><p>with potentially hundreds of victims at a time</p><p>in numerous languages.</p><p>However, AI developments within the last two years,</p><p>including the launch of writing tools like ChatGPT,</p><p>are making it easier for criminals</p><p>to break down language barriers</p><p>and create the content they need for scamming.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest AI paradigm shift</p><p>comes from deep fakes.</p><p>Scammers are increasingly using machine learning systems</p><p>to allow for realtime face swapping.</p><p>This technology allows criminals</p><p>to change their appearance on video calls</p><p>with their victims,</p><p>making them realistically appear</p><p>to be a different person.</p><p>Such services are a game changer for scammers</p><p>because they allow attackers</p><p>to prove to victims in photos or realtime video calls</p><p>that they are who they claim to be.</p><p>Stephanie Baroude,</p><p>a criminal intelligence analyst</p><p>in Interpol&#39;s human trafficking unit,</p><p>says, The impact of AI</p><p>also needs to be considered</p><p>as part of an investment scammer&#39;s tactics</p><p>in the recruitment of other scammers.</p><p>Baroud says the recruitment ads</p><p>that lure people into being trafficked</p><p>used to be quote, Very generic,</p><p>and full of grammatical errors.</p><p>However, AI is making them appear</p><p>more polished and compelling.</p><p>It really is making it easier</p><p>to create a very realistic job offer, she says.</p><p>Unfortunately this will make it much more difficult</p><p>to identify which is the real</p><p>and which is the fake ads.</p><p>I&#39;m sure in some of your research</p><p>or reading some of the coverage of this,</p><p>you&#39;ve heard about this scam compounds</p><p>that are really prevalent in Southeast Asia.</p><p>And obviously it seems unlikely</p><p>we will ever know Bruce&#39;s identity,</p><p>but has it crossed your mind</p><p>that he might&#39;ve been,</p><p>you know, potentially a victim of human trafficking himself</p><p>and also be not necessarily</p><p>just a perpetrator in this whole system?</p><p>[Evelyn] Yeah, I found that out afterwards</p><p>that whoever he is himself</p><p>could be a victim too, just like you said,</p><p>which complicates it a little
