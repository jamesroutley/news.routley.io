    <h1>Proposed Renewal of the Registry Agreement for .NET</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-sc126="" id="main"><div _ngcontent-sc128=""><iti-additional-languages-container _ngcontent-sc128="" _nghost-sc121=""><!----></iti-additional-languages-container><!----><section _ngcontent-sc225="" main-content=""><div _ngcontent-sc225=""><iti-detail-section _ngcontent-sc225="" _nghost-sc221=""><h3 _ngcontent-sc221="">What We Need Your Input On</h3><!----><p>ICANN organization is posting for Public Comment the proposed agreement for renewal of the 2017 .NET Registry Agreement (.NET RA), set to expire on 30 June 2023. The renewal proposal is a result of bilateral discussions between ICANN and VeriSign, Inc. (Verisign), the Registry Operator for the .NET and .COM TLDs.</p>
<p>The proposed renewal agreement for the .NET Registry Agreement (.NET Renewal RA) is based on the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/registry-agreements/details/net?section=agreement">current .NET RA</a> with proposed modifications, including the incorporation of some provisions from the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/icann-decides-on-com-amendment-and-proposed-binding-letter-of-intent-between-icann-and-verisign-27-3-2020-en">Amendment 3 to the .COM Registry Agreement</a> and from the <a href="https://itp.cdn.icann.org/en/files/registry-agreement/proposed-clean-base-gtld-registry-agreement-11-01-2023-en.pdf" data-linktype="fileRedirectUrl">2023 Global Amendment</a> to the Base gTLD Registry Agreement (Base RA) which was recently approved by the generic top-level domain (gTLD) registries and is currently pending review by the ICANN Board of Directors.  </p>
<p>Below is a summary of key provisions in the proposed .NET Renewal RA that are materially different from the current .NET RA:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed .NET Renewal RA incorporates certain contractual obligations from the 2023 Global Amendment including:
<ul>
<li>A requirement to comply with the <a href="https://www.icann.org/gtld-rdap-profile">gTLD Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Profile</a>,</li>
<li>The plan to sunset certain requirements to provide Registration Data Directory Services (RDDS) via the WHOIS protocols on a date aligned with the WHOIS Sunset Date set forth in the 2023 Global Amendment,</li>
<li>Updated definitions for RDDS related terms,</li>
<li>Updated reporting requirements that include changes to address the advice from the ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee in <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-097-en.pdf">SAC097</a> related to inconsistent reporting of RDDS queries,</li>
<li>Service Level Requirements for RDAP availability, round-trip time, and update time,</li>
<li>Updates to Uniform Resource Locator (URL) web addresses in the RA and miscellaneous changes (e.g., URLs updated to “https” from “http”) to address outdated links.</li>
<li>Adjustments to the allowable uses by ICANN of the Bulk Registration Data Access (BRDA) to include research purposes. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commitments related to combating DNS security threats similar to those in the Base RA’s Specification 11, Sections 3A and 3B.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please know that the attached Redline of the Proposed .NET Renewal Registry Agreement to the 2017 .NET Registry Agreement reflects not only the changes noted above but also revisions that were made as part of Amendment 1 to the .NET RA and as part of 2022 revisions to Verisign’s RRA which is incorporated into the RA.</p>
<p>In addition to the proposed renewal agreement, ICANN and Verisign propose to amend the binding <a href="https://itp.cdn.icann.org/en/files/registry-agreements/com/com-proposed-loi-03jan20-en.pdf" data-linktype="fileRedirectUrl">Letter of Intent</a> (LOI) dated 27 March 2020 for two purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>To extend the commitment by Verisign to adopt enhanced contractual provisions addressing security threats (which includes the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/icann-and-contracted-parties-negotiate-about-improved-dns-abuse-requirements-18-01-2023-en">ongoing DNS Abuse negotiations</a>) into the .NET RA, as already provided for in the LOI for the .COM RA.</li>
<li>To add an agreement that the parties develop mutually agreed upon requirements appropriate for the .COM and .NET TLDs for reporting security incidents to ICANN. This is based on recommendations by the Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) in its 3 November 2015 Advisory (<a href="https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-074-en.pdf">SAC074</a>) which were <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/board-activities-and-meetings/materials/approved-board-resolutions-regular-meeting-of-the-icann-board-04-02-2018-en#1.f">approved</a> by the ICANN Board in February 2018.</li>
