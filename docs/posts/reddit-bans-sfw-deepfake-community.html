    <h1>Reddit bans ‘SFW’ deepfake community</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mvp-content-main"><p>Over the weekend, apparently sometime around Sunday, Reddit banned the apparently ‘SFW’ (Safe For Work) <a href="https://www.unite.ai/what-are-deepfakes/">deepfakes</a> community titled <a href="https://reddit.com/r/deepfakesfw/">r/deepfakesfw</a>. The subreddit was one of the early responses to the social media giant’s prompt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/08/reddit-bans-deepfakes-face-swap-porn-community">deletion</a> of the original, AI-porn-ridden r/deepfakes sub in 2018.</p><p>The (relatively) boiler-plate legend that <a href="https://archive.ph/tjOkK">now greets</a> (archive snapshot taken Monday, June 13) anyone visiting the sub explains that it <em><i>‘was banned due to a violation of Reddit’s <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">rules</a> against involuntary pornography’</i></em>.</p><div id="attachment_181903"><p><a href="https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:auto/h:auto/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deepfakesfw-banned-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181903" src="https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:562/h:352/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deepfakesfw-banned-1.jpg" alt="The new front page for r/deepfakesfw." width="562" height="352" srcset="https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:850/h:532/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deepfakesfw-banned-1.jpg 850w, https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:300/h:188/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deepfakesfw-banned-1.jpg 300w, https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:240/h:150/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deepfakesfw-banned-1.jpg 240w, https://ml8ygptwlcsq.i.optimole.com/fMKjlhs.QRSi~1ce64/w:768/h:481/q:mauto/https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/deepfakesfw-banned-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-181903"><em>The new front page for r/deepfakesfw.</em></p></div><p>The r/deepfakesfw sub was not frequently archived by popular conservation platforms, but the most <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220603181038/https:/reddit.com/r/deepfakesfw/">recent WayBack Machine snapshot</a>, taken around ten days ago (on 3rd June 2022), indicates that the sub had 3,095 readers at that time.</p><p>That’s actually a higher number of subscribers than <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DeepFakesSFW/">r/DeepFakesSFW</a> (note the extra ‘s’), which currently has <a href="https://archive.ph/uyt5g">2,827 readers</a> (archive snapshot taken Monday, June 13, 2022).

I reached out to the sole listed moderator of r/DeepFakesSFW about this, and will post any available updates.</p><p>Most of the content at this subreddit, and at the larger r/SFWdeepfakes is concerned with using deepfake technology to ‘recast’ actors from popular or classic movies, or otherwise to have some more innocuous AI-driven fun with popular media and deepfake technology, and do indeed qualify as ‘SFW’.</p><p>Even though many such posts skirt perilously close to copyright-driven bans, the continuing survival of ‘IP-appropriated’ non-porn deepfake video posts by major YouTube deepfakers such as Ctrl-Shift-Face suggest a broad studio and rights-holder tolerance towards such activity, at least for the time being.</p><h3><strong>The ‘Innocent’ Appearance of the Deepfake Process and Ecostructure</strong></h3><p>Two weeks ago it <a href="https://www.unite.ai/google-has-banned-the-training-of-deepfakes-in-colab/">came to light</a> (and much <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31538595">discussion</a>) that Google had suddenly banned deepfake-creation software from its popular Colab cloud processing environments. Even to date, Colab is apparently only ‘triggered’ by attempts to run <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab">DeepFaceLab</a> (DFL), the most popular deepfakes software in the world (and the one most <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb7b7/ethical-deepfakes-deep-tom-cruise-ai-generated-porn">closely associated with AI porn</a>), rather than less-frequented implementations such as <a href="https://faceswap.dev/">FaceSwap</a>, which is better-reputed, even though it performs exactly the same tasks as DFL.</p><p>To an extent, this approach may have been the only way that Colab could have implemented <em><i>any</i></em> restriction on the production of deepfake pornography, since the actual deepfake training process uses nothing but open source software and highly-cropped face images (usually at a mere 512x512px, often less), with almost zero possibility for image recognition algorithms to intercept any actual pornographic content.</p><p>By the time the deepfake model is trained, the deepfaker no longer needs the enormous processing power of Colab or an expensive local GPU. Most actual <em><i>conversions</i></em> (i.e. the process of imposing a face into a video, pornographic or otherwise), can be accomplished locally, on low-powered laptop GPUs – or even on a CPU (with a slightly longer processing time). By the time anything pornographic is happening in the deepfake process, Colab has long since been cut out of the picture.</p><p>Therefore, the constituent elements that pass between creators of deepfake porn rarely represent more than a potential minor copyright infringement, in the form of the passing around of ‘face sets’, which deepfake creators have extracted from YouTube videos, Blu-rays, televised interviews, social media, and various other sources.</p><h3><strong>Is a ‘Scorched Earth’ Policy Coming for Deepfake Communities?</strong></h3><p>The question that haunts the denizens of deepfake Discord communities such as <a href="https://discord.com/channels/797172242697682985/797390188732219392">DeepFaceLab</a> (including <a href="https://www.unite.ai/real-time-deepfake-streaming-with-deepfacelive/">DeepFaceLive</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/channels/441989398465085440/441989398465085442">FaceSwap</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/730623345288151060/730634974746771606">Machine Video Editor</a> (MVE, a GUI-based <a href="https://github.com/MachineEditor/MachineVideoEditor">environment for DFL</a>, with many added features), and new audio-based deepfake Discord servers such as <a href="https://discord.com/channels/718568156980838501/732627897008914514">Audio Deepfakes</a> is <em><i>Will current portal and platform owners soon simply ban deepfake communities on principle, rather than bear the expense of constant moderation against a tide of NSFW adherents and creators?</i></em></p><p>Bryan Lyon, one of the developers of FaceSwap, and owner of the project’s associated Discord server, commented<sup>†</sup>:</p><p><em> ‘We’ve managed to stay on Discord, despite several purges, by staying absolutely squeaky clean. We don’t have any hidden channels or a secret second server with illicit content. There was a purge of the popular DeepFaceLab server a couple of years back. Everyone on it got banned. They had invite-only roles with access to channels with non-consensual pornography.’</em></p><p>Given that Google, itself one of the world’s largest technological hosting resources, has blanket-banned deepfake training on its servers and GPUs, it’s even possible that the Microsoft-owned GitHub may decide that <a href="https://archive.ph/OSvV9">facilitating these technologies</a>* will eventually not be worth the moral ambiguity or investment of oversight.</p><p>At this time, the process of legitimizing deepfake technologies so that their use transits away from homespun porn towards movie and TV production, and non-infringing/criminal uses, is too nascent to produce clear policy guidelines for platforms and community host services.</p><p><em><i>* Archive of https://github.com/search?q=deepfake from Monday, June 13, 2022.</i></em></p><p><em><i>First published 13th June 2022.
