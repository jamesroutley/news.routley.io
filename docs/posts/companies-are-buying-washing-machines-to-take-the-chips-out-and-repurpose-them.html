But it has become so dire that large industrial companies are buying washing machines in order to rip out the chips and repurpose them, according to ASML CEO Peter Wennink.</p><hr/><p>“Now, we could say that’s an anecdote,” he said on the company’s earnings call Wednesday. “But to be honest, it happens everywhere — it is 15-, 20-, 25-year-old semiconductor technology that is now being used everywhere.” </p><p>Wennink said that internet of things is likely driving the demand for these older chips found inside home appliances.</p><p>The Dutch company makes lithography tools that chip giants such as TSMC, Intel, and Samsung use to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/intel-euv-fab-chips" target="_blank">manufacture their most advanced processors</a>. Wennink has a unique view of the semiconductor supply issues since ASML deals with a wide range of businesses around the world. And business is good: It <a href="https://www.asml.com/-/media/asml/files/investors/financial-results/q-results/2022/q1/financial-statements-us-gaap-q1-2022-y7k3s6.pdf?rev=ec86e1e389fe424fa47e08eb1a64e7c6" target="_blank">reported a net profit</a> of €695.3 million ($754.3 million) on sales of €3.53 billion.</p><p>ASML itself is struggling to build all of the tools its customers want, and is trying to figure out how to produce just over 700 lithography tools in total every year. Wennink said in the earnings call that he would be happy if he could fulfill 60% of the orders ASML has received this year. According to Bernstein analyst Mark Li, it is likely ASML will struggle to fulfill demand through 2023.</p></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Amazon has long held a tight grip over its third-party merchants. Sellers get access to its massive fulfillment centers, shipping services and the coveted Prime logo if they sell on Amazon.com. But now, Amazon is loosening some of its hold on merchants by allowing them to sell goods with Prime benefits on their own sites, which could allow the e-commerce giant to swallow more of the industry.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The company is introducing <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-unveils-buy-prime-expanding-prime-shopping-benefits?ots=1&amp;slotNum=4&amp;imprToken=20c0261c-3eb8-5c28-262&amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22799233%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/2022%5Bd%5DD" target="_blank">Buy With Prime</a>, which lets merchants who use Amazon&#39;s services (warehouses and delivery) add a button to their site that allows customers to purchase with Prime benefits. That means Prime subscribers who buy goods off a third-party site will still have access to free shipping, next-day delivery and free returns. Amazon said the initiative will start with Amazon sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon, and it&#39;ll expand to other merchants throughout this year.</p><p>The initiative is another push for Amazon to become the biggest delivery service in the game. Dave Clark, the company&#39;s head of worldwide consumer, said late last year that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/amazon-on-track-to-be-largest-us-delivery-service-by-2022-exec-says.html" target="_blank">it&#39;s on track</a> to overtake UPS and FedEx as the biggest package delivery service in the U.S. By adding Prime benefits to sites other than Amazon&#39;s, it&#39;ll be increasingly convenient to use the company&#39;s fulfillment and delivery services to attract more customers (even with its added fuel and inflation <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/amazon-seller-fuel-surcharge" target="_blank">fees</a>). </p><p>“For over 20 years, we’ve been empowering small and medium-sized businesses with opportunities to grow,” Peter Larsen, Amazon’s VP of Buy with Prime, said in a release. “Allowing merchants to offer Prime shopping benefits on their own direct-to-consumer online stores is an exciting next step in our mission to help merchants of all sizes grow their business — whether on Amazon or beyond.”</p><p><span></span>Buy With Prime also shows that Amazon is becoming a bit more like Shopify, which already allows merchants to build their own storefronts. Shopify doesn&#39;t provide its own marketplace for sellers, but instead <a href="https://www.shopify.com/free-trial?term=shopify&amp;adid=565872334073&amp;campaignid=15436644439&amp;branded_enterprise=1&amp;BOID=brand&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgYSTBhDKARIsAB8Kuku8_DqIDP19NcJeARridGy1QDjuI0EXiFMxnSxL64i0sBFfReTKvAAaAsmzEALw_wcB&amp;cmadid=516586854;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494812;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011" target="_blank">gives merchants</a> the tools to get started and takes care of marketing goods and payment. </p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>The Workplace Technology Accountability Act, or <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1651" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 1651</a>, would regulate the use of worker surveillance technology to protect worker privacy, Cal Matters <a href="https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2022/04/california-workers-surveillance/" target="_blank">reported</a> Tuesday. Specifically, the bill would require employers to give workers advance notice about any monitoring technology that was being used to track them. Employers would also be banned from monitoring workers on personal devices or after hours, and workers would be able to view and correct data about themselves, according to Cal Matters.</p><p>AB 1651 would also ban employers from using electronic monitoring systems that use “facial recognition, gait, or emotion recognition technology.” (Emotion AI is also popping up on <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/emotion-ai-sales-virtual-zoom" target="_self">sales calls</a>, in customer service software, in <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/last-mile-delivery-data-commerce" target="_self">delivery</a> and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/driver-monitoring-ai-infrastructure-bill" target="_self">passenger vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/emotion-ai-school-intel-edutech" target="_self">in the classroom</a>.)</p><p>The bill moved past the Assembly’s Committee on Labor and Employment on Wednesday with a 5-2 vote, according to the office of Assemblyman Ash Kalra, D-San Jose, who introduced the bill on Monday.

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>After some question of will-he-or-won&#39;t-he, Elon Musk joined Tesla&#39;s first-quarter earnings call Wednesday. Surprisingly to some, the Tesla CEO had nothing to say about his current side project — <a href="https://www.protocol.com/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-faq" target="_blank">making a hostile takeover bid</a> for his <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/elon-musk-twitter-offense" target="_blank">favorite social network</a>, Twitter — and instead focused on what appears to be his new favorite topic: lithium mining.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>Tesla had a huge quarter, significantly beating analyst estimates with profit of $3.32 billion on $18.7 billion in revenue (up 81% year-over-year). And while many had hoped Musk would give some hints as to what&#39;s next with Twitter, he instead outlined what&#39;s next for Tesla. Here are a few key takeaways from Tesla&#39;s earnings call.<br/></p><p><strong>Tesla absolutely crushed Wall Street expectations.</strong><br/></p><p><strong></strong>According to <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-price-earnings-51650454399?tesla=y" target="_blank">Barron&#39;s</a>, Wall Street anticipated earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 a share and around $18 billion in revenue, estimates that Tesla beat handily. The company also made around $1 billion more in operating profit than analysts expected. Tesla&#39;s share price jumped around 5% in after-hours trading, up to $1,017 per share from closing at around $976.</p><p><strong>Musk wants more people to get into the lithium business.</strong><br/></p><p>The supply chain is squeezing Tesla tight. One major supply chain challenge the company is facing is lithium, though not because of there&#39;s a shortage of it. Musk said the element is &#34;almost everywhere,&#34; but the steps to refine it are expensive and arduous. Musk sees this as an issue for the entire EV industry. His solution? More people need to get into the lithium business, he said.  </p><p><strong></strong>&#34;Can some more people please get into the lithium business?&#34; Musk said. &#34;Do you like minting money? Well the lithium business is for you.&#34;</p><p>The supply chain issues lead to one boon for the company: Part of the reason it had a high profit margin is that due to the higher average selling price of its vehicles (the company raised the prices of its entire fleet by <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/tesla-price-hike-inflation%5D" target="_self">5% to 10%</a> this past quarter). But because of this, he doesn&#39;t anticipate vehicle prices will rise again soon. </p><p>&#34;Our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that ... we believe will happen over the next six to 12 months,&#34; Musk said. &#34;That&#39;s that&#39;s why we have the price increases today, because a car order today will arrive in some cases a year from now.&#34;</p><p><strong>The company will host a product event for its long-awaited RoboTaxi next year. </strong></p><p>Musk has been talking about a Tesla RoboTaxi, essentially a driverless Uber, for years. Now it looks like the company is closer to actually getting them on the road. Musk didn&#39;t divulge too many details, but said the company is planning to host a product event next year, and is aiming for volume production in 2024.</p><p>He also anticipates that they will be really, really cheap. </p><p>&#34;Looking at some of our projections, it would appear that a RoboTaxi ride will cost less than a ... subsidized bus ticket or a subsidized subway ticket,&#34; Musk said. </p><p>We&#39;ll believe it when we see it.</p><p><strong>Musk predicts Tesla Bots will be a bigger business than cars.</strong><strong></strong></p><p>Musk is a big believer in Tesla&#39;s company&#39;s Optimus project, which aims to create full-fledged humanoid robots called Tesla Bots. Tesla Bots, first announced <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/tesla-bot" target="_blank">last August</a>, will be 5&#39;8&#34; tall, weighs 125 pounds, and can move at about five miles per hour. It&#39;ll run an Autopilot system similar to that of Tesla cars. Musk said in the earnings call that the program&#39;s importance &#34;will become apparent in the coming years.&#34; </p><p>&#34;I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program,&#34; Musk said. &#34;Those who are insightful or looking listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business.&#34; </p><p>Well, OK! We look forward to seeing how Musk&#39;s many projects turn out. In the meantime...lithium mining, anyone?</p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>The proposed union, which would be called the Apple Workers Union, would have 107 workers. Around 70% of the store&#39;s workers signed cards in support of the election, and plan to file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board Wednesday afternoon. The effort is backed by the Communication Workers of America.  </p><p>“Right now, I think, is the right time because we simply see momentum swinging the way of workers,” Cumberland Apple Store employee and union organizer Derrick Bowles told Bloomberg Law. “As we sat back and re-evaluated, what we realized is that we love being at Apple — and leaving Apple, that’s not something any of us wants to do. But improving it is something we wanted to do.”</p><p>The move comes after a group of Apple Store employees at the Grand Central flagship store in Manhattan on Monday announced their intention to try to form a legally-recognized union. The group, which calls itself the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/apple-retail-workers-union" target="_blank">Fruit Stand Workers United</a>, have to convince at least 30% of their retail peers at the Grand Central location to sign union interest affiliation cards.  </p><p>Both groups aim to raise base wages, with the Atlanta location seeking a $28 per hour starting wage and Manhattan store seeking $30 per hour, up from the $20 per hour base pay Apple currently offers retail employees. The Manhattan store is also asking for better benefits, including increased tuition reimbursements and 401(k) matches. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/apple-retail-employee-unions" target="_blank">Reports</a> of unionization efforts at Apple retail locations first emerged in February, with two then-unnamed stores planning to file union paperwork with the NLRB. </p><p>“Somebody has got to be the first to do something,” Bowles told Bloomberg Law. “Being first doesn’t matter to us — doing it is what matters to us. And if we have to be first we will be first.”</p><p>Tech company employees have in recent months been organizing for improved working conditions. This month, Amazon <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/amazon-workers-unionize?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_blank">warehouse workers</a> in Staten Island formed the company&#39;s first union following a hard fight to organize in the face of Amazon&#39;s pushback. Google Fiber contract employees also <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-fiber-employees-vote-unionize" target="_blank">successfully unionized</a> in late March, becoming the Alphabet Workers Union&#39;s first recognized bargaining unit.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Last month Instagram decided to finally let users see the most recent posts first in their feed. Now the company is testing something on the opposite spectrum, removing the &#34;recent&#34; tab from the hashtag page. The reason, Instagram said, is to help users connect with &#34;more interesting and relevant content.&#34; But really this seems like yet another play to compete with TikTok.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>Instagram <a href="https://twitter.com/instagramcomms/status/1516458971149701121?s=21&amp;t=axbQfYia_YxRnnAS0k3MJA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced on Twitter</a> Tuesday that users involved in the test now will see just two tabs: Top, where the most popular content will be displayed, and Reels, where you&#39;ll see videos (presumably many of which will be lifted straight from TikTok).</p><p>Instagram parent company Meta has been transparent about how much it’s relying on Reels for growth. Facebook’s user growth <a href="https://www.protocol.com/meta-facebook-users-drop" target="_self">declined for the first time</a> last quarter, but Zuckerberg said Reels were Meta’s fastest-growing content type. And even though most Reels content is just <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/reels-tiktok-instagram-spam" target="_self">3-week-old TikToks</a>, Meta continues to lean in to the short-form video format. Instagram rolled out a menu of options for creators to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-reels-global" target="_self">monetize Reels</a> in mid-February, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/dining/instagram-algorithm-reels.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">algorithm pushes</a> the looping videos more than most other content. Now, the company is being a little less discreet, increasing the odds users scroll through the videos by eliminating other options.</p>The hashtag change comes on the heels of Instagram rolling out several new features. Creators can now <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/instagram-tests-new-feature-to-help-users-support-social-causes/articleshow/90513102.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support causes</a> through hashtags, for example. All users can also now tag products in their posts, whereas before this feature was only available to brands and designated creators.</template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Coinbase has unveiled a long-awaited NFT marketplace, amping up the competition in a fast-growing sector that&#39;s been dominated by a single player, OpenSea.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The crypto exchange announced Wednesday <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/gm-coinbase-nft-is-now-in-beta-25e6c052aa43" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the beta launch of Coinbase NFT</a> where users can check out an initial collection for sale on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Beta testers will be able to buy and sell NFTs with a Coinbase wallet or a self-custody wallet. The company is waiving transaction fees “for a limited time,” Sanchan Saxena, vice president of product for ecosystem products, said in a blog post.</p><p>Fees eventually will be added and will be “in-line with Web3 industry standards, and we’ll provide notice before anything changes,” Saxena said. OpenSea charges a 2.5% fee, and allows NFT creators to set their own fees, including royalties on subsequent sales.</p><p>Coinbase announced late last year that it was expanding to NFTs which exploded last year into a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/nft-market-surpassed-40-billion-in-2021-new-estimate-shows" target="_blank">$40 billion market</a>.</p><p>The move is seen as a direct challenge to OpenSea, which shares investors with Coinbase, most notably Andreessen Horowitz. Coinbase is betting on its ability to offer a better and simpler way for users to dabble in NFTs, which is known to be a complicated and expensive process. OpenSea doesn&#39;t offer its own wallet, and <a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500007978402-What-crypto-wallets-can-I-use-with-OpenSea-" target="_blank">recommends Coinbase&#39;s wallet among others</a>.</p><p>Users “don’t just want better tools to buy and sell NFTs: they want better ways to discover them, better ways to find the right communities, and better spaces in which they can feel connected with each other,” Saxena said.</p><p>Coinbase is starting with a select group of users from a waitlist who will be invited to check out the NFT marketplace. </p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Less than a year after Grubhub was tossed around like a hot potato, the company that ended up buying the food ordering platform is looking to sell. Just Eat Takeaway.com, GrubHub&#39;s current owner, is reportedly exploring a sale, so get those oven mitts ready. </p>
            
            <div><template><p>The European company is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/20/just-eat-takeaway-is-exploring-a-sale-of-grubhub.html" target="_blank">facing pressure from shareholders</a> to sell all or part of its U.S. arm. Just Eat bought Grubhub for $7.3 billion at the time, and its market value now sits at about $5.8 billion. The dip in valuation is due in part to demand for services like food delivery <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/20/just-eat-takeaway-considers-selling-us-arm-grubhub-as-orders-fall" target="_blank">dropping off</a> as pandemic-related restrictions wane. In a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/just-eat-takeaway-shares-rally-after-putting-grubhub-on-the-block-2022-04-20#:~:text=%22The%20Management%20Board%20confirms%20its,highly%20attractive%20portfolio%20of%20assets." target="_blank">trading update</a>, Just Eat said order fell 1% in the first quarter, with an even steeper decline of 5% in North America.<br/></p><p>The company&#39;s board said in that update that it &#34;confirms its alignment with shareholders in wanting to both create and realize value from the company’s highly attractive portfolio of assets.&#34; The European company couldn&#39;t guarantee a sale or timeline for such a move, but it said &#34;further announcements will made as and when appropriate.&#34;</p><p>&#34;We are in talks with people around this (a sale), but I need to caution that doesn&#39;t automatically lead to a transaction,&#34; Just Eat CEO Jitse Groen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/just-eat-takeaway-weighs-grubhub-sale-scales-back-2022-growth-view-2022-04-20/" target="_blank">said</a>. Groen added that the company hired banks to look into a sale, and buyers have showed strong interest.</p><p>GrubHub took a winding road to get to this point. It began looking for a buyer in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grubhub-considers-strategic-options-including-possible-sale-11578505832" target="_blank">early 2020</a>, a few months before the pandemic shuttered the world. Both Uber and Delivery Hero both <a href="https://www.protocol.com/uber-buying-grubhub-what-does-it-mean" target="_self">showed interest</a>, with things heating up in May 2020. Those talks fell apart a couple of months later, and that&#39;s when Just Eat <a href="https://www.protocol.com/uber-grubhub-deal-antitrust" target="_blank">emerged as a buyer</a>. The company finalized the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/just-eat-takeawaycom-completes-acquisition-of-grubhub-301312124.html" target="_blank">purchase of GrubHub</a> in June 2021. The marriage has been rocky from the start, though, at least in some shareholders&#39; eyes.</p><p>Even before Tuesday, Just Eat investors have pressed the company to sell Grubhub. Activist investor Cat Rock Capital asked Just Eat to sell in October, saying it needs to &#34;refocus its business on Europe.&#34; At the time, Groen said Just Eat wouldn&#39;t look into a sale and instead <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/stock-index/2021/just-eat-takeaway-stock-falls-ceo-says-he-wont-sell-grubhub/" target="_blank">look for</a> &#34;strategic partnerships.&#34; But with orders down and the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/uber-lyft-mask-mandate-lifted" target="_blank">world continuing to reopen</a>, it looks like the calculus has changed.</p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>Tesla alleges that the state agency filed  its lawsuit in February as part of a &#34;turf war&#34; with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is investigating the company separately. Tesla&#39;s lawyers said in a filing that the state&#39;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing&#39;s three-year investigation prior to suing was &#34;bare bones,&#34; and that the agency didn&#39;t make the company aware of many worker complaints until after the lawsuit was filed. </p><p>Tesla is seeking to pause the lawsuit for 120 days, as well as make the agency mediate with the company outside of court, according to Reuters. </p><p>The Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/california-tesla-discrimination-lawsuit" target="_blank">brought the lawsuit</a> in mid-February, alleging that Tesla&#39;s factory in Fremont is a racially-segregated workplace. Kevin Kish, the agency&#39;s director, told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-sued-by-california-civil-rights-agency-for-alleged-racial-discrimination-harassment-11644468985?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> in February that the factory&#39;s Black employees are discriminated against in job assignments and pay, &#34;subjected to racial slurs&#34; by supervisors and managers and faced racist graffiti in the factory&#39;s restrooms and work stations. </p><p>Tesla responded to the lawsuit in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/dfehs-misguided-lawsuit" target="_blank">blog post</a>, calling the agency&#39;s efforts &#34;misguided,&#34; and a &#34;narrative spun by the DFEH and a handful of plaintiff firms to generate publicity.&#34; Tesla said in its blog post from February that it intended to ask the court pause the case once the lawsuit was filed.</p><p>This isn&#39;t Tesla&#39;s first run-in with allegations of discrimination. Six employees filed lawsuits against the company for alleged sexual harassment in December, and in October, former employee Owen Diaz <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/tesla-loses-racial-discrimination-case" target="_self">won</a> a lawsuit claiming that Tesla subjected him to a racially hostile workplace — though his award was reduced from a nearly $137 million to $15 million <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-judge-cuts-verdict-tesla-race-bias-case-15-mln-137-mln-2022-04-14/" target="_blank">last week</a>. More than 100 Tesla employees have been <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/tesla-fremont-racism-discrimination" target="_self">granted the right to sue</a> in the past three years, mostly on the basis of race-based complaints.</p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>Six Amazon employees were killed by the Edwardsville tornado, one of several tornadoes that wreaked havoc across Illinois and Kentucky and killed more than 80 people on Dec. 11. The distribution center where they were working partially collapsed and injured several more workers, including four delivery drivers who are named in the new suits against the company.</p><p>The<a href="https://bencrump.com/press/attorneys-ben-crump-and-bob-hilliard-file-lawsuits-on-behalf-of-amazon-workers-victims-of-amazon-warehouse-collapse-during-deadly-tornadoes/" target="_blank"> lawsuits </a>against Amazon were filed on behalf of Deon January, the mother of killed worker DeAndre Morrow, and four drivers who were injured by the collapse: Jamarco Hickman, Evan Jensen, Jada Williams, and Deontae Yancey. The plaintiffs are represented by Ben Crump, the attorney who represented George Floyd&#39;s family and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-sued-racial-discrimination" target="_blank">also represents a former Google recruiter </a>suing the company over racial discrimination, as well as Bob Hilliard of Hilliard Martinez Gonzales and Patrick King and William Miller of MillerKing Law Firm. </p><p>The suit accuses Amazon of failing to address safety hazards in the warehouse, failing to properly follow tornado warning procedures, and failing to provide adequate tornado shelters, among a number of other allegations. Federal regulators with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration <a href="https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1568095.015" target="_blank">have a still-ongoing investigation</a> into the tornado collapse; OHSA regulators investigate all workplace fatalities as a standard practice. Members of the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/amazon-warehouse-safety-investigation" target="_blank">also requested information </a>from Amazon about working conditions and warehouse safety with regard to the Edwardsville tornado earlier this month. </p><p>“Amazon had numerous warnings and opportunities to put their employees’ safety first, but they chose their bottom line instead,” Crump said in a press release about the lawsuits.</p><p>Amazon did not immediately respond to request for comment. </p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Delta CEO Ed Bastian confirmed on Tuesday that the airline is testing SpaceX&#39;s satellite internet service. He told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/delta-air-lines-tested-spacexs-starlink-internet-for-planes-delta-ceo-says-11650316287?mod=tech_lead_pos3" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> that the company has held talks with Starlink about bringing its satellite Wi-Fi on board, and has conducted exploratory tests, but didn&#39;t release and further details of the partnership. The tests could mean that Starlink service will be available for free on Delta flights, given that Bastian previously told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-wi-fi-isnt-free-on-airlines-1532520000?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> that in-flight Wi-Fi should be a free service.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>Delta has deployed Viasat&#39;s satellite internet service, which costs passengers $5, on 300 planes so far. Moving to Starlink would likely take a few years, given that Delta would have to outfit its planes with Starlink equipment (and presumably the company has a deal with Viasat).</p><p>SpaceX has been building out Starlink for the past several years, and has been considering expanding to airlines since last year. Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX&#39;s vice president of Starlink and Commercial Sales, said at a conference last June that the company was “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/spacex-starlink-talking-to-airlines-about-in-flight-satellite-internet.html" target="_blank">in talks with several</a>” airlines about providing travelers with in-flight service. Hofeller also said at a conference last month that Starlink believes in-flight internet needs to be upgraded, and that “the expectation has changed faster than the technology,” according to the Wall Street Journal. </p><p>CEO Elon Musk also tweeted last year that he was working on getting <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1408565146218283014" target="_blank">regulatory approval</a> for its use in the Boeing 737 and A320 to &#34;serve most number of people.&#34; However, SpaceX has some competition in airline Wi-Fi, with Intelsat and Viasat already offering services to thousands of planes. </p><p>Inking a contract with Delta could prove to be a big boost for Starlink, as the high cost of materials recently forced the company to hike its <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/starlink-price-increase-inflation" target="_blank">installation fees</a> by 20% and its monthly residential subscription by 10%. The company last year had also been working on cutting the production cost of Starlink terminals, which reportedly ran around $1,000 per terminal. </p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>Both of those steps are huge departures for Netflix, which has in the past mostly ignored account sharing and dismissed the idea of ad-supported streaming. &#34;Allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising-tolerant to get what they want makes a lot of sense,&#34; said Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings during the company&#39;s earnings call Tuesday afternoon.<br/></p><p>Hastings said that the company was looking into the possibility of a lower-priced, ad-supported tier now, and may launch it within the next two years. &#34;Think of us as quite open to offering even lower prices with advertising as a consumer choice,&#34; he said.</p><p>More immediately, Netflix is looking to lean on a segment of the market that knows Netflix all too well: an estimated 100 million households that participate in account sharing. “This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service,” the company said in its letter to investors. “While we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity.”</p><p>Netflix COO Greg Peters said during Tuesday’s earnings call that the company is looking to monetize account sharing by asking people who share accounts with family members who don’t live in the same household to pay a bit more — something the company recently began to test in South America.<br/></p><p>“We’re trying to find a balanced approach here,” Peters said, adding that it may take up to a year to roll out those changes globally. It will take a while to work this out and to get the balance right,” he said.</p><p>In its <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/FINAL-Q1-22-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank">letter to investors</a>, Netflix had attributed part of this downturn to its decision to leave Russia as a result of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, detailing that this resulted in a net loss of 700,000 subscribers.</p><p>However, Netflix executives also admitted that they had overestimated the company’s near-term growth potential following a massive wave of subscriber additions early during the pandemic. Instead, the company is dealing with a number of issues, which include ongoing COVID-19 uncertainties as well as a slowed uptake of smart TVs due to supply chain disruptions. Finally, executives specifically called out growing competitive pressure in the streaming market — a departure from statements made in the past.</p><p><span></span>Netflix executives were frank about the fact that there is no quick fix to those problems, and forecasted that the company will lose another 2 million subscribers in Q2, compared to the 1.5 million it added in the same quarter last year. That number alone was enough to send investors to the hills; the share price is down close to 23% in after-hours trading.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>On Tuesday, DoorDash released its <a href="https://doordash.news/community/esgreport2021/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first ESG report</a> since going public in 2020. The report spans everything from insights about merchants and Dashers to community impact and sustainability at the delivery service company. The report outlines diversity and representation at DoorDash and shows the demographics of both its contract workers and corporate employees.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The report shows that 58% of Dashers in the U.S. are women, and 38% are people of color. </p><p>“I would be very, very happy seeing that metric continue to grow,” Katy Shields, the head of People at DoorDash, told Protocol. “I think flexible work really matters, particularly for women, and for people of color. And I think part of the differentiation I&#39;ve seen us make an investment in is the safety and the ways that people can highlight their safety, [or] flag if they&#39;re not feeling safe.” </p><p>When it comes to global corporate employees, women are just shy of making up half of the workforce. Currently, 46% of total DoorDash employees are women and non-binary people, up from 44% the year prior. Representation of women in leadership is lower. In 2021, women accounted for 40% of leadership at the director level and above, up from 35% the year prior. </p><p>In terms of racial diversity, in the U.S., 16% of corporate employees identify as Black and 13% identify as Hispanic or Latino. And the percentage of underrepresented employees in technical roles remains low at 7% of DoorDash’s U.S. employee base. The company reported that it&#39;s aiming to increase the number of underrepresented workers in technical roles to 10% by 2025. </p><p>DoorDash also hopes to increase the percentage of underrepresented employees in leadership from 12% to 20% by 2025.</p><p>DoorDash <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/diversity-tracker/" target="_self">trends slightly ahead of other tech companies</a> when it comes to racial diversity. By comparison, Uber reported about 10% of its staff identified as Black and 8% identified as Latinx in 2021. The numbers were even lower at Meta, where Black and Hispanic employees account for about 4% and 7% of its U.S. workforce respectively. Protocol <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/diversity-tracker/diversity-report-recent-companies" target="_blank">continues to track publicly</a> released diversity data for some of the largest U.S. tech companies. </p><p>Shields points to DoorDash’s leadership accelerator program as one of the ways it promotes diversity higher in the ranks at the company. Its Elevate program focuses on getting more women of color around the leadership table. It has also been a major retention play for the company. Shields shared that the retention rate of participants after a year of completing the program is 91%. “We drive these more curated, highly personal, niche and very hands-on programs to increase representation,” she said. </p><p>In fall 2020, DoorDash leaders also began to make it an imperative that employees be able to demonstrate a “DEI track record” in order to be eligible for promotions at the senior level, said Shields. </p><p>“And what we mean by that is you&#39;re actively diversifying your team, [and] you are actively driving the type of culture where women and people of color will want to work for you,” she said. </p><p>Her team has also built similar guidance in their employee performance ratings model. In order to be eligible for strong performance ratings at the leadership level, employees must also demonstrate that they have a strong DEI track record in recruiting and hiring.</p><p>“I&#39;m a firm believer that DEI should not be done off the side of your desk. It should be driven in everything we do as a leadership team, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming to do here at DoorDash,” said Shields. </p><p>DoorDash plans to launch its full DEI report in the coming weeks. </p></template></div>

CNN executives want CNN+ to have a distinctly different menu of content than the live-TV version, and began developing the product before the merger was finalized. Discovery executives think some CNN+ content could fold into the CNN app while other material could live on HBO Max, which Discovery considers its flagship streaming service.</p><p>Since the merger last month, Discovery+ and HBO Max appear to be on a path toward becoming a bundled <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/hbo-max-discovery-plus-bundle" target="_self">Netflix killer</a>. With so many streaming services for consumers to choose from, Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s main challenge is keeping subscribers from canceling after their favorite show is over. According to the Axios report, Discovery executives see CNN+ as just a feature that would make a larger streaming service stronger — but not as a standalone success.</p><p>If CNN+ flames out soon, this would be a particularly hard fall: The service launched <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/cnn-plus-streaming-service" target="_self">just three weeks ago</a>.

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Nintendo has been hit with a labor complaint through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) from an unnamed individual claiming their right to unionize was violated by the game-maker and its associated staffing agency in Redmond, Washington. The news was <a href="https://www.axios.com/nintendo-nlrb-complaint-3bb227c7-40c3-40c5-9578-5190e595a00e.html" target="_blank">first reported on Tuesday by Axios</a>. </p>
            
            <div><template><p>The complaint is thin on details at the moment, but it lists Nintendo&#39;s U.S. division and staffing firm Aston Carter as the charged parties. The allegations in broad terms involve violations of the National Labor Relations Act, including rules around unfair labor practices such as &#34;layoff and refusal to hire&#34;; &#34;coercive statements&#34; including &#34;threats, promises of benefits, etc.&#34;; &#34;retaliation, discharge, discipline&#34;; and &#34;coercive actions&#34; including &#34;surveillance.&#34; </p><p>The complaint was filed last week on April 15, and the concrete specifics of the case are currently not available unless specifically requested through the Freedom of Information Act. The complaint makes Nintendo just the latest video game company to face charges of unfair treatment, as part of a wider industry reckoning around workplace discrimination, sexism and labor practices in the game industry. </p><p>Activision Blizzard is the most high-profile of the companies currently embroiled in such disputes and lawsuits. The publisher <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/court-approves-eeocs-18-million-settlement-activision-blizzard" target="_blank">settled</a> a sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation lawsuit with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this year, but it still faces <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22994994/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexism" target="_blank">numerous lawsuits</a> from the state of California, investors and former employees over its treatment of workers and the actions of its executive leadership. </p><p>The situation at Activision Blizzard and the company&#39;s initial defensive response to allegations of worker treatment have sparked a unionization push within the company, including at subsidiary Raven Software, where workers in the quality assurance division <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/raven-union-election-activision-blizzard" target="_blank">voted to unionize last December</a>. The NLRB is also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22939657/activision-blizzard-raven-software-union-nlrb-hearing" target="_blank">overseeing a dispute</a> between Raven employees and Activision management over the scope of the proposed union, which the game publisher refused to recognize. </p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>The audit follows a push by Amazon shareholders to make the company be more transparent about how its policies affect diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The company said the focus of the audit will be &#34;to evaluate any disparate racial impacts on our nearly 1 million U.S. hourly employees resulting from our policies, programs, and practices.&#34; Amazon didn&#39;t say when the results of the audit will be completed, though they will be made public once finished. In 2021, 44% of Amazon shareholders supported a proposal for a racial equity audit, according to the filing, but the proposal was rejected last year. </p><p>Amazon&#39;s board of directors  recommended that shareholders vote against the resolution for the audit, arguing that the company is conducting its own human rights assessment and has launched initiatives promoting workforce diversity and inclusion. But New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has proposed an independent audit to be voted on again at the company&#39;s shareholders meeting next month. </p><p>The proposal filed on behalf of shareholders argues that the company&#39;s assessment wouldn&#39;t do enough, as it isn&#39;t &#34;an audit conducted by auditors who are experienced in rooting out biases and discrimination.&#34; </p><p>&#34;There is no public evidence that Amazon is assessing the potential or actual negative impacts of its policies, practices, products, and services through a racial equity lens,&#34; the filing reads. &#34;Because of the pattern and magnitude of controversies repeatedly facing Amazon, we believe that it is in shareholders’ best interests for Amazon to proactively identify and mitigate risks through an independent racial equity audit.&#34; </p><p>Shareholders are also reportedly are voting next month on an independent audit of Amazon&#39;s treatment of warehouse workers, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/18/amazon-to-conduct-racial-equity-audit-led-by-former-ag-loretta-lynch.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, which Amazon has urged shareholders to vote against. </p></template></div>

He anticipates shortages in every part of the battery building process, including mining raw materials like  cobalt, lithium and nickel, processing materials and building the battery cells themselves. </p><p>“Put very simply, all the world’s cell production combined represents well under 10% of what we will need in 10 years,” Scaringe told reporters, according to the WSJ. “Meaning, 90% to 95% of the supply chain does not exist.&#34;</p><p>Rivian has had a rocky start to the year.

The company reversed that plan after <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/rivian-price-hike-backlash" target="_self">massive outcry</a> from customers. Rivian in March also cut its production outlook in half to 25,000 vehicles, which it attributed to supply chain issues.</p><p>Car companies already dealing with a shortage of automotive sensors due to the chip crunch are now exploring ways to boost battery supply. Scaringe said Rivian is considering adding in-house battery production to diversify its supply.</p><p>“We are not going to have a single supplier,” he told the WSJ. “We are going to have multiple suppliers.”</p><p>Rivian also isn&#39;t the only EV maker feeling the squeeze of inflation. Tesla also <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/lucid-price-increase-report" target="_blank">increased prices</a> by 5-10% across its entire lineup due to the surging cost of nickel and other materials. If battery supply issues persist, car buyers who want to make the jump to EVs may face even higher costs.</p></template></div>

The Apple workers have affiliated themselves with Workers United, the national union that has successfully led more than 20 Starbucks stores to unionize so far (and hundreds more in earlier stages in the process). Workers at the JFK8 Amazon facility in Staten Island have also paralleled the unusual success of the Starbucks union movement, voting to form the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/amazon-union-wins-staten-island" target="_blank">first group of unionized Amazon workers</a> earlier this month. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/amazon-union-objections-staten-island" target="_blank">Amazon plans to challenge the result of that election</a>, and a second election with another group of workers in another Staten Island facility is scheduled to begin April 25. </p><p>The workers already affiliated with the FSWU must convince at least 30% of their retail peers at the Grand Central location to sign union interest affiliation cards, which would then trigger a formal union election administered by the National Labor Relations Board if Apple does not voluntarily recognize the union.</p><p>“We are fortunate to have incredible retail team members and we deeply value everything they bring to Apple. We are pleased to offer very strong compensation and benefits for full time and part time employees, including health care, tuition reimbursement, new parental leave, paid family leave, annual stock grants and many other benefits,&#34; an Apple spokesperson wrote in a statement to Protocol.</p><p><span></span>If successful in its unionization efforts, the FSWU plans to demand higher salaries and benefits, including a minimum wage of $30/hour (Apple&#39;s current minimum <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/16/apple-grand-central-station-retail-union-workers-united/" target="_blank">sits at $20/hr for retail workers</a>) and increased tuition reimbursements and 401(k) matches. &#34;Grand Central is an extraordinary store with unique working conditions that make a union necessary to ensure our team has the best possible standards of living in what have proven to be extraordinary times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and once-in-a-generation consumer price inflation,&#34; <a href="https://fsworkersunited.org/" target="_blank">the workers wrote on their newly launched union website.</a><br/></p><p>&#34;Hourly wage workers across the country have come to the realization that without organizing for a collective voice, employers will continue to ignore their concerns in the workplace. Workers from every single worksite, be they from Starbucks or Amazon or Apple, have spent years repeatedly expressing their concerns in the workplace — concerns about safety, their well-being, how to improve and make the workplace better — but management have ignored or done little to address the challenges workers face,&#34; Workers United wrote in a statement to Protocol.</p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>At the core of their concern is the IRS&#39; Free File program, through which TurboTax and other participants were supposed to offer tax preparation services to low-income Americans for free. But the lawmakers described that program &#34;a failure&#34; due to underutilization, and noted that Intuit left the program last year. According to stats in the letter, the program was intended to serve 70% of Americans, but as of 2018, it was only serving 3%. </p><p>Warren, Porter and Sherman hold TurboTax partly accountable for that, in light of reporting by <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines" target="_blank">ProPublica</a>, which found the company was adding code to its Free File site that kept it from surfacing in Google results. The company has since changed that code, according to ProPublica, but that did not apparently satisfy Warren and her colleagues.</p><p>They argued Intuit&#39;s &#34;influence peddling&#34; in Washington has allowed these issues to fly under the radar. The company previously hired a former top IRS official to be its chief tax officer and, according to the letter, Intuit also hired former FTC chair Jon Leibowitz to defend the company against a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/ftc-intuit-turbotax" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> recently filed by the FTC.<br/></p><p>That suit takes aim at TurboTax&#39;s &#34;bogus&#34; promises of free tax preparation, accusing TurboTax of &#34;disseminating the deceptive claim that consumers can file their taxes for free using TurboTax&#34; when they often end up getting charged in the end. Intuit called the FTC&#39;s claims &#34;not credible.&#34;</p><p>In their letter, the lawmakers described the suit as &#34;welcome and long overdue.&#34;</p><p><span></span>Now, Warren, Porter and Sherman are asking Intuit to answer questions about its &#34;revolving door&#34; with the IRS and other government agencies. In the letter, they asked Intuit to share the number of employees and external partners Intuit has worked with since 1999, who also held roles in the executive branch. They also asked the question in reverse: How many employees or partners went on to work in the executive branch since 1999? The lawmakers are also asking Intuit to share how much money it&#39;s made from taxpayers who make less than $73,000 since 1999.</p><p>Intuit has until May 2 to provide answers.</p><p><span></span>Ultimately, though, the letter isn&#39;t just seeking answers. It&#39;s also seeking to raise the profile of the Tax Filing Simplification Act. It would give Americans a pre-filled return that they could sign and return to file their taxes. But that bill has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/13/11417676/elizabeth-warren-tax-return-free-filing-tax-day-intuit-hr-block-turbotax-automatic-simple" target="_blank">kicking around</a> for years now and only seems to get any mention on Tax Day, so don&#39;t hold your breath.</p><p>For Warren, the letter is as much about getting answers to questions as it is about pushing companies to change their ways without government intervention. After all, the senator does have a long track record of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/warren-gensler-lawmaker-letters" target="_blank">using letters to get her way</a>.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>On Saturday, Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1515405264740134918" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: “🎶Love Me Tender 🎶.” It wasn&#39;t an Elvis reference. On Monday, Twitter filed its plans for a poison pill defense with the SEC, a move that would head off a potential tender offer from Musk or other parties. </p>
            
            <div><template><p> Musk had <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-twitter-takeover-explained" target="_self">offered to buy the company</a> at $54.20 a share last week in a negotiation with the board that went nowhere, and officially <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/hostile-tech-takeover" target="_self">became hostile</a> when the board rejected the offer. He&#39;s hinted in recent tweets that he might go directly to shareholders with a tender offer.</p><p><span></span>The mechanics of the plan are similar to most poison pills, with the goal being to dilute the stake that a hostile party owns by issuing new shares. Shareholders will be able to exercise the rights to purchase a thousandth of a share of preferred stock for $210. That price, along with the current market price, forms the basis for a calculation of how many shares of common stock shareholders will receive. The &#34;acquiring person&#34; — the party accumulating a stake of 15% or more — isn&#39;t eligible. The bottom line is that Twitter can flood the market with newly issued shares.</p><p>The exercise price in a poison pill is typically set high to discourage hostile offers. It&#39;s common for the price to be set at a multiple of two or three times the current market price. By that standard, $210 is higher than usual.</p><p>But $210 is also half of $420, which might be a symbolic gesture by the board. The $54.20-a-share price in his Twitter offer seemed to call back to the time Musk proposed taking Tesla at $420 a share, a number that&#39;s an allusion to weed culture. It probably feels good to stick it to the guy who&#39;s trying to buy your company.</p><p>Musk hasn&#39;t launched a tender offer yet, but if he were to do so with the plan in place, shareholders could in theory exercise their rights to buy shares cheaply and unload them on him at the designated price, making a purchase economically unfeasible.</p></template></div>
