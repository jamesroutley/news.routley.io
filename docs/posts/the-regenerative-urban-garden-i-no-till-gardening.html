    <h1>The regenerative urban garden I: No-till gardening</h1>

  <p>This post series is my attempt to answer that question. (Mind you, this is only our second year of gardening on this land, so no doubt I have a lot yet to learn and some steep learning curves to climb.)</p><h3>Regenerative growing practices on the urban backyard scale</h3><p>Here&#39;s my back-of-the-napkin, off-the-cuff summary of key regenerative land management principles:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Disturb the soil as little as possible.</p></li><li><p>Always keep the soil covered.</p></li><li><p>Always keep a living root in the soil.</p></li><li><p>Plant more perennial crops.</p></li><li><p>Diversity, diversity, diversity!</p></li><li><p>Incorporate animals into the system, and have a system in place for rotating them through landscape.</p></li></ul><p>Now, all of these can absolutely be applied even on the urban or suburban garden scale. Soil is soil is soil. There&#39;s nothing inherent about them that says you can only do them if you have 200 acres to manage.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with the first one. The way to disturb the soil as little as possible translates to:</p><h3>No-till (or no-dig) gardening</h3><p>No-till gardening is exactly what it sounds like: you farm, or garden without ever tilling the soil. Tilling and plowing are almost synonymous with land cultivation, aren&#39;t they? Yet they actually destroy soil structure, create compaction, and kill the very soil biology that&#39;s the basis of fertility, like fungal networks and all those earthworms that make the soil nice and squishy.</p><p>But if you don&#39;t till, how, then, do you break up and loosen the soil? How else do you kill all the weeds? How else do you build fertility?</p><p>In a no-till garden, these goals are achieved in a couple of simple ways:</p><h4>1. Aerate using a broadfork.</h4><p>This is a fun annual spring ritual. The broadfork allows you to gently fluff up the soil and improve its structure without turning it over completely. It&#39;s a garden chore my daughter loves doing with me â€” we rock back and forth, she can&#39;t stop laughing, I get good exercise.</p>

  <h4>2. After broadforking, layer on a &#34;lasagna mulch&#34; to suppress weeds and build fertility.</h4><p>In other words, you layer on different types of organic material, one of which is a weed block layer like cardboard or newspaper. On garden beds, I like using a few layers of wet newspaper because it breaks down faster.</p><p>There are many variations to lasagna or sheet mulching. Mine usually ends up looking something like this, from bottom layer to top layer:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>bottom: slashed vegetation (any weeds or cover crops on soil surface)</p></li><li><p>any soil amendments</p></li><li><p>thin layer of composted manure</p></li><li><p>newspaper or cardboard</p></li><li><p>2 inches of compost</p></li><li><p>top layer: seedless mulch, like straw, leaves, lawn clippings, or cut-down cover crops</p></li></ul><p>All these layers gradually break down, and the compost or manure invites lots of juicy earthworms that aerate the beds and gradually pull the organic materials deep into the soil.</p><p>The mulch shades the soil, blocks weeds, and creates fantastic habitat for soil micro-organisms, which are your partners in building good soil.</p><p>You can literally see yesterday&#39;s news turning into good garden soil! Now there&#39;s something to meditate on while gardening.</p>
