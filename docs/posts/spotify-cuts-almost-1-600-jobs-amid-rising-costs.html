Yet as the global economy’s momentum has waned, it has held back from its previous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/04/spotify-crises-podcasts-culture-wars-competition-concerns" data-link-name="in body link">heavy investment into podcasting</a>. That investment included backing a podcast from Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex in a deal that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/19/spotify-executive-calls-harry-and-meghan-grifters-after-podcast-deal-ends" data-link-name="in body link">ended in apparent acrimony this year</a>.

It had already cut back employee numbers by 6% in January and by a further 2% in June.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-9" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Redundant employees will receive an average of five months of severance pay plus unused holiday pay, Ek said.</p><p>“Embracing this leaner structure will also allow us to invest our profits more strategically back into the business,” he added. “Today is a difficult but important day for the company.”</p></div></div></div>
