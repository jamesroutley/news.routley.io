    <h1>Early-life low-calorie sweetener consumption disrupts memory function in rats</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="section-4"><div id="methods">
<p>Animal monitoring</p>
<p>Male and female Sprague Dawley rats (Envigo; P25; 50–70 g) were housed individually in a climate-controlled (22°C–24°C) environment with a 12:12-hour light/dark cycle (lights off at 6 p.m.). Rats were maintained on standard chow (Lab Diet 5001; PMI Nutrition International; 29.8% kcal from protein, 13.4% kcal from fat, 56.7% kcal from carbohydrate) and water. All experiments were performed during the light cycle. At P26, rats were randomized into groups of comparable weights and were provided with their experimental diets. Body weights were measured daily, whereas water consumption and chow intake were measured 3 times per week. Female estrus phase was not manipulated nor tracked in any of the experiments.</p>
<p>Experiment 1</p>
<p><span>Diet.</span> Juvenile male and female rats (<i>n</i> = 10 per sex/sweetener) were provided with the maximum ADI in mg/kg body weight, as recommended by the FDA, for ACE-K (catalog A2815, Spectrum Chemical; 0.1% weight/volume [w/v] in reverse osmosis [RO] water; ~15 mg/kg), saccharin (catalog 81-07-2, MilliporeSigma; 0.1% w/v in RO water; ~15 mg/kg), or stevia (JG Group; 0.033% w/v in RO water; ~4 mg/kg) from P26–P77 (approximately 7 weeks of access). The volume required for delivery of each solution was calculated based on body weight daily and injected into a rodent sipper tube with a vinyl cap; it was placed on the wire rack of the home cage adjacent to the rat’s ad libitum standard chow and water bottle. Voluntary consumption of the entire sweetener ration was verified daily by inspecting the tube for all animals. Rats in the control group (CTL; <i>n</i> = 10 per sex) were provided a sipper tube filled with RO water at an equivalent volume/body weight as the ACE-K and saccharin groups. Each sweetener concentration was selected based on in-house 2-bottle preference tests (versus water), as well as concentrations published studies (<span><a id="#B38-link" href="#B38" onclick="showRefSection();">38</a></span>, <span><span></span><a id="#B49-link" href="#B49" onclick="showRefSection();">49</a></span>). Sweetener access ceased at P77.</p>
<p>Behavioral experiments</p>
<p><span>Novel object in context.</span> Contextual episodic memory was assessed beginning at P63 (following 30 days of LCS consumption) using the hippocampal-dependent novel object in context (NOIC) task, a time frame and behavioral procedure adapted from ref. <span><a id="#B42-link" href="#B42" onclick="showRefSection();">42</a></span>. The NOIC procedure took place over 5 days, and each day consisted of a 5-minute session per animal. The apparatus and objects were cleaned with 10% ethanol (EtOH) between each animal. On days 1 and 2, rats were placed in Context 1, a semitransparent box (38.1 cm width [W] × 61 cm length [L] × 30.5 cm height [H]) with yellow stripes, or Context 2, a gray opaque box (43.2 cm W × 43.2 cm L × 40.6 cm H) (1 context/day in counterbalanced order). Following this habituation phase, each animal was placed in Context 1 containing Object A and Object B placed on diagonal, equidistant markings with ample space for the rat to circle the objects (NOIC day 1). Object A and Object B were an unopened 12 oz soda can and a stemless wine glass, counterbalanced among animals. Importantly, the side Object A was located on was counterbalanced by group. The following day (NOIC day 2), rats were placed in Context 2 with identical copies of Object A. On the test day (NOIC day 3), rats were placed again in Context 2, except this time with Object A and Object B (which was not a novel object per se, but its placement in Context 2 was novel to the rat). On NOIC days 1 and 3, exploration (defined as sniffing or touching the object with the nose or forepaws) was hand-scored by an experimenter blinded to the experimental group assignments who was viewing a live camera recording on a computer monitor. The discrimination index for Object B (time spent exploring Object B/[time spent exploring Object A + time spent exploring Object B]) was calculated for days 1 and 3. Data were represented as a percentage shift from baseline, where baseline is the discrimination index on day 1.</p>
<p><span>Barnes Maze.</span> To test for hippocampal-dependent spatial memory, we employed a Barnes Maze task as previously described (<span><a id="#B9-link" href="#B9" onclick="showRefSection();">9</a></span>, <span><span></span><a id="#B50-link" href="#B50" onclick="showRefSection();">50</a></span>). In this task, rats were placed on a Barnes Maze (Med Associates), a circular elevated platform (diameter, 122 cm; height, 140 cm) containing 18 identical holes spaced 20° apart along the edge. Four sets of visuospatial cues (e.g., black and white stripes, a white circle, a stuffed unicorn, and an assortment of irregular shapes) were displayed on the room walls surrounding the maze, approximately 1 meter from the edges of the maze. The rats were habituated to the maze for 1 day as previously described (<span><span></span><a id="#B9-link" href="#B9" onclick="showRefSection();">9</a></span>); they were then trained for 2 days with 2 trials per day (as described below). The probe test, which assesses spatial memory retention, was conducted at P77.</p>
<p>During each training trial, the rat was placed in a start box for 30 seconds. Then, the box was lifted and the animal was given 3 minutes to find the hidden escape hole within one of the holes. Each rat was assigned a specific escape hole in relation to the spatial cues, with the location counterbalanced across groups. To motivate the rats to search for the escape hole, mildly aversive stimuli (120 watt bright overhead light and 75 db white noise) were used (<span><a id="#B50-link" href="#B50" onclick="showRefSection();">50</a></span>). The white noise ceased once the rat entered the escape hole. After each trial, the rat was left undisturbed in the escape hole for 1 minute before being returned to its home cage. Between each rat and trial, all surfaces were cleaned with 10% EtOH, and the maze was rotated 180° (to eliminate olfactory strategies). In the case that the rat failed to find the escape hole within the 3-minute trial, the experimenter placed the rat inside the escape hole for 1 minute. Latency (defined as the time to reach the escape hole) and the number of incorrect hole investigations was recorded by the experimenter. The procedure for the probe test was similar to training, except that the test was a single 2-minute trial with no escape hole. Data were presented as the percent of correct investigations on the first 10 investigated holes.</p>
<p><span>Zero Maze.</span> All rats were tested for anxiety-like behavior in the Zero Maze on P110 or P111. The Zero Maze was an elevated circular platform (63.5 cm height, 116.8 cm external diameter) with 2 closed zones and 2 open zones, all of which were equal in length. The closed zones were enclosed with 17.5 cm–high walls, whereas the open zones had only 3 cm–high curbs. Animals began in the same closed arm of the maze and were allowed to roam the maze for a single 5-minute session. After each session, the apparatus was cleaned with 10% EtOH. An experimenter scored the total time the rat spent in the open zones. A rat was considered in an open zone if its head and 2 front paws were in the open zone, as previously described (<span><a id="#B9-link" href="#B9" onclick="showRefSection();">9</a></span>). Data were reported as the percentage of time spent in the open zones over the 5-minute test.</p>
<p>Ingestive behavior</p>
<p><span>Solutions.</span> Corn oil emulsions were made by mixing 4.5% oil (Mazola, ACH Foods Inc.) and 0.6% of an emulsifier (Emplex) in deionized water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) in an emulsifying blender before the training sessions. Emulsions were blended again if oil droplets started to appear in the solution. Reagent-grade glucose (0.56M), fructose (0.56M), 10% w/v MALTRIN (Maltrin580), quinine HCl (0.15 mM, 0.3 mM, and 1mM; QHCl), and lithium chloride (0.12M LiCl) were prepared fresh with dH<sub>2</sub>O before each session.</p>
<p><span>Lickometer training and tests.</span> Animals were given 30-minute sessions (with the exception of the LiCl test, which was 20 minutes, see below) in identical operant chambers equipped with optical lickometers (Habitest, Coulbourn Instruments). The sipper spout was in a recessed magazine in the center of one end wall, ~2 cm above a grid floor. Access to the sipper spout was computer-controlled via a motorized guillotine door. Licks were time stamped and recorded via Graphic State software (Ver 4.0). Starting at P82, rats deprived of water overnight were trained to lick in the lickometer for 30-minute sessions on 2 consecutive days (1 session/day). On each day, rats were offered a bottle of dH<sub>2</sub>O in the lickometer. On the second day, any rat that did not take at least 800 licks in 30 minutes was given an additional 30-minute session with dH<sub>2</sub>O later the same day; water bottles were returned to the home cage after this training. Starting on P85, rats were provided daily chow rations to maintain their body weight at 85% of their free feeding weight. At P88, rats were trained to lick for 4.5% corn oil emulsion for one 30-minute session so they would associate the spout with calorie intake. Rats were retrained the same day if they did not reach the 800-lick criterion in the first session. Testing started at P89 and occurred over 2 days. Testing order was counterbalanced such that half the animals were given 0.56M glucose to consume for 30 minutes on the first test day and 0.56M fructose on the second test day; the other half received the reverse order. After 1 day of rest, rats were then tested with 10% w/v MALTRIN for 30 minutes and were returned to ad libitum chow 30 minutes after testing. From P95 to P105, the rats were water restricted (bottles pulled the day before water retraining, which occurred over 1 day, and returned 30 minutes after the test) to test for 30-minute quinine intake (starting with the lowest concentration on P96 and ending with the highest concentration on P105, with 2–4 days on ad libitum water between concentrations to allow for sufficient rehydration). At P130, overnight water-deprived rats were retrained with 30-minute access to water, and then they were water deprived again. The next day, rats were tested with the 0.12M LiCl solution. While the concentration of LiCl produces aversion, consumption of LiCl was capped to prevent overingestion, based on ref. <span><a id="#B51-link" href="#B51" onclick="showRefSection();">51</a></span>. Microstructural analyses of licking patterns on each test were performed with the time-stamped lick records. Bursts were defined as runs of licks, separated by a ≥ 1 second pause in licking (<span><span></span><a id="#B52-link" href="#B52" onclick="showRefSection();">52</a></span>). In addition to the total number of licks taken per session, total licks in the first minute, first burst size, number of bursts, and mean burst sizes were computed.</p>
<p><span>PR operant responding for sucrose or high-fat diet.</span> Operant response training was conducted as previously described (<span><a id="#B53-link" href="#B53" onclick="showRefSection();">53</a></span>). Rats were habituated to 20 sucrose pellets in the home cage on P134. Starting at P135, the rats received a 1-hour training session each day over 6 days in standard conditioning boxes (Med Associates) that contain an “active” lever and an “inactive” lever, whereby pressing the active lever results in the release of a 45 mg sucrose pellet into a food cup (F0023, Bio-Serv). For the first 2 days, the rats were trained to press the active lever on a fixed ratio-1 (FR1) schedule with an autoshaping component. On these sessions, each active-lever press resulted in sucrose reinforcement. In the case that 10 minutes lapsed without an active-lever press, a pellet was automatically dispensed. The next 4 days of training consisted of FR1 followed by FR3 (3 active-lever presses were required to obtain 1 pellet) training without autoshaping for 2 days each. Subsequently, from P151 to P152, the rats were tested using a PR reinforcement schedule, whereby the number of lever presses for a sucrose pellet increased progressively using the following formula:</p>
<p>F(i) = 5 × 10<sup>0.2i–5</sup></p>
<p>where F(i) is the number of lever presses required for the next pellet at i = pellet number (<span><a id="#B53-link" href="#B53" onclick="showRefSection();">53</a></span>, <span><span></span><a id="#B54-link" href="#B54" onclick="showRefSection();">54</a></span>). The test session terminates when the rat did not achieve a ratio within 20 minutes, and the total number of pellets earned was recorded. Beginning on P153, rats were retrained with 2 FR1 sessions and 1 FR3 session (1 session/day) with high-fat pellets (35% kcal fat enriched with sucrose, F05989, Bio-Serv). Then, the rats were retested from P159 to P160 on a PR schedule, as above, except that high-fat pellets were used instead of sucrose pellets.</p>
<p><span>Free-access sucrose consumption in the home cage.</span> From P165 to P193, all rats were provided ad libitum access to an 11% w/v sucrose solution (C&amp;H Pure Granulated White Cane Sugar; dissolved in RO water) in addition to standard chow and water in the home cage for 4 weeks. The concentration of sucrose was selected to match the one found in SSBs consumed by humans (<span><a id="#B55-link" href="#B55" onclick="showRefSection();">55</a></span>) and our prior studies (<span><span></span><a id="#B9-link" href="#B9" onclick="showRefSection();">9</a></span>). Sugar intake was measured and fresh solutions were provided every 3 days.</p>
<p><span>Body Composition.</span> At P194, rats were food restricted 1 hour prior to being weighed and scanned for body composition as previously described (<span><a id="#B7-link" href="#B7" onclick="showRefSection();">7</a></span>) using the Bruker NMR Minispec LF 90II (Bruker Daltonics). Percent body fat was calculated as (fat mass [g]/body weight [g]) × 100.</p>
<p>Microbiome</p>
<p><span>Fecal collection.</span> Following Barnes Maze testing (P77), animals returned to a sterile cage (no bedding) and were mildly restrained until defecation occurred. Fecal samples were weighed under sterile conditions and then placed into a DNase/RNase free 2 mL cryogenic vial embedded in dry ice. Samples were stored in a –80°C freezer. All materials used to collect samples were cleaned with 70% EtOH between rats.</p>
<p><span>16S rRNA-Seq.</span> Fecal samples were shipped on dry ice to UC Davis Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) and Host Microbe Systems Biology Core. Total DNA was extracted using Mo-Bio (now Qiagen) PowerFecal kit. Sample libraries were prepared and analyzed by barcoded amplicon sequencing. Briefly, the purified DNA was amplified on the V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes via PCR using the following primers: F319 (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3′) and R806 (5′-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). High-throughput sequencing was performed with Illumina MiSeq paired end 250 bp run. Raw data files can be accessed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, PRJNA632048).</p>
<p><span>Sequence processing and data analysis.</span> Sequencing reads were analyzed with DADA2 and QIIME2 (<span><a id="#B56-link" href="#B56" onclick="showRefSection();">56</a></span>). Forward reads were truncated to 200 bp and denoised to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and the chimera sequences were removed with the DADA2 “consensus” method. ASV sequences were classified using the QIIME2 sklearn classifier with the SILVA database (release 132) (<span><span></span><a id="#B57-link" href="#B57" onclick="showRefSection();">57</a></span>). Taxonomic abundance tables were normalized as previously described to correct for the varied sequencing depth across samples (<span><span></span><a id="#B58-link" href="#B58" onclick="showRefSection();">58</a></span>). The statistical analysis was performed with R. PCoA was calculated based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and visualized using the R function “capscale” in the package “vegan”. The PERMANOVA test of the associations between microbiome and groups was performed with the function “adonis” in the same package. Shannon diversity index was calculated with the function “diversity” and used to characterize α diversity. The associations of individual taxa and groups were analyzed with a linear regression model with Group and Sex of the rat as the main effects and Group × Sex as the interaction. Rare taxa (prevalence &lt; 25% samples) were not included to avoid overadjustment for FDR. The Wilcoxon test (FDR &lt; 0.1) was used to identify significantly differential taxa between treatment and CTL. The <i>P</i> values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>
<p>Experiment 2</p>
<p>Because short-term sugar intake was predominately affected in male rats from Experiment 1, a new cohort of juvenile male rats (<i>n</i> = 15) was divided into the following 2 groups at P26: (a) CTL diet, consisting of chow, water, and a sipper tube injected daily with water as in Experiment 1 (<i>n</i> = 8), or (b) ACE-K diet (0.1% w/v; ~15 mg/kg) daily via a sipper tube, with standard chow and water as described above (<i>n</i> = 7), to examine the effects of early life sugar and LCS consumption on glucose tolerance in adulthood. Rats were on the diets until P74, to approximately match ACE-K exposure in Experiment 1 (7 weeks of access), and they were then outfitted with gastric catheters from P79 to P81 to compare glucose tolerance following either oral or gastric dextrose administration (timeline depicted in <a href="#sd">Supplemental Figure 1B</a>).</p>
<p><span>Gastric catheter surgeries.</span> Gastric catheter surgeries were conducted as described in Schier et al. previously (<span><a id="#B59-link" href="#B59" onclick="showRefSection();">59</a></span>). Following an overnight fast, rats were laparotomized while under isoflurane. A gastric catheter made of silastic tubing (inside diameter = 0.64 mm, outside diameter = 1.19 mm; Dow Corning) was inserted ~1 cm into the stomach through a puncture wound in the greater curvature of the forestomach. The catheter was tethered to the stomach wall with a single stay suture, silastic cuff, and piece of Marlex mesh (Davol). A purse string suture and concentric serosal tunnel were used to close the wound in the stomach. The other end of the catheter was then tunneled s.c. to an interscapular exit site, where it connected to a luer lock adapter, as part of a backpack harness worn by the rat (Quick Connect Harness, Strategic Applications). Rats were treated postoperatively with gentamicin (8 mg/kg, s.c. injection) and ketoprofen (1 mg/kg, s.c. injection). Rats were given increasing increments of chow (1–3 pellets) after surgery and then were given ad libitum access to chow. The gastric catheter was routinely flushed with 0.5 mL of isotonic saline beginning 48 hours after surgery to maintain patency. Harnesses were adjusted daily to accommodate changes in body mass.</p>
<p><span>Intragastric and OGTT.</span> This method was newly established and modified from prior procedures (<span><a id="#B30-link" href="#B30" onclick="showRefSection();">30</a></span>, <span><span></span><a id="#B51-link" href="#B51" onclick="showRefSection();">51</a></span>). All rats were trained to lick at the lickometer for water and habituated to passive intragastric infusions in the Coulbourn chambers. After overnight water deprivation, rats had 30 minutes of free access to a bottle and sipper containing water, and they then returned to the home cage (without water). Approximately 3–4 hours later, rats returned to the chambers. The intragastric catheter was connected to an infusion line, consisting of polyethylene tubing encased in a spring tether and routed through a single-channel swivel, attached to a computer-controlled infusion pump and syringe. Rats were infused with 4 mL of water (0.75 mL/minute). Rats returned to the home cage at the end of the intragastric infusion; no home cage water was provided. On the following day, rats received the same intragastric habituation session in the morning. Three to 4 hours later, rats received a second lickometer training session. In this session, rats had access to water for 5 minutes through a sipper spout connected to an infusion pump. Here, licking the spout activated the infusion pump for 1 second (0.75 mL/minute) and during this activation time licks did not reactivate the pump. Rats returned to a home cage with water after this session. Then, to train the rats to associate the spout with nutritive value, a third training session was conducted with 4.5% w/v corn oil emulsion in place of water, for 30 minutes, in the morning following a 20-hour fast. Animals were given additional 30-minute training sessions if they did not take at least 800 licks. Approximately 3–4 hours later, rats returned to the chamber and received a 4 mL intragastric corn oil infusion over 5 minutes. Chow was returned after the intragastric infusion. All rats underwent oral and IGGT  testing in a counterbalanced order on P98 and P101. Chow was removed from the home cage 20 hours prior to testing. Water was removed from the home cage approximately 14–20 hours prior to testing to encourage licking during the test. Then, 5 minutes prior to the start of each test, baseline blood glucose was measured from the tail with a glucometer (One touch Ultra2, LifeScan Inc.). At minute 0, rats received 3 mL of a 20% w/v dextrose solution dissolved in sterile saline via a pump-infused licking session (OGTT) or intragastric infusion (IGTT) over 5 minutes. Blood glucose readings were obtained at 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after time 0. Rats were kept in the chambers until after the 30-minute blood glucose measurements and then returned to their home cages for the remaining measurements.</p>
<p>Experiment 3</p>
<p>Male and female rats (<i>n</i> = 16 per sex/treatment) were given daily ACE-K (0.1% w/v; ~15 mg/kg) or water (CTL group) through a sipper tube along with chow and water until P80. This matched the design of Experiment 1 (~7 weeks access to ACE-K), to generate tissues for analyses. At P80, chow and ACE-K sippers were removed 4 hours into the light cycle, and all rats were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture (90:2.8:0.72 mg/kg, intramuscular injection) before being rapidly decapitated for collection of circumvallate tissue in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and flash frozen brain tissue.</p>
<p>Quantitative PCR</p>
<p><span>Circumvallate taste papillae.</span> CV samples were collected approximately 8–12 hours into the light cycle (and 6–8 hours after chow was removed). The whole tongue was removed and pinned into a Sylgard dish filled with a Tyrode’s solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose). Under a microscope, 3 mL of an enzyme cocktail (1 mg/mL collagenase A [1088793001, Sigma-Aldrich] and 0.1 mg/mL elastase [Sigma-Aldrich] in PBS) was injected under the lingual epithelium. Then, the tongue was incubated at 37°C for approximately 20 minutes. The epithelium containing the CV was carefully peeled from the underlying connective tissue. The CVs were stored overnight at 4°C in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then transferred into DNase/RNase-free tubes and stored at –80°C.</p>
<p><span>qPCR analysis.</span> To quantify relative <i>Tas1r2</i> and <i>Tas1r3</i> mRNA expression between CTL (<i>n</i> = 8, 4 females and 4 males) and ACE-K (<i>n</i> = 8, 4 females and 4 males) rats in the CV, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as previously described (<span><a id="#B60-link" href="#B60" onclick="showRefSection();">60</a></span>). Total RNA was extracted from each sample using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (74804, Qiagen), and concentration per sample was measured with a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (ND-ONE-W, Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (205311, Qiagen) and amplified using the TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (4391128, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay — for rat β-actin (Actb, Rn00667869_m1, Applied Biosystems), rat Taste receptor type 1 member 3 (Tas1r3, Rn00590759_g1, Applied Biosystems), and rat Taste receptor, type 1, member 2 (Tas1r2, Rn01515494_m1, Applied Biosystems) — and TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (4444557, Applied Biosystems), in the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All reactions were run in triplicate with control wells without a cDNA template included to verify absence of genomic DNA contamination. The triplicate Ct values for each sample were averaged and normalized to β-actin expression. The comparative 2<sup>–ΔΔCt</sup> method was used to quantify the relative expression levels of our genes of interest between groups.</p>
<p>RNA-Seq</p>
<p><span>Brain tissue collection (HPCd and ACB).</span> Whole brains were flash frozen in isopentane surrounded by dry ice and stored at −80°C. Tissue punches of dorsal hippocampus (HPCd ) and nucleus ACB (2.0 mm circumference, 1–2 mm depth) were collected using a Leica CM 1860 cryostat. Anatomical landmarks were based on the Swanson brain atlas (HPCd containing dorsal cornu ammonis area 1 and dorsal dentate gyrus at atlas levels 28–30, and ACB at atlas levels 10–12) (<span><a id="#B61-link" href="#B61" onclick="showRefSection();">61</a></span>).</p>
<p><span>Sample preparation and sequencing.</span> Total RNA was extracted using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with high purity confirmed using a NanoDrop One (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, samples were sent to the USC Genome Core to verify the quality using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). There, libraries were prepared from 1 μg of total RNA using a NuGen Universal Plus mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Tecan Genomics Inc.). Final products were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and fragment size distribution was determined with the Bioanalyzer 2100. The libraries were pooled equimolarly, and the final pool was quantified via qPCR using the Kapa Biosystems Library Quantification Kit. The pool was sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform, in single-read 75 cycles format, obtaining about 25 million reads per sample. RNA-Seq data for HPCd and ACB are available on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession no. GSE212589)</p>
<p><span>RNA-Seq quality control.</span> RNA-Seq quality control was performed using FastQC (<span><a id="#B62-link" href="#B62" onclick="showRefSection();">62</a></span>). Low-quality reads were trimmed by Trimmomatic (<span><span></span><a id="#B63-link" href="#B63" onclick="showRefSection();">63</a></span>). Reads were aligned to <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> genome Rnor6.0 using STAR (<span><a id="#B64-link" href="#B64" onclick="showRefSection();">64</a></span>). Gene counts were quantified using HTSeq (<span><span></span><a id="#B65-link" href="#B65" onclick="showRefSection();">65</a></span>). Principal component analysis (PCA) detected potential sample outliers, and 1 ACB sample from the ACE-K treatment group was removed.</p>
<p><span>Identification of DEGs.</span> Genes detected in &lt; 3 samples or with a normalized count &lt; 5 were filtered out. DEseq2 was used to perform differential gene expression analysis between CTL and ACE-K treatment groups across both sexes to identify DEGs affected by ACE-K Treatment, Sex, and Treatment × Sex interactions or within males and females separately to identify DEGs affected by treatment within each sex (<span><a id="#B66-link" href="#B66" onclick="showRefSection();">66</a></span>). <i>P</i> values were adjusted for multiple-testing corrections using Benjamini-Hochberg correction. At FDR &lt; 0.05, no significant DEGs were identified for the treatment effect both across and within sex analyses. Suggestive DEGs were defined as DEGs with an unadjusted <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 and the absolute value of log fold change ≥ 0.4. For heatmap visualization, raw counts were normalized using regularized log transformation implemented in DESeq2. <i>Z</i> scores for each gene were calculated and visualized.</p>
<p><span>Pathway analyses of DEGs.</span> Pathway analysis was conducted using EnrichR with suggestive DEGs by checking the DEG enrichment in curated pathways from KEGG, BioCarta, Reactome (<a target="_blank" href="https://reactome.org/">https://reactome.org/</a>), and gene ontology (GO) biological pathways (<span><a id="#B67-link" href="#B67" onclick="showRefSection();">67</a></span>–<span><span></span><a id="#B69-link" href="#B69" onclick="showRefSection();">69</a></span>). Pathways with an FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>
<p>Experiment 4</p>
<p>Male rats were given daily ACE-K (0.1% w/v; ~15 mg/kg, <i>n</i> = 9) or water through a sipper tube (CTL, <i>n</i> = 10) with chow and water until P60. Between P61 and P67, following a 22-hour fast and 15-hour period of water deprivation, the tail vein was cut, and blood was collected in a tube for a maximum of 3 minutes or 200 μL — whichever came first. The blood was left at room temperature for 30 minutes to coagulate and was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 2,000<i>g</i> at 4°C. The serum was aliquoted and stored at –80°C until used to assess insulin levels. Then, following a 22-hour fast, rats were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture (90:2.8:0.72 mg/kg) before rapid decapitation and collection of duodenal mucosa samples on P88–P89 (timeline depicted in <a href="#sd">Supplemental Figure 1D</a>).</p>
<p><span>Serum insulin.</span> The Ultra Sensitive Rat Insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, 90060) was used to measure serum insulin levels (low range assay). The optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm and 630 nm, and the data were analyzed with the kit protocol.</p>
<p><span>Duodenal villi collection and qPCR.</span> In accordance with diurnal gene expression patterns (<span><a id="#B70-link" href="#B70" onclick="showRefSection();">70</a></span>), intestinal tissues were collected between approximately 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. in a counterbalanced order in 2 squads (1 squad per day). The intestine was exposed via laparotomy. Two 1 cm segments of the duodenum were collected by measuring distally from the pyloric sphincter, removing and disposing of the initial 1 cm section, and then collecting 2 subsequent 1 cm segments. The segments were flushed with sterile saline, and scrapes of mucosal villi were collected. Duodenal villi samples were preserved in RNAlater for 24 hours and then transferred into DNase/RNase-free tubes and stored at –80°C. To quantify relative Sglt1 (<i>slc5a1</i>) and Glut2 (<i>slc2a2</i>) mRNA expression between CTL and ACE-K rats in the duodenum, qPCR was performed as described above. The cDNA were not amplified and the real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression Assay for rat β-actin (Actb, Rn00667869_m1, Applied Biosystems), rat slc5a1 (<i>Sglt1</i>, Rn01640634_m1, Applied Biosystems), and rat slc2a2 (<i>Glut2</i>, Rn00563565_m1, Applied Biosystems).</p>
<p>Statistics</p>
<p>All data except for gene and microbiome sequencing results are presented as mean ± SEM and were analyzed and graphed using Prism software (GraphPad Inc., Version 9.1.2.225) or Statistica (Version 7; Statsoft), with significance at <i>P</i> ≤ 0.05. Body weights, water, and caloric intake were analyzed using a multifactor mixed 2-way ANOVA, with Time as a within-subjects factor and Group (Experiments 1–3), Sex (Experiments 1 and 3), and Sweetener (Experiment 1) as between-subjects factors. Glucose tolerance results were analyzed via 2-way ANOVA, with Time as a within-subjects variable and Group as a between-subjects variable. Body composition, NOIC, Barnes Maze, Zero Maze, licking/ingestive tests, PR, sucrose consumption in the home cage, and <i>Tas1r2</i> and <i>Tas1r3</i> relative mRNA expression were analyzed using a multifactor 2-way ANOVA with Sex (where included), Group, and Sweetener as the independent between-subjects variables (except for mRNA analyses, which did not include Sweetener as a variable). Unpaired samples 2-tailed <i>t</i> tests were used to analyze the effect of LCS (ACE-K, specifically) on fasting insulin, <i>Sglt1</i>, and <i>Glut2</i> mRNA expression levels (Experiment 4). Data were corrected for multiple comparisons using Sidak’s multiple-comparison test.</p>
<p>Study approval</p>
<p>All experiments were approved by the IACUC at the University of Southern California and performed in accordance with the <i>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</i> (National Academies Press, 2011).</p>
