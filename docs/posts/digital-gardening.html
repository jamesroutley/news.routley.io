                        <p>A website is a lot like a garden.</p>
<p>I spend most of my days tending to <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/">my garden</a>. I walk around it aimlessly, plucking dead links, pruning superfluous words, and repotting overgrown paragraphs into their own articles. I neglect some sections and obsess over others.</p>
<p>I accept that my work will remain unfinished. I am eager to discover what the soil can produce, but there are only so many hours in a day. I already marvel at how far it has come.</p>
<p>I have learned to welcome other gardeners as peers, instead of fearing them as competitors. I have learned to share advice and compliments freely. The world needs more gardens.<br/></p>
<p>This article is a seedling. I might tend to it later, when it feels right. Kind regards to <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden">Maggie Appleton</a>, who introduced me to this metaphor.</p>
