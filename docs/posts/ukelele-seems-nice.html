    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, February 23, 2024</em></p><p>I&#39;ve wanted to pick up an instrument again for a while now. I considered the guitar, but:</p><ol><li>the strings hurt my fingers</li><li>they&#39;re so big!</li><li>when I&#39;ve tried to learn, I&#39;ve felt a lot of pressure to get good or get out. Rock star mentality, maybe? Not my speed, anyway.</li></ol><p>So instead, I&#39;m going to try the ukulele:</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><ol><li>nylon strings</li><li>small and cute</li><li>all the stuff I have found about ukulele is like &#34;yeah, we&#39;re all here to have fun.&#34; Really chill, which I appreciate.</li></ol><p>And as a nice bonus I really like the sound of the ones I bought. I got two because my son wants to learn with me! I&#39;m really looking forward to messing around and making some music!</p></article></div></div>
