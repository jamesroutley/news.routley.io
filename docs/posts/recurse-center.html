    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people say the job market is a mess. Fewer people find themselves on a layover relocating for a job only to have the second leg of the trip cancelled as <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/13/israel-strike-iran-trump-nuclear-talks" target="_blank">a war broke out</a> mid-flight. This was the situation I found myself in one evening in New York—and I began to form a new plan. There was a mysterious place I had heard of, from <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://eieio.games/" target="_blank">internet celebrities</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://miles.land/" target="_blank">Stanford peers</a>, where programmers could go to build… things. It wasn’t all that clear to me actually but everyone I knew who had done it was very cool and I had yet to try living on the East Coast so I checked the window for applications, saw there was about a week left before the summer batch, and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.recurse.com/apply" target="_blank">the rest is history</a>.</p><p><img alt="My batch gathered together celebrating Recurse’s birthday." src="https://figbert.com/work/recurse/company.webp"/></p><p><a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=0d85c06dc14f97552f2130471d4e3086" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Recurse</a> gave me the resources—both technical and personal—to do the best work I’ve ever done. I was able to hack on projects I had long imagined but never had the time for, and pursue new ideas with wild abandon. On my first day in the office I showed up to a hackathon partner-less, and said that I was looking to make progress on a <a href="https://figbert.com/posts/ideating-tragit/">code forge</a>. Someone else had shown up alone as well, and volunteered. <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://wolfesoftware.com/" target="_blank">Josh</a>, fountain of <code>git</code> knowledge and the world’s premier <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/poaf" target="_blank">ZIP expert</a>, became a good friend. On my last day in the office, I one-shot a prototype <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/FIGBERT/playspinz" target="_blank">dreidel game</a> at a hackathon for the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="http://play.date/" target="_blank">Playdate console</a>. In between these bookending coding sprints, I discovered that everyone at the Recurse Center had arrived with their own profound specialties and interests. I was no exception: some <a href="https://figbert.com/projects/roll-call/#eight-months-later">things</a> <a href="https://figbert.com/projects/blind-date-a-book/">I</a> <a href="https://figbert.com/projects/rapid-riter/">made</a> <a href="https://figbert.com/projects/cordially/">there</a> <a href="https://figbert.com/projects/stickies/">have</a> <a href="https://figbert.com/projects/cloudlab/">ended</a> <a href="https://figbert.com/projects/two-pockets/">up</a> on this site.</p><p>Some notable occurences and accomplishments from my time at the Recurse Center have yet to make their way into the public eye. <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.frankchiarulli.com/" target="_blank">Frank</a> nerd-sniped me into a hardware project of grand scale that I <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/figbert/scrollthingy" target="_blank">am still working on</a>. When it’s done it may very well be my magnum opus. <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://keithfrost.github.io/" target="_blank">Keith</a> tricked me into learning <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="http://gleam.run/" target="_blank">Gleam</a>, and I have gone on to become a huge fan of the language. I also picked up Ruby and Rust, though I didn’t end up trying a Lisp as I had hoped. I met <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://filippo.io" target="_blank">Filippo</a>, creator of <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://age-encryption.org/" target="_blank"><code>age</code></a>, and he mailed me stickers that are now on my bike. <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://wobblybits.blog/" target="_blank">David</a> planted the idea in my mind that “project people” should have a truck, and four months later I test-drove a Rivian R1T…</p><p>Working at Recurse is a high-agency playground. If you enjoy shooting off on <a href="https://figbert.com/posts/tangible-deliverables/">productive tangents</a>—as I do—there are enough toys there to keep you entertained for a long time. Apply yourself and you can turn the 3D printers, retro computers, ESP32s, and ultrawide monitors around you into something wonderful. Or <em>somethings</em> wonderful! And while doing so, you’ll pair with incredible folks, present your work to a large audience, and hopefully become a better maker yourself. You are the only one in charge and there is no guide. I enjoyed that. In many ways it felt like a natural extension of the d. school’s philosophy of “learning by doing.”</p><p><img alt="Me presenting at the Recurse Center" src="https://figbert.com/work/recurse/presentation.jpg"/></p><p>I was chatting with a good friend of mine over summer, describing Recurse, when she posed a good question: “How is this going to change what you’re looking for in a career?” It’s true that I have yet to see a job posting for <em>Person Who Builds Funky and Impactful Open-Source Stuff and Eats at a New Restaurant Every Night</em>. But there are aspects of Recurse that I will look for wherever I end up next. I enjoyed the variety, the personal responsibility, the creative control, and the balanced blend of impressive goals with relaxed attitude. These qualities made the the work feel special.
