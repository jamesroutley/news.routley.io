  <p>2025-11-01 - <strong>Feeling like a kid in a candy store, once more</strong></p>
  <p>As evident by my last blog post <a href="https://jsteuernagel.de/posts/a-prison-of-my-own-making/">&#34;A prison of my own making&#34;</a>, I needed to change something about my relationship with technology.
How I was doing things didn&#39;t work anymore, but I also felt unable to change anything about it, as the way I was doing things seemed like <strong>the</strong> way that I was supposed to use.</p>
<p>What I needed was a fresh start.
And I managed to find that fresh start in the BSD family of operating systems.</p>
<p>I had already given <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> a try at the time and I liked what I saw.
OpenBSD had already established itself in my workflow as an easy to use and reliable router and general OS for single-purpose VMs.
But it isn&#39;t able to fullfill my needs for a multi-purpose system, where I&#39;d want to run multiple separated workloads in something like a container or VM.
But FreeBSD could.</p>
<p>I know that I generally operate best by just committing to using a thing and then figuring out what I need, as I need it.
So I committed to using FreeBSD and found a really nice server to do just that on the Hetzner server auction.</p>
<p>I started setting it up with <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bastillebsd.org/">BastilleBSD</a> for jails and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve">vm-bhyve</a> for VMs.
I didn&#39;t know how to do most things and felt kinda lost.
But there it was again, that feeling of excitement to learn something new, which got my into self-hosting in the first place.</p>
<p>After some trial and error I managed to find a setup that works for me.
As per usual, it deviates a bit from what might be the most <em>common</em> setup, but it&#39;s undoubtedly <strong>me</strong>
(I&#39;ll probably explain more about it in the future, when things have settled).</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve come to appreciate about FreeBSD, and the BSD operating systems in general, is their simplicity and good documentation.
Most tasks are just a few commands to run via SSH and if that isn&#39;t the case, someone has probably written a decent wrapper around it.
If I need to find a piece of information, I still instinctively search online for it, just to be greeted by an online version of the corresponding man page.
So I could also have just gathered that information on the CLI, <em>oh well</em>.</p>
<p>I also love the focus on long-term compatibility.
I can find a solution to a problem in a forum post from 2008 and not even for a second do I have to doubt whether it will work, because it always does.
At the same time, that doesn&#39;t mean there are no new features.
The system doesn&#39;t feel old.</p>
<p>Sure, not everything was all roses and some of that was probably due to my way of just jumping into a problem and digging myself through it one step at a time, instead of reading up on it a lot beforehand.
For example I was confused for a long time about the release cycle of the base system and whether that somehow related to pkg and ports (It does not).
And I was not able to properly phrase the question in a way that would result in a helpful result while searching.
Luckily the BSD community has been nothing but kind and helpful so far.
I&#39;ve had multiple people on the Fediverse offer their help and when I had a specific question, I would always get multiple solid answers explaining it to me.
Thanks to everyone that replied, it&#39;s genuinely a blast to feel like a newbie again!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know whether I will actually stick with all of what I&#39;m doing right now, in the long term.
But that&#39;s not important.
What is important is that I&#39;m having fun, learning a new thing, right now.
I&#39;ll see what sticks long-term.</p>
