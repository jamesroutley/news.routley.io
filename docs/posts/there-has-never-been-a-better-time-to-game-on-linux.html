    <h1>There has never been a better time to game on Linux</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I&#39;ve been running Linux full-time pretty much since Valve released Proton. I remember submitting reports to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">ProtonDB</a> back when it was just a shared Google Sheet! In the years that followed I made it a point to test and report out on different games as new versions of Proton were released and support improved. I thought it important that we have a good data set for what worked and what didn&#39;t. Over those years I tested hundreds of games and submitted as many reports to the database.</p>
<p>In thinking back over my gaming in 2023, however, I realized that I fell out of the habit of submitting reports because <strong>I&#39;m so used to Proton working that it&#39;s stopped occurring to me that it might not.</strong></p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t some games that don&#39;t work -- it simply means that the success rate that I used to have (maybe 30-50% on average) has risen high enough that I&#39;m genuinely surprised if something doesn&#39;t work (it&#39;s probably somewhere around 95% for me now, though that&#39;s biased by the types of games that I play). I actually tried to remember the last game that <em>didn&#39;t</em> work, and I genuinely couldn&#39;t tell you what it was. Everything I&#39;ve played recently has booted like it&#39;s native.</p>
<p>Honestly, I genuinely don&#39;t even know which games are native and which run through Proton anymore. I&#39;ve stopped caring!</p>
<p>I got my Steam Deck halfway through 2022. It was awesome, but it was definitely a bit rough around the edges. There weren&#39;t that many compatible games. The OS had some clunkiness. It matured though, and has gotten better. Among my friend group, I&#39;m the only person who cares even a little bit about Linux. If you asked any of them to name three different Linux distributions they&#39;d stare at you blankly because they wouldn&#39;t understand the question. Nevertheless, of my friends, SIX of them have Steam Decks and are now gaming regularly <strong>on Linux.</strong></p>
<p>There are currently <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified">~4,300 Deck Verified games</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable">~8,700 Deck Playable games</a> according to Valve. On ProtonDB, ~8,600 games have been verified as working on Linux by at least three users, while ~19,700 games have been verified by at least one user. There is SO much variety available, and the speed with which we&#39;ve gotten here has been pretty breathtaking.</p>
<p>This was my device breakdown for my Steam Replay for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>55% Steam Deck</li>
<li>32% Linux</li>
<li>10% Virtual Reality</li>
<li>4% Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>The only non-Linux gaming I did was VR and some local multiplayer stuff I have on a Windows machine hooked up to my TV.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to proselytize too much, but if you have a general interest in gaming, you could probably switch over to Linux full time and be perfectly happy with the variety of games you have available to you. Not too long ago, making the jump felt like a huge sacrifice because you&#39;d be giving up so much -- SO many games were incompatible -- but it no longer feels that way. You can transfer and most of -- probably almost all -- your library will still work! Also, if a particular game doesn&#39;t work, there isn&#39;t too much sting because, well, there are thousands of others you can give your attention to.</p>
<p>If you have a specific game that you <em>must</em> play, then it&#39;s possibly a different story. If you love <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1085660"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>, for example, then full-time Linux definitely is not for you. The same goes VR -- it&#39;s simply not up to snuff on Linux yet. There are other niches too that don&#39;t transfer over as well (modding, racing sims, etc.) so, of course, this isn&#39;t a blanket recommendation and everyone&#39;s situation is different.</p>
<p>But for a prototypical person who&#39;s just your sort of general, everyday gamer? It&#39;s reached a point where they could be very happy on Linux. In fact, as proven by my friends and their Steam Decks, it&#39;s reached a point where people can be gaming on Linux <em>and not even know they&#39;re doing that.</em> That&#39;s how frictionless it&#39;s gotten!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really have a point to this post other than to say it&#39;s incredible that we are where we are, and I&#39;m beyond appreciative of all the effort that people have put in to making this possible.</p>
