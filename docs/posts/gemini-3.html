        <div><h3 data-block-key="vzong"><b>A note from Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai:</b></h3><p data-block-key="chas6">Nearly two years ago we kicked off the Gemini era, one of our biggest scientific and product endeavors ever undertaken as a company. Since then, it’s been incredible to see how much people love it. AI Overviews now have 2 billion users every month. The Gemini app surpasses 650 million users per month, more than 70% of our Cloud customers use our AI, 13 million developers have built with our generative models, and that is just a snippet of the impact we’re seeing.</p><p data-block-key="6j2i">And we’re able to get advanced capabilities to the world faster than ever, thanks to our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation — from our leading infrastructure to our world-class research and models and tooling, to products that reach billions of people around the world.</p><p data-block-key="8gp4r">Every generation of Gemini has built on the last, enabling you to do more. Gemini 1’s breakthroughs in <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/">native multimodality</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/">long context window</a> expanded the kinds of information that could be processed — and how much of it. Gemini 2 laid the foundation for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/#ceo-message">agentic capabilities</a> and pushed the frontiers on <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-thinking">reasoning and thinking</a>, helping with more complex tasks and ideas, leading to Gemini 2.5 Pro topping LMArena for over six months.</p><p data-block-key="brjb8">And now we’re introducing Gemini 3, our most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life.</p><p data-block-key="dqcvt">It’s state-of-the-art in reasoning, built to grasp depth and nuance — whether it’s perceiving the subtle clues in a creative idea, or peeling apart the overlapping layers of a difficult problem. Gemini 3 is also much better at figuring out the context and intent behind your request, so you get what you need with less prompting. It’s amazing to think that in just two years, AI has evolved from simply reading text and images to reading the room.</p><p data-block-key="blaun">And starting today, we’re shipping Gemini at the scale of Google. That includes Gemini 3 in <a href="http://blog.google/products/search/gemini-3-search-ai-mode">AI Mode in Search</a> with more complex reasoning and new dynamic experiences. This is the first time we are shipping Gemini in Search on day one. Gemini 3 is also coming today to the <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-gemini-app">Gemini app</a>, to developers in <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-3-developers">AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/gemini-3-is-available-for-enterprise">Vertex AI</a>, and in our new agentic development platform, <a href="http://antigravity.google">Google Antigravity</a> — more below.</p><p data-block-key="raau">Like the generations before it, Gemini 3 is once again advancing the state of the art. In this new chapter, we’ll continue to push the frontiers of intelligence, agents, and personalization to make AI truly helpful for everyone.</p><p data-block-key="95vlk">We hope you like Gemini 3, we&#39;ll keep improving it, and look forward to seeing what you build with it. Much more to come!</p><hr/></div>

Today we’re releasing <a href="http://antigravity.google/">Google Antigravity</a>, our new agentic development platform that enables developers to operate at a higher, task-oriented level.</p><p data-block-key="d28vq">Using Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning, tool use and agentic coding capabilities, Google Antigravity transforms AI assistance from a tool in a developer’s toolkit into an active partner. While the core of Google Antigravity is a familiar AI IDE experience, its agents have been elevated to a dedicated surface and given direct access to the editor, terminal and browser. Now, agents can autonomously plan and execute complex, end-to-end software tasks simultaneously on your behalf while validating their own code.</p><p data-block-key="3jg05">In addition to Gemini 3 Pro, Google Antigravity also comes tightly coupled with our latest Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model for browser control and our top-rated image editing model Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Image).</p></div>
