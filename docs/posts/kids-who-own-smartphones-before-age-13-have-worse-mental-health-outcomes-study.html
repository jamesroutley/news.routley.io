Girls reported lower emotional resilience and lower confidence, while boys reported feeling less calm, less stable and less empathetic.</p><p>&#34;The younger the child gets a smartphone, the more exposure to all this impacts them psychologically and shapes the way they think and view the world,&#34; Tara Thiagarajan, one of the study&#39;s authors, told ABC News in an emailed statement.</p><p>About 48% of young women who had smartphones by 5 or 6 years old reported having severe suicidal thoughts, compared to 28% of females who had smartphones by 13 or older.</p><p>In young men, 31% of those who had smartphones by 5 or 6 years old reported having severe suicidal thoughts and 20% of males who had smartphones by 13 or older reported having severe suicidal thoughts.</p><p>Study authors attributed the differences between young women&#39;s and young men&#39;s mental health symptoms to social media usage. Other factors that seemed to impact mental health outcomes were cyberbullying, poor sleep and poor family relationships.</p><p>The study&#39;s authors recommended restricting smartphone and social media access for kids under 13, promoting digital literacy education and corporate accountability.</p><p>&#34;Ideally, children should not have a smartphone until age 14, and when they do get a smartphone, parents should take the time to discuss with their children how to interact on the Internet and explain the consequences of doing various things,&#34; Thiagarajan added.</p><p>ABC News&#39; <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/video/123920766" target="_blank">Dr. Tara Narula also said on &#34;Good Morning America&#34;</a> Monday that limiting kids&#39; access to social media appears to be a key step in protecting children and their mental health outcomes.</p><p>&#34;The longer we can push off allowing our kids to be on social media, we are learning, the better,&#34; Narula said. &#34;I think lots of families are getting creative … landlines …. flip phones for kids [are] maybe an option so that they can have access to communicating without all the other things that come with smartphones.&#34;</p><p>The study&#39;s findings come amid an effort led by social psychologist <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/author-suggests-guidelines-parents-kids-phones-social-media-108509992" target="_blank">Jonathan Haidt</a>, author of &#34;Anxious Generation,&#34; to limit kids&#39; smartphone use due to the impact on their mental health. Haidt has proposed setting nationwide &#34;norms&#34; or guidelines, including not giving children a smartphone before high school, no social media before age 16 and establishing schools as phone-free zones.</p><p>Pediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert also recommended that parents demonstrate to children how to use smartphones responsibly.</p><p>&#34;Children watch everything you do -- and that doesn&#39;t stop until they leave your house,&#34; Burgert told ABC News via email. &#34;Connect authentically and meaningfully for a few minutes every day, and show your children that the humans we live with are more important and worthy of our attention than our phones.&#34;</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends families follow <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/5cs-of-media-use/" target="_blank">the 5 C&#39;s of media use</a>, including teaching kids and teens how to be safe online, since content and advertisements may be targeting an older audience.</p><ul data-testid="prism-list"><li data-testid="prism-list-item"><strong>Child</strong> - Consider your child and their personality.
