    <h1>This Week&#39;s Hype</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>This morning Quanta Magazine informs us that <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/">Physicists Create a Wormhole Using a Quantum Computer</a>, promoting the article on Twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/QuantaMagazine/status/1597984021522178048">BREAKING: Physicists have built a wormhole and successfully sent information from one end to the other</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nattyover/status/1597984919904718848">Physicists have used Google’s quantum computer to send a signal through a wormhole, a shortcut in space-time first theorized by Einstein and Rosen in 1935</a>. </p>
<p>This work is getting the full-press promotional package:  no preprint on the arXiv (unless I’m missing something?), embargoed info to journalists, with reveal at <a href="https://caltech.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_TxwTFpAPRXusyTqm4qaa_g">a press conference</a>, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/volumes/612/issues/7938">cover story in Nature</a>, accompanied by a barrage of press releases (see <a href="https://inqnet.caltech.edu/wormhole2022/">here</a>, <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2022/11/fermilab-and-collaborators-lead-work-on-quantum-gravity-tests/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/physicists-observe-wormhole-dynamics-using-a-quantum-computer">here</a>, with Harvard, MIT and Google to come).  This is the kind of PR effort for a physics result I’ve only seen before for things like the Higgs and LIGO gravitational wave discoveries (OK, and the primordial gravitational wave non-discovery).  It would be appropriate I suppose if someone actually had built a wormhole in a lab and teleported information through it, as advertised.</p>
<p>An additional part of the package is the Quanta coverage, with a very long article by Natalie Wolchover and an over-the-top seventeen minute film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJCS1W1uzg">How Physicists Created a Wormhole in a Quantum Computer</a>, with abstract</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost a century ago, Albert Einstein realized that the equations of general relativity could produce wormholes. But it would take a number of theoretical leaps and a “crazy” team of experimentalists to build one on Google’s quantum computer. </p></blockquote>
<p>The two senior physicists behind this, Joe Lykken and Maria Spiropulu, have histories that go way back of successfully promoting to the press nonsense about exotic space-time structures appearing in experiments that have nothing to do with them.  Back in 1999, the New York Times published <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/040400sci-universal-theory.html">Physicists Finally Find a Way to Test Superstring theory</a>, which featured Joe Lykken. In 2003, they featured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/30/science/scientist-at-work-maria-spiropulu-other-dimensions-she-s-in-pursuit.html">Maria Spiropulu explaining how she was going to find extra dimensions</a> (or “something just as ‘crazy””) at the Tevatron, or failing that, the LHC.</p>
<p>I just saw that the New York Times also has a big story about this: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/science/physics-wormhole-quantum-computer.html">Physicists Create ‘the Smallest, Crummiest Wormhole You Can Imagine’</a>.  At least this article has some sensible skeptical quotes, including:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The most important thing I’d want New York Times readers to understand is this,” Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing expert at the University of Texas in Austin, wrote in an email. “If this experiment has brought a wormhole into actual physical existence, then a strong case could be made that you, too, bring a wormhole into actual physical existence every time you sketch one with pen and paper.”</p></blockquote>
<p>An odd thing about the Quanta article is that it contains a couple quotes from me, that aren’t at all about the wormhole business. They’re about the attempt to use AdS/CFT to either solve QCD or get a viable theory of quantum gravity.  Back in June Wolchover contacted me with some questions about AdS/CFT.  It seems that she was planning a long piece on AdS/CFT, one which somehow many months later got amalgamated with the wormhole nonsense.  I had forgotten that I was thinking of turning what I sent her back then into a blog posting but never got around to it, so just earlier today posted it <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13184">here</a>.</p>
<p>On the substance of what is really going on here, it’s exactly the same as what was discussed extensively a month ago in <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13113">this posting</a> and in its comment section.  The claim that “Physicists Create a Wormhole” is just complete bullshit, with the huge campaign to mislead the public about this a disgrace, highly unhelpful for the credibility of physics research in particular and science in general.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here’s the <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/making-traversable-wormhole-with.html">promotional piece from Google</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/WKCosmo/status/1598050909350944768">Will Kinney’s reaction</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Physics World has <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-teleportation-opens-a-wormhole-in-spacetime/">Quantum teleportation opens a ‘wormhole in spacetime’</a> with a quote from Witten saying positive things about this experiment (“a ‘milestone’ in developing control over microscopic quantum systems”), nothing about the wormholes.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I tried reading the paper in some more detail. Almost all the calculations in the paper were done on paper or on a classical computer. As far as I can tell, all they did was perform elaborate SYK calculations on a classical computer, together with simulations of noise on the Google quantum computer, trying to find a possible calculation on the quantum computer that would have signal, not just noise.  Once such an N=7 SYK calculation was identified, they used a 9 qubit quantum computer and the noisy result matched the simulation result from the classical computer, exactly as expected.  Seeing the completely expected match between results from a 9 bit noisy quantum computer and the results of the simulation of this on a classical computer caused Maria Spiropulu to say that “I was shaken” and “It was nuts. It was nuts”, while Joe Lykken felt that the moment was on a par with discovery of the Higgs particle.</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed that the Nature issue comes with an article by Brown and Susskind, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03832-z">A holographic wormhole traversed in a quantum computer</a>.  Amidst the hype, they do at least point out:</p>
<blockquote><p>because nine qubits can be easily simulated on a classical computer, the results of this experiment cannot teach us anything that could not be learnt from a classical computation, and will not teach us anything new about quantum gravity.</p></blockquote>
<p>New Scientist is the sober one here, with their headline the relatively reasonable <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2349118-a-quantum-computer-has-simulated-a-wormhole-for-the-first-time/">A quantum computer has simulated a wormhole for the first time</a></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  MSN is going for the larger context: physicists didn’t just create a wormhole in a lab, also <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/this-tiny-2d-wormhole-could-finally-solve-the-biggest-problem-in-physics/ar-AA14KTHu">This tiny 2D wormhole could finally solve the biggest problem in physics</a></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Andreas Karch <a href="https://twitter.com/karch_andreas/status/1598097349959888898">on Twitter</a> I think has an accurate characterization of this “mostly a publicity stunt”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Experimentally it’s of course cool they can do SYK – as a demonstration they have control over their device. They can couple 9 qbits in a pre-specified way. But I guess we knew they could do this before. Going after SYK in particular, in my mind, is mostly a publicity stunt.</p></blockquote>
