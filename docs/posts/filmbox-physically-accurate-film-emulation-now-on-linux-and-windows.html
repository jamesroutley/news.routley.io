    <h1>Show HN: Filmbox, physically accurate film emulation, now on Linux and Windows</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2>A holistic reproduction of photochemical motion picture imaging.</h2><h2>Based on empirical data and refined for creative utility.</h2><h2>Built for high-end production. Right in DaVinci Resolve.</h2></p><div><div><p><h2>The look and feel of motion picture film defines a century of art.</h2><h2>As we move beyond photochemical imaging, we need not leave behind its aesthetic quality.</h2></p><div><div><div><p><h2>Film has a unique response to light intensity and wavelength. Filmbox uses rich empirical datasets to transform scene-referred image data to embody the non-linearities of contact-printed negative.</h2></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><h2>As light strikes color film negative, different wavelengths scatter within the layers of emulsion and affect neighboring image regions in a very specific way. Filmbox convolves digital image data to exhibit the soft yet detailed quality of the negative.</h2></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><h2>The perceptual intensity of film grain varies with the density of the developed negative. Filmbox reproduces the quality and tonal distribution of grain as well as other subtle effects of the development process.</h2></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><h2>Film transport mechanisms are not perfectly stable, and labs are not perfectly clean. If desired, Filmbox can model the subtle instability of real 35mm and 16mm cameras, and procedurally place samples of real dust.</h2></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p><h2>The look of projected film is the combination of the spectral characteristics of the negative and the print.</h2><h2>Filmbox maps the emulated negative to the light output of the digital display using a characterization of the combined photometric response of an actual contact printed negative.</h2></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
