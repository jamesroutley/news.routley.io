The result has been a plummeting Turkish lira and far less spending power for the average Turk.</p><p>Erdogan instructed the country&#39;s central bank — which analysts say has no independence from him — to repeatedly slash borrowing rates last year even as inflation continued to rise. Central bank chiefs who expressed opposition to this course of action were fired; by the spring of 2021, Turkey&#39;s central bank had seen four different governors in two years.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-106996805" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>Turkish lira and U.S. dollar</p><p>Resul Kaboglu | NurPhoto via Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div><p>The Turkish president vowed to deliver a new economic model that would bring about a boom in export wealth thanks to a cheaper lira, and then tackle inflation by getting rid of Turkey&#39;s longtime trade deficit. That has not happened, and now sky-high costs for energy imports that need to be paid in dollars — a lot more dollars, thanks to the weakness of the lira — are putting intense pressure on the economy.</p><p>Economic analysts expect the trajectory for Turkey&#39;s inflation will only get worse.</p><p>&#34;The laser focus on heterodox measures over conventional monetary policy will unlikely solve the inflation challenge and we anticipate levels breaching 80% y/y in Q3-22,&#34; Ehsan Khoman, director of emerging markets research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at MUFG Bank, wrote on Twitter following the release of figures.</p><p>Speaking to CNBC, Khoman added that he expects Turkey&#39;s inflation to &#34;stay north of 70% y/y until November owing to a confluence of elevated commodity prices, rising domestic production costs and a precipitously depreciating lira.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Turkey back in the inflation age of the 1990s. Looks as if Erdogan has lost his last econ credibility,&#34; Holger Zschapitz, finance editor at German daily Die Welt, wrote on Twitter. &#34;Erdogan&#39;s unorthodox strategy for managing the country&#39;s $790bn econ continued to backfire,&#34; he wrote in another tweet.</p><p>The 73.5% figure for Turkey&#39;s consumer price index is up from 70% the month before.</p></div></div></div>
