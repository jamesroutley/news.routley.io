    <h1>Ask HN: What are these strange random strings spamming my blog?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have a wordpress blog, and recently I discovered that there are several spam comments daily which have seemingly random strings in the content. The comments don&#39;t have any other (human readable) links, which are usually present in other spam comments. Can someone explain what is the point of such random strings? Do they mean/represent anything?</p><p>Some example of spam comments</p><p><a href="https://imgur.com/3FVR7Yn" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/3FVR7Yn</a></p></div></div></div>
