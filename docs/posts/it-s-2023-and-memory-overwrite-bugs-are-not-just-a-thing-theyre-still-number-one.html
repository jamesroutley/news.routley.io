    <h1>It&#39;s 2023 and memory overwrite bugs are not just a thing theyre still number one</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The most dangerous type of software bug is the out-of-bounds write, according to MITRE this week. This type of flaw is responsible for 70 CVE-tagged holes in the US government&#39;s list of known vulnerabilities that are under active attack and need to be patched, we note.</p>
<p>Out-of-bounds write, sometimes labeled <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html">CWE-787</a>, also took the top spot in 2022, showing a distinct lack of improvement.</p>
<p>An out-of-bounds write happens when software (and sometimes hardware) alters memory it&#39;s not supposed to, such as by writing data to a memory buffer and overshooting the end of that buffer, causing it to unexpectedly change other variables and information and/or just crash. That kind of bug can be triggered accidentally through normal operation, or it can be triggered deliberately by exploit code.</p>

    

<p>Typically, exploit code will induce an out-of-bounds write to alter data structures so that the flow of execution is hijacked and diverted in a way the attacker chooses, allowing them to take control of the software, be it an application, a remote service, or part of an operating system. Ideally, software should be written to prevent this kind of overwrite, and using memory-safe languages like Rust <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/11/nsa_urges_orgs_to_use/">can help here</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>Number two on MITRE&#39;s list is the less complex but still annoying cross-site scripting bug (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html">CWE-79</a>), which was key in four CVEs in the known exploited vulnerabilities <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">catalog</a> maintained by Uncle Sam&#39;s CISA. This bug type is a fancy form of a failure to sanitize user input.</p>
<p>Number three — SQL injection flaws (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html">CWE-89</a>) — account for four known exploited bugs in the CISA catalog. Again, another form of input sanitization failure. Clean and neutralize your inputs, people. You can&#39;t assume all your users are nice.</p>

        

<p>MITRE compiles the annual <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html">CWE Top 25 list</a> by analyzing public vulnerability data in America&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a>. This year&#39;s list is based on 43,996 CVE records for vulnerabilities in 2021 and 2022, and was issued in hand with US Homeland Security and CISA.</p>
<p>&#34;These weaknesses lead to serious vulnerabilities in software,&#34; the cybersecurity agency <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/06/29/2023-cwe-top-25-most-dangerous-software-weaknesses">warned</a> today. &#34;An attacker can often exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system, steal data, or prevent applications from working.&#34; </p>
<p>In fact, the top three most dangerous software weaknesses for 2023 were also the most dangerous, and in the same order, in the 2022 list. Progress is slow, it seems.</p>
<div>
<h3>Time to get patching</h3>

<p>Also today, CISA added eight more flaws to its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog</a>. These affect D-Link and Samsung devices and they are tracked as:</p>

<ul>
<li>CVSS 9.8 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25717">CVE-2019-17621</a> D-Link DIR-859 router contains a command execution vulnerability.</li>

<li>CVSS 7.8 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20500">CVE-2019-20500</a> D-Link DWL-2600AP access points are vulnerable to command injection attacks.</li>

<li>CVSS 7.8 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25487">CVE-2021-25487</a> Samsung mobile devices are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. </li>

<li>CVSS 5.5 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25489">CVE-2021-25489</a> Samsung mobile devices contain an improper input validation flaw.</li>

<li>CVSS 6.4 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25394">CVE-2021-25394</a> Samsung mobile devices are susceptible to a race condition vulnerability.</li>

<li>CVSS 9.0 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-3427">CVE-2021-25395</a> another race condition bug in Samsung mobile devices, but this one&#39;s critical. </li>

<li>CVSS 6.7 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25371">CVE-2021-25371</a> an unspecified flaw in Samsung mobile devices.</li>

<li>CVSS 6.7 — <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25372">CVE-2021-25372</a> Samsung mobile devices contain an improper boundary check vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Number four, however, was one of the &#34;biggest movers&#34; on the list, jumping from the seventh spot last year to the fourth-ranked most dangerous issue this year. It&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html">CWE-416</a>, or use-after-free. This type of exploitable bug is when a program, remote service, or operating system component releases memory that&#39;s no longer needed, and then continues to use it anyway. At that point, it&#39;s relying on memory that could be, say, manipulated by some other code, and can lead to crashes or hijacking of execution.</p>
<p>Again, memory-safe languages are useful here as they abstract away this fiddly memory management, or ensure insecure memory use is blocked.</p>

        

<p>Some of the other biggest movers up the list, according to MITRE, include <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html">CWE-862</a>, which covers missing authorization bugs. This weakness jumped from sixteenth position last year to number 11 in 2023.  </p>
<p>Additionally, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html">CWE-269</a> (improper privilege management) moved up seven places to 22 on the list, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html">CWE-863</a> (incorrect authorization) went from rose four ranks to number 24.</p>

</ul>
<p>There&#39;s also a couple new entries to this year&#39;s list: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html">CWE-269</a> (improper privilege management), in 22nd place, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html">CWE-863</a> (incorrect authorization) as a newcomer in 24th.</p>
<p>&#34;CWEs are becoming more and more prevalent in vulnerability exposure conversations as the community looks to avoid the root causes that can become vulnerabilities,&#34; according to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html">MITRE</a>. </p>
<p>To this end, the nonprofit will publish a series of reports over the next few months that aim to help organizations &#34;more effectively&#34; use the Top 25 list. These will cover a range of topics including weaknesses that didn&#39;t quite make the Top 25 — but orgs should still be aware of them. </p>
<p>It will also publish a report on trends in CWEs over the last four years, and a report on actively exploited weaknesses based on CISA&#39;s catalog.  ®</p>
