    <h1>Finite-choice logic programming @ POPL</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-3lgtpi4n="">  <p>This week, on stage with <a href="https://www.convivial.tools/">Chris</a> and
<a href="https://www.rntz.net/">Michael</a>, I presented our work on Finite-Choice Logic
Programming, the theory behind
<a href="https://dusa.rocks">our Dusa logic programming language</a>. There were hats
involved, as captured in this beautiful image from
<a href="https://types.pl/@atsuzaki">Katherine Philip</a>.</p>

<p>(Special thanks to <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rxg/">Ron</a> who stole the show in
his pivotal role as a very convincing heckler,

<p>I’ll update this post once the video is cropped out of the livestream and
posted on the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@acmsigplan/videos">SIGPLAN YouTube page</a>. However,
if you weren’t there, the best presentation is probably
<a href="https://typesafety.net/misc/finite-choice-logic-programming-popl-slides-transcript.pdf">this PDF with lightly edited slides and a minimally edited transcript of the talk</a>.
The full story, of course, is <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704849">in the paper</a>.</p>
<p>I hope we communicate why we’re interested in the
principles underlying this new programming language. The talk barely mentions
the Dusa implementation; instead, it focuses on how we were able to define the
meaning of programs as a potentially-infinite set of solutions, all of which
disagree with each other. I’ve been describing our central mathematical
construction — defining a complete lattice of
sets-of-incompatible-sets-of-facts — as “just annoying enough that I
understand why nobody else did it before” (at least nobody else, to our
knowledge, did it to solve the problem we were solving). But now that we’ve
written this out, I hope it’s a chunk of math that others will find useful
in other work!</p>  </div></div>
