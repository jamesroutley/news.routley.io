    <h1>What helps people get comfortable on the command line?</h1>
    
    

<p>Sometimes I talk to friends who need to use the command line, but are
intimidated by it. I never really feel like I have good advice (I&rsquo;ve been using
the command line for too long), and so I asked some people <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/110842645317766338">on Mastodon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you just stopped being scared of the command line in the last year or
three — what helped you?</p>

<p>(no need to reply if you don’t remember, or if you’ve been using the command
line comfortably for 15 years — this question isn’t for you :) )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This list is still a bit shorter than I would like, but I&rsquo;m posting it in the
hopes that I can collect some more answers. There obviously isn&rsquo;t one single
thing that works for everyone &ndash; different people take different paths.</p>

<p>I think there are two parts to getting comfortable: <strong>motivation</strong> and <strong>resources</strong>. I&rsquo;ll
start with a couple of motivations and then list some resources.</p>

<h3 id="a-killer-app">a &ldquo;killer app&rdquo;</h3>

<p>A few people mentioned a &ldquo;killer command line app&rdquo; that motivated them to start
spending more time on the command line. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a></li>
<li>jq</li>
<li>wget / curl</li>
<li>git (some folks found they preferred the git CLI to using a GUI)</li>
<li>ffmpeg (for video work)</li>
<li>hard drive data recovery tools (from <a href="https://github.com/summeremacs/public/blob/main/20230629T180135--how-i-came-to-use-emacs-and-other-things__emacs_explanation_linux_origin_raspberrypi_story_terminal.org">this great story</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of people also mentioned getting frustrated with GUI tools (like heavy
IDEs that use all your RAM and crash your computer) and being motivated to
replace them with much lighter weight command line tools.</p>

<h3 id="inspiring-command-line-wizardry">inspiring command line wizardry</h3>

<p>One person mentioned being motivated by seeing cool stuff other people were
doing with the command line, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQnyApKysg4&amp;feature=youtu.be">this &ldquo;command-line chainsaw&rdquo; talk by Gary Bernhardt</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="explain-shell">explain shell</h3>

<p>Several people mentioned <a href="https://explainshell.com/">explainshell</a> where you
can paste in any shell incantation and get it to break it down into different
parts.</p>

<h3 id="history-tab-completion-etc">history, tab completion, etc:</h3>

<p>There were lots of little tips and tricks mentioned that make it a lot easier
to work on the command line, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>up arrow to see the previous command</li>
<li>Ctrl+R to search your bash history</li>
<li>setting bash history to unlimited</li>
<li><code>cd -</code> to go back to the previous directory</li>
<li>tab completion of filenames and command names</li>
<li>learning how to use a pager like <code>less</code> to read man pages or other large text files (how to search, scroll, etc)</li>
<li>using pbcopy/pbpaste on OS X to copy/paste from your clipboard to stdout/stdin</li>
<li>backing up configuration files before editing them</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="raspberry-pi">raspberry pi</h3>

<p>Some people started using a Raspberry Pi, where it&rsquo;s safer to experiment
without worrying about breaking your computer (you can just erase the SD card and start over!)</p>

<h3 id="a-fancy-shell-setup">a fancy shell setup</h3>

<p>Lots of people said they got more comfortable with the command line
when they started using a more user-friendly shell setup like
<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> or <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>. I really
agree with this one &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been using fish for 10 years and I love it.</p>

<p>A couple of other things you can do here:</p>

<ul>
<li>some folks said that making their terminal prettier helped them feel more
comfortable (&ldquo;make it pink!&rdquo;).</li>
<li>set up a fancy shell prompt to give you more information (for example you can
make the prompt red when a command fails). Specifically <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/dsh1g3/new_powerlevel10k_feature_transient_prompt/">transient prompts</a>
(where you set a super fancy prompt for the current command, but a much
simpler one for past commands) seem really nice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some tools for theming your terminal:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell">base16-shell</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">powerlevel10k</a> is a popular fancy zsh theme which has transient prompts</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/starship/starship">starship</a> is a fancy prompt tool</li>
<li>on a Mac, I think <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> is easier to customize than the default terminal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-helpful-friend-or-coworker">a helpful friend or coworker</h3>

<p>Someone who can answer beginner questions and give you pointers is invaluable.</p>

<h3 id="aliases">aliases</h3>

<p>Lots of people said that making their own aliases or scripts for commonly used
tasks felt like a magical &ldquo;a ha!&rdquo; moment, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>they don&rsquo;t have to remember the syntax</li>
<li>then they have a list of their most commonly used commands that they can summon easily</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cheat-sheets-to-get-examples">cheat sheets to get examples</h3>

<p>A lot of man pages don&rsquo;t have examples, for example the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/s_client">openssl s_client</a> man page has no examples.
This makes it a lot harder to get started!</p>

<p>People mentioned a couple of cheat sheet tools, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tldr.sh/">tldr.sh</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cheat/cheat">cheat</a> (which has the bonus of being editable &ndash; you can add your own commands to reference later)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example the <a href="https://github.com/cheat/cheatsheets/blob/master/openssl">cheat page for openssl</a> is really
great &ndash; I think it includes almost everything I&rsquo;ve ever actually used openssl
for in practice (except the <code>-servername</code> option for <code>openssl s_client</code>).</p>

<h3 id="don-t-try-to-memorize">don&rsquo;t try to memorize</h3>

<p>A couple of people said that they needed to change their approach &ndash; instead of
trying to memorize all the commands, they realized they could just look up
commands as needed and they&rsquo;d naturally memorize the ones they used the most
over time.</p>

<p>(I actually recently had the exact same realization about learning to read x86
assembly &ndash; I was taking a class and the instructor said &ldquo;yeah, just look
everything up every time to start, eventually you&rsquo;ll learn the most common
instructions by heart&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Some people also said the opposite &ndash; that they used a spaced repetition app
like Anki to memorize commonly used commands.</p>

<h3 id="vim">vim</h3>

<p>One person mentioned that they started using vim on the command line to edit
files, and once they were using a terminal text editor it felt more natural to
use the command line for other things too.</p>

<p>Also apparently there&rsquo;s a new editor called
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is like a nicer version of
pico/nano, for folks who don&rsquo;t want to learn emacs or vim.</p>

<h3 id="use-linux-on-the-desktop">use Linux on the desktop</h3>

<p>One person said that they started using Linux as their main daily driver, and
having to fix Linux issues helped them learn. That&rsquo;s also how I got comfortable
with the command too back in ~2004 (I was really into installing lots of
different Linux distributions to try to find my favourite one), but my guess is
that it&rsquo;s not the most popular strategy these days.</p>

<h3 id="workshops">workshops</h3>

<p>A couple of people said that workshops like <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>
workshops (an introduction to the command line, git, and Python/R programming
for scientists) helped them get more comfortable with the command line.</p>

<p>You can see the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/">software carpentry curriculum here</a>.</p>
