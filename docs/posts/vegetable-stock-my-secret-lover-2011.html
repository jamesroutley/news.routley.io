    <h1>Vegetable stock: my secret lover (2011)</h1>

      <p>After learning how to season food correctly, homemade stock is the single best thing anyone can do for his cooking. A stock is a liquid extraction of complementary flavors, a broad palette upon which sharper splashes of color may be painted.</p><p>Stock is about balance and intensity of flavor. Making a mushroom sauce? If you were to just purée some cooked mushrooms, the isolated flavor would taste harsh, but add some stock and it will gain balancing sweet and vegetal notes. Those carrots need more flavor? Simmer them in stock instead of water: stocks are <em>distillations</em> of elemental flavors. They can be diluted or concentrated at will.</p><p>I credit stock with much of my ability to impress in the kitchen. They’re as much cooking <em>technique</em> as they are <em>ingredient</em>. But, you keen, they’re too hard to make! They take too long! Nay. Sit down. Let me tell you about my favorite stock. I make it almost weekly, and it’s so easy that I am positively mystified why every cook in every household isn’t making this elixir regularly. Let me tell you about vegetable stock, and let me tell you how to make it.</p><figure data-orig-height="332" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f84e012219370d5597eb5e08066e7506/c799129b728d7012-d7/s500x750/ed39872cda25e360f2b67786d97a2533c6671440.jpg" data-orig-height="332" data-orig-width="500" width="500" height="332" alt="image"/></figure><p>I made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasturtium_(genus)">nasturtium</a> soup this weekend, and the subsequent dinner’s conversation remained imperturbably anchored to how unbelievably tasty it was. Yet it consisted of nothing more than nasturtium leaves puréed with vegetable stock, with a nasturtium flower for garnish.</p><p>Consider how else you might make this soup. You’ve got some nasturtium leaves: fine. How will you turn that into a soup? You’ll need to add some liquid, clearly. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=nasturtium+soup&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Looking around the internet</a>, I see a minefield of misguided ideas. Steep the leaves? That will diminish their brightness. No, they need to be puréed uncooked. But with what? Cream? That will dull the leaves’ radish-y spice. Chicken broth or stock? The flavor of nasturtium is too delicate: you’ll overpower it. Thicken with potato? We don’t need filler here. Water? The result will taste thin and incomplete, lacking sweetness and umami.</p><p>Purée the leaves with vegetable stock and it will taste like a garden. It will taste like it smelled when you went back there to pick the nasturtium. It will taste like sitting in a park in spring. And then the horseradish spice of the leaves will give you a hearty, well-rounded slap and bring you back to the kitchen.</p><h4>Making vegetable stock</h4><p>Get three large carrots, an onion, two leeks, and a bulb of fennel. Peel the carrots and onion; discard all but the white and light-green part of the leeks. Wash the leeks and fennel. Chop everything up finely and put it in a big pot with a few glugs of oil.</p><p>Now you’re going to sweeten up these vegetables by cooking them over low heat. You don’t want to brown them—that will make a darker, richer variant of this stock, which should be bright and clean. Add a large three-fingered pinch of salt to draw out the vegetables’ juices and turn the heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about fifteen minutes. Taste an onion. It should be quite sweet.</p><p>Add enough water to cover the vegetables, then add that amount of water twice more. Bring the water to a bare simmer and then let it cook for forty-five minutes.</p><p>Strain the stock. That’s it. Store it in your fridge, but the stock will lose its brightness after a few days. That’s why, when America’s Test Kitchen set out to find the best grocery store vegetable stock, they concluded that all of them were unusable.</p><p>This stock provides a mostly neutral foundation for flavor. You can adjust for its intended purpose readily and improvisationally. Want grassier flavors? Add half a bunch of parsley. Heartier? Brown the vegetables while sautéing them. Asian flavors? Add ginger, a little lemongrass, and star anise. And so on.</p><h4>How else you might use this stock</h4><p>Reduce the stock by half, add salt and some fresh lemon juice; and you will have the best vegetable broth you’ve ever tasted. Add a bunch of fresh, perfectly-cooked summer vegetables immediately before serving and you will <em>wow</em> people. One friend, tasting in disbelief, asked how much honey I added to make it so sweet. I told him “three carrots.”</p><p>Make risotto with it. Cook pasta in it. Any vegetable which you would normally cook by simmering in water (carrots, potatoes, turnips, pearl onions…)? Cook them in this with a healthy dose of salt. Make a fantastic sauce for any dish by puréeing a complementary, perfectly-cooked vegetable with reduced stock. Season it and use it in place of store-bought chicken broth: that stuff tastes like industrial chemicals.</p><p>Once you’ve got this down, no one will have to persuade you to learn about chicken, veal, pork, fish, and mushroom stocks.</p>
