    <div><p>Providing a compact and accessible overview of the status of a project is very important for a production team. And it&#39;s quite a challenge, since almost every team member has a different angle when viewing or thinking about the status of the project.</p>
<p>Today we are sharing Watchtower: a visual film production tracking tool. Watchtower helps visualizing the status of a short film, episode or film sequence and unpack as much information as needed, down to the duration of a shot and assets used in it. All in the space of one screen.</p>

<p>Watchtower was developed during the creation of <a href="https://studio.blender.org/films/sprite-fright/">Sprite Fright</a>, originally as a Blender add-on called edit-breakdown, and subsequently as a web application. You can check out a <a href="https://kitsu.blender.cloud/watchtower-demo/#/pro/fc77c0b9-bb76-41c3-b843-c9b156f9b3ec" target="_blank">live demo</a>, and a features overview right here.</p>
<p><iframe width="720" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n28PnQFSmU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grid view (for shots and assets) with grouping and filtering tools</li>
<li>Detail view, displaying shot or asset details</li>
<li>Timeline showing individual shots as well as task statuses</li>
<li>Compatible with <a href="https://github.com/cgwire/zou">Zou</a> as data backend</li>
<li>Watchtower is Free Software, available under the GPL3 license</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Watchtower is a web application that can fetch data from a live Kitsu web API or from JSON files, allowing it to be used in a production environment with user authentication (Kitsu server), or integrated with other task management software via JSON data interchange.</p>
<p>Watchtower is tailored to display the edit video in sync with data for shots timing information, their grouping in sequences, assets and their usage in shots, task types and their completion status and assignee per shot/asset.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions on how to deploy Watchtower are available in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/blender/watchtower/-/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The grid-paradigm has proven itself quite powerful, and could be explored as a UI option for other tasks as well, such as render management. Next up is a workflow for creating and editing the shot data from within Watchtower, as well as casting assets in a fast, visual and interactive way.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>Special thanks to Inês Almeida for co-developing the prototype and for the web rendering backend. Thanks to Pablo Vazquez for UI feedback and contributions.</p>
