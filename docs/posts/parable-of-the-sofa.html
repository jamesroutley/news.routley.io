    <h1>Parable of the Sofa</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">When Lauren was pregnant with a child who’s now turning 25, we purchased a comfy dark-brown
    leather sofa which fits our living room nicely.  
    What with kids and relatives and
    employees and cats and Standards Comittees and friends and book clubs and socials, the butt-support cushions had, a quarter
    century later, worn out. So we had them replaced, at a fair price, by a small local business. Which is something that modern
    capitalism is trying to make impossible.</p>

<p><img alt="Worn leather with a phone for scale" title="Worn leather with a phone for scale" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/01/worn.png"/></p><p>I’ll be honest; when we realized how ratty the sofa was getting, my first thought was “crap, gonna have to buy a sofa”. But
    Lauren said “No, because new sofas suck. Also, Luxcious.”</p>

<p>I’ll get to Luxcious in a bit, but it turns out that new sofas, by and large, really do. Why would that be? Well, check out
    <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/dtc-sofa-crisis-32304b9e">Why Are (Most) Sofas So Bad?</a> in <cite>Dwell</cite>
    magazine which has a weirdly-intermittent paywall, here’s <a href="https://archive.is/deGMX">another version</a>.</p>

<p>From early in the piece: “Sofas made in the past 15 years or so are absolute garbage, constructed of
    sawdust compressed and bonded with cheap glue, simple brackets in place of proper joinery, substandard spring design, flimsy
    foam, and a lot of staples.” It’s excellent, well-written, and will take you some surprising places.</p>

<p>But the subtext is
    drearily familiar. Globalization: Check. Cheap-labor arbitrage: Check. Tax engineering: Check. High profits:
    Check. Flat-packing: Check. Late Capitalism: Check check fucking check.</p>

<p>But, quality furniture is expensive to make, and
    should be, but doesn’t wear out fast, thus deserves extended maintenance.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>Luxcious</span> · 
Its
    <a href="https://luxciousupholstery.ca">Web site</a> (“Breathe new life into old furniture”) is way prettier than its location,
    in an old and extremely miscellaneous high-traffic zone: auto-body shops, hipster lounges, self-storage, beauty supplies…</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/01/-big/PXL_20240528_195945287.jpg.html"><img alt="Luxcious on Main Street" title="Luxcious on Main Street" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/01/PXL_20240528_195945287.png"/></a></p>
<p>They’re family-run and idiosyncratic. You have to know how to find the sketchy rear parking lot and walk in the back
    door. But they’re friendly and competent. Here’s the new leather they bought for the cushions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/01/-big/PXL_20240522_202346949.jpg.html"><img alt="One cow’s worth of leather" title="One cow’s worth of leather" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/01/PXL_20240522_202346949.png"/></a></p>
<p>And here’s the sofa with the re-covered cushions in place.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/01/-big/PXL_20240528_204400696.jpg.html"><img alt="Sofa with refinished cushions" title="Sofa with refinished cushions" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/01/PXL_20240528_204400696.png"/></a></p>
<p>Yes, from this angle, the new cushions make the sofa’s back look shabby, but it’s not as obvious to the naked eye and after a
    decade or so we’ll never notice it.</p>

<p>The whole job cost us $1100 Canadian.
    Given that the sofa cost three-thousand-plus 1999 dollars and new leather sofas of the “not flat-packed sawdust and
    glue” variety quickly get into five figures, the choice was a no-brainer.</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>“Lifestyle”</span> · 
This kind of transaction is exactly what modern capitalism is trying to stamp out.</p>

<p>A single-location family-owned business that provides a living for a few people? With no plans to load up on debt or
    other financial
    engineering? Or for growth into unicorn status? No GenAI dimension? No marketing or public-relations people?</p>

<p>In conversation with venture capitalists, you hear the phrase “lifestyle business”, meaning one that is doing nicely
    and rewarding the people who run it and which isn’t planning for unbounded growth.  The words “lifestyle business” are always, of
    course, uttered in a voice dripping with contempt. Luxcious is a lifestyle business.</p>

<p>It seems blindingly obvious that an economy with a higher proportion of lifestyle businesses is going to be more resilient,
    more humane, and immensely more pleasant than the one that the Leaders Of Industry are trying to build.</p>

<p>How would we get there from here?  I’m not smart enough to figure out what the regulatory regime is that would ban most of what
    private-equity does and tilt the playing field in favor of resilient lifestyle businesses.</p>

<p>But I’d sure vote for a political party that convinced me it was trying to achieve that.</p>
