    <h1>US border forces are seizing Americans&#39; phone data and storing it for 15 years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If a traveler&#39;s phone, tablet or computer ever gets searched at an airport, American border authorities could add data from their device to a massive database that can be accessed by thousands of government officials. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dhs-investigate-audit-cbp-phone-tracking-no-warrant-163107786.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">US Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP) leaders have admitted to lawmakers in a briefing that its officials are adding information to a database from as many as 10,000 devices every year, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/15/government-surveillance-database-dhs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> reports. </p>
<p>Further, 2,700 CBP officers can access the database without a warrant and without having to record the purpose of their search. These details were revealed in a letter <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-reveals-new-details-about-us-customs-and-border-protections-egregious-violations-of-americans-rights-during-warrantless-electronic-device-searches" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0">Senator Ron Wyden wrote</a> to CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus, where the lawmaker also said that CBP keeps any information it takes from people&#39;s devices for 15 years. </p>
<p>In the letter, Wyden urged the commissioner to update CBP&#39;s practices so that device searches at borders are focused on suspected criminals and security threats instead of allowing &#34;indiscriminate rifling through Americans&#39; private records without suspicion of a crime.&#34; Wyden said CBP takes sensitive information from people&#39;s devices, including text messages, call logs, contact lists and even photos and other private information in some cases. </p>
<p>While law enforcement agencies are typically required to secure a warrant if they want to access the contents of a phone or any other electronic device, border authorities are exempted from having to do the same. Wyden also pointed out that travelers searched at airports, seaports and border crossings aren&#39;t informed of their rights before their devices are searched. And if they refuse to unlock their electronics, authorities could confiscate and keep them for five days.</p>
<p>As<em> The Post </em>notes, a CBP official previously went on record to say that the agency&#39;s directive gives its officers the authority to scroll through any traveler&#39;s device in a &#34;basic search.&#34; If they find any &#34;reasonable suspicion&#34; that a traveler is breaking the law or doing something that poses a threat to national security, they can run a more advanced search. That&#39;s when they can plug in the traveler&#39;s phone, tablet or PC to a device that copies their information, which is then stored in the Automated Targeting System database.</p>
<p>CBP director of office of field operations Aaron Bowker told the publication that the agency only copies people&#39;s data when &#34;absolutely necessary.&#34; Bowker didn&#39;t deny that the agency&#39;s officers can access the database, though — he even said that the number was bigger than what CBP officials told Wyden. Five percent of CBP&#39;s 60,000 personnel have access to the database, he said, which translates to 3,000 officers and not 2,700.</p>
<p>Wyden wrote in his letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#34;Innocent Americans should not be tricked into unlocking their phones and laptops. CBP should not dump data obtained through thousands of warrantless phone searches into a central database, retain the data for fifteen years, and allow thousands of DHS employees to search through Americans’ personal data whenever they want.&#34;</p></blockquote>
<p>Two years ago, the Senator also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dems-call-for-cbp-location-data-investigation-200136069.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">called for an investigation</a> into the CBP&#39;s use of commercially available location data to track people&#39;s phones without a warrant. CBP had admitted back then that it spent $500,000 to access a commercial database containing &#34;location data mined from applications on millions of Americans’ mobile phones.&#34;</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
