    <h1>Chess: Magnus Carlsen disqualified in N.Y. after refusing to change out of jeans</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Magnus Carlsen, the world No 1, has been disqualified from the World Rapid Championship in New York due to a dress code violation, refusing to change from jeans, after a previous warning. He is also withdrawing from the World Blitz which starts on 30 December.</p><p>Fide explained their decision <a href="https://www.fide.com/news/3363" data-link-name="in body link">in a statement</a> while Carlsen said: “I said I’ll change tomorrow … but they said you have to change now it became a matter of principle for me so here we are! Honestly I’m too old at this point to care too much. If this is what they want to do I’ll probably set off to somewhere where the weather is a bit nicer.”</p><p>At the time of his default, Carlsen had scored 5/8 and was a point and a half behind the leaders, with little chance of retaining his title.</p><p>After eight of the 13 rounds, Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Poland), Arjun Erigaisi (India) and Alexander Grischuk (Russia) <a href="https://chess-results.com/tnr1074690.aspx?lan=1&amp;art=1&amp;rd=5&amp;flag=30include" data-link-name="in body link">led on 6.5/8</a>. Nine players on 6/8 include Russia’s 18-year-old Volodar Murzin, who <a href="https://lichess.org/broadcast/fide-world-rapid--blitz-championships-2024--rapid-open-1-30/round-2/RZi09iMn/Z6ggMI0K" data-link-name="in body link">beat the No 2 seed</a> and US champion, Fabiano Caruana, and the world No 3 and speed specialist, Hikaru Nakamura.</p><figure id="1ed41f27-dec9-4d7f-87c1-3cc7b1610443" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5e7c2390c1e593d0fe02176cf9493d339dac8f/0_0_1127_1126/master/1127.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5e7c2390c1e593d0fe02176cf9493d339dac8f/0_0_1127_1126/master/1127.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5e7c2390c1e593d0fe02176cf9493d339dac8f/0_0_1127_1126/master/1127.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5e7c2390c1e593d0fe02176cf9493d339dac8f/0_0_1127_1126/master/1127.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5e7c2390c1e593d0fe02176cf9493d339dac8f/0_0_1127_1126/master/1127.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5e7c2390c1e593d0fe02176cf9493d339dac8f/0_0_1127_1126/master/1127.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Chess 3952" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5e7c2390c1e593d0fe02176cf9493d339dac8f/0_0_1127_1126/master/1127.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="444.6051464063886" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span><strong>3952:</strong> Albert Sandrin v Pal Eros, Pula 1972. White to move and win.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The early rounds of the 11-round Women’s World Rapid were a triumph for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/23/teenager-alice-lee-sets-new-landmark-for-us-womens-chess-after-online-feats" data-link-name="in body link">rising US star Alice Lee</a>, 15, who won all her four games and was the sole leader. However Lee, who burst into prominence last year, lost to the top seed and reigning world women’s champion, China’s Ju Wenjun, in a crucial fifth-round pairing.</p><p>After six of the 11 rounds Ju had 5.5/6, half a point ahead of Alexandra Kosteniuk (Switzerland) and Kateryna Lagno (Russia), with Lee in the chasing group on 4.5/6.</p><p>The field of 182 for the World Rapid/Blitz <a href="https://chess-results.com/tnr1074690.aspx?lan=1" data-link-name="in body link">includes 30 Americans</a> while China has the top three seeds in the Women’s World Rapid/Blitz, which has 113 entries. The total prize fund is $1m for the open Rapid and Blitz, with $428,500 for the two women’s events.</p><p>This is the first time that the popular speed world championships have been staged on American soil, let alone at the centre of international finance. Rapid is defined as 15 minutes per player per game, plus an increment of 10 seconds a move from move one, while Blitz is three minutes per player per game, plus a two seconds per move increment.</p><p>Carlsen has already won five world rapids and seven world blitzes in his illustrious career, and captured both titles in 2022 and 2023. The <a href="https://x.com/chesscom/status/1870558410925818264" data-link-name="in body link">list of his lifetime victories</a> is impressively long, and underlines the task ahead for the new classical world champion, Gukesh Dommaraju, as the Indian 18-year-old, who is not competing in New York, aims to match the Norwegian’s achievements.</p><p>Carlsen’s chess curriculum vitae lists 64 major titles, all but nine of them over the board. Gukesh so far has just six – one world championship, one Candidates, three Olympiad golds, and one Fide Circuit, albeit with a 16-year age advantage.</p><p>Rapid is now Carlsen’s favourite format, and he scored again in last week’s Champions Tour, where most events were held online while the eight-player final pool was staged across the board in Oslo.</p><p>It ended up with a final between Carlsen and his old rival Ian Nepomniachtchi, who he defeated in their 2021 world title match, where their <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2127373" data-link-name="in body link">136-move sixth game</a> was the longest in world championship history. This time there was a much faster outcome, as Carlsen won 4-1 including a <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2813014" data-link-name="in body link">23-move crush</a> in the final game.</p><p>Carlsen is always alert to new developments, and his 7 a3 repeated Gukesh’s novelty against Ding Liren from game 13 of the Fide world title match in Singapore, a drawn encounter where the teenager overlooked a win.</p><p>Nepomniachtchi varied from Ding by early castling, but he missed the power of the rook lift 17 Rh3! This is an ancient and strong strategy against the French, which I recall the shock of experiencing as Black at London 1948 against Oliver Penrose. Here, White’s attack on the king quickly proved the irrelevance of the Russian queen excursion on the opposite flank, and Carlsen’s final 23 Qg6! created the unanswerable threat of Ng5 and Qh7 mate.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-15" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="44e53def-10b4-4130-ab7e-3674cc48bfb9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:16,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Chess: Gukesh and India celebrate after win but new challenges are emerging&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;44e53def-10b4-4130-ab7e-3674cc48bfb9&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/20/chess-gukesh-and-india-celebrate-after-win-but-new-challenges-are-emerging&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;design&#34;:0,&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:2}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-16 | 16" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>The World Rapid started on Thursday, and continues at 7pm GMT on Friday and Saturday. You can watch free, with grandmaster and computer commentary and assessments, on <a href="https://lichess.org/broadcast/fide-world-rapid--blitz-championships-2024--rapid-open/round-1/kTmtGlGP#boards" data-link-name="in body link">lichess.org</a> and other major chess sites.</p><p>In between the three-day, 13-round Rapid on 26-28 December and the two-day Blitz on 30-31 December, Fide has organised the Wall Street Gambit, a conference to explore the fusion between chess and finance.</p><p>Its highlight will be a keynote address by the renowned economist and GM Kenneth Rogoff, who will speak on chess, AI, and economics. Caruana and India’s former world champion Vishy Anand will be present. Standard <a href="https://tickets.fide.com/events/fide/1478195" data-link-name="in body link">tickets cost $1,000</a>, while VIP tickets at $5,000, which include a blitz game and selfies with Caruana, are already sold out.</p><p>No UK players have travelled to the World Rapid/Blitz due to the high cost and the low chances of a prize. For England’s experts, the annual £10,000 <a href="https://chess-results.com/tnr1088363.aspx?lan=1from" data-link-name="in body link">Caplin Hastings Masters</a> from 28 December to 5 January is the event of the moment. More than 100 entries range from at least seven 2500+ grandmasters to a long tail where over half the field are rated below 2000.</p><p>England’s youngest ever GM, 15-year-old Shreyas Royal, is the top home seed, while a likely candidate for an international title is 21-year-old FM Alex Golding, who already has two IM norms and a 2400+ rating and has just won the traditional Richmond pre-Christmas blitz at Orleans Park School from an entry of over 100.</p><p><strong>3952</strong><strong>:</strong> 1 Nh6+ Kf8 2 Nf5! (threat 3 Rh8 mate) g6 3 Qh6+ Kg8 4 Qh7+ Kf8 5 Qh8+! Bxh8 6 Rxh8 mate. Black can sacrifice his bishops and queen at g2 and f2, but this only delays mate.</p></div></div></div>
