    <h1>Ask HN: Video streaming is expensive yet YouTube &#34;seems&#34; to do it for free. How?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Can anyone help me understand the economics of video streaming platforms?</p><p>Streaming, encoding, and storage demands enormous costs -- especially at scale (e.g., on average each 4k video with close to 1 million views).
Yet YouTube seems to charge no money for it.</p><p>I know advertisements are a thing for YT, but is it enough?</p><p>If tomorrow I want to start a platform that is supported with Advert revenues, I know I will likely fail. However, maybe at YT scale (or more specifically Google Advert scale) the economics works?</p><p>ps: I would like this discussion to focus on the absolute necessary elements (e.g., storing, encoding, streaming) and not on other factors contributing to latency/cost like running view count algorithms.</p></div></td></div></div>
