                      <li>A software bug caused Amazon to overstate some corporate employees&#39; raises, a leaked email said.</li>
                      <li>Amazon&#39;s stock has fallen, and the software relied on older share prices to calculate compensation.</li>
                      <li>The glitch comes amid an upswell of discontent over pay at Amazon.</li>
                      </ul><p>Many of Amazon&#39;s corporate employees who just got promoted are finding that because of a software error, their raise packages actually won&#39;t be as high as they thought, according to an email seen by Insider that was sent to managers on Thursday.</p><p>The glitch caused Amazon to overstate bonuses for recently promoted employees because it miscalculated compensation by relying on older, higher stock prices for Amazon shares, the email said. It&#39;s not clear exactly how many employees were affected, but an internal trouble ticket seen by Insider said roughly 40% of employees promoted this quarter had &#34;been impacted by this issue.&#34;</p><p>The company resolved the glitch Tuesday. Still, when employees learned they would make less than they thought, it reinforced a sense among some that the company was nickel-and-diming them, according to screenshots of Slack messages seen by Insider.</p><p>Amazon employees have expressed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employee-frustrations-over-low-pay-reach-crisis-point-2022-1" data-analytics-module="body_link">increasing dissatisfaction with compensation</a> over the past year amid a perception that they&#39;re paid less than peers in the tech sector. In response, Amazon <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-increases-base-salary-cap-350000-memo-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link">nearly doubled its base pay cap</a> and promised raises earlier this year, but that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employee-compensation-pay-new-salary-update-range-2022-4" data-analytics-module="body_link">wasn&#39;t enough to quell all the unrest</a>.</p><p>One Amazon employee wrote in an internal Slack channel Thursday morning in response to learning about the glitch that as &#34;stock continues to tank every day,&#34; Amazon was &#34;taking away something that somewhat made us whole.&#34;</p><p>Amazon&#39;s share price has fallen 28.2% in the past six months. Because of the error, &#34;it is likely that the promotional cash value your employee will now receive is lower than you originally discussed with them,&#34; the email to managers said. &#34;We recognize that this is an uncomfortable conversation to have.&#34;Â </p><p>In a statement, an Amazon representative, Brad Glasser, said the company &#34;identified and immediately corrected an issue with some newly promoted employees&#39; compensation communications.&#34;</p><p>&#34;We are working with employees to ensure they understand their updated compensation,&#34; Glasser added.</p><p><em><strong>Do you work at Amazon?
