    <div><div><div><p><big>During the Cold War, the Military Topographic Directorate (VTU) of the General Staff of the Soviet Army conducted a secret topographic mapping program at a high level of detail and coverage for almost the entire globe. The true extent of the Soviet cartographic enterprise is yet to emerge, but it is clear that this was the most comprehensive global topographic mapping project ever undertaken.  The number of different maps produced is impossible to quantify, but it is certainly  well in excess of two million. </big></p>
