Since then, I’ve been gradually working on a CAD model for a new set of what started as (yet another) subwoofer, but became some compact 2-way office ribbon speakers.</p><p>The idea was to create a fully parametric design that could be easily adapted to any drivers, enclosure volume etc – yet still retain the original aesthetic.</p><p>OpenSCAD is my <a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/10-ways-to-get-the-best-out-of-openscad/">CAD package of choice</a> – it’s a code-CAD system so I’m right at home. There are, however limitations which make certain things excessively hard or long-winded; even impossible!</p><p>With this project, I wanted to push the boundaries of what is possible with OpenSCAD and what I could make in my garage. I wanted these speakers to look like they could have been bought from a high-end audio store.</p><h2 id="design">Design</h2><p>I didn’t want a simple box like most speakers. Moving toward more higher-end speakers, more exotic shapes are used – often with compound curves and automotive grade finishes.</p><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/finished.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" srcset="/blog/speakers/finished_hu5e092c751bca44bb5098268d5675a6c2_95243_854x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, /blog/speakers/finished_hu5e092c751bca44bb5098268d5675a6c2_95243_1708x960_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="The original design" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/finished_hu5e092c751bca44bb5098268d5675a6c2_95243_854x480_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" loading="lazy" height="480" onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" width="300"/></picture></a><figcaption>The original design</figcaption></figure><p>For a while the design was for a custom modelled bass-reflex subwoofer, but I decided to make some 2-way speakers after taking a look at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/speedster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Carmody’s Speedster</a> design; I was more excited about the idea of building a pair of full-range speakers considering I had already build a <a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/large-horn-subwoofer-build/">sizeable subwoofer</a>. So, I decided to build some Speedsters instead.</p><h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3><p>For about 6 years I had some Mission SX2 speakers. They were finished in piano black and were curvy – I wondered how the complicated-looking shape was made.</p><p>As it turns out, each curve was just a circular arc – the complexity came from the intersection of these arcs at the edges – elegant!</p><p>I also had some old Sony speakers with a flat conical profile at the front. I figured this would work well with the speedster design, considering the tweeter is inset somewhat.</p><p>I decided I’d like to lean into the compound curve idea a bit more – elongate the design, move the center of the main curve forward, and pitch the top up towards the back for a kind of forced perspective.</p><h3 id="cad-approach">CAD approach</h3><p>I mocked up the shape by intersecting 5 cylinders – one for each panel except the bottom. Moving around, I deviated from the SX2 design by moving the center of the side curves to the front, and angling the top for a slight incline.</p><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/body.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" srcset="/blog/speakers/body_hudfc1b03ce1920c4e9994a69f3646a212_53107_854x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, /blog/speakers/body_hudfc1b03ce1920c4e9994a69f3646a212_53107_1708x960_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="The (final) base shape" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/body_hudfc1b03ce1920c4e9994a69f3646a212_53107_854x480_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" loading="lazy" height="480" onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" width="316"/></picture></a><figcaption>The (final) base shape</figcaption></figure><p>After some time I realised I could optimise the design quite a bit by intersecting 4 circles instead, and then extruding to intersect with a single cylinder. This, and setting the number of faces (<code>$fn</code>) throughout the design reduced the eventual build time to 3 minutes instead of around an hour.</p><p>The extrusion approach also allowed me to use <code>offset()</code> to round the sharp edges of some of the panels. As it’s OpenSCAD, I couldn’t round the other edges – these would have to be rounded later by sanding as a post-process.</p><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/circle.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" srcset="/blog/speakers/circle_hu22c48c8bd5f896e2b6c7fd590b2b319b_14661_854x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, /blog/speakers/circle_hu22c48c8bd5f896e2b6c7fd590b2b319b_14661_1708x960_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Demonstration of left panel curve derivation" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/circle_hu22c48c8bd5f896e2b6c7fd590b2b319b_14661_854x480_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" loading="lazy" height="480" onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" width="573"/></picture></a><figcaption>Demonstration of left panel curve derivation</figcaption></figure><p>In the above image, you can see the derivation of the curve of the left panel – using an offset, large circle.</p><p>Given I intended to subtractively mill the design from 18mm MDF or birch ply, I had to convert the shape into a series of panels with no overhangs. The approach I used was simple – to intersect an “infinite” panel with the edges of the basic shape, and subtract the adjacent panels from each.</p><p>This approach is illustrated above. From the combination intersection, you can see how 2 possible side and rear panel sizes could be derived – the rear could be wider and extend to the sides, or the side panels could be longer and extend to the rear.</p><p>The side panel intersections were the most tricky as they had to be at an angle and offset determined by the centre of the circle defining the curve as well as the depth. This was necessary to ensure the panel was of even thickness on both sides.</p><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/internal_volume.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" srcset="/blog/speakers/internal_volume_hu747f95b64fdcda76b706634da256927b_35264_240x240_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, /blog/speakers/internal_volume_hu747f95b64fdcda76b706634da256927b_35264_480x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Internal volume shape" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/internal_volume_hu747f95b64fdcda76b706634da256927b_35264_240x240_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" loading="lazy" height="240" onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" width="154"/></picture></a><figcaption>Internal volume shape</figcaption></figure><p>Given the design was not a simple box, I needed a way of arriving at the same internal volume as the box design. I used a similar method to calculate the shape of the internal volume, and then used <a href="https://admesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admesh</a> to measure the volume of the shape. It was then a simple matter of iterating on the depth until the volume matched the box design. Note that I kept the front panel the same size – this is important for the acoustic design as the baffle step affects the frequency response.</p><p>I wonder if my design (vs a box) is acoustically superior in one way: thanks to the curved design, there are no parallel surfaces – this could reduce standing waves and resonances.</p><p>Beyond this, a disclaimer – I know I’m modifying the original design which is something Mr. Carmody warns against. I think I’m being sensible though!</p><h3 id="driver-holes">Driver holes</h3><p>I made a generalised negative cut-out to support any circular driver. The design accepts the panel thickness, driver inset, bezel thickness etc. It also supports either a conical or rounded flare for when the driver is inset.</p><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-24-11.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" srcset="/blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-24-11_hu6452f507e4e8a762d18427c6f12f6fe4_5384_854x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, /blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-24-11_hu6452f507e4e8a762d18427c6f12f6fe4_5384_1708x960_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Negative generalised driver hole" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-24-11_hu6452f507e4e8a762d18427c6f12f6fe4_5384_854x480_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" loading="lazy" height="140" onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" width="670"/></picture></a><figcaption>Negative generalised driver hole</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-25-43.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" srcset="/blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-25-43_hu0d28f46f85c6d1bdf76bab60de6fdfbf_36255_854x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, /blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-25-43_hu0d28f46f85c6d1bdf76bab60de6fdfbf_36255_1708x960_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Effect of chamfer on the reverse of the front" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/Screenshot%20from%202025-01-01%2018-25-43_hu0d28f46f85c6d1bdf76bab60de6fdfbf_36255_854x480_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" loading="lazy" height="316" onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" width="854"/></picture></a><figcaption>Effect of chamfer on the reverse of the front</figcaption></figure><p>On the reverse of the front panel, a chamfer is added to reduce turbulence behind the driver. See <a href="http://www.troelsgravesen.dk/chamfer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> for more information – it’s important!</p><h3 id="screw-holes">Screw holes</h3><p>I thought a long time about how I would construct the design. Most importantly, how would I align and clamp the panels for gluing?</p><p>I considered using dowels, brad nails, clamps and jigs. I remembered my <a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/large-horn-subwoofer-build/">horn-loaded subwoofer)</a> and how I used screws to align and clamp the panels as recommended in the design; it worked excellently! <em>If</em> I could manufacture pre-determined holes with a calibrated profile, I could use regular cabinet screws to allow fast assembly with no clamps at all.</p><p>One downside is that I would have fill the resulting holes; a good compromise in my opinion. Another is that depending on how I manufacture the panels, it may be difficult to get accurate holes.</p><p>Most of the design was implicit, meaning I didn’t actually know the specific co-ordinates of a lot of the features such as most of the geometry of the rear panel. This was fine, except for placing screw holes.</p><p>For a long time the design had some “guesses” with hard-coded offsets to determine he position of the screw holes. This is because there’s no way of addressing a corner, edge or surface in openscad – it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSG</a> only and not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BREP</a> system.</p><p>This meant that for a truly parametric and fully qualified design, I’d have to derive the locations manually. I won’t go into detail but it was basic trigonometry, just a lot of it.</p><p>I used some simple techniques to align the screw holes – placing debugging cylinders at the calculated positions to check they were correct, using the orthogonal view aligned to a plane to validate the positions.</p><h3 id="crossover">Crossover</h3><p>The crossover in the speedster design is a fairly complex (and therefore bulky and inefficient) third-order design. This would make it a pain to manually construct in a reproducible manner, so I wanted to create a PCB for this purpose.</p><p>Luckily, <a href="https://www.nullmethod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Ose</a> had kindly <a href="https://github.com/gregose/speedster-crossover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed one on github</a>. It was fairly large as it was designed to accommodate variety of possible inductor/capacitor/resistor sizes – not a problem on a rectangular speedster design but a little challenging to fit inside my design.</p><p>In the end I designed an access panel at the bottom of the speaker to allow easy installation of the crossover. This was a lot of effort (I even made an algorithm to calculate the screw positions evenly) but worth it – what if I had sealed in the crossover and it developed a fault?</p><p>The design held the crossover together with 20mm standoffs, attached to the access panel in a vertical orientation.</p><h3 id="gaskets">Gaskets</h3><p>To properly seal the speaker drivers, rear connectors and access panel, I had to find some kind of gasket material. It’s possible to buy foam tape, but that seemed quite messy.</p><p>I thought the best way would be to manufacture the gaskets to be the perfect shape, complete with bolt holes. I first experimented with a 3D printed design using TPU filament, but the resulting gaskets felt too hard and I didn’t think it would seal well.</p><p>In the end I found some 1mm self-adhesive EVA foam. If I could get some time with a laser cutter I could make them easily and get a great seal!</p><h3 id="nesting--post-processing">Nesting &amp; post processing</h3><p>I like the idea of a fully automated build chain; in addition to being full parametric, my design produces renders of all the parts, optimised STLs and even places the parts on individual beds/plates.</p><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/bed-1.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" srcset="/blog/speakers/bed-1_hu7dfdb3053b55e675eb326046195a4b14_85630_854x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, /blog/speakers/bed-1_hu7dfdb3053b55e675eb326046195a4b14_85630_1708x960_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Parts on a fairly large bed" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/speakers/bed-1_hu7dfdb3053b55e675eb326046195a4b14_85630_854x480_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" loading="lazy" height="480" onload="this.style.background=&#34;none&#34;" width="815"/></picture></a><figcaption>Parts on a fairly large bed</figcaption></figure><p>This was more necessary when I was targeting CAMBAM or PyCAM, which are quite basic so don’t include the ability to automatically place parts.

It did!</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><h3 id="fit--finish">Fit &amp; finish</h3><p>I was surprised at how neat the speakers looked. They didn’t look “DIY” which was one of my aims.</p><p>If I were to make them again, I’d make sure the screw holes were properly filled, and use more filler elsewhere as it’s possible to see the 3D printed texture and screw holes in some places with the right light.</p><p>I’d also make sure the bass port has enough paint – it’s a bit thin in places, but I don’t mind for now as it’s not visible during use where I’ve got it set up.</p><p>Bed liner paint was a good choice – I like the even finish. Perhaps I could experiment with sanding the finish and possibly waxing it or something on a test piece.</p><h3 id="construction--design-method">Construction &amp; design method</h3><p>I’m pleased to say the design method of creating a shape and intersecting panels, combined with clamping screws worked extremely well. There were no issues (in the end) with panel warping or accumulating errors.</p><p>I was a little worried about accumulating errors, but thanks to the accuracy of the screw clamping method, decent 3D printer and viscous glue, there were no issues.</p><p>Given it’s parametric I dare say I’ll make some other speakers in the future with the same design. Possibly the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/virage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virage</a> now that I have the Paul Carmody bug.</p><h3 id="how-do-they-sound">How do they sound?</h3><p><strong>TL;DR: Great! Best speakers I’ve heard, possibly ever.</strong></p><p>First I hooked them up to my office amplifier, a 25 year old Sony. Unfortunately even at max volume they were not loud enough. The amp was clearly struggling – playing a sine wave would result in audible clipping.</p><p>Why was it struggling? It has no problem driving the 6 ohm speakers it came with. The answer lies in the crossover – it’s a third order design and therefore inefficient compared to a simple first-order crossover. These speakers need power!</p><p>Despite this, vocals sounded amazing and there was a surprising amount of bass – as is characteristic of the speedster design.</p><p>The speakers were rather boomy in my office. I suspect this is due to the DBFB feature of the amp – bass enhancement tuned to the sony speakers it came with. Given this and the power problem, I reserved judgement until I got a proper amplifier.</p><p>So what amplifier would make sense? Requirements:</p><ul><li>Small form factor, it’s on my desk</li><li>Enough power to drive the speakers</li><li>Good sound quality – no distortion</li><li>Reasonable price</li></ul><p>I consulted <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio Science Review</a> to find a suitable amplifier.
