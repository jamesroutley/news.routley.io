Chess is a chess variant where playing the top engine move is
forbidden.</h2>
<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>
<p>Select a chess engine and an evaluation method. Most chess apps
include a chess engine. For casual games, the suggested evaluation
method is letting that engine run for 1 minute on your device.</p>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<p>Human Chess has the same rules as normal chess, with one additional
mechanic. Starting from move 2, players can claim their opponent’s last
move was a top engine move. This immediately ends the game.</p>
<p>Claims are settled by asking the chess engine to evaluate the
position before the contested move. If the chess engine suggests the
opponent’s move, the claimant wins the game. If not, their opponent wins
instead.</p>
<p>Checkmating loses the game, as it is always the top engine move.
Rather than aiming for checkmate, players seek to force their opponent
to make a top engine move. If a player only has one move available, that
move will always be the top engine move, which loses the game.</p>
<p>Stalemate, however unlikely, remains a draw.</p>

<h3 id="the-fine-print">The fine print</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both black and white’s first moves are exempt from claims</li>
<li>When multiple moves have the top score, they are all top moves, even
if visual markers (like move arrows) suggest the engine prefers one over
the other.</li>
</ul>
