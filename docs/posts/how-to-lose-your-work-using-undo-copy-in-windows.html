    <h1>How to lose your work using Undo Copy in Windows</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
<p>This is a simple guide on how to lose your work using the brilliant design of the Windows interface. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy-paste a file from one folder to another. Simple.</li>
<li>Start working on the copy. Make sure to spend several hours editing the file, so your loss has some actual value.</li>
<li>Right click anywhere in Windows Explorer and press Undo Copy. You can&#39;t miss it, it&#39;s right above the &#34;New&#34; option:</li>
</ol>

<p>Done. Your work is gone. Instead of panicking and trying to find ways to recover it, you should take a deep breath and make peace with the fact that you&#39;ve lost several hours (or more!) for nothing.</p>
<h3 id="lets-see-an-example">Let&#39;s see an example</h3>
<p>Your boss asks you to make a PowerPoint presentation. Eager to impress, you get started right away. You don&#39;t want to start from scratch so you copy a template that your company has provided, to be used for all presentations. </p>
<p>You paste the template on the Desktop and start working right away. You spend a good amount of time creating a flawless presentation. Now, since you&#39;re an organized person, you want to move the finished product to another folder, to keep your Desktop clean. </p>
<p>You right click in Explorer with the intention of doing New â†’ Folder. Instead, you misclick and press Undo Copy, just a few pixels away. You notice in horror that your PowerPoint file is gone. You try looking in the Recycle Bin but there&#39;s nothing there.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-way-to-recover-it-what-about-redo-copy">Is there a way to recover it? What about Redo Copy?</h3>
<p>Redo Copy does exactly what it&#39;s supposed to do. It copies the <strong>original</strong> file to the destination. It doesn&#39;t restore the edits that you made on the copy.</p>
<p>What about data recovery software? Can any of those recover your file?</p>
<p>I tried a few basic file recovery programs but none of them could do the job. Let me know if you find any software that can get you out of this mess.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-way-to-prevent-this">Is there a way to prevent this?</h3>
<p>Yes. Just disable this silly feature using the Windows Registry.</p>
<p>Create a DWORD entry named <code>MaxUndoItems</code> with a value of 0 under: </p>
<pre><code>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you can run this equivalent command:</p>
<pre><code>reg add &#34;HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced&#34; /v MaxUndoItems /d 0 /t REG_DWORD /f
</code></pre>
<p>Log off or restart and the context menu option will be gone. The associated shortcut (Ctrl-Z) will be disabled too (note that this only applies to Explorer, Ctrl-Z will still work in other programs).</p>
