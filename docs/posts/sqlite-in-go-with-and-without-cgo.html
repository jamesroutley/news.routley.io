<p>Most people use the
<a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3">mattn/go-sqlite3</a> package to interact with SQLite in Go. This
package uses cgo and bundles the <a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/commit/2df077b74c66723d9b44d01c8db88e74191bdd0e">SQLite C amalgamation
files</a>
with the Go source.</p>
<p>But Go developers often prefer not to use cgo (see for example <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/tag/cgo">cgo is
not go</a>). I mention this because
there happens to be an underrated <a href="https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite">translation of SQLite&#39;s C source
code to Go</a>. Since it is a
translation of C to Go, you don&#39;t need to use cgo to call into
it. Some developers find this idea compelling. And this Go translation
is an impressive work in and of itself.</p>
<p>But for real-world usage there are at least two major concerns I had:
compatibility and performance. According to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite#section-readme">their
documentation</a>
they pass most or all SQLite3 tests, so it seems pretty compatible. But I
didn&#39;t see anything on their site or documentation (which, to their detriment,
is pretty scant) that talked about performance. So I took a look.</p>
<p>This post summarizes some basic ingestion and query benchmarks using
<a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3">mattn/go-sqlite3</a> and
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite">modernc.org/sqlite</a>. tldr; the
Go translation is consistently at least twice as slow for both small
datasets and large, for <code>INSERT</code>s and <code>SELECT</code>s.</p>

<p>There are two main benchmarks, one ingest benchmark and one query
benchmark. They are both run 10 times and both run against a growing
number of rows.</p>
<h2>Ingest</h2>
<p>This benchmark inserts 10_000, 479_827, and 4_798_270 rows 10 times
each. There are ten columns and the contents are a mix of randomly
generated strings and integers.</p>
<h2>Query</h2>
<p>This benchmark runs a single <code>GROUP BY</code> query: <code>SELECT COUNT(1), age FROM people GROUP BY age ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC</code>. It runs 10 times
against each of the sizes of rows ingested.</p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/sqlite-cgo-no-cgo/blob/main/cgo/main.go">mattn/go-sqlite3
version</a>. And here is the <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/sqlite-cgo-no-cgo/blob/main/nocgo/main.go">SQLite Go translated
version</a>.</p>
<h2>Machine Specs</h2>
<p>I am running these benchmarks on a dedicated bare metal instance, <a href="https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/rise/rise-1/">OVH
Rise-1</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>RAM: 64 GB DDR4 ECC 2,133 MHz</li>
<li>Disk: 2x450 GB SSD NVMe in Soft RAID</li>
<li>Processor: Intel Xeon E3-1230v6 - 4c/8t - 3.5 GHz/3.9 GHz</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are the averages across all 10 runs for each query category,
number of rows acting on, and the library (cgo or no cgo) used.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite">modernc.org/sqlite</a> is a very
impressive project. But it is at least twice as slow in every
variation even with smaller datasets. And <code>SELECT</code> performance gets
way worse as the dataset size increases. The Go translation also has a
greater standard deviation which might be attributable to the garbage
collector. My guess is that mattn/go-sqlite3 is so constant in
<code>SELECT</code> performance even as the dataset increases because even 4
million rows is peanuts for SQLite. Or maybe my benchmark code is wrong!</p>
<p>Based on these results, if your workload has solely small datasets
(i.e. small business apps) the tradeoff allowing you to avoid cgo
could be worth it. Otherwise if you care strongly about performance
you&#39;ll be better off with the real SQLite and
<a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3">mattn/go-sqlite3</a>.</p>
