    <h1>‘Blue lights’ flash in sky moments before Morocco earthquake</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>MYSTERY blue lights were seen flashing in the sky just moments before the horror earthquake that killed 2,900 people in Morocco.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/">short clip on X</a> shows a single blue flash on the top left corner of the shot, followed by a second burst of light seconds later.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon has been observed before the earthquake in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/">Turkey</a> earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/turkey-earthquake/">claimed the lives of 45,000 people.</a></p>
<p>The first recorded instance of earthquake lights on camera dates back to 1965 during a Japanese earthquake, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/article-758370">The Jerusalem Post</a> reports.</p>
<p>The mysterious lights have also been observed in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China</a> in 2008, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/italy/">Italy </a>in 2009, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/mexico/">Mexico</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>The cause of earthquake lights, or EQLs, remains shrouded in mystery, leaving unanswered questions about whether it serves as some sort of ominous sign of impending disasters.</p>
<p>Scientists suggest that this may be the release of energy as a result of the movement of lithospheric plates, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment/2019/04/earthquake-lights-explained">National Geographic</a> reports.</p>
<p>Analysing 65 earthquake light incidents for patterns in a 2014 study, adjunct physics professor and and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nasa/">NASA</a> researcher Friedemann Freund described the phenomenon &#34;as if you switched on a battery in the Earth&#39;s crust&#34;.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Morocco woke up to devastating damage following a major 7.2-magnitude earthquake - making it one of the deadliest disasters the country has seen for over 120 years.</p>

<p>More than 2,900 people are dead and 2,059 are injured after the monster tremor struck just after 11pm local time on Friday.</p>
<p>People were sent fleeing in terror from buildings, and those who could not escape were killed as houses collapsed in the quake in Morocco.</p>
<p>The shaking lasted several seconds and a 4.9-magnitude aftershock was recorded 19 minutes later.</p>
<p>The city of Marrakesh was shaken - but the villages in the country&#39;s remote High Atlas mountains bore the brute of the devastation.</p>
<p>Morroco is also popular with tourists, with the country welcoming some 700,000 Brits every year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23892372/morocco-earthquake-relief-efforts-brits/">Dozens of Brits broke off from holidays and business trips to queue for hours to give blood</a>, with others planning supply runs into areas worst hit by the shocks.</p>
<p>Others were setting up field kitchens for quake victims left homeless and hungry by the 6.8 magnitude <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23886828/morocco-earthquake-brit-tourists-deaths/">Moroccan quake</a>, which wiped villages off the map south of Marrakesh.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/foreign-commonwealth-and-development-office/">Britain’s ­Foreign Office</a> said it was sending 60 search and rescue specialists, four search dogs and equipment to the scene.</p>
