    <h1>OpenAI wants to buy Chrome and make it an &#34;AI-first&#34; experience</h1>

<p>According to Turley, OpenAI would throw its proverbial hat in the ring if Google had to sell. When asked if OpenAI would want Chrome, he was unequivocal. &#34;Yes, we would, as would many other parties,&#34; <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-buy-chrome-executive-testifies">Turley said</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI has reportedly considered building its own Chromium-based browser to compete with Chrome. Several months ago, the company hired former Google developers Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher, both of whom worked to bring Chrome to market.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to see why OpenAI might want a browser, particularly Chrome with its 4 billion users and 67 percent market share. Chrome would instantly give OpenAI a massive install base of users who have been incentivized to use Google services. If OpenAI were running the show, you can bet ChatGPT would be integrated throughout the experienceâ€”Turley said as much, predicting an &#34;AI-first&#34; experience. The user data flowing to the owner of Chrome could also be invaluable in training <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">agentic AI models</a> that can operate browsers on the user&#39;s behalf.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there&#39;s so much discussion about who should buy Chrome, but relatively little about spinning off Chrome into an independent company. Google has contended that Chrome can&#39;t survive on its own. However, the existence of Google&#39;s multibillion-dollar search placement deals, which the DOJ wants to end, suggests otherwise. Regardless, if Google has to sell, and OpenAI has the cash, we might get the proposed &#34;AI-first&#34; browsing experience.</p>
