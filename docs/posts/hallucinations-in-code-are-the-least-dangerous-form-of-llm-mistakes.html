    <h1>Hallucinations in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes</h1>

<p>2nd March 2025</p>



<p>A surprisingly common complaint I see from developers who have tried using LLMs for code is that they encountered a hallucination—usually the LLM inventing a method or even a full software library that doesn’t exist—and it crashed their confidence in LLMs as a tool for writing code. How could anyone productively use these things if they invent methods that don’t exist?</p>
<p>Hallucinations in code <strong>are the least harmful hallucinations you can encounter from a model</strong>.</p>
<p>The real risk from using LLMs for code is that they’ll make mistakes that <em>aren’t</em> instantly caught by the language compiler or interpreter. And these happen <em>all the time</em>!</p>

<p>The moment you run LLM generated code, any hallucinated methods will be instantly obvious: you’ll get an error. You can fix that yourself or you can feed the error back into the LLM and watch it correct itself.</p>
<p>Compare this to hallucinations in regular prose, where you need a critical eye, strong intuitions and well developed fact checking skills to avoid sharing information that’s incorrect and directly harmful to your reputation.</p>
<p>With code you get a powerful form of fact checking for free. Run the code, see if it works.</p>
<p>In some setups—<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">ChatGPT Code Interpreter</a>, <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, any of the growing number of “agentic” code systems that write and then execute code in a loop—the LLM system itself will spot the error and automatically correct itself.</p>
<p>If you’re using an LLM to write code without even running it yourself, <em>what are you doing?</em></p>
<p>Hallucinated methods are such a tiny roadblock that when people complain about them I assume they’ve spent minimal time learning how to effectively use these systems—they dropped them at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>My cynical side suspects they may have been looking for a reason to dismiss the technology and jumped at the first one they found.</p>
<p>My less cynical side assumes that nobody ever warned them that you have to put a lot of work in to learn how to get good results out of these systems. I’ve been exploring <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">their applications for writing code</a> for over two years now and I’m still learning new tricks (and new strengths and weaknesses) almost every day.</p>

<h4 id="qa">Manually testing code is essential</h4>

<p>Just because code looks good and runs without errors doesn’t mean it’s actually doing the right thing. No amount of meticulous code review—or even comprehensive automated tests—will demonstrably prove that code actually does the right thing. You have to run it yourself!</p>
<p>Proving to yourself that the code works is your job. This is one of the many reasons I don’t think LLMs are going to put software professionals out of work.</p>
<p>LLM code will usually look fantastic: good variable names, convincing comments, clear type annotations and a logical structure. This can lull you into a false sense of security, in the same way that a gramatically correct and confident answer from ChatGPT might tempt you to skip fact checking or applying a skeptical eye.</p>
<p>The way to avoid <em>those</em> problems is the same as how you avoid problems in code by other humans that you are reviewing, or code that you’ve written yourself: you need to actively exercise that code. You need to have great manual QA skills.</p>
<p>A general rule for programming is that you should <em>never</em> trust any piece of code until you’ve seen it work with your own eye—or, even better, seen it fail and then fixed it.</p>
<p>Across my entire career, almost every time I’ve assumed some code works without actively executing it—some branch condition that rarely gets hit, or an error message that I don’t expect to occur—I’ve later come to regret that assumption.</p>

<h4 id="tips">Tips for reducing hallucinations</h4>
<p>If you really are seeing a deluge of hallucinated details in the code LLMs are producing for you, there are a bunch of things you can do about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try different models. It might be that another model has better training data for your chosen platform. As a Python and JavaScript programmer my favorite models right now are Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking turned on, OpenAI’s o3-mini-high and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (for Python).</li>
<li>Learn how to use the context. If an LLM doesn’t know a particular library you can often fix this by dumping in a few dozen lines of example code. LLMs are incredibly good at imitating things, and at rapidly picking up patterns from very limited examples. Modern model’s have increasingly large context windows—I’ve recently started using Claude’s new <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration">GitHub integration</a> to dump entire repositories into the context and it’s been working extremely well for me.</li>
<li>Chose <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>. I genuinely find myself picking libraries that have been around for a while partly because that way it’s much more likely that LLMs will be able to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll finish this rant with a related observation: I keep seeing people say “if I have to review every line of code an LLM writes, it would have been faster to write it myself!”</p>
<p>Those people are loudly declaring that they have under-invested in the crucial skills of reading, understanding and reviewing code written by other people. I suggest getting some more practice in. Reviewing code written for you by LLMs is a great way to do that.</p>

<p><em>Bonus section</em>: I asked Claude 3.7 Sonnet &#34;extended thinking mode&#34; to review an earlier draft of this post—&#34;<code>Review my rant of a blog entry. I want to know if the argument is convincing, small changes I can make to improve it, if there are things I&#39;ve missed.</code>&#34;. It was quite helpful, especially in providing tips to make that first draft a little less confrontational! Since you can share Claude chats now <a href="https://claude.ai/share/685cd6d9-f18a-47ef-ae42-e9815df821f1">here’s that transcript</a>.</p>
