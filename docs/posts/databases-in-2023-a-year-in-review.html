Although some of these systems have been around for a couple of years, the widespread interest in LLMs and services built on top of them (e.g., ChatGPT) brought them to the forefront this last year. Vector databases promise to provide deeper searches on data (especially unstructured data) based on the data&#39;s semantics rather than just its contents. That is, instead of searching for documents that contain exact keywords (e.g., &#34;Wu-Tang Clan&#34;), an application can search for documents that are related to topics (e.g., &#34;hip-hop groups with songs about slinging&#34;).</p><p>The &#34;magic&#34; that facilitates these types of searches is <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transformers</a> that convert data into a fixed-length, one-dimensional vector of floating point numbers called an <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embedding</a>. The values in these embeddings are indecipherable to humans. Instead, their contents encode some relationship between the parameters and the transformer&#39;s training corpus. The size of these embedding vectors ranges from 100s of dimensions for simple transformers to 1000s for high-end models.<!-- --></p><p>Suppose one generates embeddings for all the records in a database using a transformer. In that case, one can search for similar records for a given input by finding the record embeddings closest to the search embedding in high-dimensional space. But brute-force comparing all vectors to find the closest matches is horribly expensive.</p><p>The complexity of this search is O(N * d * k) where N is the number of embeddings, d is the size of each vector, and k is the number of matches you want -- if you don&#39;t know what this means, trust me, it is terrible. Thanks to <!-- --><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankrgyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ankur Goyal</a> (CMU&#39;17) for the correction.<!-- --></p><p>This is where vector DBMSs come into the picture. At its core, a vector DBMS is just a document database with a specialized index data structure to accelerate similarity search on embeddings. Instead of performing an exact match for the most similar vectors per query, these systems can use approximate searches to generate results that make the trade-off of being &#34;good enough&#34; in exchange for returning the result more quickly.

NoSQL systems that natively store JSON became popular in the late 2000s (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB), but it took several years after that until the relational DBMS incumbents added support for JSON (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MySQL added JSON data types in <!-- --><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/state-of-json-in-postgres-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/json-support-in-oracle-database-12cr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a>, and <!-- --><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015</a>, respectively).

This delay is somewhat surprising given that many relational DBMSs already supported the conceptually similar XML data type. <!-- --></p><p>There are two likely explanations for the quick proliferation of vector search indexes. The first is that similarity search via embeddings is such a compelling use case that every DBMS vendor rushed out their version and announced it immediately. The second is that the engineering effort to introduce what amounts to just a new access method and index data structure is small enough that it did not take that much work for the DBMS vendors to add vector search. Most vendors did not write their vector index from scratch and instead just integrated one of the several high-quality open-source libraries available (e.g., <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DiskANN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft DiskANN</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Faiss</a>). <!-- --></p><p>But if the engineering effort to add reasonable vector search capability to a DBMS is low, the danger is that the vector DBMS vendors do not have a large enough moat to keep existing DBMSs from encroaching on their turf.</p><p>I recently told the co-founders of both the Pinecone and Weaviate that there are two paths their systems could take (see my <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QBZv5DrCUM&amp;t=3230s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast interview</a> with Weaviate’s CTO). The first way is that their customers will start using vector DBMSs as their &#34;database of record,&#34; and then vendors will add better support for operational workloads. They will end up looking more like popular document DBMSs (e.g., MongoDB), and then in five years, they will add support for SQL like the NoSQL systems that preceded them. The alternative path is that vector DBMSs will remain secondary databases updated via changes from upstream operational DBMSs. This is how people use search engine DBMSs like <!-- --><a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elastic</a> and <!-- --><a href="https://vespa.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vespa</a>. In that case, the vector DBMSs can survive without expanding their query languages or having a more structured data model.<!-- --></p><p><strong>Side Comment:</strong> I recently recorded a <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDhVEjgCHGk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A session</a> on vector vs. relational databases.
