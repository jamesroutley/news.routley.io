<p><strong>AirGradient Open Air</strong></p>

<p>Open Air is an outdoor air quality monitor enabling you to know if the air quality is healthy or not. It measures PM1, PM2.5, PM10, Temperature and Humidity. It’s fully open-source and customizable, so you can extend it in whatever way you like.</p>

<h2>Why Air Quality is So Important</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/" alt=""/></p><div>
<div>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, more than 90% of the people breathe unhealthy air. Air pollution is the biggest driver of premature death of all environmental health risks. With climate change and the warming of the planet, air pollution, e.g. through wildfires are also increasingly becoming a major issue in regions with previously very clean air.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/why.png" alt=""/></p><div>
<div>
<p>The monitor measures PM1, PM2.5, PM10, Temperature and Humidity. In future we will offer options with TVOC and CO2 sensors. The standard version uses two independent particle sensors with integrated temperature and humidity sensors. </p>

<h2>Flexible Data Platforms</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/dash.jpg" alt=""/></p><div>
<div>
<p>The AirGradient Open Air monitor is unique as it gives you full flexibility on how you want to monitor and use the data. Being open-source you are not locked in to any specific data platform but can connect the data to any server, i.e. Home Assistant or use the AirGradient data platform - a data platform specifically made for air quality monitoring. </p>

<h2>AirGradient Map with OpenAQ Data</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/map.jpg" alt=""/></p><div>
<div>
<p>If you use the AirGradient data platform, you can opt-in to share your outdoor data with the public and openAQ. OpenAQ is a non-profit organisation collecting and organizing worldwide air quality data and making it available for the public and research. Your data is then also available on the AirGradient map together with thousands of other monitors from openAQ.</p>

<h2>Easy to Assemble, Setup &amp; Install</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/" alt=""/></p><div>
<div>
<p>The kit is very easy to assemble, and you can also get the monitor as fully assembled version. We provide detailed instructions and videos on how to connect the monitor to your WiFi network and set it up on the dashboard and map. If you run into any problem, just <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/support">contact us</a> directly and we are happy to help. You can also ask questions in the <a href="https://forum.airgradient.com">AirGradient Forum</a> and get valuable tips from the community.</p>

<h2>Mounting Options</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/mounting.png" alt=""/></p><div>
<div>
<p>The monitor can be mounted on walls or poles. For pole mounting, use two stainless steel zip ties and feed them through the zip tie holders. Alternatively you can use two screws and mount the monitor on a wall. To prevent theft, there is a small hole on the monitor that you can use with a secure screw to prevent the monitor from easily taken off.</p>

<h2>Ideally combined with indoor monitors</h2>
<p>In order to fully understand the air quality of your environment, we recommend you also monitor the air quality indoors. We spend most of our time indoors and often the indoor air can also be very unhealthy due to indoor pollutants like volatile organic components (VOCs), or high particle concentrations from cooking. High CO2 values due to insufficient ventilation can lead to tiredness and lower cognitive performance.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>In order to ensure the accuracy of the monitor we work with more than 15 universities and research institutions around the world that have co-located the monitor with their reference instruments. A special thanks to all our scientific partners for participating in this program. To learn more or if you are interested to participate, you can read more on our <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/research">research page</a>.</p>

<h2>In 2019, 99% of the world population was living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met. Ambient (outdoor air pollution) in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016.</h2>

<h2>Easy to Extend</h2>

<div>
<p>The open-hardware / open-source nature of the monitor allow easy changes and additions on the firmware as well hardware. The board is powered by an ESP32-C3-MINI microcontroller that is easy to program with a wide eco-system and has integrated WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.</p>

<h2>Open Hardware, Open Source, Open Data, Open Everything!</h2>
<p>As the name implies, the Open Air has been designed from the ground up with the strong desire democratizing air quality monitoring. Access to the information about the air you breathe should not be a privilege of the rich. Air pollution is one of the largest global environmental and health risks, requiring a high density sensor network to understand and solve the problem. We provide a blueprint of a robust, affordable and open design that citizens and NGOs worldwide can use to accurately measure air quality.</p>

<h4>Fully Open Source</h4>
<p>All code, schematics, 3D files etc. are open-source and published under CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. You can easily adapt the hardware as well as flash your own firmware.</p>
</div>
<div>
<ion-icon name=""></ion-icon>
<h4>You own your Data</h4>
<p>There is a trend in our industry to monetize air quality data to the extent that often the owner of the monitor does not own the data. We believe this is wrong. The data that your monitor generates should belong to the owner of the monitor.</p>

<h4>openAQ</h4>
<p>We have partnered up with <a href="https://openaq.org/">openAQ</a>, a non-profit with the mission to provide air quality data to influence policy, and to enable the public to access information on air pollution through open data and open-source tools.</p>

<h2>Statements from People Involved</h2>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Having used the AirGradient indoor DIY kits as well as the commercial AirGradient ONE in awareness projects with schools and universities here in Thailand, I am very keen on piloting this new outdoor monitor. I am also interested in exchanging ideas and resources for student engagement with this open source projct.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The San Joaquin Valley of California has extreme climate injustice and the worst air quality in the United States, yet continues poorly monitored. The SEEN Team has partnered with AirGradient to facilitate low-cost monitoring in rural disadvantaged communities, and to increase awareness and education related to air quality. We intend to provide more and better real-time air quality information for local decision makers to act in the best interest of their underserved communities.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I’m very happy to contribute to this open hardware project with my product design experience and working with the team to not only ensuring a beautiful look but a highly functional design. Turning the required air flow characteristics and vent specification into a good looking product was a challenge I really liked. I’m looking forward to see the product in many Citizen Science projects around the world.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Having tested numerous air quality sensors for the projects we are doing I found myself extremely impressed with AirGradient. Not only are they technically first class with their product, they have a level of engagement and adaptability which makes working with them very easy. A welcome element to this is their clear commitment to the importance of environmental issues, showing itself in their interest in the details of our projects - all this helps them to deliver…!</p>

<p>AirGradient have consistently gone above and beyond their contractual duties in order to better support the SAMHE Project. They have shown great flexibility and a genuine interest to listen to the complex needs of the project; as a result, they deliver valuable products and a friendly service, both in a manner that is timely for the project.</p>

<h2>Why we care about Air Quality</h2>
<p>AirGradient started as a volunteer project to help a school in Northern Thailand monitor the air quality in classrooms during the highly polluted burning season. From the beginning, we have worked with students and educators to building hardware to increase awareness in the area of air quality, to understand the health impacts of pollutants, and to empower the positive changes that can be made to reduce air pollution.</p>
