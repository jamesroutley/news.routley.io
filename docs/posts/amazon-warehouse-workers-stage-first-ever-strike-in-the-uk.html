The walkout marks the first formal industrial action in the country for the U.S. tech giant.</p><p>The 24-hour strike action began Wednesday a minute after midnight.

Amazon introduced the pay hike last summer. But warehouse workers say it fails to match the rising cost of living. They want the company to pay a minimum £15 an hour.</p><p>They also want better working conditions.

The company began laying off 18,000 workers last week in an attempt to dial back some of the expansion it undertook during the Covid-19 period and brace for a possible recession in 2023.</p><p>Earlier this month, Amazon launched a consultation to close down three of its U.K. sites, where it employs a combined 1,200 people. The move is not part of Amazon&#39;s 18,000 job cuts, according to the firm.</p><p>Amazon has long been criticized for labor shortcomings, with the company often accused of poor working conditions in its warehouses and delivery operations and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/24/how-amazon-prevents-unions-by-surveilling-employee-activism.html">squashing attempts from employees to unionize</a>. In April, staff at the company&#39;s Staten Island warehouse in New York became the first group in the U.S. to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/02/amazon-workers-just-voted-to-join-a-union-heres-what-happens-next-.html">vote in favor of joining a union</a>.</p><p>&#34;We stand in solidarity with the Amazon workers of Coventry fighting for higher pay and benefits,&#34; Chris Smalls of Amazon Labor Union, which established the union, told CNBC. &#34;It&#39;s time Amazon who claims to be Earth&#39;s best company come to the table and bargain in good faith with its unions.&#34;</p><p>Amazon has previously said its employees have the right to join or not join a union, but that it doesn&#39;t believe unions are the best choice for its workers.</p></div></div></div>
