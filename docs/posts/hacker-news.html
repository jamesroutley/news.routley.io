If you’re really lucky, those are also the things you like doing. I’m good at writing articles that get upvoted and discussed on Hacker News, or news.ycombinator.com. But I don’t like it.</p><p>Writing on the internet can be a two-way thing, a learning experience guided by iteration and feedback. I’ve learned some bad habits from Hacker News. I added <em>Caveats</em> sections to articles to make sure that nobody would take my points too broadly. I edited away asides and comments that were fun but would make articles less focused. I came to expect pedantic, judgmental feedback on everything I wrote, regardless of what it was. Whoever upvotes articles doesn’t comment, and whoever comments doesn’t seem to like anything.</p><p>I don’t like what Hacker News has become – or a lot of the web, for that matter. But I’m part of the discourse. I’ve written critical articles, mean tweets, silly comments, the whole lot of it. It’s impossible to separate one thing from another and neatly place blame. But it’s simple to notice a thing you want less of and turn it off.</p><p>So I can flex the freedom of an <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/02/06/how-to-blog.html">independent blog</a> by embracing what seems good and pushing away what I don’t like. Redirecting Hacker News links away from this website makes sense to me. Traffic to this website doesn’t pay my bills. Disengaged readers just looking for a hot take don’t return to my site, or recognize me when I write something else, or write blog posts of their own and bring new creativity to the indie web.</p><p>Maybe posts will be less <em>viral</em> (I can hear, as I write that, someone writing “you haven’t written a hit in years, Tom!”), but writing viral posts or maximizing wasn’t my goal when I set out and it isn’t now.</p><p>Anyway, the <a href="https://macwright.com/rss.xml">RSS feed works great</a>. The HTML site works pretty well. I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw">tweet</a> most new articles I write. Business as usual, just less of the orange site.</p><p><img alt="Brooklyn Skyline from Gowanus" src="https://macwright.com/images/2022-09-15-hacker-news-brooklyn-skyline-from-gowanus.jpeg"/></p></div></div>
