    <h1>U.S. Department of Defense Launches All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office Website</h1>

                <p>Today the department launched a website on the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to provide the public with information concerning AARO and its efforts to understand and resolve unidentified anomalous phenomena. </p>

<p>This website will provide information, including photos and videos, on resolved UAP cases as they are declassified and approved for public release.  The website&#39;s other content includes reporting trends and a frequently asked questions section as well as links to official reports, transcripts, press releases, and other resources that the public may find useful, such as applicable statutes and aircraft, balloon and satellite tracking sites.  </p>

<p>This fall, consistent with Section 1673 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, AARO will launch a secure reporting tool on the website to enable current and former U.S. government employees, service members, or contractors with direct knowledge of U.S. government programs or activities to contact AARO directly to make a report.  The department is conducting its final reviews to ensure the reporting mechanism complies with the Privacy Act of 1974, the Whistleblower Protections Enhancement Act of 2012, the Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No FEAR Act), and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.  In the interim, current U.S. service members, U.S. government employees, and civil aviators are encouraged to continue to use the existing reporting mechanisms available to them through their organizations.  A mechanism for members of the general public to make reports will be announced in coming months.</p>

<p>The department is committed to transparency with the American people on AARO&#39;s work on UAP.  This website will serve as a one-stop shop for all publicly available information related to AARO and UAP, and AARO will regularly update the website with its most recent activities and findings as new information is cleared for public release.</p>

<p>You can see AARO&#39;s new website at <a href="https://www.aaro.mil" target="_blank">https://www.aaro.mil</a>.</p>
