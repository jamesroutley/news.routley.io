    <h1>A Note on Fil-C</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Filip Pizlo recently released a (solo!) <a href="https://fil-c.org/">project called Fil-C</a> that adds a memory-safety instrumentation pass to clang (for spatial safety -- out-of-bounds accesses), along with a runtime support library and <a href="https://fil-c.org/fugc">a concurrent GC</a> (for temporal safety -- use after free). It is, by the standards of such tools, highly compatible with existing code -- so much so that building a full linux distro userspace seems likely within reach with only modest patching effort. The stated performance overheads (<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251028-filcc-vs-clang.html">measured by Dan Bernstein at &#34;about 1-4x cycles&#34;</a>) are by modern standards &#34;probably tolerable&#34; for many workloads (EDIT: <a href="https://gist.github.com/graydon/c769a4d741b1fc955f78271a4fa3d2df">also see a few initial measurements I made with the &#34;optfilc&#34; tools</a> -- I did less-micro benchmarks and found a wider range), especially stuff that&#39;s IO bound or not otherwise straining for maximum performance.</p></div></div>
