    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here&#39;s another<!-- --> <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/happy">#happy</a> post for you! I wrote this from the sunny shores of the Bahamas, so I&#39;m doing particularly well.</p>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/-XtYJz3uwW0?si=u-h_AR_qGT851cdy">Hong Kongâ€™s Legendary Whole-Roasted Goose</a> is so fascinating. Street Eats by Bon AppÃ©tit continues to impress me.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/24/1198911299/answering-your-questions-about-electric-vehicles">The Sunday Story: Answering Your Questions About Electric Vehicles</a> is a fantastic episode of the NPR Sunday Story. I learned a lot about electric vehicles and it challenged a few misconceptions I had about EV production in the US.</li>
<li><a href="https://switchedonpop.com/episodes/amelia-meath-david-gray-sxsw">How to DIY a Music Career (with Amelia Meath and David Gray at SXSW)</a> is a great interview with Amelia Meath of Sylvan Esso. I love hearing about how musicians think about their careers. Also learned a bunch about David Gray&#39;s song Babylon.</li>

<li>I enjoyed the short post &#34;<a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/cookie-banners-are-not-needed/">Dear Paul Graham, there is no cookie banner law</a>.&#34; I feel like I gave up on this fight ten years ago, but glad to see some folks are still at it.</li>
<li>I read all of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41886271">The Sword of Kaigen</a> by M.L. Wang. I was gifted this book by my friend Frankie and it is not at all what I expected. Is it a political thriller? A reimagining of The Last Airbender? A treatise on the dangers of propaganda? A character study on women in bad marriages? I think it&#39;s all of these things and more. It could have been 30% shorter, but it is beautifully written and I&#39;d recommend to anyone who likes a bit of epic fantasy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/gps-jamming-map/">FlightRadar describes their new GPS Jamming Map</a> is pretty interesting.</li>
<li><a href="https://danluu.com/slow-device/">Dan Luu&#39;s Slow Device</a> writeup is super fascinating and very infuriating when you think about all of the companies that don&#39;t build for less powerful devices.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve had a few times in my career where I&#39;ve pushed back against folks using websockets. <a href="https://rxdb.info/articles/websockets-sse-polling-webrtc-webtransport.html">This article</a> provides a great analysis of when to use which technology and lines up with my normal arguments.</li>
