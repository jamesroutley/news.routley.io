    <h1>The unix69 keyboard layout: nerdy and nice</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>A proper Unix keyboard layout must have <em>escape</em> next to <em>1</em> and <em>control</em>
next to <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>Compared to the usual ANSI layout, <em>backquote</em> is displaced from its
common position next to <em>1</em>. But a proper Unix keyboard should cover
the entire ASCII repertoire, 94 printing characters on 47 keys, plus
<em>space</em>, in the main block of keys.</p>
<p>To make a place for <em>backquote</em>, we can move <em>delete</em> down a row so it
is above <em>return</em>, and put <em>backslash</em> and <em>backquote</em> where <em>delete</em>
was.</p>
<p>(Aside: the <em>delete</em> key emits the delete character, ASCII 127, and the
<em>return</em> key emits the carriage return character, ASCII 13. That is why
I don’t call them <em>backspace</em> and <em>enter</em>.)</p>
<p>This produces a layout similar to the main key block of <a href="https://imgur.com/MAiofgF">Sun Type
3</a>, <a href="https://happyhackingkb.com/jp/products/discontinued/hhkb_kb02/">Happy Hacking</a>, and <a href="https://kono.store/products/whitefox-mechanical-keyboard">True Fox</a>
keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer compact keyboards so I don’t have to reach too
far for the mouse, but I can’t do without arrow keys. So a
<a href="https://www.keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts-gdeby">65% keyboard size</a>
(5 rows, 16 keys wide) is ideal.</p>
<p>If you apply the Unix layout requirements to a typical ANSI 68-key 65%
layout, you get a 69-key layout. I call it unix69. (1969 was also the
year Unix started.)</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://dotat.at/graphics/unix69.png" alt="a screenshot of the unix69 keyboard layout from the KLE link above"/></p>
<p>I have arranged the bottom row modifiers for Emacs: there are left and
right <em>meta</em> keys and a right <em>ctrl</em> key for one-handed navigation.
<em>Meta</em> is what the USB HID spec calls the “GUI” key; it sometimes has
a diamond icon legend. Like the <a href="https://happyhackingkb.com/jp/products/discontinued/hhkb_kb02/">HHKB</a>, and like Unix
workstations made by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Keyboard_(A1048).jpg">Apple</a>
and <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8RsW.jpg">Sun</a>, the meta keys are
either side of the space bar.</p>
<p>There are left and right <em>fn</em> keys for things that don’t have
dedicated keys, e.g. <em>fn</em>+arrows for <em>page up</em>/<em>page down</em>, <em>home</em>,
<em>end</em>. The rightmost column has user-programmable macro keys, which I
use for window management.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/6610c45b1c12f962e6cf564dc66f220b">http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/6610c45b1c12f962e6cf564dc66f220b</a></em></p>
<p>ANSI 65% keyboards have <em>caps lock</em> where <em>control</em> should be.</p>
<p>They have an ugly oversized <em>backslash</em> and lack a good place for <em>backquote</em>.</p>
<p>The right column is usually wasted on fixed-function keys.</p>
<p>It’s common for 65% keyboards to have 67 or 68 keys, the missing key
making a gap between the modifiers and arrow keys on the bottom row.
I prefer to have more rather than fewer modifier keys.</p>

<p><a href="https://matt3o.com/whitefox-the-making-of/">Matteo Spinelli</a>’s
<a href="https://kono.store/products/whitefox-mechanical-keyboard">Whitefox / Nightfox “True Fox” layout</a> has top 2 rows
similar to unix69. It sometimes has <em>backslash</em> and <em>backquote</em>
swapped.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it has <em>caps lock</em> where <em>control</em> should be. Its right
column is wasted on fixed-function keys (though the keyboards are
reprogrammable so it’s mainly a keycap problem).</p>
<p>On the bottom row, True Fox has two modifers and a gap between space
and arrows, whereas unix69 has three modifiers and no gap.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://happyhackingkb.com/jp/products/discontinued/hhkb_kb02/">Happy hacking</a> keyboard layout is OK for a 60% Unix layout.
However it lacks a left <em>fn</em> key, and lacks space for full-size arrow
keys, so I prefer a 65% layout.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://dotat.at/graphics/keybird69.jpg">https://dotat.at/graphics/keybird69.jpg</a></em></p>
<p>Owing to the difficulty of getting keycaps with exactly the legends I
would like, the <em>meta</em> keys on my <a href="https://dotat.at/@/2023-08-04-keybird.html">keybird69</a> are labelled <em>super</em>
and the delete key is labelled <em>backspace</em>. I used <em>F1</em> to <em>F4</em>
keycaps for the macro keys, tho they are programmed to generate <em>F13</em>
to <em>F16</em> which are set up as
<a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a> hot keys.</p>
<p>But otherwise <a href="https://dotat.at/@/2023-08-04-keybird.html">keybird69</a> is a proper unix69 keyboard.</p>
