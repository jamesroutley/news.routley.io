    <h1>Europe to decide if 6 GHz is shared between Wi-Fi and cellular networks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A row is brewing in Europe over the 6 GHz part of the wireless spectrum, between those who believe it should be licensed for use by cellular networks and others that want it reserved for Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Alliance and the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance (DSA) have published open letters addressed to &#34;EU digital ministers,&#34; expressing concerns that the upper 6 GHz band (6425 to 7125 MHz) may be rendered off-limits to Wi-Fi networks in European Union countries.</p>
<p>At the heart of the problem is that newer Wi-Fi standards such as Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 are capable of using frequencies in the entire 6 GHz band to provide greater performance. But mobile operators are also eyeing this band for 5G and 6G network services.</p>

    

<p>The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) of the European Commission is currently exploring ways of sharing the upper 6 GHz band between license-exempt technologies such as Wi-Fi and mobile networks. The lower part of the band is already license-exempt. Britain&#39;s telco regulator Ofcom is <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/11/ofcom_proposes_wifi_and_cellphones/">following a similar policy</a>, after a consultation process in 2023.</p>

        


        

<p>However, the Wi-Fi camp is worried that the German government may have changed its stance to favor exclusive mobile network use of the upper 6 GHz band, potentially influencing the RSPG&#39;s decision.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport told German news site <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/WLAN-Rejection-Germany-Favors-Mobile-for-Upper-6-GHz-Band-10965806.html" rel="nofollow">Heise Online</a>: &#34;The frequency requirements of mobile network operators in the upper 6 GHz band are assessed as greater with a view to future 6G applications&#34; than those of Wi-Fi applications.</p>

</ul>
<p>In response, the Wi-Fi Alliance and the DSA are trying to stoke fears that such a move would severely dent Europe&#39;s digital development, claiming Wi-Fi is the primary way consumers access the internet and constraining it would impact progress.</p>
<p>&#34;Blocking Wi-Fi access to the upper 6 GHz band would be devastating to the future of Wi-Fi technology in Europe. This spectrum is uniquely positioned to sustain the evolution of the Wi-Fi ecosystem and enable the next generation of digital innovation,&#34; said the DSA.</p>

        

<p>The DSA styles itself as a global body advocating for regulations that will deliver more efficient spectrum use, but its member list appears to consist chiefly of US tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Broadcom, and Cisco.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Alliance complained that its members were working with the RSPG&#39;s proposals to try and use the spectrum on a shared basis, in line with the European Commission&#39;s mandate.</p>
<p>&#34;By contrast, the mobile industry is arguing against a compromise. It is now demanding exclusive use of the entire upper 6 GHz band for mobile services, arguing this would strengthen Europe&#39;s digital sovereignty,&#34; its letter states.</p>

        

<p>It claims that Wi-Fi has access to &#34;significantly less spectrum than mobile. These traffic patterns show Wi-Fi&#39;s need for the upper 6 GHz band far exceeds that of mobile.&#34;</p>
<p>The mobile telecoms industry sees it differently, of course. Vodafone has <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/26/vodafone_6_ghz_wi_fi/">previously conducted tests</a> in the upper 6 GHz frequencies, achieving download speeds of up to 5 Gbps, and saying it should be made available to boost cellular capacity when current bandwidth becomes exhausted.</p>
<p>Nokia and Swedish telco Telia also <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/nokia_upper_6_ghz_spectrum/">carried out a pilot deployment</a> using the upper 6 GHz spectrum last year, claiming it showed the ability to add &#34;massive capacity&#34; in built-up areas, while high throughput can be achieved in suburban or rural areas.</p>
<p>In this respect, the mobile industry has backing from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which earmarked the upper 6 GHz band for cellular services at the <a href="https://www.itu.int/wrc-23/" rel="nofollow">World Radio Conference</a> (WRC) in 2023.</p>
<p>However, the US telco regulator the FCC <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/28/nab_spectrum_fcc/" target="_blank">reserved the entire 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi</a> and other unlicensed operations back in 2020. Other countries are not prevented from following their own path.</p>
<p>All eyes will be on the RSPG&#39;s next Plenary Meeting on November 12, to see what decision (if any) it adopts.</p>
<p>A spokesperson at the European Commission sent a statement to <em>The Register</em>:</p>
<p>&#34;The Commission envisages a technical harmonisation decision on the upper 6 GHz band.To this end, the Commission has tasked the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) to develop EU-harmonised technical conditions for a preferred usage scenario of the band. The CEPT has to deliver its final report in July 2027.&#34; ®</p>
