Now I do! I want to share my thoughts behind its design, and how I have begun to find an identity with this domain name that started as a bit of a shit-post.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><hr/><p>I bought this domain (veryth.ink) on a whim one day because it was something I thought was kind of clever at the time, and still do for the most part. But until now, I hadn&#39;t really identified with it in any meaningful way, it was/is a form of shit-post, which later was justified as a way to take myself and the publication of my thoughts a little less seriously, and now, spurred by the creation of this favicon, it&#39;s a way of owning the way my brain works.</p><p>I had gotten tired of seeing the 404 error when my browser tried and failed to fetch the favicon for my website, so, I sat down and opened up my favorite pixel-art editor. My immediate inclination was to draw a brain, it&#39;s what I (and I hope, many others) use when thinking, very, or otherwise. But I didn&#39;t want to just draw a brain and call it a day, that felt kind of lazy, and lacking any individuality or personal meaning. So I started to think about, well, <em>how</em> I think, specifically how difficult it can be sometimes to get the disparate parts of my brain to work together to achieve a common goal. The over-simplified model of &#34;left-brain vs right-brain&#34; sprung to mind, and I knew I had to somehow communicate the two halves working together in this icon. After a few iterations, I came up with this!</p><img alt="Pixel art of a brain as viewed from the top with a &#39;repeat track&#39; symbol in the middle of the two hemispheres" title="Pixel art of a brain as viewed from the top with a &#39;repeat track&#39; symbol in the middle of the two hemispheres" src="https://veryth.ink/blog/new-favicon/very-think-favicon-light-upscaled.png"/><p>I used the common &#34;repeat&#34; symbol, that anyone who has used a music player since the 2000&#39;s should recognize, as a reference for the symbol in the midst of the two hemispheres to indicate cycles, or iterations, of thought. This can sometimes be a negative state of operation for me, where I fixate on something out of my control and sink deeper into anxiety, but other times, this fixation can be one of my strengths! This was all the justification I needed to commit to this logo, and in doing so, it helped me finally build a story for this domain name that is consistent with an aspect of my identity.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this little bite-size post on the motivations behind the design of my new favicon. If any of this resonated with you in some way I&#39;d love to hear how! You can find out how to contact me on my <a href="https://veryth.ink/about">about</a> page. Or, if you&#39;re here from <a href="https://recurse.com/">RC</a>, well, you know how to find me!</p><hr/></section><span>//Â <a href="https://veryth.ink/tags/meta/">#meta</a>, <a href="https://veryth.ink/tags/blaggregate/">#blaggregate</a></span></article></main></div></div>
