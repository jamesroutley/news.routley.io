  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve recently rediscovered an old game called “The Games: Winter Challenge”, a Winter Olympics sports game developed by MindSpan and published by Accolade in 1991 for DOS and Sega Genesis.
I had the DOS version of the game when growing up, so when I was randomly reminded of its existence, I was driven by a mix of nostaliga and curiosity to dig it up again.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/winter_titlescreen.webp" alt="Animation of the game&#39;s title screen"/></p>

<p>Having grown up to become a computer scientist, I was not as much insterested in replaying it (though hearing the iconic music again was fun), but much more how it worked under the hood.
I had spent hours as a kid playing especially the ski jumping event, trying to reach the elusive mark of 100 meters, without success, and was determined to find out not only whether it was possible to achieve, but also what the theoretical optimum would be.
Conveniently, the game features a replay system that allows you to save and rewatch past attempts, which opens up great opportunities for creating a TAS and manufacture a perfect replay file, and push the game to its limts.</p>

<p>My initial plan of attack was simple: Find a copy of the game, crack it open in Ghidra, disassemble it to find out how the ski jumping works, and optimize based on the discovered mechanics.
As it turned out, each step of this plan was way more involved than anticipated, and created more questions along the way that demanded answers, opening up a rabbit hole of early 90s video game development intricasies.
This write-up will take you along on this ride of discovery, learning about how DOS-based programs worked, how video video game developers worked around the hardware limitations, how early copy protection worked, and how GOG sells you a broken version of the game (as of March 2025).</p>

<h2 id="taking-stock---version-chaos-and-copy-protection-circumvention">Taking stock - version chaos and copy protection circumvention</h2>

<p>The game has had multiple releases, including the original release in 1991, two bundle releases with its successor “Summer Challenge” in 1992 (Europe) and 1996 (US), and a GOG release of the bundle in 2020, based on DOS emulation through <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>.
While the original floppy disks from my childhood are likely buried somewhere, they are of limited use today for lack of a floppy drive to read them with, so I searched the internet for the game.
Acquiring these different versions wasn’t too difficult thanks to the Internet Archive hosting various versions of the original media, and of course purchasing it from GOG.</p>

<p>The original game used a code wheel for copy protection.
Code wheels were a typical copy protection of the time: They are a physical set of disks sliding against each other, which you got together with the floppy disks containing the game.
At startup, the game asks you to turn them in a specific configuration, which reveals a code you need to enter into the game for it to work.
For those who are not old like me and have never seen a code wheel before, there is an <a href="https://www.oldgames.sk/codewheel/games-winter-challenge">interactive online version</a> of this game’s code wheel available.</p>

<p>The original 1991 release as expected asks for this code when you try to play any discipline, and boots you out if you answer incorrectly twice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigation 1:</strong> how is the code wheel check implemented?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/winter_code_wheel_input.png" alt="Screen shot of the code wheel input in-game"/></p>

<p>The GOG version does not ask you for the code and lets you play without it, so presumably they have removed the copy protection from it instead of distributing the code wheel.
Where it get very insteresting is that multiple people are complaining in the discussion of this game on GOG that the game is “improperly cracked” and doesn’t work correctly as a result.
The descriptions of some of the behaviors, like that you can’t land a ski jump beyond a certain distance, or that you always crash in the last lap of speed skating, actually resonated with my recollection of playing the game as a kid, which means either we had a poorly cracked version back then as well, or that this is not related to copy protection at all and the game is just buggy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigation 2:</strong> Are there hidden copy protection measures which affect gameplay?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1996 US release actually comes with a separate crack, presumably officially sanctioned: Next to the main <code>WINTER.EXE</code>, it has a <code>WINTER.COM</code>, only 879 bytes in size, which when executed removes the code wheel check from the game, otherwise the game still asks for it.</p>

<p>But the version confusion doesn’t end there.
While searching for different versions, I also found other versions of the game, often in the form of online playable images loaded in DOSBox in the browser.
None of these needed a code wheel, and while some were based on the 1996 US release, others used entirely different cracks, created by different release groups of the early 90s.</p>

<p>And to complete the mess, the original game actually offers an option to install the game to disk instead of playing it from floppy, including its very own set of mysteries.
The installation does not work like you might expect, just copying files from floppy to disk; instead, it actually creates a whole new <code>WINTER.EXE</code> executable each time.
During installation, you can choose different options, including which graphics modes to support, and a “fast loading” mode which according to the manual makes the game load faster at the cost of additional hard drive space, and each combination of the options creates a different executable for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigaton 3:</strong> How are these different versions of the executable being created, and how do they differ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So taking stock and comparing all different acquired versions, there are a lot of distinct binaries:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The original floppy version of the game</li>
  <li>Six different versions of the game when installed to hard disk, for each combination of “fast loading” and either or both of the EGA and VGA graphics modes</li>
  <li>The GOG version of the game, which is based on the installed VGA+EGA fast-load version with individual bytes modified</li>
  <li>A cracked binary of unknown origin, which is based on the installed VGA fast-load version with individual bytes modified</li>
</ol>

<p>Furthermore, there are three different stand-alone cracks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The official <code>WINTER.COM</code> crack (879 bytes) which was provided with the 1996 US release alongside an unmodified floppy version</li>
  <li>A <code>WG.COM</code> crack (366 bytes) by release group “The Humble Guys” from October 17, 1991, within days after the game’s release</li>
  <li>A <code>WINTER.COM</code> crack (291 bytes) by release group “Razor1911” from October 17, 1991, the same day(!) as the other crack</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigation 4:</strong> How do the individual cracks work, and do they use different mechanisms?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="cracking-the-binary-open---obfuscation-and-memory-constraints">Cracking the binary open - obfuscation and memory constraints</h2>

<p>So to start somewhere, I loaded up the floppy version in Ghidra, and was immediately underwhelmed. It only managed to analyze a tiny fraction of the inital code, with most of it remaining binary blobs.
Opening the same file in IDA revealed much of the same picture, but IDA also provided accompanying warnings: It thinks the binary may be packed, and there are lots of unused bytes beyond the end of the code.
I figured that the binary must be packed or obfuscated in some way, and the tiny bit of initial code is the routine to unpack the rest of the binary.</p>

<p>So I began reverse-engineering the unpacking routine, and discovered a suspicious string in the binary, nestled between the assembly: <strong>*FAB*</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/FAB.png" alt="A calling card left by Fabrice Bellard"/></p>

<p>As it turns out, “FAB” stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrice_Bellard">Fabrice Bellard</a>, who next to being the original developer of widely used programs such as FFmpeg and QEMU, is also the creator of an executable compression utility called <a href="https://bellard.org/lzexe.html">LZEXE</a>, developed in 1990.
Luckily, the inner workings of LZEXE are widely documented and understood.
I won’t go into the details of how the compression works here, there are great existing write-ups by <a href="https://cosmodoc.org/topics/lzexe/">Scott Smitelli</a> and <a href="https://www.lodsb.com/reversing-lz91-from-commander-keen">Sam Russell</a> if you want to dig deeper.
We just want to unpack the binary to get to the good stuff, and there are plenty existing unpacking utilities available, including UNLZEXE by Mitugu Kurizono from the same era.
The packing and unpacking is its own arms race microcosm, with protectors to prevent the unpacking, and more sophisticated unpackers to do it anyway, but luckily no additional unpacking protections were employed for this game.</p>

<p>The resulting unpacked binary has two surprises right off the bat: Firstly it is only 168kB in size, much smaller than the original executable despite extraction presumably making it grow in size, and secondly the result of unpacking it is identical across all different versions of the game.
This gives us a hint for how the game is structured: It contains a chunk of business logic, which is what we have unpacked and is the same across versions, and then it contains some resrouces, like sprites and sounds, which are included into the executable file and loaded out of it at runtime.
This assumption is supported by the fact that the extracted binary actually still works properly as long as it is placed beside the original <code>WINTER.EXE</code> binary to load the assets out of.</p>

<p>But it also is somewhat surprising for the two cracked versions of the binary, I would have expected those to contain modified business logic in order to facilitate skipping the code wheel check.
The answer to that mystery becomes apparent quickly after opening the new extracted binary in a disassembler.
By looking around some, we find suspicious interrupt calls to <code>int 3fh</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/int3fh.png" alt="Instances of a mysterious interrupt 3fh"/></p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="side-bar-interrupts">Side bar: Interrupts</h3>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">Interrupts</a> are the main way DOS programs used to communicate with the operating system, analogous to today’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">syscalls</a>.
Whenever a program wants to interact with something outside it’s own code, it would call an interrupt and ask DOS to perform that task for it, handing back control to the operating system temporarily, and resuming when it is complete.
Anything from printing text to the screen, reading and writing files from disk, to allocating heap memory, is done through the main interrupt DOS provides, <code>int 21h</code>.
Which action is requested and any arguments are determined by the value of the CPU registers when the interrupt is called.
Other interrupts exist like <code>int 33h</code> for mouse interactions, but notably <code>int 3fh</code> is not one of the DOS-provided interrupts.
Under the hood, the routing of interrupts is handled by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_vector_table">interrupt vector table</a>, which contain for each interrupt the address of the routine that is executed from when the interrupt is called.
Programs can modify this table (using an interrupt) to add their own custom interrupts, and <code>int 3fh</code> is likely used-defined this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IDA provides a helpful comment to these, that this interrupt is typically used for calling an “Overlay manager”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="side-bar-overlays">Side bar: Overlays</h3>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_(programming)">Overlaying</a> is a technique for loading additional pieces of code at runtime, where multiple such pieces, called overlays, can be swapped out in the same place in memory.
This was useful in programs of the time to save on RAM usage: DOS only allowed a maximum of 640kB of memory to be used by a program (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_memory">Conventional memory</a>), and large applications might themselves already be too big to fit all their code into that limit, not even considering any data.
Overlays are used to circumvent this limitation: By breaking the program code up into multiple overlays, the program only needs to load whatever overlay is needed for the current operation into memory.
Other overlays are loaded from disk as they are needed, replacing the previous overlay, allowing the program to have complex functionality with a small memory footprint.
Loading and managing overlays was the responsibility of an overlay manager, a library which kept track of which overlays are needed when and loaded and unloaded them accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it turns out, the game was written in C and compiled with the Microsoft C compiler version 6, as hinted by an embedded string <code>MS Run-Time Library - Copyright (c) 1990, Microsoft Corp</code> in the binary.
Perusing the compiler’s manual, the linker of that compiler did natively support overlays and would install its own overlay manager as <code>int 3fh</code> by default, so this was my first suspicion for how this structure was created.</p>

<p>Overall, this was not good news.
It means that the unpacked binary is in fact not all the business logic that exists, and there are more pieces of code, presumably in the resources packaged with the executable.
Disassemblers don’t understand these overlays, can’t detect them or automatically disassemble them, so the work to understand the business logic will be more manual than planned.
In order to progress further, we need to find and extract all these overlays, to get a complete picture of the game’s code.</p>

<p>By finding where the interrupt 3fh is installed at the start of the program, we can identfy the overlay manager routine which is called each time an overlay is needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/int3f_initialization.png" alt="Installing the int3fh"/></p>

<p>Based on documentation for how Microsoft’s overlay manager worked, each interrupt call is followed by 3 bytes, one byte for the index number of the overlay that is needed, and two for the 16-bit address within that overlay.
Calling the interrupt then works like a function call: The overlay is loaded, the function at the given address is invoked, and afterwards the control flow returns directly after the interrupt call.
In fact the interrupts are literal replacements for function calls: a the 5 bytes typically needed for a far call instruction (1 byte opcode, 2 bytes address offset, 2 bytes address segment) are replaced by the Linker with the 5 bytes for the interrupt (2 bytes opcode, 1 byte overlay index, 2 bytes address offset) where needed.</p>

<p>This is where the good news ended though.
According to the documentation, each overlay should be appended to the main program, including its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable">MZ header</a>, but this is not what we find in our binary.
Worse still, when using DOSBox’ debugger to step through an invocation of the interrupt, the code that was loaded is nowhere to be found in the binary file.
Also, unlike typical overlays, they are not actually occupying the same space in memory, instead new memory is dynamically allocated for each overlay, and deallocated after use.
That is useful because it allows multiple overlays to be loaded at the same time, but also means this game is not actually using the overlay mechanism from Microsoft C, instead it uses what appears to be a bespoke overlay management implementation.</p>



<p>Statically reverse-engineering the overlay manager routine turned out to be a very time-consuming endeavor, but luckily there were still some hints that can help us take some shortcuts.
The DOS emulator <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a> is a fork of DOSBox, and has additional useful debugging features, including logging of all file IO, and all <code>int 21h</code> interrupts.
Watching those while the game starts up reveals that the game is seeking through the binary to specific locations, which happen to be directly after the bytes of the main program, and then reading many chunks of 22 bytes each.</p>

<p>These are likely the start of the resources, and when checking the binary at that location we find that the secion begins with two bytes spelling out <code>MB</code>, similar to how the executables themselves start with an <code>MZ</code> magic number.
Looking for this magic number in the disassembly brings us directly to the routine which parses out the structure of the embedded resources.</p>

  <h3 id="sidebar-16-bit-architecture-and-segments">Sidebar: 16-bit architecture and segments</h3>

  <p>This program, and all DOS programs at the time, were built for a 16-bit architecture, compared to the 64-bit architecture today’s computers are using.
What that means is that all registers in the CPU can hold only 16-bit values, including any pointers.
Since 16-bit registers can only have 2^16 = 65536 different values, it can only address 64kB of memory.
This was too little, even back then, so in order to be able to address more memory, pointers typically consisted of 2 parts, a segment and an offset.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segmentation">Segments</a> are chunks of memory, at most 64kB in size, which were typically assigned different roles: there are typically one or multiple code segments holding the program code, a data segment holding the work memory for any data the program stores, and a stack segment to hold the values which are put on the stack.
Those segments can be considered independent parts of the memory, and to interact with something from another segment, you would need a far pointer, consisting of both a segment and offset within that segment, whereas for referencing something within a segment a near pointer using only the offset is sufficient.</p>

  <p>Under the hood, the memory is still one linear chunk, and the resulting memory address of a far pointer is simply <code>segment * 16 + offset</code>.
That means segments can technically overlap with different segment-offset pairs pointing to the same physical address, but conventionally they were chosen to be distinct blocks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resources are all tabulated in a simple header structure, in entries of 22 bytes each.
Each entry contains two 4-byte numbers, indicating the length of the data and the offset in the file where they are located.
The remaining bytes contains a 0-terminated string spelling out the name of the resource (any byte after the 0 terminator is garbage).
However, this name is obfuscated by adding <code>0x60</code> to all bytes, so they don’t show up in any strings analysis of the binary.
By de-obfuscating the names, we can learn that these additional binary blobs contain both the assets like images, meshes, music and SFX files, and the code overlays in the form of pairs of files with extensions <code>COD</code> and <code>REL</code>.</p>

<p>One fun pattern to observe is that the garbage data after the file names are leftovers from the previous name, suggesting that when the entries were written, it used the same buffer for all names in order.</p>

<p>Just from the names, we can assume that the <code>COD</code> files contain the actual machine code, and the <code>REL</code> files contain some relocation data.</p>

<blockquote>
  

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)">Relocation</a> is a concept that allows code to become location-independent: When a program is loaded into memory, it may not be loaded at the same address every time.
However, parts of the program refer to other parts by address (e.g. a function call), and in order for those to continue to work regardless of the actual location in memory, they need to be modified.
To achieve this, all addresses are written into the binary as if the program is located at memory address 0, and all the places which correspond to segment values are put in a long list called the relocation table.
For the main program, this is handled by DOS: the MZ header of the executable contains a relocation table with addresses in the code that need to be updated.
After copying the program into memory at some offset, DOS goes through this list and adds the chosen offset to each of the addresses it contains, making all far pointers point to the correct locations again.</p>

  <p>When loading these code overlays, the same problem of relocation will exist, and the <code>REL</code> files likely contain the needed information to facilitate their proper relocation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When looking at the different versions of the installed game, we can see that the resources they are bundled with are indeed different.
This finally resolves the first of our side mysteries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigaton 3 complete!</strong>
Depending on the chosen graphics mode, more or fewer assets are included, and each asset can come in two variants, the uncompressed version (e.g. <code>TITLE.MGS</code>), and a compressed version (e.g. <code>TITLE.PMG</code>), indicated by prepending a <code>P</code> to its extension.
The “fast loading” versions of the installation bundle the uncompressed resources, while the floppy version contains the packed versions, providing a trade-off between speed of loading the assets at runtime and the size they take up on disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s difficult to imagine nowadays, but hard drive space was a serious concern back then, and the additional kilobytes the unpacked asstes take up could matter a lot.</p>

<p>However, it seems that even in the fast-loading versions, not all assets are actually uncompressed.
Specifically some of the code overlays stay packed even there, presumably as a means to keep them obfuscated even when fast loading is selected during installation.
However, through disassembly we already know where the resources are loaded now, so using a debugger with appropriate breakpoints, we can easily dump the uncompressed versions for these as well out of the program memory, without needing to understand how the compression of the resources actually works.
(If you are still curious how the compression works, I did end up disassembling it to find that it’s a surprisingly sophisticated custom variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate">DEFLATE</a> compression.
You can find a JS re-implementation of it <a href="https://github.com/MrWint/winter/blob/70da5ba230a2161955d2fb9094f3d47bdea46026/patcher/patcher.js#L79">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Conveniently, the game also provides us with a fairly easy way to check whether we extracted all the resources correctly.
It turns out the game is more flexible with where it tries to load the resources from, and not only checks the embedded resources in the binary, but also checks for individual files of the same name, in the root folder or a subfolder called “ART”.
As long as the resource can be found in any of these places, it will use it.
So by writing a program to extract all these recources into their own files and placing them in the ART subfolder, and then manually modifying the binary to delete all embedded resources, we can make the game use our extracted assets instead.
Doing this and running the game, it is indeed still working, confirming that our extracted resources are accurate and we’re not missing anything else coming from the binary file.</p>

<h2 id="combining-all-overlays">Combining all overlays</h2>

<p>So now we finally have all the code comprising the business logic of the game, but they are spread out over 17 files, the main executable and 16 overlays, making them very annoying to work with.
What we would like is one single binary with all the code in it, making it much easier to analyze.
To achieve this, we can try to embed the overlays into the binary, essentially undoing the overlaying and having all of them loaded at once side-by-side.
Even more, doing this allows us to undo the replacement of the function calls with overlay interrupts, eliminating <code>int 3fh</code> altogether and making the automatic analysis by common disassemblers much more accurate.
Available RAM is obviously not a concern anymore today, but we will still need to stay within the 640kB limit DOS imposes.
Luckily, all overlays combined are only around 100kB in size, so together with the main binary of 168kB it should still leave enough room to load the assets as needed, especially since it won’t need to reserve heap space anymore loading the overlays.</p>

<p>Actually fusing the binaries together is not that easy unfortunately.
My first idea of just concatenating all overlays onto the main binary in memory and baking in the relocations to make them all connect sadly wouldn’t work, because of the stack and how dynamic memory allocations work.
The main binary is set up in a way where all code segments come first, then the data segment holding all the work memory the program uses, and lastly the stack segment.
Trying to append the overlays to this will always create some issues: Adding them before the data segment would mean we need to re-write all references to it throughout the code, which are hard to identify because the line between the data and stack areas are fuzzy and the code might do some pointer arithmetic that relies on the relative positions of the segments.
Adding the overlays after data segment by moving the stack back is also impossible, because the game does some weird shenanigans where it sets the stack segment to equal the data segment, adjusting the stack pointer accordingly to compensate.
This is probably useful as an invariant for optimization, but also means that the data and stack segments need to be close together in memory to allow that.
And finally, placing it after the stack, where they are typically loaded using the overlay manager, has problems as well because it would conflict with heap allocations.</p>

<blockquote>
  

  <p>Memory management worked completely differently back in the DOS days compared to now.
While modern operating systems all work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a> where each program has its own address space completely to itself, and the operating system translates them to the physical RAM addresses, DOS programs ran in what is called 16-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode">Real Mode</a>, which uses the actual physical addresses directly.
That means programs had direct control over the entire RAM of the system, and could just read and write to it as they pleased.
This worked, mostly because you could only run one DOS program at a time anyway, so they didn’t need to share memory with others.</p>

  <p>So allocating memory really didn’t mean much since it was all yours anyway, and programs typically started out with “owning” the entire memory space.
DOS still provided an allocator, but in order to use it your program first needed to deallocate some of the memory space and give it back to DOS, so that new blocks can be allocated in this space.
This game does this, and in order to determine how much it can free up, it performs some calcuations based on the addresses it happens to be loaded into.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by just appending the overlays, we would interfere with the allocated memory, and while we could try to patch the program to avoid this, it may cause other unexpected side effects.</p>

<p>The solution to this conundrum, as always obvious only in hindsight, is to not add the overlays after the main program, but before it.
Since programs are created to be location-independent and can work anywhere in memory, moving it back in order to make space for the overlays can be done completely safely.
And since the overlays are normally heap allocated and can be anywhere in relation to the main program, there is no reason why that anywhere couldn’t be also before the main program.</p>

<p>To test this concept, I first created a new binary which only padded out the beginning of the binary by the needed amount without actually placing the overlays into it.
This can be done without needing to disassemble its contents at all, just using the relocation information in the MZ header to identify all the places where addresses need to be adjusted, and updating the header information to push the segments backwards.
The resulting binary still works perfectly, proving not only that the concept works, but also that the remaining memory is sufficient for everything else the game still needs to load.</p>

<p>In a second step, we can now place all the overlay code in the newly available space, and wire it up.
For each call of the <code>int 3fh</code> interrupt, we can extract which overlay and which location in the overlay it would normally go to, and replace it with a direct <code>far call</code> to that address in the now-embedded overlays.</p>

<p>The overlays themselves also need to be adjusted using their relocation information, with a small additional caveat: within the overlays there are two types of relocations, the addresses that point back into the main program, and the addresses which point to other areas within the same overlay.
The game contains special logic to handle both cases when it loads the overlays, which we need to replicate here, by checking which area of memory an address points to before applying the relocations.</p>

<p>We also need to append all the relocation information for the overlays to the relocation table of the main program, because the new combined binary can of course still be loaded into memory at any location, so the addresses need to be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>What we end up with is a completely self-contained binary, which does not need to load any more overlays to work, and which doesn’t contain any overlay interrupts anymore.
Together with the extracted art assets in separate files, we now have an unpacked and unobfuscated, still perfactly playable, version of the game.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that this was not guaranteed to actually work.
Replacing the overlay interrupts with function calls has the same behavior, but the overlay manager itself which is now sidestepped has additional side effects which could be critical for the game to work.
One notable instance of this in the game is the logic it uses to unload overlays: To detect which memory addresses to deallocate, it inspects the actual code of the program, parses the interrupt call opcodes, and extracts the information out of it in order to determine which overlay is affected.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>seg000:D91F maybe_unload_overlay_for_call:
seg000:D91F                 push    bp                      ; save base pointer register on the stack, to restore it later
seg000:D920                 mov     bp, sp                  ; set base pointer to current stack pointer. This means all arguments are some fixed offset from bp
seg000:D922                 les     bx, [bp+6]              ; Read the far pointer that was provided as an argument, and store it in es:bx
seg000:D925                 cmp     byte ptr es:[bx], 0CDh  ; Check if at the given address is a CD byte, which is an int instruction
seg000:D929                 jz      short unload            ; if it is any int instruction, proceed (doesn&#39;t check what interrupt it actually is)
seg000:D92B                 jmp     short skip_unloading
seg000:D92D ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
seg000:D92D unload:
seg000:D92D                 mov     bl, es:[bx+2]           ; Read the overlay index following the int instruction to know which overlay to unload
seg000:D931                 call    unload_overlay          ; unload the overlay
seg000:D934
seg000:D934 skip_unloading:
seg000:D934                 pop     bp                      ; restore the base pointer stored at the start of the function
seg000:D935                 retf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Luckily, the game has built-in fallbacks to skip this step if the code locations don’t actually contain an interrupt but instead a far call.
Presumably, because it was not known ahead of time which pieces of code would end up in which overlay, they couldn’t know for sure which calls would end up being interrupts instead so they needed to handle both cases.
For us this is lucky because it means that even after replacing all interrupts with function calls, the overlay management code can handle it correctly and doesn’t try to unload our baked-in overlays.</p>

<h2 id="the-anti-debugger-check---part-1-obfuscation-and-assembly-trickery">The anti-debugger check - Part 1: obfuscation and assembly trickery</h2>

<p>With all the prep work done, we can now take a look at the inner workings of the game in earnest, starting with looking at the copy protection and the claims of improperly cracked versions causing gameplay issues.
Besides the main code wheel protection, the game actually has another defense mechanism, an anti-debugger check.
That anti-debugger check consists of two parts.</p>

<p>The first and simplest one is that the game checks for the existence of known debuggers in its path.
It tries to open three files with the file names <code>NU-MEGA</code>, <code>SOFTICE1</code> and <code>TDHDEBUG</code>, and if any of these exist, the game will not let you get past the main menu.
As you might guess, these names correspond to popular DOS-based debuggers, so if it detects you are using any of these, it will refuse operation.
The names of these files is obfuscated in the code using the xor operation, similar to the resource file names, and the check is buried inbetween other code initializing the intro sequence, but by logging the file IO the program performs they are easy to spot.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>very misleading</strong> piece of code that would make any malware developer jealous.
At first glance, it appears to read the current time and process it, and then write a constant <code>4A52h</code> to register cx and later into <code>debugger_check_result_4E62A</code>.
However, the <code>process_current_time_result</code> does some weird things instead.
For one, most of the operations (I marked them with question marks) don’t actually contribute anything, they are purely there to confuse you.
The operation that actually matters and is trying to hide is the modification of the base pointer at <code>seg010:003F</code>.
This, in combination with the instruction at <code>seg010:0054</code>, modify the return address of the function, increasing it by 6.
This means instead of returning at <code>seg010:000E</code> like it should, it will instead return at <code>seg010:0014</code>, skipping setting cx to the constant value.
So the value that is actually propagated into <code>debugger_check_result_4E62A</code> is the <code>detected_debugger_binary</code> which was loaded into cx, all the other operations are just misdirection.</p>

<p>This kind of misdirection is clearly intended to make disassembly deliberately harder and stop people from reverse engineering the copy protections.
We will see more of it as we move on.</p>

<h2 id="the-anti-debugger-check---part-2-modern-computers-are-too-fast">The anti-debugger check - Part 2: Modern computers are too fast</h2>

seg000:035B                 mov     debugger_check_result, ax
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These two moves are the second debugger check the game does, which is more technical and based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8253">Intel 8253</a> timer chip.</p>

<p>The first move is performed inside a timer interrupt handler which the game installs, and which is triggered by the aforementioned timer chip.
Later during the initialization, the game then runs the second move of the flag to its final location, which is ultimately the one that is checked to decide whether you passed or failed.
That means that this timer interrupt is expected to be triggered at the right moment, after the initial known debugger check has been performed, but before the value is looked up later during initialization.
If the timer is triggered too early or too late with respect to the initialization, the the check won’t pass.
This check would prevent you from stepping through the initialization code, because the timer interrupt will fire too early, or emulate it in some way that doesn’t consider hardware interrupts.</p>

<p>For modern DOS emulators like DOSBox, this is not a problem and they are accurate enough to be able to pass the check easily.
The main issue arises from modern computers being <em>too fast</em>: if your emulation speed is too high, especially if you use the fast-loading version of the game, it breezes through the initialization so fast that it is done before the timer interrupt could trigger, making you fail the check.
The simple solution to this problem therefore is to slow down the emulator before starting the game.
After it is in the main menu, you can speed it up again without adverse effects.
Especially our home-cooked fully unpacked version loads so blazingly fast, that I need to slow down the emulator to a crawl in order to still pass the check.
This is because unpacking the resources from the executable is itself much slower than loading individual files, even if they are not compressed, because it needs to linearly scan through the whole resource list for every resource, whereas the (emulated) file IO takes no time at all.</p>

<p>Slowing down the emulator each time to pass the check gets annoying quickly though.
Luckily, the debugger check is done in a single place, and is easily removed without any adverse effects, by modifying the conditional jump at <code>seg000:0D47</code> to be an unconditional jump instead.
We have now partially cracked the game, hurray!
That was the appetizer though, the main course is still to come and it’s a doozy.</p>

<h2 id="the-code-wheel-check---a-honey-pot-for-crackers">The code wheel check - A honey pot for crackers</h2>

<p>The code wheel protection is in principle less technical and more straight-forward: The game reads the number you enter, it then looks up what the answer should have been, and checks whether they match.
Thanks to our fully unpacked executable, finding where this check is made is as simple as finding the error message (“That ticket number is incorrect.  Try again.”) in the binary, and looking for references to it, places in the code where it is used.
Placing debugger breakpoints on this function and stepping through it lets us identfy which sections are roughly responsible for which parts of the process.</p>

<p>Through this process, we can identify the heart of the protection: a function which takes the randomly generated code wheel configuration and the entered ticket number as an input, and decides whether it was entered correctly or not.
It doesn’t do any assembly trickery, but it contains some unnecessary operations as misdirection.
We can translate it to some more compact pseudo code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>code_wheel_check_answer(city_index, flag_index, country_index, discipline_index, ticket_number):  # at seg007:0260
    # determine how high the slot cutout for the chosen city is on the inner wheel, values 0(innermost) - 5(outermost)
    slot_height = slot_height_table[city_index]
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A890 = ticket_number

    # determine slot position relative to chosen discipline, values 0-11 clockwise
    slot_position = (city - ((city + 1) &gt;&gt; 2)) - discipline_index
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A892 = ticket_number
    if slot_position &lt; 0:
        slot_position += 12

    # determine which sector of the outer wheel is under the slot
    flag_wheel_sector = (flag_index + slot_position) % 12
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A894 = ticket_number

    # do unnecessary operations as misdirection
    rand = random_number()
    alloc = allocate_memory(rand % 1000)
    deallocate_memory(alloc)

    # determine which sector of the middle wheel is under the slot
    country_wheel_sector = (country_index + slot_position) % 12

    # read expected answer from obfuscated table
    obfuscated_ticket = country_wheel_data[country_wheel_sector * 6 + slot_height]
    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A898 = ticket_number
    if obfuscated_ticket == 0xa283:  # hole in the middle wheel, use outer wheel data instead
        obfuscated_ticket = flag_wheel_data[flag_wheel_sector * 6 + slot_height]

    code_wheel_ticket_number_4A89C = ticket_number
    return ticket_number ^ 0xa283 == obfuscated_ticket
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from the random memory allocation and deallocation providing some red herrings, the actual checking logic is fairly straight-forward and directly simulates how the physical code wheel functions.
It considers how the discs are rotated, and then checks which number will be visible on the wheel based on a table of all the possible answers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But besides the immediate check, it also places the ticket number into 5 different places in memory.
Those 5 memory locations are where it gets interesting, because looking at where they are used, they all re-appear in the same location:</p>

<p>In this code snippet, the 5 copies of the ticket number are modified in various ways to create 6 new values derived from it, with some arbitrary opertaions to make them all different.
Each of these six values is used some specific place elsewhere in the code, where it is compared against some reference value.
If we try to find out where those reference values come from, what we find it a second copy of the code wheel answer checking routine from above, complete with a second instance of the table containing all correct answers!
The only difference between the two is that is uses a different value to xor the ticket numbers with, using <code>0xc514</code> instead of <code>0xa283</code>.
Afterwards, the same arbitrary operations are applied to them to create the 6 reference values.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side investigaton 2 complete!</strong></p>

  <p>The hidden copy protection checks are real!
The game performs more hidden code wheel checks throughout the game, in each of these 6 locations.
If the main code wheel check is merely skipped, these hidden checks will fail and the game knows you tried to circumvent the copy protection.
When that happens, it will mess with the game in more subtle ways, to sabotage your illegitimate play session.
This is a sneaky additional layer of copy protection, where if you try to crack the game and remove the obvious checks, you might not even realize these additional checks exist, unless you pick up on the gameplay alterations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To find out what gameplay alterations the game performs when the checks fail, the easiest way is to set breakpoints at each of these locations, and then play the various disciplines waiting for them to trigger.
This lets us easily discover what each of the hidden checks do.</p>

<p>Even better, thanks to the replay feature, we can record a replay with a proper version, and then play it back in a version where the hidden checks activate, in order to see what difference they make on the same set of inputs.</p>

<h3 id="ski-jump">Ski Jump</h3>

<p>One of the most obvious changes we find in the skip jump event: When the copy protection check fails, any attempt land a ski jump beyond a certain distance fails.
More specifically, beyond a distance of 86.7m, the game won’t recognize you pressing Enter to land your jump anymore:</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/ski_jump_success.webp" alt="Ski jump success"/>

</p>

<h3 id="speed-skating">Speed Skating</h3>

<p>This is the second very obvious change: In the third lap in speed skating, the game won’t allow you to turn forcing you to crash into the wall:</p>

</p>

<h3 id="biathlon">Biathlon</h3>

<p>In Biathlon, the copy protection check happens during the shooting sections.
If the check fails, it will move your shot by a random amount to the top right, on the second and fourth target in each segment:</p>

</p>

<h3 id="downhill">Downhill</h3>

<p>The Downhill event also has a copy protection check.
It is activated partway into the run, and if it fails it changes the physics behavior to lower the gravity, making you fly off the track:</p>

</p>

<h3 id="bobsled">Bobsled</h3>

<p>The alteration in the Bobsled event is probably the most subtle.
When the copy protection check fails, after the first couple of turns, the physics change to give you more drag, slowing you down more than usual:</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/bobsled_success.webp" alt="Bobsled success"/>

</p>

<h3 id="luge">Luge</h3>

<p>The last of the copy protection checks is the most drastic.
During the Luge event, if you are close to the end of the track with a time of below 57.7s, the game just instantly forfeits your run, preventing you from finishing it:</p>

<p><img src="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/writeup/luge_failed.webp" alt="Luge failure"/>
</p>



<p>Now that we know what a failed copy protection check looks like, we can check each of the  game versions and cracks we found to see whether they work correctly.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <strong>ALL OF THEM, except for one, FAIL THE COPY PROTECTION CHECK!
That includes even the official releases: Both the 1996 US release and the 2020 GOG release are broken.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take a look under the hood of each of them and see what they do</p>

<h3 id="the-gog-version-2020">The GOG version (2020)</h3>

<p>The GOG version comes with a pre-patched binary, which is based on the installed VGA+EGA fast-load version of the original 1991 release.
When looking for what has been changed, beside a couple of padding bytes that do nothing, there are only 2 bytes that are different:</p>

<p>The first is at position 0x12bcdd in the file, which corresponds to offset 0xd47 in overlay 1.
That is the location of the debugger check, and if does the exact same modification we did above ourselves: it changes the jump instruction from a conditional <code>je</code> (0x74) to an unconditional <code>jmp</code> (0xeb), skipping the debugger check.</p>

<p>The other modification is similarly simple and happens at position 0x12bca4 in the file, which corresponds to offset 0xd0e in overlay 1.
This is where the code wheel check is started from, and it replaces the initial <code>cmp</code> opcode (0x83) with a simple <code>retn</code> opcode (0xc3), returning immediately and skipping the code wheel check.</p>

<p>But as we saw, simply skipping the code wheel will trigger the hidden copy protection checks, and the GOG version makes no attempt to circumvent these, causing the game to be broken.</p>

<h3 id="the-unknown-cracked-version">The unknown cracked version</h3>

<p>The second of the pre-patched binaries we found, is based on the VGA fast-load version instead.
It has only one meaningfully change compared to the original.
At position 0x122b42, which corresponds to offset 0x406 in overlay 1, it replaces a <code>call</code> instruction with <code>nop</code>s (0x90).
That function is the one leading to the code wheel check, so it is very similar to the GOG version, it just skips the function entirely instead of calling it and then immediately returning from it.
The effects are of course also the same: It trips the hidden copy protections and the game behavior is broken.</p>

<h3 id="the-the-humble-guys-crack-1991">The “The Humble Guys” crack (1991)</h3>

<p>Instead of a pre-patched binary, this crack comes in the form of a program <code>WG.COM</code> which you run separately before the main executable.
It’s only 366 bytes in size, and when we disassemble it we see this (with some unimportant parts omitted):</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The crack works by overriding interrupt handlers and injecting its own code into them.
It first overrides the main DOS interrupt <code>int 21h</code>, and looks for a specfic interrupt the game triggers during initialization, at which point it overrides the overlay manager interrupt <code>int 3fh</code> as well.
The reason it needs to do this in two steps is that the <code>int 3fh</code> interrupt is only installed during runtime, so it can only be overridden afterwards.
Why it is looking for that specific random interrupt is beyond me, since there were way more obvious targets, like the interrupt that actually installs the <code>int 3fh</code> handler.</p>

<p>In the overlay manager interrupt, it then looks for one very specific invocation, by checking the register values and return address.
That specific invocation happens from offset 0xd26 in overlay 1, where it tries to load and perform the code wheel check.
When it finds this interrupt, it will simply skip executing it, effectively skipping the code wheel check.</p>

<p>This has essentially the same effect as the modifications from the pre-patched binaries above.
It notably also trips the hidden copy protections and breaks the game.</p>

<p>The opcodes are different, but the check that is performed is exactly the same as the one as in the “The Humble Guys” crack.
It checks the same register state, and it even uses the same weirdly specific <code>int 21h</code> invocation to install the overlay manager shim.</p>

<p>If I were to guess, I’d say someone has taken some “inspiration” from the “The Humble Guys” crack when creating this version.
It’s also just shoddily bolted together, with snippets of unused code everywhere.
It looks like someone repurposed some other similarly structured crack, and insterted the specifics of the “The Humble Guys” crack into it to make it work for this game.</p>

<p>It of course therefore also has the same problem: it trips the hidden copy protections and the game is broken.</p>

<p>The basic mechanism is the same as in the other two cracks: it injects its own code into the <code>int 21h</code> and <code>int 3fh</code> interrupt handlers.
But the logic it performs in the <code>int 3fh</code> shim is slightly more complicated, and makes 5 individual modifications.</p>

<p>The first one skips the check for known debuggers which we looked at before, simply skipping its execution.
The second case is for the main anti-debugger check, hooking the interrupt that is called after it is failed and instead skipping over it back to the success case.</p>

<p>The remaining three all deal with the code wheel check.
The third case hooks the interrupt that is called when the code wheel dialog is being opened, and sets <code>si</code> to 1 which will simulate confirming the dialog instantly.
The fourth case is just a helper, it hooks the next interrupt after the dialog is closed, and overrides two bytes at the end of the routine that checks the provided input to inject an artificial <code>int 3f</code> instruction there.
This is not actually a valid overlay interrupt, it is only used as a place for the fifth case to hook into, because there are no other interrupts to hook into in that function.</p>

<p>So finally, the last case is where the code wheel check is actually defeated.
It hooks at the end of the input checking routine, after the game has computed the expected result to compare the input against, and it overrides all 5 copies of the ticket number with the correct value the game expects, then pretends the comparison was successful.
This way, the code wheel check succeeds, and all the hidden code wheel checks the game will perform later will also work because the correct value has been written everywhere.</p>

<p>With this, the game’s copy protection is completely defeated, with no adverse effects during gameplay.</p>

<h2 id="help-i-have-a-broken-version-of-the-game">Help, I have a broken version of the game!</h2>

<p>In case you have bought this game from GOG or have one of the many other broken versions out there, I have created a <a href="https://mrwint.github.io/winter/patcher/index.html">tool to fix the game for you</a>.
You can use the tool to patch your binary to remove the hidden copy protection checks (as well as the debugger and code wheel checks themselves in case they are not removed already), so you can enjoy this game without any limitations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion---what-about-creating-the-perfect-ski-jump">Conclusion - What about creating the perfect ski jump?</h2>

<p>My original goal was to deconstruct the game mechanics, specifically for the ski jumping event, but that quest got so thoroughly side-tracked by all the copy protection related investigations that it moved somewhat into the background.
Now that the copy protection mysteries are solved, I will be able to focus on that, and it will likely end up being its own write-up.</p>
