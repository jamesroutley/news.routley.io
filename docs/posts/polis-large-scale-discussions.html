It is described on the website as:</p><blockquote><p>a real-time system for gathering, analyzing and understanding what large groups of people think in their own words, enabled by advanced statistics and machine learning.</p></blockquote><p>More specifically, Polis is a platform for a <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/conversation" title="conversation">conversation</a>, in which <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/participants" title="participants">participants</a> submit short text statements, or <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/comments" title="comments">comments</a>, (&lt;140 characters) which are then sent out <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/semi-randomly" title="semi-randomly">semi-randomly</a> to other participants to <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/vote" title="vote">vote</a> on by clicking <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/agree" title="agree">agree</a>, <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/disagree" title="disagree">disagree</a> or <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/pass" title="pass">pass</a>.

It works like this:¬† Dozens or thousands of participants submit short statements expressing their views on the question.¬† They also respond to other participants‚Äô statements with Agree, Disagree, or Pass.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As hundreds of these statements and evaluations accumulate, a behind-the-scenes algorithm sorts participants into diverse clusters of like-minded responders.¬† The algorithm then identifies ‚Äúconsensus statements&#34; about which all the diverse clusters agree. At any time, participants can view graphics revealing the whole ecosystem of perspectives as it evolves. If they wish, they can create new statements that respond to what they see in that overview.¬† Over time their statements tend to become more specific and practical.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After days or weeks of this activity, the results - both consensus statements and divisive statements - are usually turned over to a dialogue among diverse stakeholders, citizens or decision-makers to inform and stimulate their creative responses to the question. Activities can be organized through which views from polis exercises and dialogues feed back and forth into each other to generate deepening insight and/or specificity.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Polis has been used with populations ranging from 40 to 40,000 people.¬† It is ideal for discovering unrealized possibilities in complex, conflicted situations involving widely diverse perspectives.</p></blockquote></main></div></div>
