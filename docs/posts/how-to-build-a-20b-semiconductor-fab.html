    <h1>How to build a $20B semiconductor fab</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p>For the last several decades, one avenue of technological progress has towered over nearly everything else: semiconductors. Semiconductors are materials that can have their conductivity varied by many orders of magnitude, which makes it possible to selectively block and allow the flow of electrons. This property makes it possible to manufacture all sorts of electronic devices, not least of which is the digital computer. </p><p><span>As semiconductor technology has advanced over the past several decades, the cost and size of electronic computation has steadily fallen, making the PC, the internet, and mobile phones all possible. Today, semiconductors in the form of </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/" rel="">powerful GPUs</a><span> that can perform enormous numbers of matrix multiplications are the keystone for advancing AI technology. Increasingly available computation to do enormous amounts of search and learning drives progress in things like </span><a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html" rel="">game-playing AI, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs)</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>As Moore’s Law has marched forward, transistors (an electronic switch which is the fundamental building block of integrated circuits) have gotten smaller and cheaper. In 1954, the first transistor radio, the </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna6288916" rel="">TR-1</a><span> had 4 transistors which cost $2.50 apiece ($29.03 in 2024 dollars). Today, an </span><a href="https://lanoc.org/review/cpus/8673-amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d" rel="">AMD Ryzen processor</a><span> with 9.9 billion transistors is </span><a href="https://shop-us-en.amd.com/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-processor/" rel="">on sale for $650</a><span>, or about $0.000000066 per transistor; in other words, since the 1950s the cost of a transistor has fallen by about a factor of 300 million.</span></p><p><span>The same shrinking and cheapening has happened for every semiconductor component. But at the same time, the facilities to manufacture them have become increasingly expensive. In the late 60s and early 70s, a semiconductor fabrication facility (or ‘fab’) cost on the order of $4 million (~$31 million in 2024 dollars). Today, a modern fab can cost $10-$20 billion or more. Intel is building a pair of fabs in Arizona which are projected to cost </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/16/inflation_has_added_50_to/" rel="">$15 billion apiece</a><span>, and Samsung’s fab in Taylor, Texas is projected to cost </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/16/inflation_has_added_50_to/" rel="">$25 billion</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png" width="1456" height="1109" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1109,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>These enormous costs are ultimately due to the same factor that has steadily driven down the cost of semiconductors: Moore’s Law, the observation that the number of components on an integrated circuit tends to double every two years. (There is a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_second_law" rel="">Moore’s Second Law</a><span>, also known as Rock’s Law, which posits that the cost of a semiconductor fab doubles every four years.) The smaller semiconductor components get, the more difficult it is to create the conditions to manufacture them. </span></p><p><span>A modern microchip has features on the order of 50 nanometers in width, or around 1/2000th the width of a human hair.</span><span> Materials are placed in layers a few atoms thin. Creating objects this small requires ultra-precise manufacturing equipment, and a production environment that can screen out as many sources of interference as possible; every rogue speck of dust or tiny fluctuation in electrical voltage. And these conditions must be maintained not in the rarefied conditions of an experimental lab, but in a mass production facility that is producing hundreds of millions of microchips every year. The combination of ultra-precision and high-volume production results in some of the most complex, expensive factories in the world.</span></p><p>To understand why a modern fab is so expensive, we first need to understand the process for manufacturing semiconductors.</p><p><span>If we sliced a computer chip down the middle, and looked very, very closely, we would see that it is composed of a series of layers.

graphic above are the semiconductor components themselves: transistors, capacitors, resistors, diodes, and all the other parts created out of silicon to make a microchip.</span><span> These individual components will be connected together using microscopic metal wires, the layers in the area marked BEOL (back end of line). Because of the enormous number of components in a modern electronic chip, this wiring must be routed on separate layers, which are separated by electrical insulators known as dielectrics. Intel’s current process, for instance, consists of </span><a href="https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/6720/a-look-at-intel-4-process-technology/3/" rel="">15 layers of metal wiring</a><span>. This wiring gets connected together and to the semiconductor components through holes in the layers known as ‘vias.’</span></p><p><span>Chips are made by building up this complex structure one layer at a time. Starting with a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_(electronics)" rel="">wafer </a><span>of extremely pure silicon, layers of material are added, portions of the layer are removed, more material is added (or existing material is modified), and so on, until the entire structure is complete. This fabrication method is known as the </span><a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/invention-of-the-planar-manufacturing-process/" rel="">planar process</a><span>, and it was invented at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959 by Jean Hoerni. It’s what makes integrated circuits, and modern computer technology, possible.</span></p><p>The process for building up the structure of a microchip can be broken down into four basic operations, repeatedly applied: layering, patterning, doping, and heat-treating.</p><h5>Layering</h5><p><span>Layering is used to add an extremely thin layer of material — as little as a </span><a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/10199223" rel="">nanometer or less</a><span>, 1/100,000th the thickness of a human hair — to the surface of the wafer. These layers might be insulators (such as layers of silicon dioxide used to separate components), conductors (such as layers of copper wiring used to connect components) or semiconductors (such as </span><a href="https://www.mks.com/n/silicon-epitaxial-thin-films" rel="">epitaxial thin films of silicon</a><span> which form part of the semiconductor components). Depending on the step in the process and the material being used, different layering techniques might be applied. </span></p><p><span>Deposition methods have also evolved over time as features have shrunk. Current common layering methods include thermal oxidation (exposing wafers to oxygen in a furnace, which creates a thin layer of silicon dioxide on the wafer surface), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (where gaseous chemicals are brought together, depositing their reactants on the surface of the wafer) and sputtering (where a solid material is bombarded with plasma ions, causing atoms to break free and be deposited on the wafer’s surface). The small size of modern semiconductor components demands that these layering methods are capable of extreme precision; modern </span><a href="https://www.asm.com/our-technology-products/ald" rel="">atomic layer deposition</a><span> methods, for instance, are capable of creating a single layer of atoms at a time.</span></p><h5>Patterning</h5><p><span>Patterning is the process of inscribing specific patterns on the wafer, selectively removing material as needed to create electronic components. On modern semiconductors this is done using </span><em>photolithography</em><span>. A wafer is first coated with a thin layer of light-sensitive material called photoresist. Bright light of a specific wavelength is shone through a glass or quartz plate called a </span><a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/mask" rel="">mask</a><span> that has the pattern to be created on the wafer inscribed on it. A mask contains the patterns necessary for a single chip, but a wafer will contain hundreds of individual chips. To expose each one, the mask is moved back and forth over the surface of the wafer using a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper" rel="">stepper or scanner</a><span>. The light that isn’t blocked by the mask passes through and induces a chemical reaction in the photoresist; with positive photoresist, the area exposed to light weakens and becomes soluble; with negative photoresist, the exposed area hardens while the rest of the photoresist remains soluble. In either case, the wafer will be washed after it’s exposed to light, leaving behind a hardened layer of photoresist in the pattern that needs to be applied.</span></p><p>From here, the wafer will be etched: a corrosive chemical will be applied to the wafer, eating away the material exposed by the removed photoresist and inscribing the pattern onto the wafer itself. Etching can be “wet” (by exposing the wafer to liquid chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid) or “dry” (by exposing the wafer to gasses like fluorine which have been energized into a plasma). After etching, the remaining photoresist is removed.</p><h5>Doping</h5><p><span>Doping is the process of introducing very small amounts of impurities into a semiconductor material to change its electrical conductivity.

There are many steps in the process where the wafer is heated or cooled to obtain a specific result. Ion implantation, for instance, results in a damaged silicon crystal structure. This damage is repaired with rapid thermal annealing; thermal lamps heat the wafer to over 1,000 degrees in a matter of seconds, and then the wafer is slowly cooled, repairing the crystal structure. Heating is also used during the lithography process to “bake” and harden the liquid photoresist.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png" width="758" height="285" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:285,&#34;width&#34;:758,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Xiao 2012.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to these four basic processes, semiconductor manufacturing involves many other supporting processes. One key supporting process is polishing: because a microchip is built up from dozens of individual layers, variations in layer thickness will propagate over time as more layers are added, causing problems if left unaddressed. To combat this, wafers are frequently polished during the fabrication process using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to smooth out the wafer surface. CMP is also used to fill holes created by etching, by applying a layer of material to the entire wafer and then polishing away the material above the hole.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Even getting semiconductor devices to work at all required paying extremely close attention to chemical concentrations and rogue impurities. When semiconductors were being researched at Bell Labs in the 1940s, mysterious component failures were eventually traced to researchers who had touched copper door knobs; the tiny number of copper atoms that migrated from the door to the workers hands was enough to ruin their work material. Early semiconductor manufacturers found that their processes were influenced by, among other things, the phase of the moon, whether workers had recently visited the bathroom, and female workers’ menstrual cycles. </p><p><span>And as semiconductor features have gotten smaller, the problem has only gotten more difficult. As transistors shrank, Intel found that even the most innocuous equipment change — using a slightly longer pipe or cable, for instance — could cause process disruptions to new fabs and cause months or years of lower yields. To combat this, Intel instituted a process known as </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/630771" rel="">Copy EXACTLY!</a><span> New fabs would be identical to existing fabs to the extent possible, right down to the color and brand of the paint on the walls.</span></p><p>A modern semiconductor fab must thus create a world of incredible precision and predictability. Every possible effect that might disrupt the manufacturing process, no matter how small, must be screened off, any subtle deviation hunted down and eliminated. And this control must be maintained in a mass production environment, where hundreds of thousands of wafers and millions of individual chips (each one with billions of transistors) are produced each year.</p><p>To create this environment, a modern semiconductor fab typically consists of four levels. The heart of the fab is the cleanroom level; the factory floor where the fabrication process actually takes place. Below the cleanroom is the sub-fab, one or more levels (typically two) that contain the ducts, piping, wiring, and equipment needed to support the cleanroom operations. And above the cleanroom level is an interstitial space with fans and filters used for recirculating air into the cleanroom below.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png" width="592" height="512.1517386722866" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:821,&#34;width&#34;:949,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:592,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Cross section of a fab, via Intel.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The cleanroom level contains the process tools: the individual pieces of equipment that perform the various operations discussed above.

In most modern fabs, this consists of a ceiling-mounted rail system (though some fabs, particularly older ones, may use floor-based automated guided vehicles instead). Specially designed vehicles pick up FOUPs at one process tool, and drop them off at the next one. The large number of manufacturing steps means that it can take months for a wafer to go through the entire process. This, combined with the large number of wafers a fab produces a month, means that at any given time there are tens of thousands of wafers at various points in the production process, traveling back and forth between tools or being stored waiting for their turn. Over the course of the production process a wafer will travel many miles back and forth between different production tools. Because of this, the rail transport systems must be extensive, with miles of track and hundreds or thousands of transport vehicles.

such as phosphine and arsine for doping, are highly toxic. Others, such as the silane used in some CVD processes, are pyrophoric (meaning they ignite spontaneously with air.) One chemical, the chlorine trifluoride used for </span><a href="https://www.samaterials.com/chlorine-trifluoride-for-in-situ-cleaning-of-cvd-chambers.html" rel="">cleaning CVD chambers</a><span>, is so toxic and so prone to spontaneous ignition (it&#39;s capable of setting wet sand on fire) that </span><a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/sand-won-t-save-you-time" rel="">some chemists refuse to work with it</a><span>. These chemicals require special handling and leak detection systems, backup power systems, and specially designed fire protection systems due to the hazard they represent.</span></p><p><span>The sub-fab also contains the exhaust systems for handling the various byproducts generated by the process tools. To prevent byproducts (particularly ammonia) from reacting with each other, several separate exhaust systems must be used. Many of the processes require abatement equipment (which will burn off any harmful byproducts) or </span><a href="https://www.mks.com/n/exhaust-gas-treatment" rel="">scrubbers</a><span> to remove hazardous material. This equipment might be mounted to the process tool itself, or be part of a centralized exhaust system.</span></p><p>In addition to chemical handling and exhaust equipment, the sub-fab contains electrical boxes, transformers, fans, air handlers, chillers, RF generators, heat exchangers, and all the other equipment needed to keep the fab tools operating. Sub-fabs are often divided into a “clean” sub-fab (where the air from the cleanroom recirculates), and a separate “dirty” or utility sub-fab below that. And while the level of control can be relaxed somewhat in the sub-fab (workers don’t need to wear bunny suits in it), variations and potential disruptions must still be minimized. Even slight changes in voltage, pressure, or vibration, or the smallest particle emitted by the piping, can negatively affect the manufacturing process.</p><p><span>Achieving this means that sub-fab equipment must be manufactured with much more stringent requirements and much tighter tolerances than in conventional manufacturing. Things like pipes, ducts, pumps, and other material handling equipment are stainless steel and </span><a href="https://blog.cpsgrp.com/fabtechinc/fluoropolymer-coating-and-stainless-steel-duct" rel="">teflon-coated</a><span>. The interior of pipes must be </span><a href="https://www.handytube.com/technical-resources/blog/semiconductor-fabs-can-get-electropolished-stainless-steel-tubing-quickly" rel="">electropolished</a><span> to prevent particles from being emitted or providing places for contaminants to accumulate, and pipes must be joined using special </span><a href="https://blog.morganitech.com/the-power-of-orbital-welding-in-the-semiconductor-industry" rel="">orbital welding</a><span> methods to prevent leaks or contamination. Often sub-fab equipment and material must itself be manufactured in a cleanroom using </span><a href="https://www.emersonautomationexperts.com/2023/valves-actuators-regulators/specialized-control-valves-for-semiconductor-ultrapure-water-applications/" rel="">specialized manufacturing procedures</a><span>, and transported to the jobsite </span><a href="https://www.fitokgroup.com/tmp/file/Ultra_High_Purity_Process_Specification_FC-03.pdf" rel="">double-wrapped in plastic bags</a><span> to prevent contamination during transport.

Workers must follow specially-designed “clean construction” protocols to keep materials clean, minimize particle intrusion and to ensure the cleanroom can operate successfully when it&#39;s completed.

This is not all that different from other </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/which-city-builds-skyscrapers-the" rel="">large commercial building projects</a><span>, and far faster than some other tightly controlled process facilities, like nuclear power plants. </span></p><p><span>In the US, however, fabs are built slower than elsewhere in the world. Fab construction time in the US has increased from just over 650 days on average in the 1990s to over 900 days on average in the 2010s, compared to around 600-700 days in Asian countries, in part because of </span><a href="https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/what-environmental-regulations-mean-fab-construction" rel="">increasingly stringent environmental review processes</a><span>.

But the fab exists to provide the necessary environment for the thousands of process tools to function, and it&#39;s these tools that are by far the most expensive part of building a new fab. Roughly 70-80% of the cost of a new fab will be the process tools that go in it. (One side effect of this is that upgrading an existing fab to use a more advanced process node can cost an </span><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-euv-tools-order" rel="">appreciable fraction</a><span> of the cost of a totally new fab.)</span></p><p><span>The equipment proportion of fab cost has risen over time.

For modern semiconductor fabs, each new process node increases fab cost by about 30%. There are two main drivers of this increase. One is that more advanced process nodes require more expensive equipment. ASML’s EUV lithography machines, for instance, are far more expensive than the deep ultraviolet machines that they replaced. The second main cost driver is that as transistors continue to shrink, more masks and process steps are required to manufacture them. Connecting transistors together requires more layers of metal wires, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_field-effect_transistor" rel="">FinFETS</a><span> (transistors made from “fins” that project up from the wafer’s surface) require more layering steps than the simpler transistors they replaced. (EUV, however, temporarily reversed this trend, as it made it possible to do in one mask what previously took two or more, and thus reduced the number of process steps.) More layers and more process steps means more equipment: if product A has twice the manufacturing steps as product B, it will require twice as much equipment to produce if the output level is to remain constant.</span></p><p>But there are also other cost drivers beyond these two factors. As semiconductor features have gotten smaller, the silicon wafers used to produce them have gotten larger. Chips were produced on 50 mm wafers in the 1970s, but today’s leading-edge fabs use much larger 300 mm wafers (a transition to 450mm wafers was planned but never executed), and larger wafers tend to require more expensive equipment. The switch to 300 mm wafers, for instance, necessitated much greater use of automated material handling equipment, as the wafers were too heavy to carry around in FOUPs by hand. These handling systems, in turn, required larger structures with taller cleanroom ceilings.</p><p><span>The ever-increasing cost of fabs has created a shift in the structure of the semiconductor industry. When fabs were cheaper to build, any chip producer could afford to have their own fabs. But as fab costs increased, it became more and more burdensome for manufacturers to operate cutting edge manufacturing facilities due to the high costs, and fewer manufacturers had the production volume to spread those costs over. The “efficient scale” of a 150 mm wafer fab is around 10,000 wafers a month, but for a 300 mm logic wafer fab, that jumps to 40,000 wafers. (And memory wafer fabs will be even larger, at </span><a href="https://www.asianometry.com/p/the-economics-of-tsmcs-giga-fabs" rel="">120,000 wafers per month</a><span>. Thus only a very small number of companies (currently TSMC, Samsung, and Intel) attempt to operate leading-edge nodes, and the industry has shifted to a “fabless” model where companies like Apple and Nvidia design their chips but have them manufactured by “foundries” like TSMC. By pooling the orders of many different chip companies, the foundries can achieve the scale necessary to afford cutting edge fabs.</span></p><p><span>The enormous expense of a modern semiconductor fab boils down to the intersection of two things. One is that semiconductor fabs are mass production factories, with modern “gigafabs” producing hundreds of millions of chips per year, each chip containing billions of transistors.</span><span> The second is that producing semiconductors requires almost unfathomable levels of precision. Manipulating huge volumes of matter on the atomic level, repeatedly and reliably, 24 hours a day 365 days a year, is an enormously expensive undertaking.</span></p><p><em><strong><span>For those interested in reading more about semiconductor manufacturing, a reading list of the best books and other sources I found on the topic is </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/semiconductor-fab-reading-list" rel="">available here</a><span> for paid subscribers.</span></strong></em></p></div></div></div>
