	<p>I have a <a href="https://www.logicguynyc.com/">good friend</a> who loves the lost cultural institution of the after-dinner speech. For his birthday party this year, he encouraged his guests to prepare and present their own talks in what amounted to a mini conference— it was a blast! I decided to throw my hat into the ring, and the result is reproduced below. It’s a strange piece of writing: an experiment in rhetoric, a test-bench for ideas arising from a reading group on climate movements, an earnest pastiche filled with meta-in-jokes. This is the sort of throwaway piece I’d normally just leave on some backup drive, but I’ve received enough interest to make the decision to post it here. If anything, it’s a nice reminder to myself that putting something out there is often more important than polishing it to brilliance.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This talk is, at some level, about climate change. But the
real aim is to let you see yourself, and the world around you, a little
differently; and to give you new tools or lenses to help envision a
better future. Last year marked a dramatic jump-shift in the record for
maximum global average temperature. We all know that carbon emissions
from human activity are dangerously warming the planet, and that the
primary way we&#39;ve managed to put all those troublesome greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere is by digging up and burning so-called “fossil fuels”
for energy. But to label these substances merely “fuels” is deceptive,
as our relationship goes far deeper than that: in some sense, fossil
fuels are the foundation of human life as we know it.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I mean. First, some background: “fossil fuels” are named as
such because they are composed primarily of plants that lived and died
between 360 million and 290 million years ago. Their biomass sank to the
bottom of swamps and was transformed through intense geological
processes into energy-dense molecules called hydrocarbons. Now, let&#39;s
take a bit of a jump and talk about steel. Steel is awesome: it&#39;s
strong, ductile, wear-resistant, rigid, totally recyclable, and
therefore great for making things. Ships, bicycles, buildings, bridges,
pots and pans– it&#39;s so useful that humans produce more steel by far
than we do any other substance on earth, aside from concrete. So how do
you make steel? Well, basically the most practical way to do it is you
take iron ore, you seal it in a furnace with some coal, and you ignite
it. The heat from burning the coal melts the ore, and the carbon
monoxide from the burning reacts and combines with the iron to form
steel. So steel is <em>made from</em> hydrocarbons. Next, let&#39;s talk about
food: arguably even more awesome than steel. Once you work your way down
the food chain, most of what we eat comes from plants. And plants need
nitrogen in order to grow, and in order to sustain consistent
agricultural yields we need to manually add nitrogen to the soil, in the
form of fertilizer. Since exhausting the entire global supply of bird
shit for this purpose wasn&#39;t really working out, about 100 years ago we
came up with a way of pulling nitrogen directly out of the atmosphere.
How do you make fertilizer out of thin air? Well, again, you heat it and
combine it with... methane, AKA “natural gas.” So all of our modern
fertilizer, and therefore our entire food system, is built on
hydrocarbons. Let&#39;s see, what else... Plastics? That&#39;s an easy one,
we use them for <em>everything:</em> textiles, foams, paints, coatings, toys,
appliances, packaging. Very much made of hydrocarbons. Roads? Roofs?
Made from bitumen, which is– you guessed it– a hydrocarbon. Maybe you
can see where this is going. Yes, we combust hydrocarbons for energy to
fly our planes and drive our cars and generate heat and electricity, but
that&#39;s only half of the picture; our civilization doesn&#39;t just <em>run
on</em> hydrocarbons, our civilization <em>is</em> hydrocarbons. The kinds of
people who enjoyed Christopher Nolan&#39;s <em>Oppenheimer</em> might call ours
the “Nuclear Age,” but the fact that one of the last serious
applications of nuclear ordinance research was for fracking is telling.
Our entire material existence, starting from an atomic level and
ascending to our love of cars and consumerism, is entirely constituted
and organized around this single limited and sparsely-distributed
geological resource. It is impossible to understand the former without
recognizing the latter. And it doesn&#39;t stop at the tangible level:
society and technology are always mutually interpellated, with our
fossil roots constantly shaping, and in turn being shaped by, our
politics, ideologies, aspirations, and conceptions of the good life.
Neither mind nor body would exist as they do in this moment without
hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>One very abstract way to think about this argument is as if we are no
longer <em>Homo sapiens</em> but have instead become a race of carbon cyborgs.
To use this term, of course, is to invoke Donna Haraway, for whom “the
cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality,
the two joined centers structuring any possibility of historical
transformation.” It&#39;s not every eon that a species manages to
re-engineer the entire basis of its ecological metabolism, after all.
The next obvious line of inquiry is into the <em>nature</em> of this
hypothetical evolutionary step; how, and under what conditions, did such
a change come about? What is the shape of this cyborg, its prostheses,
its sacrificial organs, and how are they distributed through space and
time? While these are interesting and important questions, we must
mostly leave them aside for today. Our concept of “carbon cyborg,” even
in its coarse form, still presents an intriguing subject for analysis–
or perhaps psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Returning to that climate change thing, the undisputed policy consensus
is for decarbonization: since burning fossil fuels causes harm, we need
to stop burning fossil fuels. Under the operating assumption of a human
civilization that only uses hydrocarbons as a thermal energy source,
this seems like a no-brainer: alternatives already exist, just switch
over! So why, then, is the historical record a stream of denial,
resistance, and, above all, unchanged use of hydrocarbons? These
behaviors come across as irrational and self-destructive. However,
consider now our carbon cyborg: hydrocarbons are integral to who and
what they are, so the notion of hydrocarbons causing harm presents a
psychological contradiction. How can that which constitutes the self be
bad for the self?! Suddenly denial and resistance appear rational and
sympathetic. As the impacts of burning hydrocarbons worsen, so too does
the strain of this psychological rift. Maybe the carbon cyborgs develop
a schizophrenic popular climate discourse fixated on both naive
techno-optimism and nihilistic doomerism. Instead of gas turbine
generators, they switch to wind turbines made with far more plastic and
steel. They add solar panels to their roofs and use extremely
energy-intensive chemistry to produce a weak trickle of synthetic fuels
made with carbon pulled from the air rather than the ground. But they
are still carbon cyborgs; their modalities, their ways of life and
material relations, are qualitatively unchanged. They still extract
hydrocarbons as fossil feedstocks, and even still burn fossil fuels,
though perhaps now pumping sunlight-reflecting aerosols into the
stratosphere in an attempt to offset the warming effects. Even if this
path leads to a stable existence instead of merely a delayed form of
auto-annihilation, the carbon cyborgs are left with no true resolution
to their inner dysfunction, and face perpetual risk of breakdown. Theirs
is a world where, as Karl Marx famously put, “the traditions of all dead
generations weigh like a nightmare on the minds of the living.”</p>
<p>The vision I&#39;ve just presented in caricature aligns with the most
optimistic projections of our trajectory through a so-called “green
transition.” To understand this vision is to realize that interventions
like eating less meat or installing heat pumps or exercising shareholder
votes on emissions reporting are necessary steps in the right direction,
but <em>they are not enough:</em> in order to prevent mass death of present and
future generations, we need to change on a deeper level. Though
hydrocarbons may be our lifeblood, they are not in our genetic code; the
carbon cyborg is doomed, but <em>Homo sapiens</em> doesn&#39;t have to be. It is
possible to imagine a life-world that has no fundamental dependency on
hydrocarbons. After all, that&#39;s how things worked just 300 years ago;
and even the industrial revolution, widely held as the inception of the
hydrocarbon era, could have gone differently. Andreas Malm demonstrates
in his book <em>Fossil Capital</em> that the early British industrial plants
where coal-fired steam engines were first widely deployed did not turn
to the technology to surpass limitations on fundamental energy needs:
hydropower was substantially cheaper than coal, and only ever utilized
to about 5% of total accessible watershed capacity in the UK. That&#39;s
not to say that solving the post-hydrocarbon technology question will be
easy, or that it&#39;s even the most difficult part of the equation. Malm
argues that the industrial adoption of coal <em>was</em> primarily fueled by
the re-organization of society and resulting shift in social relations;
outgrowing the carbon cyborg will no doubt require equally radical
changes to our current values and political systems. This work must be
performed by everyone, regarding everything, with the urgency of
outpacing the next heat wave or cyclone. Imagination is the first step;
Ursula LeGuin, an exemplar practitioner, wisely observed that “it is
above all by the imagination that we achieve perception, and compassion,
and hope.” She spent her career fighting against the idea that fantasy
was a luxury, a respite from the problems of the so-called “real;”
indeed, today, perhaps more than ever, fantasy is necessary for our
survival. Fantasy in that the very molecules of our bodies do not have
to be as they are; fantasy in that we can fight the inertia of the
cyborg logics of our existence, and win.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t some saccharine TED talk where I end with a nicely-wrapped
just-so resolution. If anything, I&#39;ve done the opposite: barged up here
and killed the vibes by shouting at you that you need to rethink your
entire existence from the ground up. And you do! But my point is that
that&#39;s not such a bad thing. I can personally think of nothing that
makes me feel more alive. And so I raise my cup, made from hydrocarbons,
full of beer, that is also made from hydrocarbons, and say: To a better
future! Happy birthday, Bryan! <small><code>{\}</code></small>
