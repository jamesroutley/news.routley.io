      <p>Turtle frowned. His already wrinkly face got even more scrunched up. “Do I really have to?” He looked at the Tiny One’s flipper paws bouncing happily in front of him, his chubby butt sat comfortably in Koala’s pouch.</p>
<p>Koala took his flipper and squeezed it. “You’ll still be here, and we will be here. You’ll just do other things for a part of your day.”</p>
<p>“Ionwana”, Turtle grumbled. Koala’s ears wiggled confusedly, she didn’t quite understand. “I don’t wanna”, said Turtle, a little louder, kicking at a rock with his flipper.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Tiny One squawked and smiled at him. Turtle’s frown fought for a second, then it broke up. “You’re right, Tuala. You’re always right. It will be okay.”</p>
