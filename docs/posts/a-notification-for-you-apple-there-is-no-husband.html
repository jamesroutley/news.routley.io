	Here’s a notification for <em>you</em>, Apple: There is no husband.</p>
<p>
	Despite what my iPhone’s frequent notification summaries report, my husband isn’t messy, he isn’t sad and he <em>definitely</em> didn’t take out the garbage—because, again, I don’t have one. Wife? Yes. Husband? No.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-t/">As part of Apple Intelligence</a>, the company rolled out these AI-powered summaries. Instead of scrolling through a mountain of missed alerts, you get little condensed summaries, grouped by app. Great concept, not quite “intelligent” execution.</p>
<p>
	One person received a summary of <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-i/">BBC News notifications that read</a>: “Luigi Mangione shoots himself.” <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-d/">Another got one that said</a>: “Brazilian tennis player, Rafael Nadal, comes out as gay.” Another summary of <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-h/">New York Times notifications</a> said: “Netanyahu arrested.”</p>
<p>
	And then there’s my hubby situation. Summaries of messages from my wife often include the word “husband”—usually when she’s talking about one of our sons. With a tap, you see the original notifications, so the confusion abates quickly, but it can still be shocking to see something so wrong.</p>
<p>
	Here’s what seems to be happening, and what Apple is doing about it.</p>

<p>
	Remember, these generative-AI models don’t know anything; they predict the next word based on patterns and context. With these bundled notifications, there isn’t much to go on. </p>
<p>
	Here’s an example: My wife messaged me about our 7-year-old son’s messy room. Instead, the Apple intelligence summary read: “Expresses frustration with her husband’s messiness and lack of common sense.” The original messages only mentioned “he” or “him,” nothing more.</p>

<p>
	Apple knows this is a problem. On Thursday, the company released the latest developer versions of its iPhone, iPad and Mac software, which temporarily disables notification summaries for <em>all</em> news apps. An Apple spokeswoman said the company is working on improvements and that they will be available in a future software update.</p>
<p>
	In the software, which I’m now testing, the remaining summarised notifications are in italics to better distinguish them from regular notifications. Apple also makes it clearer when you turn on this feature that it will “occasionally make mistakes that could misrepresent the meaning of the original notification.”</p>

	<li>
		Apple’s addressing these issues through updates to its AI tools and is improving the accuracy of its models.</li>

		The company is encouraging people to report these issues while these AI tools are still in beta.</li>

<p>
	Have I done that? No, of course not. He may be messy and lack common sense, but that’s no reason for me to <em>kill</em> my husband!</p>

	TikTok Crackdown Countdown ⏰</p>
</span>
</h2>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>
	This just in! The Supreme Court has <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-u/">OK’d the TikTok shutdown</a>. The judges upheld a federal law requiring Bytedance to sell or shut down the social-media app by this coming Sunday, Jan. 19. Now, the big question: What happens next? Here’s where things stand:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		TikTok could go dark and be removed from app stores—at least temporarily—on Sunday. President-elect Donald Trump and his team are reportedly working to keep the app alive. TikTok CEO Shou Chew plans <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-o/">to attend his inauguration</a> Monday.</li>
	<li>
		The Biden administration has signaled it won’t enforce the ban before leaving office.</li>
	<li>
		However: In the event of a Supreme Court loss (which just happened), TikTok had been planning to shut down the app in the U.S. to comply with the law and avoid exposing companies that sell or distribute the app to legal liability.</li>
	<li>
		The only really sure thing? That squirmish TikTok “refugees” will continue to head Chinese-owned social-media apps <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-b/">RedNote</a> and Lemon8 in protest. The apps have surged in popularity this week.</li>

<p>
	If you haven’t been following, Sonos had quite the mish<em>app</em>. (Come on, that’s a good one!) The company’s redesigned app, <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-n/">introduced in May</a>, broke a lot of key features and generally just pissed off users—especially those who had spent a ton to put Sonos speakers all around their homes. (Ahem, me.) While the company spent the past year scrambling to fix the mess, there’s now real change at the top. <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-p/">CEO Patrick Spence</a> is out, and Tom Conrad, a veteran of Pandora, Snap and Apple, is in. (He was already a Sonos board member.)</p>

	Chatbots are pretty passive: They wait for you to make the first move. Now OpenAI lets paying subscribers with Plus, Pro or Team plans schedule ChatGPT to reach out to you. Just this morning, it suggested I have a bowl of Greek yogurt and berries for breakfast.</p>
<p>
	Open the app and select the model called “GPT-4o with scheduled tasks.” It’s available on Web, iOS, Mac and Android—but not Windows yet. Then send a message with what you’d like it to do and when.</p>
<p>
	I went with “Message me at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow with a healthy breakfast option.” Cordilia asked it to start a casual conversation in Spanish at 8 a.m. every day.</p>

	 IBM clocks were seemingly in every school classroom when I was growing up. The clocks were synchronized to a master clock in the principal’s office, and whenever the master clock’s time was adjusted, the hands of the clocks in every room would move with it. The loud noise the mechanical gears made forced the teacher to stop talking until it was finished.</p>
<p>
	This clock was a gift from a neighbor about 30 years ago. He was cleaning out his garage and, knowing I worked for IBM, thought I’d be interested in having it. I’ve always loved the long and varied history of the company, and this throwback to a simpler tech era.</p>
