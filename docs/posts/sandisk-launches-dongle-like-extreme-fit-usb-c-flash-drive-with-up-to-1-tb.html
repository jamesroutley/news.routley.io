	<p>Sandisk has introduced the Extreme Fit USB-C flash drive, and this compact storage solution starts at $15.99. Unlike traditional pen drive models, the company has opted for a design that&#39;s similar to the dongles of wireless mice and keyboards. Such a design makes the drive not stick out much from the port when connected to a device.
</p>
<p>As for the performance, Sandisk is promising USB 3.2 Gen 1 speed. That is, the Type-C flash drive can offer a read speed of up to 400 MB/s, but this rating is only applicable for the options starting from 128 GB. As for the base offering with 64 GB of storage, it has a rated read speed of up to 300 MB/s, which is also a decent transfer speed given that it&#39;s not an external SSD (1 TB Samsung T9 curr. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Professionals-MU-PG1T0B-AM/dp/B0CHFSWM2P?tag=nbcnewsnet-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">$119.99 on Amazon</a>).
</p>
<p>Speaking of which, while the Sandisk Extreme Fit is small in size, it&#39;s available with up to 1 TB of storage. The USB-C flash drive is also said to be compatible with multiple platforms, including <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/True-multitasking-and-menu-bar-for-the-Apple-iPad-iPadOS-26-now-available.1115207.0.html" target="_self">iPadOS</a>. The brand further highlights that due to the size, it&#39;s not only a plug-and-play flash drive but also a &#34;plug-and-stay&#34; storage solution.
</p>
<p>Other notable highlights include a sleek design, 3 grams of weight, and compatibility with the Sandisk Memory Zone app. The USB-C flash drive is available <a href="https://shop.sandisk.com/products/usb-flash-drives/sandisk-extreme-fit-usb-c?sku=SDCZ530-1T00-G46" target="_blank">on the official store</a> in the following options:</p><ul><li>64 GB (curr. $14.99 instead of $15.99)</li><li>128 GB (curr. $19.99 instead of $21.99)</li><li>256 GB (curr. $27.99 instead of $29.99)</li><li>512 GB (curr. $54.99 instead of $59.99)</li><li>1 TB (curr. $109.99 instead of $117.99)</li></ul></div><div id="c14888184"><div>
