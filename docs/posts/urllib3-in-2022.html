<p>In total urllib3 received <strong>$26,615 USD in financial support</strong>
and <strong>distributed $18,622 USD</strong> to maintainers and community contributors.
<strong>We&#39;re thankful for the financial support we receive from
our sponsors.</strong> Without funding our team wouldn&#39;t be able to
compensate maintainers to continuously lead, upkeep, and secure urllib3.
Without funding, we couldn&#39;t reward contributions from our team and the community and 
larger project like urllib3 v2.0 would either never be finished or take even longer than the year+ it&#39;s taken already to ship.
Let&#39;s dive into our sources of financial support in 2022 and how the money was spent:</p>

<h3 id="open-collective">Open Collective<a href="#open-collective" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>$12,900 from the <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/06/say-hello-to-the-recipients-of-the-2022-spotify-foss-fund/">Spotify 2022 FOSS Fund</a></li>
<li>$1,433 from contributions via <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/urllib3/">GitHub Sponsors</a></li>
<li>$160 from contributions via <a href="https://opencollective.com/urllib3">Open Collective</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We disbursed <a href="https://opencollective.com/urllib3/transactions?period=2022-01-01T06%3A00%3A00.000Z%E2%86%922023-01-01T05%3A59%3A59.999Z&amp;kind=EXPENSE">~$6,500 USD from our Open Collective</a> to maintainers and community contributors for their work on the project.
We go into 2023 with $18,827 in our Open Collective balance. In the new year our team will continue
using Open Collective funds for &#34;<a href="http://sethmlarson.dev/get-paid-to-contribute-to-urllib3">issue bounties</a>&#34;
to attract new contributors and reward existing ones for their hard work. We&#39;ll also hopefully have
time available for some contributors to work on larger initiatives as has been done in 2022.</p>

<h3 id="direct-payments-and-awards">Direct payments and awards<a href="#direct-payments-and-awards" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>We also had financial contributions that didn&#39;t go into our Open Collective.
These are contributions that either dispersed directly from Tidelift to maintainers
of the project or from financial awards that were given to individuals for maintaining urllib3.</p>

<ul>
<li>$6,152 from <a href="https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-urllib3?utm_source=pypi-urllib3&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog">Tidelift</a>, split between Seth Larson and Quentin Pradet</li>
<li>$5,000 from <a href="https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-urllib3?utm_source=pypi-urllib3&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog">Tidelift</a> to Seth Larson</li>
<li>$550 from <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-24-thank-you-to-our-maintainers/">GitHub Maintainer Month</a> to Seth Larson via GitHub Sponsors</li>
<li>$420 from <a href="https://github.com/orgs/indeedeng/sponsoring">Indeed</a> to Seth Larson via GitHub Sponsors</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-0-0-alpha-is-now-available">2.0.0 alpha is now available!<a href="#2-0-0-alpha-is-now-available" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/2.0.0a1">first pre-release of urllib3 v2.0.0</a> was made available in November 2022. Massive thank-you to the many contributors who helped achieve this milestone over multiple years. The final push in November required paid full-time
work by maintainers Quentin Pradet and Seth Larson. Both of them <a href="https://quentin.pradet.me/blog/i-got-paid-to-work-on-open-source-3.html">documented</a> their <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/working-on-urllib3-full-time-for-one-week">experiences</a>.
The release includes the following highlighted changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added a complete set of type hints (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ahramezani+is%3Aclosed+type+hint">Hasan Ramenzani</a>)</li>
<li>Added a <code>json</code> parameter to <code>.request()</code> methods and <code>.json()</code> method to <code>HTTPResponse</code>
for easier processing of JSON data both for requests and responses (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2250">Sai Vinay</a>)</li>
<li>Added a top-level <code>urllib3.request()</code> method for sending HTTP requests without configuring a <code>PoolManager</code> (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2150">Franek Magiera</a>)</li>
<li>Added ability to append multiple headers names to <code>HTTPHeaderDict</code> and not have them be merged when sent (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2669">Raphael Gaschignard</a>)</li>
<li>Added support for zstandard compression (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2624">Mauro Amico</a> and <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard/commit/1dc39cfea821893268176dae754355ec19609ce0">Gregory Szorc</a>)</li>
<li>Removed support for verifying certificates with <code>commonName</code> by default, now only <code>subjectAltName</code> is used.</li>
<li>Changed the default minimum TLS version to 1.2 (was TLS 1.0)</li>
<li>Changed <code>multipart/form-data</code> header formatting to match WHATWG standard (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2257">David Lord</a>)</li>
<li>Removed support for Python 3.6 and earlier. Codebase has been optimized for Python 3.7+</li>
<li>Removed the <code>urllib3.contrib.ntlmpool</code> module</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl</code> and <code>urllib3.contrib.securetransport</code> modules</li>
<li>Removed support for non-OpenSSL TLS libraries (ie LibreSSL, wolfSSL)</li>
<li>Removed support for OpenSSL versions before 1.1.1</li>
<li>Removed support for unmaintained Python implementations (Google App Engine, Jython)</li>
</ul>

<p>The team is hopeful to publish the stable release in early 2023 after ensuring all major dependent packages are able to integrate safely. You can read the <a href="https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html">v2.0 migration guide</a> or <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/main/CHANGES.rst">changelog</a> if you&#39;re interested more information.</p>

<h2 id="security-posture-improvements">Security posture improvements<a href="#security-posture-improvements" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Tidelift sponsored exploratory work into improving urllib3&#39;s security posture by evaluating OpenSSF projects like <a href="https://securityscorecards.dev">Scorecard</a>, <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org">Best Practices</a>, <a href="https://www.sigstore.dev">Sigstore</a>, and <a href="https://slsa.dev">Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts</a> (SLSA).
The results of the work resulted in urllib3 being scored <a href="https://deps.dev/pypi/urllib3">9.6/10</a> on OpenSSF Scorecard which tracks a wide range of security health metrics.
This is at the time of writing the <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/pypi-scorecards/blob/main/data/2022-12-31.csv">highest score</a> achieved by any Python package on PyPI.</p>

<p>Starting in v1.26.12, urllib3 is now published with <a href="https://slsa.dev/provenance">provenance attestations</a> thanks to SLSA. We use the <a href="https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator">generic GitHub SLSA generator</a> with GitHub OIDC to generate a provenance attestation and achieve <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels">SLSA level 3</a>. This attestation allows consumers to prove their wheels and sdists were built for a specific git tag, GitHub repository, and GitHub Action workflow.</p>

<p>The work of integrating Scorecard, SLSA, and Sigstore with urllib3 resulted in <a href="https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/b933cbc6970b81e9069d2da4c16089ce">at least 11 developer experience issues</a> filed and fixed in the listed projects
to help future project maintainers adopt these tools.</p>
