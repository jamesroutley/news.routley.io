    <h1>Finding services companies via their TXT records</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was watching <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evan</a>&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsxjNsFu_2g">talk</a> on DNS at RubyConf during
an early dinner when I came across something interesting. I thought I would share it here.</p>
<p>Before watching the talk, I knew what TXT records were and had even used them to verify domains for
some services. However, I never knew they were public and visible for everyone. I genuinely thought they were solely
used for verification purposes by the companies that employed them and were kept private. I was wrong.</p>
<p>üåû For those unfamiliar, TXT records are used to store text data associated with a domain name. They have various applications,
including verification and authentication. While there may be more uses, these are the two I have encountered in the past.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, when a product asks you to verify your domain, they might request you to add a TXT record to your domain. Once added, they check for the presence of this record to verify your domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflecting on that definition and example, I&#39;m not sure why I didn&#39;t realize they were public before. ü§¶</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyways, here&#39;s how you can discover the products and services companies use through their TXT records.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>First, you need to find a company&#39;s domain. For example, let&#39;s use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. Their domain
is stripe.com.</p>
<p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMzI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMyMCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></span><img alt="Mind Blown Meme" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p>
<p>Finding the TXT records for a domain is straightforward. You can use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)">dig</a> or
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup">nslookup</a>. I will be using dig.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>dig</span> stripe.com TXT
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For instance, here&#39;s the answer section for stripe.com on the day I wrote this post: Oct 29, 2023.</li>

<ul>
<li>So Stripe seems to have verified their site with Google, Liveramp (I didn&#39;t know what this was until minutes ago, for example), Atlassian, Docker, Docusign
and a couple others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-nslookup"><a href="#using-nslookup"><span></span></a>Using nslookup</h3>
<p>The following is the nslookup equivalent of the dig command above.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>nslookup</span> -type<span>=</span>TXT stripe.com
</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="note"><a href="#note"><span></span></a>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can obtain different results based on the inclusion of subdomains. For instance, when you run the commands dig stripe.com TXT and dig
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.stripe.com">www.stripe.com</a> TXT, you might get different results. Not only can the specific records differ based on the site you&#39;re &#39;digging&#39;,
but also the order in which the records are returned might vary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the companies I checked have verification records for Atlassian. I knew it was a big company, but I didn&#39;t realize it was so
deeply integrated into the tech ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As someone who frequently reads various tech blogs from different companies and regularly checks sites like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackshare.io">stackshare.io</a> to
discover the technology used behind the scenes by companies, this was a great find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are other ways to discover the
products and services companies use, but this is a great one to add to your arsenal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
