    <h1>Trans-Taiga Road:The farthest you can get from a town on a road in North America</h1>

<p>The Trans-Taiga Road is a gravel road that runs 666 km east 
from near the top end of the <a href="https://www.jamesbayroad.com/jbr/index.html"> James Bay Road</a>. It 
was built to access the various dams and generating stations that extend upriver 
along the La Grande River.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jamesbayroad.com/ttr/ttrmap_sm.jpg" width="725" height="364"/></p>

<p>This is an <i><b>extremely remote</b></i> road, leading 666 km 
east - almost to Labrador - with no settlements or towns aside from Hydro 
Quebec&#39;s settlements for workers (not open to the public). At the far end you 
will be 745 km from the nearest town! This is the farthest you can get from a 
town on a road in North America! (Not counting the private Hydro Quebec towns 
that are not open to the public). Along this road is also the
<a href="https://www.jamesbayroad.com/ttr/virtualtour/ttrvirtualtour08.html#km542">farthest north</a> point you 
can travel on a road in eastern Canada.</p>
<p>The road from <a href="https://www.jamesbayroad.com/ttr/brisay/index.html">Brisay</a> (km 582) 
to <a href="https://www.jamesbayroad.com/ttr/caniapiscau/index.html">Caniapiscau</a> is rougher and a 4-wheel 
drive vehicle is recommended by Hydro Quebec. The main reason for this is the 
very coarse gravel used for this road - there&#39;s large rocks littering the road 
surface. However, I have heard from people who have driven this road in ordinary 
passenger cars and they say it is fine. You do have to keep your eyes open for 
the larger rocks though.</p>
<p>You should definitely travel this road only in a reliable 
vehicle with good tires. It is not an overly rough road; passenger vehicles can 
drive it, but it is gravel. Vehicle breakdowns here can be very costly. Flat 
tires can be a serious (and expensive) incident if your tires are damaged. You 
could be looking at having tires flown in on a non-scheduled flight - there are 
no convenient &#34;tire stores&#34; up here! Please read
<a href="https://www.jamesbayroad.com/ttr/ttrdriving.html">Driving the Trans-Taiga Road</a> first.</p>
<p>Although there are no towns, there are a couple of outfitters 
along the way that sell fuel and offer meals and lodging. Cell phones do not 
work here.</p>
<p>Generally the scenery is fairly level, but this road is 
definitely more interesting than the <a href="https://www.jamesbayroad.com/jbr/index.html">James Bay Road</a>. For 
most of the length it runs through taiga: spruce and jack pine forest, bogs, 
rocks, and low hills. This is about all you&#39;ll see apart from birds and some 
wildlife, the occasional cabin a short distance off the road, and Hydro Quebec 
installations. I once saw a couple of wolves playing in the middle of this road.</p>
