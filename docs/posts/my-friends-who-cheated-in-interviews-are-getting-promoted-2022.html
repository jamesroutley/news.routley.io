But to get a job you need to slog, grind and get Lucky.</p> <!----> </div> <!---->  <div><h2>comments</h2>  <div> <!----> <ul><li id="21118314"><div> <p><span>They did what they had to to get the jobs that they wanted. Now theyâ€™re being promoted based on their merit, not the interview they cheated. Sounds like you have competent friends</span></p> <p><span>May 10, 2022</span> <a>202</a> <a>6</a></p></div> <div><ul><li id="21159052"><div> <p><span>I know Jesus Christ would disagree.</span></p> <p><span>May 11, 2022</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li><li id="21176982"><div> <p><span>@WKtc24 doing business is most often involves what you call &#34;cheating&#34;. In business there is no cheating, there is only making money and not making money.</span></p> <p><span>May 12, 2022</span> <a>1</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="21118184"><div> <p><span>I know an external m2/e7 hire at fb (~1m tc) that lied on resume about their position when we were at a previous company together. Made up the scope of their projects and called themselves an exec.</span></p> <p><span>May 10, 2022</span> <a>66</a> <a>6</a></p></div> <div><ul><li id="21145061"><div> <p><span>Damn @Amazon I had similar experience as you. My former colleague depicted himself as tech lead on some projects I led, recently found out when I viewed his Linkedin profile since I started looking for job and would like to reach out to folks I know to discuss opportunities. He was a competent developer and had contribution on some features of the projects but it feels weird to see people I worked with blatantly taking credits on something I spent lots of effort working on. I wish him the best at his current FAANG position but I believe aside from competency, integrity and honesty goes a long way.</span></p> <p><span>May 11, 2022</span> <a>4</a></p></div></li><li id="21176995"><div> <p><span>and how did you know they lied? did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span>May 12, 2022</span> <a>0</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="21118083"><div> <p><span>I think it says more about the company&#39;s promotion culture than about the interview process. They probably did things similar to cheating in order to get promoted, and it worked.</span></p> <p><span>May 10, 2022</span> <a>61</a> <a>2</a></p></div> <div><!----> <ul><li id="21118329"><div> <p><span>Everyone I know from my friend circle has not just thought about cheating but also actually cheated. Some were successful in cheating as they got previously seen questions and looked them up on a different laptop while some didn&#39;t.</span></p> <p><span>May 10, 2022</span> <a>24</a></p></div></li><li id="21118987"><div> <p><span>This boils down to principles and ethics. Do you think you will be ok to sleep peacefully after having cheated in an interview? If not it&#39;s not worth it. Maybe your friends are.  Now are you ok with your friends cheating? If not, time to look for new friends. Or call them out if you really care. Because cheating is infectious until that one last time when it destroys you.</span></p> <p><span>May 10, 2022</span> <a>17</a></p></div></li></ul></div></li><li id="21118060"><div> <p><span>Have you thought of sharing this feedback with your &#34;fellow friends&#34;??</span></p> <p><span>May 10, 2022</span> <a>10</a> <a>5</a></p></div> <div><ul><li id="21124787"><div> <p><span>If someone actually did this, then it is fucking brilliant.
