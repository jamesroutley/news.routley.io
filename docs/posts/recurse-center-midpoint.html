    <h1>Recurse Center - Midpoint</h1>

      <p>This past Monday marked the midway point of my time at the Recurse Center (RC). RC has been nice, and I’ve been learning a lot.</p>
<p>I was going to write a lengthy post about my time here and what I’ve been learning, but I think I’ll split it up into a few posts. There’s too much for me to verify and review otherwise. This post will lean towards my experiences and thoughts.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in my last post, but I came in with a lot of different projects I was considering working on. Here’s what they were—I’ll mark the ones that I ended up focusing on over the past 3 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>AI/ML.</strong></em> I did decide to study AI/ML. A study group for it started up pretty quickly, so it was an easy choice for me to join. I hadn’t heard of <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">the course</a> before, but I’ve been liking it a lot.</li>
<li><em><strong>iOS/Swift.</strong></em> I decided that this would be my first big project. It felt achievable to write an app, and I thought it would make me a better engineer if I was able to ship something end-to-end.</li>
<li><em><strong>Other Projects.</strong></em> I’ve been doing a bunch of things I didn’t plan on! There’s this thing at RC called “impossible stuff day”, so I wrote a lexer and parser in Rust (true to its name, I did not finish on time). And I’m also working through <a href="https://cryptopals.com">cryptopals</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Something hardware related?</strong> This was really close. It didn’t feel like I could get a meaningful amount of progress done in six weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Threads and processes.</strong> This basically meant advanced Rails and my project <a href="https://github.com/zachahn/disqualified">Disqualified</a>. This is what I do for fun in my day to day, so it didn’t feel like a meaningful project to do at RC.</li>
<li><strong>Data structures and algorithms.</strong> I decided that this felt a little too focused on “getting a job”, at least for now. I’ll do this eventually, regardless of my being at RC.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had some unexpected travels and a cold during my second and third weeks, respectively, so I missed out on some of the social aspects of RC. I’m finally feeling better, so I want to ramp back up on those calls—and maybe check out some meetings that seem interesting, even if they aren’t related to the goals I have in mind.</p>
<p>Unrelated note—I got an email today from someone who uses <a href="https://github.com/zachahn/disqualified">Disqualified</a>. It kinda made my day; I never expected my little background job processor to be run outside of my own deployments! I’m excited to go back to that project. I have lots of improvements I’ve been wanting to make.</p>
