    <h1>I don’t need a Steam Machine</h1>

			  		<p>For those of you who are living under a rock, Valve announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">three new hardware devices</a> joining their Steam Deck line-up: a new controller, a VR headset, and the GameCube—no wait, GabeCube—no wait, Steam Machine. The shiny little cube is undoubtedly Valve’s (second) attempt to break into the console market. This time, it might just work.</p>
<p>The hardware is ready to arrive in at your living room spring next year. The biggest question is: will it arrive at <em>our</em> living room? Reading all the hype has certainly enthused me (e.g. Brendon’s <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-steam-machine-is-the-future">The Steam Machine is the Future</a>, PC Gamer’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/steamos-launching-for-arm-fex-translation-layer/">Valve is all over ARM</a>, Eurogamer’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">Steam Machine preview</a>, ResetEra’s <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-hardware-family-officially-expands-in-early-2026-steam-controller-steam-machine-steam-frame.1351453/">Steam Hardware thread</a>); especially the part where the Machine is just a PC that happens to be tailored towards console gaming. According to Valve, you can install anything you want on it—it’s just SteamOS just like your trusty Deck, meaning you can boot into KDE and totally do your thing. Except that this shiny little cube is six times as powerful. I’m sure Digital Foundry will validate that next year.</p>

<p>However, this post isn’t about specs, expectations, or dreams: it’s about tempering my own enthusiasm. I’d like to tell myself why I don’t really need a Steam Machine. The following list will hopefully make it easier to say no when the buy buttons become available.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You’re a retro gamer.</em> </li>
<li><em>Your TV doesn’t support 4K</em>.</li>
<li><em>You generally dislike AAA games.</em> </li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to play games anyway.</em></li>
<li><em>The TV will be occupied anyway.</em></li>
<li><em>You already have too many gaming related hardware pieces.</em></li>
<li><em>There’s no room for yet another nondescript box under the TV.</em></li>
<li><em>You’re a physical gamer.</em></li>
<li><em>It’s Steam, not Good Old Games.</em></li>
<li><em>The last time you booted Steam was over a year ago.</em></li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to fiddle with configuration.</em></li>
<li><em>Your MacBook can emulate Windows games just fine.</em></li>
<li><em>In two years, you’ll upgrade your M1 to an M4+: there’s the power upgrade.</em></li>
<li><em>You already have a huge gaming backlog.</em></li>
<li><em>You dislike a digital backlog.</em></li>
<li><em>You’re not going to use the Machine to run office software.</em></li>
<li><em>Those cool looking indie games will be released for Switch in due time anyway.</em></li>
<li><em>It’s rumoured to cost more than</em> <code>€600</code>.</li>
<li><em>All HDMI ports both on the TV and your external monitors are occupied</em>.</li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this without buying the Steam Controller.</em></li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this as an expense on the company.</em></li>
<li><em>The cool looking LED and programmable front display don’t justify an expensive purchase.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So you see, I don’t really need a Steam Machine…</p>
<p>Fuck it, I’m getting one.</p>
