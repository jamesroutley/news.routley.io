  As announced <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/factorio-on-nintendo-switch">previously</a>, Factorio is now
  available for Nintendo Switch. You can find it on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/factorio-switch/">Nintendo eShop</a> in your region. I hope you will
  enjoy it. Remember that if you are not sure, you can try the demo. I recommend playing through the tutorial campaign
  even if you are a veteran player, as it gradually teaches you how to play the game with a controller.

<h4>Reporting bugs</h4>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<ul>
  <li>When the game is started for the first time, there will be no sound effects, only music. Please restart the game
    to fix this issue. A patch to fix this issue is already on the way. Sorry for the inconvenience.</li>
  <li>LAN discovery does not work in some rare situations if &#34;Public&#34; visibility is also selected when hosting the game.
  </li>
  <li>Maps over 100MB or with a very large number of entities (typically downloaded from the PC version) can not be loaded.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Useful information regarding multiplayer</h4>
<ul>
<li>When hosting multiplayer games over the internet, you will need to forward port 34197 in your router. Connecting to
  games that don&#39;t have their port forwarded might not work.</li>
<li>Since patches for Nintendo Switch take time to be published, the game on Nintendo Switch might be on an older version.
  Please select the &#34;console&#34; beta branch on Steam to make sure the versions match.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Is there a demo available?</b></li>
<li><b>What&#39;s the price of the full game?</b></li>
<li><b>Why is the game so expensive in my country? It&#39;s cheaper on Steam.</b></li>
<li><b>Is there a physical box release I can buy?</b></li>
<li><b>Can I keep my username in multipayer games?</b></li>
<li><b>Can I transfer my save to Nintendo Switch?</b></li>
<li><b>Can I transfer my blueprints to Nintendo Switch?</b></li>
<li><b>I&#39;m getting &#34;std::bad_alloc&#34; when trying to load a save file.</b></li>
</ul>

<h4>Welcome new players</h4>
<p>
  I don&#39;t expect an immediate influx of millions of new players from Nintendo Switch, but there will be quite a few
  fresh engineers crash landing. The Factorio community has a very good reputation of welcoming and helping new players,
  so keep up the good work! And thank you.
