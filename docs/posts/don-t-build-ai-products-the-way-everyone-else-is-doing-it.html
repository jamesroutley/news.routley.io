51vw"/></picture></div><p><span><p>If you&#39;re on the right side of the spectrum, where all you made was a button that sends something to ChatGPT and gets a response back that you showed your end users — where ChatGPT basically did all the work —you&#39;re at the highest risk here.</p><p>On the other end, if you actually built some substantial technology and LLMs where OpenAI has only assisted with a small but crucial piece, then you may be in a better position, but you&#39;re still going to run into two other major issues.</p></span></p><p><span><p>The first major issue you&#39;ll run into is cost. The best part of a large language model is their broad versatility, but they achieve this by being exceptionally large and complex, which makes them incredibly costly to run.</p><p>As an example, per the Wall Street Journal, recently GitHub Copilot was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ais-costly-buildup-could-make-early-products-a-hard-sell-bdd29b9f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">losing money per user</a>, charging $10, but on average cost $20, and some users cost GitHub up to $80 <span><span><em>per month</em></span></span>.</p><p>And the worst part is you probably don&#39;t need such a large model. Your use case probably doesn&#39;t need a model trained on the entirety of the Internet because 99.9% of that training covers topics that have nothing to do with your use case.</p><p>So, while the ease of this approach might be tempting, you could run into this common issue where what your users want to pay is less than what it costs to run your service on top of large language models.</p></span></p><p><span><p>Even if you&#39;re the rare case where the cost economics might work out okay for you, you&#39;re still going to hit one more major issue: LLMs are painfully slow.</p><p>Now, this isn&#39;t a huge problem for all applications. For use cases such as ChatGPT, where reading one word at a time is the norm, this might be okay.</p></span></p><p><span><p><span>However, in applications where text isn&#39;t meant to be read word-for-word, and the entire response is expected before proceeding to the next step in the workflow, this can pose a significant issue.</span><br/></p><p>As an example, when we started working on Builder&#39;s <a href="https://www.builder.io/blog/figma-to-code-visual-copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Visual Copilot</a>, where we wanted one button click to turn any design into high-quality code, one of the approaches we explored was using an LLM for the conversion.</p></span></p><p><span><p><span>One of the key issues we encountered was the significant time delay. When passing an entire design specification into an LLM and receiving a new representation token by token, generating a response would take several minutes, making it impractical.</span><br/></p><p>And because the representation returned by the LLM is not what a human would perceive, the loading state was just a spinner — not ideal.</p></span></p><p><span><p>If for some reason, performance still isn&#39;t an issue for you, and your users don&#39;t care about having a slow and expensive product that&#39;s easy for your competitors to copy, you&#39;re still likely to run into another major issue — LLMs can&#39;t be customized that much.</p><p>Yes, they all support fine-tuning, and fine-tuning can incrementally help the model get closer to what you need. But in our case, we tried using fine-tuning to provide Figma designs and get code out the other side.</p><p>But no matter how many examples we gave the model, it didn&#39;t improve. We were left with something slow, expensive, and inferior quality. And that&#39;s when we realized we had to take a different approach.</p></span></p><p><span><p>What did we have to do instead? We had to create our own toolchain.</p></span></p><div builder-id="builder-7fb58077a7a74b12964f2b8986b186f0"><picture><source srcset="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=100 100w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=200 200w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=400 400w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=800 800w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=1200 1200w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=1600 1600w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=2000 2000w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=705 705w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=548 548w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?format=webp&amp;width=503 503w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Diagram showing our toolchain that involves a custom built AI, a fine-tuned LLM, and our Mitosis compiler" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=705" srcset="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=100 100w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=200 200w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=400 400w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=800 800w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=1200 1200w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=1600 1600w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=2000 2000w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=705 705w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=548 548w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb84cccff2b74231b3b083909d211e7f?width=503 503w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 86vw,  (max-width: 998px) 51vw, 51vw"/></picture></div><p><span><p>In this case, we combined a fine-tuned LLM, a <a href="https://github.com/builderio/mitosis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">custom compiler</a> that we wrote, and a custom-trained model.</p><p>And it wasn&#39;t as hard as it might seem.These days, you don&#39;t have to be a data scientist or a Ph.D. in machine learning to train your own model.</p><p>Any moderately experienced developer can do it.

you won&#39;t need something nearly this complex, especially when starting out.</p><p>Remember, self-driving cars didn&#39;t spawn overnight. My 2018 Prius is capable of parking itself, stopping automatically when too close to an object, and many other things using little to no AI.</p><p>Over time, more and more layers were added to cars to do more and more advanced things, like correcting lane departure, or eventually making entire decisions to drive from one place to another.</p><p>But like all software, these things are built in layers, one on top of the next.</p></span></p><p><span><p>I highly recommend you explore the approach we used for Visual Copilot for your own AI solutions. It&#39;s a straightforward but counterintuitive approach.</p><p>The most important thing is to not use AI at first.</p><p>Explore the problem space using normal programming practices to determine what areas need a specialized model in the first place.</p><p>Remember, making “supermodels” is generally not the right approach. We don&#39;t want to send tons of Figma data into a model and get finished code out the other side.</p><p>That would be an outrageously complex problem to solve with just one model. And when you factor in all the different frameworks we support, and styling options and customizations, it would be unfeasible to retrain this model with all this additional data.</p></span></p><p><span><p><span>It likely would have become so complex, slow, and expensive that our product might never have even shipped.</span><br/></p><p>Instead, we considered the problem and said, well, how can we solve this without AI? How far can we get before it gets impossible without the types of specialized decision-making AI is best at?</p><p>So we broke the problem down and said, okay, we need to convert each of these nodes to things we can represent in code.</p><p>We needed to understand, in detail, working with elements such as images, backgrounds, and foregrounds. And most importantly, we needed to intricately understand how to make any input responsive.</p><p>After that, we started considering more complex examples and realized there are lots of cases where many, many layers would need to be turned into one image.</p></span></p><p><span><p>We started writing hand-coded logic to say if a set of items is in a vertical stack that should probably be a flex column, and items that are side by side should probably be a flex row.</p><p>We got as far as we could creating all these different types of sophisticated algorithms to automatically transform designs to responsive code before we started hitting limits.</p><p>In my experience, wherever you think the limit is, it&#39;s probably a lot further. But, at a certain point, you&#39;ll find some things are just near impossible to do with standard code.</p><p>For example, automatically detecting which layers should turn into one image, is something that human perception is really good at understanding, but this isn&#39;t necessarily normal imperative code.

It supports a wide variety of frameworks and options, and it&#39;s all super fast because all of our models are specially built just for this purpose.</p><p>We offer this at an exceptionally low cost, providing a generous free tier, and it&#39;s tremendously valuable for our customers, helping them save lots of time.</p></span></p><p><span><p>The best part is that this is only the beginning.</p></span></p><p><span><p>One of the best parts of this approach is that we completely own the models so we can constantly improve them. We aren&#39;t just wrapping somebody else&#39;s model.</p><p>If you&#39;re fully dependent only on someone else&#39;s model, like OpenAI, there&#39;s no guarantee it&#39;s going to get smarter, faster, or cheaper for your use case in any guaranteed timeline. And your ability to control that with prompt engineering and fine-tuning is severely limited.</p><p>But since we own our own model, we&#39;re making significant improvements every day.</p><p>When new designs come in that don&#39;t import well — which still happens as it&#39;s in beta — we rely on user feedback to improve at a rapid cadence, shipping improvements every single day.</p></span></p><p><span><p>With this approach, we never have to worry about a lack of control. For instance, when we started talking to some large and privacy-focused companies as potential early beta customers, one of the most common pieces of feedback was that they were not able to use OpenAI or any products using OpenAI.</p><p>Their privacy requirements prioritize making sure their data never goes into systems that they don&#39;t allow.</p><p>In our case, because we control the entire technology, we can hold our models to an extremely high privacy bar. Thank goodness, because we would’ve lost out on some serious business had we been dependent on other companies (like many others are).</p><p>And for the LLM step, we can either turn it off (because it&#39;s purely nice to have) or companies can plug in their own LLM. Those LLMs might be an entirely in-house built model, a fork of <code>llama2</code>, their own enterprise instance of OpenAI, or something else entirely.</p></span></p><p><span><p>So, if you want to build AI products, I highly recommend taking a similar approach as Builder.</p><p>As strange as it sounds, avoid using AI for as long as possible in your project. Then, when you start finding particular problems that standard coding doesn&#39;t solve well — but well-established AI models can — start generating your own data and training your own models with a wide variety of tools you can find off-the-shelf.</p><p>Connect your model(s) to your code only where they&#39;re needed.</p><p>And I want to emphasize this: use AI for as <em>little</em> as possible. At the end of the day, “normal” code is the fastest, most reliable, most deterministic, most easy to debug, easy to fix, easy to manage, and easy to test code you will ever have.</p><p>But the magic will come from the small but critical areas you use AI models for.</p><p>Can’t wait to see the awesome things you build.</p></span></p><div data-model="symbol" builder-id="builder-cd61df2407824553be2497e03d87073a"><div data-name="symbol" data-source="Rendered by Builder.io"><div builder-content-id="02714711c4b647959d015e34679ca6ee" builder-model="symbol"><div data-builder-component="symbol" data-builder-content-id="02714711c4b647959d015e34679ca6ee"><div builder-type="blocks"><div data-model="symbol" builder-id="builder-ae5eb8c51cd742758c3b4f2771ba6833"><div data-name="symbol" data-source="Rendered by Builder.io"><template data-template-variant-id="6d0b491a00e64dce9781e3c0a9839b71"><div builder-content-id="6d0b491a00e64dce9781e3c0a9839b71" builder-model="symbol"><div data-builder-component="symbol" data-builder-content-id="de784470c6884829b5e7c7603f4c51ed"><div builder-type="blocks"><div builder-id="builder-7c77e4f236f848b48c79a96f49072518"><div builder-id="builder-296e83c56835496a896d380e22d2fbd9"><div><div><div builder-type="blocks" builder-parent-id="builder-296e83c56835496a896d380e22d2fbd9"><div builder-id="builder-2487409df20c4d6ea916563459503bd5"><p><span><p>Visually build with your components</p></span></p><div builder-id="builder-dde61f974a184a338de6b5e43b675061"><div><div><pre><code>// Dynamically render your components
