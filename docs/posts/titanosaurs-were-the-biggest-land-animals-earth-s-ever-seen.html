</div><p>You&#39;re probably familiar with classic sauropod dinosaurs—the four-legged herbivores famous for their long necks and tails. Animals such as <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520246232/the-sauropods">Brachiosaurus, Apatosaurus and Diplodocus</a> have been standard fixtures in science museums since the 1800s.</p>

																																	<p>With their small brains and enormous bodies, these creatures have long been the poster children for <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/triumph-of-the-titans/">animals destined to go extinct</a>. But recent discoveries have completely rewritten the doomed sauropod narrative.</p>
<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dz3tM2YAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">I study</a> a lesser known group of sauropod dinosaurs—the Titanosauria, or &#34;titanic reptiles.&#34; Instead of going extinct, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95959-3_10">titanosaurs flourished</a> long after their more famous cousins vanished. Not only were they large and in charge on <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/">all seven continents</a>, they held their own amid the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.10.035">newly evolved duck-billed and horned dinosaurs</a>, until an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay2268">asteroid struck Earth</a> and ended the age of dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The secret to titanosaurs&#39; remarkable biological success may be how they merged the best of both reptile and mammal characteristics to form a unique way of life.</p>
<h2>Moving with the continents</h2>
<p>Titanosaurs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2012.00853.x">originated by the Early Cretaceous Period</a>, nearly 126 million years ago, at a time when many of the <a href="https://deeptimemaps.com/map-lists-thumbnails/global-paleogeography-and-tectonics-in-deep-time/">Earth&#39;s landmasses were much closer together</a> than they are today.</p>
<p>Over the next 75 million to 80 million years, the continents slowly separated, and titanosaurs drifted along with the changing formations, becoming distributed worldwide.</p>

</figure><p>There were nearly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95959-3_8">100 species of titanosaurs</a>, making up more than 30% of known sauropod dinosaurs. They varied greatly in size. From the largest known sauropods ever discovered, including <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08912960410001715132">Argentinosaurus</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.1219">Patagotitan</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1590/S0001-37652007000300013">Futalognkosaurus</a>, whose weight exceeded 60 tons (54.4 metric tons) and were bigger than a semitruck, to the smallest known sauropods, including <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2022.105389">Rinconsaurus</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2014.12.012">Saltasaurus</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1000781107">Magyarosaurus</a>, which were around only 6 tons (5.4 metric tons) and about the size of an African elephant.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Babies to titans</h2>
<p>Like many reptiles, titanosaurs began life comparatively tiny, hatching from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/24370">eggs no bigger than grapefruits</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/24370">best data on titanosaur nests</a> and eggs comes from a site in Argentina called Auca Mahuevo, featuring 75 million-year-old exposed rocks. The site contains hundreds of fossilized nests containing thousands of eggs, some of which are so well preserved, scientists recovered <a href="https://doi.org/10.1666/05-150.1">skin impressions from ancient embryos</a>.</p>
<p>The sheer number of nests found together, in multiple geological layers, suggests titanosaurs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.05.031">returned to this site repeatedly</a> to lay their eggs. The nests are so closely spaced, it&#39;s unlikely an adult titanosaur would have been able to move freely through the nesting ground. Titanosaurs likely had a hands-off parenting style, similar to many reptiles that lay numerous eggs and don&#39;t spend much time tending the nest or taking care of hatchlings.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf1509">A titanosaur hatchling</a> would have been roughly 1 foot (30 centimeters) tall, 3 feet (1 meter) long and 5–10 pounds (2.5–5 kg). Recent evidence from a site in Madagascar suggests these tiny titans were born ready to rumble.</p>

<p>Fossilized bones from the species Rapetosaurus suggest that by the time they would have been just knee high to a modern human, they were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf1509">likely fending for themselves</a>. Microscopic details recorded deep within the bones indicate baby Rapetosaurus likely foraged independently for plants and moved much more nimbly than their lumbering adult relatives.</p>

																																			<p>For the first century of dinosaur science, paleontologists imagined titanosaurs as giant, overgrown reptiles—and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2400208">used reptilian growth rates to predict their milestones</a>. In this slow-growth model, even the smallest titanosaurs would have taken nearly a century to reach their full size, meaning they would have been relatively small for a good chunk of their lives. New evidence suggests this growth pattern is unlikely.</p>
<p>Scientists like me <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520273528/bone-histology-of-fossil-tetrapods">study titanosaurs&#39; bones at high magnification</a> to better understand their growth. We look at the microscopic patterns of bone minerals as well as the density and architecture of the spaces that held blood vessels and cells.</p>
<p>The more dense the blood supply is to a bone, the faster that animal grows. These signatures are also present in living animals and can accurately reflect <a href="https://doi.org/10.1201/9781351189590">growth rates, anomalies and even age</a>.</p>
<p>Bone data shows <a href="https://phys.org/tags/titanosaur/" rel="tag">titanosaur</a> growth rates were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1201/9781351189590">on par with mammals like whales</a>—much, much faster than any living reptile—meaning they would have reached their enormous adult sizes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00137.x">in just a few decades</a>. Scientists can&#39;t know for sure how long titanosaurs lived, but based on large land animals living today, titanosaurs lived possibly 60 or more years.</p>

<p><b>Fueled by plants</b></p>
<p>The rapid growth rates of sauropods was partly due to their body temperatures. By studying the chemistry of fossilized teeth <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9296">and eggshells</a>, scientists have determined titanosaurs had body temperatures <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1206196">ranging from about 95°F to 100.5°F</a> (35°C to 38°C). That&#39;s higher than that of crocodiles and alligators, about the same as modern mammals and a bit lower than most birds, whose bodies can regularly get <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-9629(91)90122-S">as warm as 104°F (40°C)</a>.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Titanosaurs&#39; rapid growth rates were also powered by their prodigious appetites for plants. Microscopic patterns of scratches, wear and pits on their teeth indicate titanosaurs in Argentina fed on a diverse diet rich in grit, suggesting they were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151661">dining on plants found lower to the ground</a>, where sediment would be more commonly found.</p>
<p>In India, chunks of fossilized feces, otherwise known as coprolites, show titanosaurs there ingested everything from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118806">ground-level plants all the way up to the leaves and branches</a> of trees.</p>
<p>Like all dinosaurs, titanosaurs replaced their teeth throughout life. But data shows they replaced each tooth <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069235">about every 20 days</a> for maximum efficiency, one of the highest tooth-replacement rates known for dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1177265">asteroid impact 66 million years ago</a>, these long-lived, incredibly diverse and wildly successful animals probably would have kept on thriving, in places as distant as <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/">Madagascar, Romania, North America and even Antarctica</a>. Instead, titanosaurs were among the witnesses to—and victims of—the most recent mass extinction on Earth.</p>
