<p><span id="more-20228"></span>There is something I need to admit to: I am not very good with small talk. Because of this, I never think of making snacks and nibbles for when my guests come to share a meal around a table. I like everything to be ready by the time they arrive, and for everyone to be seated and eating without waiting around. When eating out, I try to avoid restaurants where a bar gets in the way of me and my dining table.</p>
<p>Chinese people are busy people. No one would think of having a diversionary cup of tea as a pre-cursor to having a meal. Let&#8217;s do everything together! Why do you think we felt a connection to the title of that celebrated film <em>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</em>?</p>
<p>But a good hostess should think of her guests. It&#8217;s time to plan beyond the candle and fluffy hand towels in the guest bathroom.</p>
<p>The first step is to make some spiced nuts for our guests to snack on whilst waiting for a drink, for dinner or for the other guests to arrive. For years I have made our <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2020/01/maple-spiced-nuts/">maple spiced mixed nuts</a> to give away as gifts, but I recently thought to try a new recipe from the Falastin Cookbook (see below) where it is called <em>sweet and spicy seeds and nuts</em>.</p>
<p>It is a very easy recipe and I have now made it a few times, to eat at home and to give away. The recipe below makes a double batch (the book&#8217;s recipe is for 180 g of cashews) but I once doubled this and made a whole 720 g batch. This was consumed / given away within the week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Nuts:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">30 g light soft brown sugar</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">3 teaspoons flaked sea salt</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2 teaspoons mild curry powder</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">½ teaspoon ground turmeric (I omitted this)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1 teaspoon Aleppo chilli flakes (or ½ teaspoon regular chilli flakes)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">360 g raw unsalted cashews</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">40 g sunflower seeds</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">40 g pumpkin seeds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Preheat the oven to 160°C fan. Line a baking tray with greaseproof/ baking paper.</p>
<p>Weigh out the cashews, sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Place together in a bowl and set aside.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Place the sugar, salt, oil, curry powder, turmeric (I omitted this) and chilli flakes into a saucepan, along with 3 tablespoons of water.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bring the mixture to a medium heat, stirring often, then add the nuts and seeds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Continue to stir for another 2 &#8211; 3 minutes, or until the nuts and seeds are coated in a sticky glaze.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Transfer to the lined baking tray. Spread the nuts out so that they bake evenly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bake for 14 &#8211; 16 minutes, until golden and crunchy. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely, then transfer to a small bowl to serve. Store in a bottle if using later, or if you are giving it away.</p>
