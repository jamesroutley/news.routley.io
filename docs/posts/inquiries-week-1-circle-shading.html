This changes the parity (odd/even) of the number of circles containing that region. Therefore, adjacent regions must have different parities, which means they can be colored with just two colors.</p><ul><li><a href="https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/live/YPPbExJ/d4a0f4df3014b035822aba23f778759e?ref=fractalkitty.com">Here is a tool </a>to show parity flipping and play once the two color conjecture is found.</li><li>Using a whiteboard for each step is useful.</li></ul><p><strong>Leading Induction Questions</strong></p><ul><li>With 1 circle, how many regions? How many colors are needed?</li><li>Induction hypothesis: Assume two colors work for n circles.</li><li>Inductive step: What happens when we add circle n+1?</li><li>How does this new circle affect the existing regions?</li><li>Does the coloring rule still work? Why?</li></ul><p><strong>Example Proof:</strong></p><p><em>For any arrangement of circles with distinct intersections:</em></p><ol><li><em>When crossing any circle boundary, we move from one region to an adjacent region.</em></li><li><em>The number of circles containing the region changes by exactly </em>±<em>1.</em></li><li><em>Therefore, adjacent regions must have opposite parities.</em></li><li><em>If we give even parities one color and odd parities another, no two adjacent regions share a color. </em></li><li><em>Therefore, exactly two colors are necessary to color any arrangement of circles with distinct intersections. </em></li></ol><h3 id="tools-and-supplies">Tools and Supplies</h3><p>This can be done virtually, on paper, or with code. </p><ul><li><strong>On paper:</strong><ul><li>crayons/markers</li><li>paper</li><li>compass - optional (circles don&#39;t need to be perfect)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Digital Drawing tools:</strong><ul><li>In browser <a href="https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/live/myyYpvO/7b5995a9cdc10fa5d5d0e8dff5eadaed?ref=fractalkitty.com">circle paint</a></li><li>Online whiteboards (miro, figma, etc) - participants can mark regions color without coloring in all the way</li></ul></li><li><strong>Coding - (not a 60 min activity)</strong><ul><li>Coding is not a single session activity and is more of a prompt to then go contemplate. </li><li>P5js, python, shaders or other languages can be used to figure out the algorithm.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h3><ul><li><strong>Lune</strong>: A crescent-shaped region formed when one circle partially overlaps another.</li><li><strong>Lens</strong>: The almond-shaped region where two circles overlap.</li><li><strong>Adjacent regions</strong>: Regions that share a boundary segment.</li><li><strong>Chromatic number</strong>: The minimum number of colors needed to properly color a set of regions.</li><li><strong>Bipartite graph</strong>: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two groups with no edges connecting vertices within the same group.</li><li><strong>Parity</strong>: The property of being even or odd.</li><li><strong>Conjecture</strong>: A mathematical statement that is believed to be true but has not yet been proven.</li><li><strong>Counterexample</strong>: A specific example that disproves a conjecture.</li><li><strong>Even-odd rule</strong>: The principle that regions can be colored based on whether they&#39;re contained in an even or odd number of circles.</li><li><strong>Invariant</strong>: A property that remains unchanged under certain operations (such as going from one region to another and changing parity).</li><li><strong>Boundary</strong>: The line or curve that separates two regions.</li><li><strong>Intersection</strong>: The place where two or more circles overlap.</li><li><strong>Region</strong>: A connected area bounded by circle arcs and/or the unbounded exterior.</li></ul><h3 id="extensions-and-what-ifs"></h3><ol><li><strong>Graph Representation:</strong> Create a graph where each region is a vertex, and regions sharing a boundary are connected by edges. What does this graph look like? How does this relate to the chromatic number? (Bipartite graphs)</li><li><strong>Different Shapes:</strong> What happens if we use other shapes instead of circles, such as triangles or squares? Does the minimum number of colors change?</li><li><strong>Single Line-Art Shape: </strong>Place a pencil on the paper and draw anything with a single line, distinct intersections, and so that the end and start are the same. How many colors are needed?</li></ol>
