            <span>Abstract:</span>  Python and Prolog express different programming paradigms, with different
strengths. Python is wildly popular because it is well-structured, easy to use,
and mixes well with thousands of scientific and machine learning programs
written in C. Prolog&#39;s logic-based approach provides powerful reasoning
capabilities, especially when combined with constraint evaluation,
probabilistic reasoning, well-founded negation, and other advances. Both
languages have commonalities as well: both are usually written in C, both are
dynamically typed, and both use data structures based on a small number of
recursive types.
