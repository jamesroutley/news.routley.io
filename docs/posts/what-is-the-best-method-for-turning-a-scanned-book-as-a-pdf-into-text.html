    <h1>Ask HN: What is the best method for turning a scanned book as a PDF into text?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I like reading philosophy, particularly from the authors rather than a secondhand account.</p><p>However I often run into that these come as scanned documents, Discourses on Livy and Politics Among Nations for example.</p><p>I would greatly benefit from turning these into text. I can snipping tool pages and put them in ChatGPT and it turns out perfect. If I used classic methods, it often screws up words. My final goal is to turn these into audiobooks, (or even just make it easier to copypaste for my personal notes)</p><p>Given the state of AI, I&#39;m wondering what my options are. I don&#39;t mind paying.</p></div></div></div>
