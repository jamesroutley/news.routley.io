    <h1>Calling Their Bluff</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately countries have started requiring eVisas even for countries that used to allow visa free travel. It’s very annoying. A month ago I signed up for an eVisa to get into Canada. Someone sent me the link, and after doing it I realised I didn’t use the official Canadian government website.. Instead I used signed up with <a href="https://evisatravel.org">evisatravel.org</a>, they seem to sit in front of the real eVisa application process and forward the application to the Canadian government.</p>
<p>They charged me $79 USD while the Canadian government charges $7 CAD ($5 USD).</p>
<p>I should have known something was up, becuase after paying the application fee, they emailed me asking me to send them a photo of my passport. I was thinking “Why didn’t they just let me upload it as part of the application process”. I suspect it has something to do with Google Ad policies.</p>

<p>I sent them my passport, then they sent me a certificate saying I was eligible to enter Canada.</p>
<p><img src="https://anguscheng.com/images/2025-08-13/certificate.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>There’s a few things offputting about this certificate.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Canadian flag image is a bit blurry.</li>
<li>The border doesn’t look good.</li>
<li>Canada is capitalised in <a href="http://www.Canada.travel">www.Canada.travel</a></li>
<li>It’s kind of weird that an immigration agency is suggesting thing to see and do.</li>
<li>“See you in Canada !” has a space before the exclamation mark.</li>
</ol>
<p>I did think to myself “What an ugly certificate, but I guess government agencies are like that”.</p>

<p>A few days later my girlfriend told me the link she gave me wasn’t the right website, and she suggested I sign up on the official site. I did some googling and found the official Canadian government website. Ah okay, yes this looks a lot more professional. So I filled in the official form which was a lot easier to fill in and also a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>Then I thought “I’ll chargeback that $79 USD payment, because fuck thsoe guys and their scammy website”. So I processed the chargeback. Pretty soon after that I got this email.</p>

<p>When I got the email I thought “Oh it’s pretty cool these guys have a process for reversing chargebacks”. I also run a business that charges credit cards online, but I don’t do anything to recover credit card charge backs. It made me think “Maybe I should try to do more to reverse the chargebacks”.</p>
<p>When I read this line “Please note that initiating a chargeback after service completion may result in your name being placed on the government blacklist, which could negatively impact any future visa applications.”</p>
<p>I thought “There’s no way this scummy company has any influence with the Canadian department of immigration”. So I ignored thier email. A few weeks later in flew into Toronto from Hong Kong and had no problems with immigration.</p>
