    <h1>You will never “fix it later”</h1>

<p>Recently I approved a pull request from a colleague, that had the following description: “That’s a hacky way of doing this, but I don’t have time today to come up with a better implementation”. </p>



<p>I’ve read somewhere (unfortunately I can’t find the source) that “The longer something remains unchanged, the less likely it is to change in the future”. </p>



<p>Surprisingly, it isn’t because we’re bad at our jobs, unprofessional, or simply uncaring. </p>



<p>There are a few, interconnected, reasons:</p>



<h3>Loss of context and confidence</h3>



<p>The further removed you are from the point where the code was written, the less you understand it. You remember less about what it does, what it’s supposed to do, how it does it, where it’s used, etc. </p>



<p>This type of thinking leads to fear, which inhibits change. </p>



<h3>Normalization</h3>



<p>The more you’ve lived with something, the more used you are to it. </p>



<p>For example – I recently moved house. In the first few days of unpacking, we didn’t have time or energy to re-assemble our bed frame. </p>



<h3>Higher priority</h3>



<p>This is a result of the previous two reasons. </p>



<h3>You’re now relying on that bad code</h3>



<p>Even though we know that this code is “bad”, we need to build other features on top of it. </p>



<p>For example, we wrote our data validation at the UI layer. But we know that data validation should happen at the domain layer. So we intend to move that code “later”. </p>



<p>A more serious, and “architectural” example:</p>



<h2>What’s the point, then?</h2>



<p>So, we realise that if we don’t fix something right away, we’re likely to never fix it. So what? why is that important?</p>



<p>Because it allows us to make informed decisions. Up until now, we thought that our choice was “either fix it now, or defer it to some point in the future”. </p>



<p>We can use this knowledge to inform our priorities:</p>



<p>We can even use this to inform our work agreements and processes. </p>



<p>If we keep believing that a deferred task will one day be done, we’ll never fix anything. </p>



<p>(Case in point: I thought about writing this post while in the shower yesterday. When I got out, I told my wife about it. She said “Go and write this post right now. Otherwise you’ll never do it”. </p>
