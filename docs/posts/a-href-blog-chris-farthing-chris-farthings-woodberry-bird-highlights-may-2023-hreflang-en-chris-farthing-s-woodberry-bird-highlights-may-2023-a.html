  <div>
    <div><p>A typical May here sees the tail-end of spring migration for the first half of the month, with the second half being more settled with little bird movement and our summer visitors settling down to breed. Things were a bit different this May, as a prolonged period of north-easterly wind in the middle of May meant that north-bound migration slowed down severely, but when the wind eventually changed, migration picked up again and carried on until the end of the month. </p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  <div>
          <div><p>It was the second peak in this unusual spring migration period which brought the most interesting passage migrants here. Most notable was a <strong>whinchat (above)</strong> on the 31<sup>st</sup>. This species is probably seen a bit less than once a year here, with more spring records than autumn records, unusual for a passage migrant. Two <strong>little ringed plovers</strong> were seen briefly on one of the tern rafts on the 22<sup>nd</sup>. This species is almost guaranteed to be seen on migration if the reservoir water level is low at the right time, but we have had a few years now with very few sightings. Two <strong>swallows</strong> passed over on the 31<sup>st</sup>.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>May is usually a quiet month for ducks, and the only notable visitor was a <strong>shelduck </strong>seen on the 12<sup>th</sup>. The following day saw a flyover <strong>oystercatcher (above)</strong>, this is another species which we are lucky to see once a year here.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>After being seen all through April, <strong>little egrets (above)</strong> continued to be a feature here for most of May, usually being seen fishing near the water inlet. <strong>Common terns (below)</strong> were seen throughout May, with one pair showing a lot of interest in one of our tern rafts.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>A pair of <strong>peregrines (below)</strong> were also very frequent visitors for most of May, and could often be found on the cranes of the building site next door.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Mid-May is usually hatching time for the local <strong>mute swans (below)</strong> and this year was no exception with 13 cygnets hatching between the reservoir pair and the adjacent New River pair. Things didn’t go well for the reservoir youngsters but the New River brood were still going strong at the end of the month.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>We saw some good warbler passage at the start of May with <strong>whitethroat</strong> being seen on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>,<strong> lesser whitethroat</strong> on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>, and a <strong>willow warbler</strong> on the 5<sup>th</sup>. Two pair of <strong>sedge warblers</strong> appear to have settled here to breed, along with two pairs of<strong> reed bunting (below)</strong>.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Other notable sightings during May were a flyover<strong> jackdaw</strong> on the 7<sup>th</sup>, an unseasonal <strong>kingfisher</strong> on the 21<sup>st</sup>, and a female <strong>kestrel</strong> on the 24<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in May 2023 was 64, quite a low total compared with previous Mays (average 68), high water levels probably being the most significant factor.</p>
