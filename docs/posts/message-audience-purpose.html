    <h1>Message Audience Purpose</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I have two pieces of content for you to consume:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.searchengine.show/listen/search-engine-1/playboi-farti-and-his-ai-homework-machine">Search Engine: What should we do about teens using AI to do their homework?</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nvKeu46jgwo?si=ozmqPq4L3hTg37HU">John Cleese&#39;s 1991 speech on creativity</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both focus on creativity in ways that inspired me. The first is a podcast investigating how different generations think about Generative AI and how it is affecting how we communicate, educate and create. The second is an older piece, focusing on how we can&#39;t create without taking the time and space to think and make things.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of great quotes in both, and while they are long, I highly recommend a listen.</p>
<p>The things I took away from them and am thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluating the output of AI is where the skill comes from, if you don&#39;t know how to make the thing, you probably won&#39;t be able to know if it&#39;s any good.</li>
<li>Forcing yourself to disconnect and make time longer than one hour is needed to get your brain spinning.</li>
<li>Dedicated space is often useful for separating work types.</li>
<li>When you don&#39;t understand something, turning it off is a common response. That&#39;s not a good way to understand it.</li>
<li>Address the problem, not the solution that you don&#39;t like.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing in particular I thought about after this was in the AI podcast, one of the interviewees mentioned &#34;Message Audience Purpose&#34; as the basis for evaluating how you should write. The context is talking about how US schools don&#39;t regularly teach this when it comes to writing. But it made me think about how I create creative works. I often ignore the message and the audience, focusing on the purpose. I think this is a mistake, and I&#39;m going to try to focus on the message and audience more in the future. I hope it helps my creative practices.</p>
<p>In particular, my goal and take away from these two posts when thinking about my creative output is taking the time to create, and during that, thinking a bit more about the work itself and my goals. Those goals should theoretically include message, audience and purpose. Similarly, I need to practice more, and make time and space to just practice my crafts.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>/Nat</p></div></div>
