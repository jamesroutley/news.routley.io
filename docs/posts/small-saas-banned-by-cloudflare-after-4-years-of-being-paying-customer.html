    <h1>Small SaaS banned by Cloudflare after 4 years of being paying customer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi, small SaaS founder here (tardis.dev) - I&#39;ve been heavy Cloudflare Workers user (currently 4 billions requests  &amp; 1PB of data per month) for about 4 years already and today at 00:00 UTC without any warning my account was restricted, both website and APIs are down or very very slow to respond/time out, customers are angry obviously. I confirmed with support that &#34;hmm, I see that your zone seems like being restricted due to 2.8 Limitation on Serving Non-HTML Content, see that there&#39;s high JSON data transfer&#34;. - which is bit strange as I&#39;m using workers which have different terms - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20791660 (confirmed by their CTO)...anyways I get it, perhaps I pay too little and should be on enterprise plan already, but when I got approached by Cloudflare sales team I explicitly asked if I can still be on pay as you go/self server model and reply was: &#34;Enterprise wise, that&#39;s up to you and you could likely get away with utilising self-serve as you go, but if you did choose to go enterprise (without R2) I might be able to have something approved in the xx/month range.&#34;</p><p>I would fully understand that I am required to upgrade, but why not sending me an email before shutting down my business completely? I even asked about such scenario on zoom meeting I had with their Sales and they said it will never happen - few weeks forward and here we are...anyways going back to replying to my customers emails regarding service outage.</p></div></div></div>
