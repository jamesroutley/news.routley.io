    <h1>They make USB-C cables with displays now</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>I’ve reached a point in my setup where most of the devices that I use are
based around the coveted USB-C port. This meant that I had a valid reason to get
a few extra because I didn’t yet have a stockpile of good USB-C cables.</p>
<p>That’s when I found out that there exist cables that have little screens on them
that show the power consumption of the connected device. This is a great little
addition
to <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/05/02/smartplugs/">my power consumption monitoring addiction.</a>
It’s also a simple way to understand if your device is charging at the speed
that you expect it to.</p>
<p>The cable I ordered cost 6.72 EUR. It is a bit stiff and hard to work with,
probably due to its supposed USB 4 support requiring actually good cabling and
shielding. It works well enough for an USB-C dock with a DisplayPort
connection that’s running a 3440x1440 display at 60 Hz.</p>
<p>It’s too early to give a definitive answer about the longevity of the cable.</p>
<p>You should be able to find these types of cables with a search query like “USB 4
Cable with LED Display”.</p>
<p>The paranoid side of me suspects that a cable like this one would be an ideal
place to hide a malicious chip. That’s the only downside that I can think of.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in going more in depth with measuring the power consumption
over USB, then you might want to look at other options.
