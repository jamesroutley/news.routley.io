    <p>OK, this is going to sound crazy: I believe all clocks are 30 seconds late.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get a few things out of the way: this is neither about time zones, nor leap seconds.
It&#39;s not about synchronization of clocks, and it&#39;s not about relativity or any obscure corner of physics.
I&#39;m talking about everyday clocks. The ones that you might have around in your house, like this one that sits on my desk:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/victorpoughon/post2image1-2.webp" alt="post2image1"/></p>
<p>Or even the clock on your phone! Maybe they&#39;re all correctly set very precisely to a very accurate reference clock, but here I will argue that they are still exactly 30 seconds late. In other words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be more accurate if they were thirty seconds ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-are-you-on-about">What are you on about?</h2><p>All the above clocks have one thing in common: they don&#39;t show seconds. They truncate down to the nearest lower whole minute, right? So when it&#39;s actually <code>14:15:45</code>, they&#39;ll show <code>14:15</code>.
And when the actual time goes from <code>14:15:59</code> to <code>14:16:00</code>, then that&#39;s when your clock changes from <code>14:15</code> to <code>14:16</code>.</p>
<p>They apply the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor function</a>!</p>
<p>Ok great. Now hear me out! Let&#39;s compute the average error between a usual (truncating) clock, and the precise current time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes the error is 1 or 2 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it&#39;s actually <code>14:02:01</code></li>
<li>Sometimes the error is almost 60 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it&#39;s actually <code>14:02:57</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the average error of a truncating clock is 30 seconds. Let that sink in for a moment: <strong>the average error of a clock is 30 seconds</strong>. If clocks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">rounded</a>
to the nearest minute instead of truncating, the average error would be 0. Therefore all clocks are 30 seconds late!</p>
<p>Similarly of course, all clocks that show seconds but not milliseconds are half a second late.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-just-a-convention">This is just a convention</h2><blockquote>
<p>But this is just a convention! Truncating, rounding or even ceiling are all valid, as long as we pick one and stick to it. By your logic we should say that it&#39;s Tuesday as soon as it&#39;s one second past noon on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well... kind of.</p>
<p>It would be weird if we rounded for years, months and days, that&#39;s for sure. I think most people think of those scales as intervals. In other words, July is a period of time, with a start and an end. So are years, centuries, seasons. We are inside of it or outside.</p>
<p>Is it the same for the current minute of the current hour ? I&#39;m not so sure.</p>
<p>Basically I&#39;m arguing that rounding for clocks would be more useful than flooring.
This is especially apparent when you&#39;re trying to calculate &#34;how much time until my next meeting?&#34;, and your next meeting is at noon. If it&#39;s 11:55, you would usually mentally subtract and conclude: the meeting is in 5 minutes. That&#39;s how I always do it myself anyway! But the most probable estimate given the available information is actually 4&#39;30&#34;!</p>
<p>If you had a rounding clock instead, 5 minutes would be the correct estimation.</p>
<p>In fact, as we go down the various scales of time all the way from years, months, days and we reach hours, that&#39;s when we start truncating! At hours! For example: if it&#39;s <code>10:43</code> and you are asked the time and (for some context appropriate reason) you reply with just hours, you would say it&#39;s 11! Personally, I would never say that it&#39;s 10 if the clock shows anything past <code>10:30</code>. I realize that&#39;s probably very different in other cultures, though! And I&#39;d be interested to learn about how different cultures approximate time in language.</p>
<p>So, looking at the various scales of time and how I mentally view them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Years</strong>: truncate. If the full date has <code>2019</code> in it, I&#39;ll say &#34;the year is 2019&#34; - all the way to the end. Saying &#34;it&#39;s 2020&#34; in September 2019 is super weird.</li>
<li><strong>Months</strong>: truncate. It&#39;s January all the way until it&#39;s February.</li>
<li><strong>Days</strong>: truncate. It gets a little weird if it&#39;s past midnight and I haven&#39;t slept yet. Is tomorrow today? Or is it the day after that? I think collectively we still haven&#39;t quite figured that one out yet. And that&#39;s ok. Kind of like how &#34;next Friday&#34; becomes ambiguous on Thursdays. Some cultures use times beyond 24:00, like 25:30 to indicate one hour and a half past midnight, and I think that&#39;s lovely!</li>
<li><strong>Hours</strong>: That&#39;s when mentally, I switch to rounding! At <code>15:48</code> I definitely feel like it&#39;s pretty much <code>16:00</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Minutes</strong>: At <code>15:48:57</code>, I definitely feel like it&#39;s <code>15:49</code>! But clocks switch back to flooring for for some reason! But mentally we round! This is why I feel like all clocks are 30 seconds late: because the truncating convention doesn&#39;t match my intuition at the minute scale.</li>
<li><strong>Seconds and below</strong>: definitely rounding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please someone tell me I&#39;m not crazy 🙃</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2025-01-07</strong>:</p>
<p>This kinda <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42612842">blew up on HN</a> and I want to clarify something: This is a tongue-in-cheek article! It&#39;s fun to think about, but in the end, this IS a convention and the most important thing about conventions is that we all follow the same ones. I&#39;m obviously not going to move all my clocks forwards by 30 seconds and neither should you! In many ways truncating is a much better convention and that&#39;s why we use it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been made aware that Big Ben is truly an analog clock and doesn&#39;t jump around every minute, so I&#39;ve removed that example. My bad! The point still stands because some &#34;analog&#34; clocks actually jump every minute and are not truly analog, but I should have picked a better example photo.</p>
