[note-- this was made with the help of a computer program that tries to express the meaning of any word by an adjective and a noun pair. Phrases like &#34;abstract astronomy&#34; for &#34;space&#34; and &#34;aquatic archipelagos&#34; for &#34;islands&#34; were generated by the program. Want to try it out? I made a <a href="http://73.172.60.168:8080/rhyme">web program using the same system but with rhyming terms</a> instead of the letter A.]</p>
