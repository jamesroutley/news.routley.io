Hi Emily,

<p>imagine me making many air quotes and speaking too fast:
Thanks for sharing the the „Dorley Sisters“. Another argument for the
origin of „basement fiction“ or „basement literature“ as genre is the
„Fritzl case“¹ where a father held his daughter captive for 24 years.
The „Dorley basement“ turns things „upside down“, men are „held below
and kept in the dark“.</p>
<p>In „Silo“ the basement is a shelter, same with „A quiet place“². The
scary is leaving the shelter (like Christine³ avoiding going out,
leaving Dorley Hall, during the first chapters).</p>
<p>One of my favourite terms is „chthonic“ as in „below ground“. Like in
„The Descent (2004)“⁴. Also, „underground“ associates with unconscious
and uncontrollable. Also „Hell“ as religious concept, or dark and less
known places like the dark woods or a dungeon. Also isolation and
metamorphosis/transformation as in „Alice in Wonderland“, „Beauty and
the Beast“, „Jekyll and Hyde“ or „Orlando“ from Virgina Wulf. Kafka and
Ovid used such themes that resonate with us since like forever.</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well and I was able to support your
argument that „The Sisters of Dorley“ is kind of „basement literature“
and shares more themes or tropes with „Silo“ like isolation
and segregation without using a pandemic or plague⁵ like theme.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out! I&#39;m so glad that <a href="https://www.fauxtrots.com/blog/basement-fiction">something I
wrote</a> resonated enough for you to send an email.</p>
<p>Wow, you&#39;re not kidding on the trigger warnings for the Fritzl case. That&#39;s
dark. (cw: rape, incest, imprisonment, etc)</p>
<p>I think you&#39;re onto something about there being fear/danger about leaving the
basement! Elsewhere in Dorley characters have panic attacks when they leave the
basement/hall for the first time. That&#39;s a parallel to the real life experiences
of trans women being afraid to venture out en femme early in transition, as well
as to the fear of infection that many people felt in 2020 (and that disabled
people feel to this day because people stopped masking), and the fear of anyone
targeted by a fascist regime. It&#39;s a fear and (justified) paranoia that the
world is out to get you.</p>
