      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I feel like every time I search for something I expect the products to be either fake, filled with fake reviews, broken when I receive them, or from a no-name fake brand that popped up last week.  It has become seemingly impossible to wade through the mess.<p>What&#39;s worse, there seems to be zero way to report these listings.  I tried submitting a review warning other customers about the fake reviews for a fake product, but the review was not approved.  In that particular instance, I was actively recommended a &#34;wasp trap&#34; by Amazon.  Curious, I saw it was rated 4.8.</p><p>Turns out the positive reviews were all for... a pet cemetery headstone (complete with photos, to make the issue completely unambiguous).  The listing itself was posted by a seller that had almost all negative reviews that were -- removed by Amazon!  The reason?  Amazon took responsibility, since it was fulfilled by Amazon.  The problem: none of the negative reviews had anything to do with things like shipping time.  They were all basically calling the product a scam.</p><p>This seems like a looming disaster for Amazon.  It baffles me that there is no way for customers to at least report these issues.  I&#39;ve done most of my shopping for the last 15 years on Amazon, but I&#39;m seriously considering stopping.  Is anyone else in this boat?</p></td></tr>
