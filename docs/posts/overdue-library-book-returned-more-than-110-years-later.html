It was adopted as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030657/" target="_blank">a 1938 musical</a> that starred Shirley Temple as Rebecca.</p><p>After the Boise Public Library welcomed the book home, it was placed in its history room, where books can be browsed but not checked out.</p><p>According to the library system, the book had originally been checked out from the <a href="https://www.boisepubliclibrary.org/about/history/" target="_blank">Carnegie Public Library</a>, a circa-1905 building on the National Register of Historic Places that is now devoid of books. </p><p>Readers could keep books for two weeks before fines were triggered, a pocket inside the cover said. </p><p>The book was more than 40,000 days overdue and could have amassed fines of 2 cents per-day adding up to more than $800, the Boise library said. But in the early twentieth century fines were capped at the purchase price of the book, which would have been $1.50, KTVB reported.</p><p>The figures are hypothetical these days.</p><p>Like other library systems, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/largest-public-library-system-u-s-says-it-ending-late-n1280887" target="_blank">New York City&#39;s</a>, Boise has <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/public-libraries-in-boise-nampa-to-ditch-late-fees/277-0fd1efa6-ea6c-4f73-b6c3-3892077ff9e4" target="_blank">eliminated late fees</a>. </p><p>&#34;It would be great if we could find out what happened, but that said, sometimes there are just mysteries in history,&#34; Martin said.</p></div><div><div><p data-test="byline-bio">Dennis Romero writes for NBC News and is based in Los Angeles.</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>
