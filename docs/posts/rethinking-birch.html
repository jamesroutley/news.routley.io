<h4>2022-09-25</h4>
<p>Context: <a href="https://birch.ink">Birch</a> is a 2d canvas-based editor and dev environment that runs code in the cloud. I&#39;ve been writing a series of blog posts about its development which you can see <a href="https://charles.inclouds.space/blog">here</a>.</p>
<p>When I started working on Birch I wanted to own a product that I could polish and contribute to day in and day out. Something I could make incremental progress on and be happy with. I wanted a project that could <em>theoretically</em> make money in the future.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve largely changed my perspective on this. I don&#39;t care about the &#39;day-in and day-out product&#39; or the money as much as I care about working on the forefront of what technology could be. On top of that I&#39;ve rethought some of the initial hypotheses Birch started with. If I were to continue down this road with Birch I would end up rewriting the entire frontend and a fair bit of the backend...</p>
<p>So I&#39;m pivoting away from Birch! I am just so excited about exploring some other areas. I spent the last few days reading, brainstorming, and delving into some tools-for-thought literature. Keep an eye out ðŸ˜„</p>
<p>But I also want to share some of my thoughts about Birch in the hopes that someone finds them useful and perhaps even picks up where I left off:</p>
<h4 id="1-the-canvas-hurts-more-than-it-helps">1. The canvas hurts more than it helps.</h4>
<p>I tried seeing how good I could get it, but even with snap-to-grid, the organization and placement of cards had a larger overhead
than seems warranted. It&#39;s nice to have all your cards visually laid out and organized, but getting there can be a hassle.</p>
<p>If I were to rewrite Birch I would use a multimedia list instead of a multimedia canvas. The &#34;multimedia&#34; here is important â€” tables, functions, charts, forms all in one conceptual place is a very good thing! The canvas... not so much.</p>
<h4 id="2-the-opportunity-is-still-good">2. The opportunity is still good!</h4>
<p>For the last two months I had been thinking more and more about the whole &#34;making money&#34; thing. I was the dreaded &#34;solution in search of a problem&#34;. Fortunately Birch is generic enough that it could apply well to a number of problems. The two I landed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&#39;s harder than it should to write a backend when you only know frontend coding, i.e. Birch could evolve into a &#34;Backed-as-a-service&#34; Ã  la Firebase, Supabase, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#39;s harder than it should be to interact with existing APIs and services. i.e. Birch could evolve into a &#34;Zapier for Programmers&#34; - high-level building blocks for people who prefer writing code to dragging around pipelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m still optimistic about the potential in both of these spaces! Both quickly building APIs and easily interacting with APIs remain unsolved problems. There are a lot of people who stand to benefit here. This should at some level be able to finance the effort to help them, right? I hope someone takes this opportunity and runs with it!</p>
<h4 id="3-the-database-has-so-much-room-for-improvement">3. The database has so much room for improvement.</h4>
<p>If I were to spend more time on Birch the first thing I would do would be to put some serious thought into a better persistence interface. (Prolog, anyone?)</p>
<p>The same issue I encounter with APIs shows up in the database space: What is the easiest and most flexible way to persist data if you don&#39;t care about performance or safety? Sqlite? Filesystems? Redis set to persist mode? Mongo?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think any of these are good answers. Key-value databases are conceptually simple but then users end up writing a query engine to deal with them. Don&#39;t get me started on SQL. There&#39;s a lot to say here that I&#39;ll save for another post, just: databases aimed at ease of use are not finished.</p>
<h4 id="4-being-completely-live-is-a-mistake">4. Being <em>completely</em> live is a mistake.</h4>
<p>... at least if you&#39;re trying to be a backend-as-a-service.</p>
<p>Birch right now doesn&#39;t have a deploy step: anytime you finish editing a function it&#39;s immediately in production, potentially able to handle requests. This could be convenient for scripting, but is completely unacceptable for a backend-as-a-service since broken edit states can cause downtime!</p>
<p>The liveness is interesting though. It makes things feel really fluid and, well, editable. I like that. If I were to continue iterating I would add a &#39;staging&#39; environment where your functions are by default live. Any edits would be immediately reflected in staging. Then there would be a deploy button to push everything in staging to prod.</p>
<p>This is not the same as developing locally and git pushing to prod! One could imagine more features where scrubbed prod data gets pulled into staging (Ã  la <a href="https://snaplet.dev">snaplet.dev</a>) or prod events get automatically forwarded to staging.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Anyways â€” this is an interesting space and I hope this serves as inspiration for future exploration! Maybe even for me?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and happy Sunday!</p>
