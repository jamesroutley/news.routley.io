    <h1>What I subscribe to</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was thinking about media I consume, and figured I&#39;d share some of my media subscriptions.</p>
<h2 id="for-podcasts">For podcasts</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.searchengine.show/">Search Engine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Search Engine is always doing interesting things about the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Vergecast and Decoder are fantastic long form podcasts that I generally find interesting and funny. Vergecast for commentary on tech news, Decoder for discussions on business.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I listen to a lot of NPR&#39;s podcasts. They are so good, so interesting, and so well done. Favorites are Up First, The Indicator, Pop Culture Happy Hour, and Short Wave.</p>
<h2 id="for-reading">For reading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">NYT</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I pay for a family subscription for my parents and my wife to NYT. It was cheaper than the four of us paying piece meal for the parts they used. While NYT has some problems (especially their opinion section), they still do good work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ProPublica is my favorite journalistic outlet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://highlandscurrent.org/">The Highlands Current</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Current is my local paper.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Craig Mod is one of my favorite writers.</p>
<h2 id="for-watching">For watching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>AppleTV</li>
</ul>
<p>I get these two for free through T-Mobile. I don&#39;t use them often, but with F1 moving to AppleTV this year, I imagine that&#39;ll change.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I pay for this because it lets me download shows to my laptop while traveling...</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d rather not have ads on my videos. Some of my favorite creators/channels are gigguk, Mother&#39;s Basement, Auto Focus, Andrew Huang, Eater, The Lot Radio, and others.</p>
<p>No idea if this was useful, but <!-- -->🤷<!-- -->.</p>
