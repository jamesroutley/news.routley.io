<p>Backlog getting you down? Drowning in technical debt? Delegate issues to Copilot so you can focus on the creative, complex, and high-impact work that matters most. Copilot coding agent makes this possible.</p>
<p>Simply assign an issue (or multiple issues) to Copilot just as you would another developer. You can do this from github.com, <a href="https://github.com/mobile">GitHub Mobile</a>, or the <a href="https://cli.github.com">GitHub CLI</a>. Copilot works in the background, using its own secure cloud-based development environment powered by GitHub Actions. Copilot explores the repository, makes changes, and even validates its work with your tests and linter before it pushes.</p>
<p>Once Copilot is done, it’ll tag you for review. You can ask Copilot to make changes by leaving comments in the pull request. Or, check out the branch locally and continue work in your IDE, with Copilot at your side.</p>

<p>Copilot excels at low-to-medium complexity tasks in well-tested codebases, from adding features and fixing bugs to extending tests, refactoring, and improving documentation. You can even assign multiple issues to Copilot at the same time.</p>
<p>Copilot coding agent is available now for Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise subscribers. If you’re on Copilot Enterprise, an administrator will need to enable the new <strong>Copilot coding agent</strong> policy before you can get access. Using the agent consumes <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions">GitHub Actions minutes</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests">Copilot premium requests</a>, starting from entitlements included with your plan.</p>
<p><em>Editor’s note (May 19, 2025): Starting today, Copilot coding agent is rolling out to GitHub Mobile users on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/NLskzwi5">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.github.android">Android</a>, as well as GitHub CLI. Availability for both platforms will gradually expand to more users throughout this week.</em></p>

<p>Starting June 4th, Copilot coding agent will use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests">one premium request</a> per model request the agent makes. This is a preview feature, and may be changed in the future.</p>
