    <h1>Jury finds Boeing stole technology from electric airplane startup Zunum</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>A federal court jury in Seattle on Thursday ruled against Boeing in a lawsuit brought by failed electric airplane startup Zunum and awarded $81 million in damages  — which the judge has the option to triple.</p><p>Zunum alleged that Boeing, while ostensibly investing seed money to get the startup off the ground, stole Zunum’s technology and actively undermined its attempts to build a business.</p><p>It accused Boeing of “a targeted and coordinated campaign” to gain access to</p><p>Zunum also accused Boeing of sabotaging its efforts to attract funding from aerospace suppliers Safran and United Technologies.</p><p>The jury found that Boeing had misappropriated Zunum’s trade secrets and breached its contract with the startup. </p><p>It also found that Boeing’s actions were “willful and malicious,” which opens the door for the judge to award triple damages plus legal costs in a case that has <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/collapsed-hybrid-electric-planemaker-zunum-sues-former-partner-boeing-alleging-misuse-of-trade-secrets/">already been running for more than four years</a>. </p>
<p>Boeing in a statement said it “respectfully disagrees with the jury’s verdict, which is not supported by the law or the facts. Boeing will pursue all available challenges to the judgment.”</p><p>Another part of the ruling awarded Zunum a further $12 million for Boeing’s alleged interference with Zunum’s relationship with Safran. And finally, the jury ruled the final award could be reduced by $20 million because Zunum failed to take action to mitigate the damage.</p><p>Taking all those amounts into consideration, U.S. District Judge James Robart could award Zunum a total of either $72 million or $235 million depending on his decision over tripling the basic damages.</p><h2>A Silicon Valley-style startup</h2><p>In 2017, Zunum, founded by Ashish Kumar and Matt Knapp, had <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/zunum-brings-silicon-valley-startup-style-to-electric-airplane-concept/">won funding from both Boeing and the state of Washington</a> for an ambitious plan to design and build a nine-seat hybrid-electric plane for city-to-city short-hop flights. </p><p>At its height, Zunum employed about 35 full-time employees at its Bothell headquarters, an additional 20 at Zunum’s electrical power facility in Elgin, Ill., near Chicago, and about 15 in Indianapolis, developing the plane’s ducted-fan propulsion system in a partnership with Purdue University. </p><p>But Zunum overpromised and failed to deliver. It never produced an airplane. It <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/local-electric-airplane-startup-zunum-runs-out-of-cash/">ran out of cash and collapsed in 2019</a>. </p>
<p>By then it had spent about $282,000 of a state grant and another $1.3 million from two investors: <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-launches-venture-capital-arm-invests-in-local-electric-airplane-firm/">Boeing’s Horizon X venture-capital division</a> and a venture-capital unit of New York-based airline JetBlue Airways.</p><p>In its response to the lawsuit, Boeing’s lawyers wrote that the story of Zunum’s demise was simply that of a typical failed startup.</p><p>“An ambitious startup’s reach exceeded its grasp, and investors fled,” Boeing’s filing states. “What preliminarily looked like an interesting investment prospect that promised a new hybrid electric or electric aircraft turned into a loss for Boeing.”</p><p>Rather than developing its own hybrid-electric design, Boeing said it developed only a “conceptual mock-up — a tool that Boeing used to evaluate the feasibility of the type of aircraft that Zunum hoped to build.”</p><p>The conclusion it drew from that mock-up was that “electric aircraft likely would not be economically viable for commercial passenger flights anytime soon.”</p><p>Boeing said other potential Zunum investors drew the same conclusion. It characterized the lawsuit as “Zunum’s latest attempt to extract more money from Boeing.”</p><p>Boeing has not publicly announced any proposal for its own version of a small hybrid-electric airplane.</p><p>The jury having sided with Zunum, Judge Robart will now decide the precise damages award and then Boeing will appeal. </p><p>The final outcome could still be some years away.</p>
