            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper introduces a new data-structural object that we call the tiny pointer. In many applications, traditional $\log n $-bit pointers can be replaced with $o (\log n )$-bit tiny pointers at the cost of only a constant-factor time overhead. We develop a comprehensive theory of tiny pointers, and give optimal constructions for both fixed-size tiny pointers (i.e., settings in which all of the tiny pointers must be the same size) and variable-size tiny pointers (i.e., settings in which the average tiny-pointer size must be small, but some tiny pointers can be larger). If a tiny pointer references an element in an array filled to load factor $1 - 1 / k$, then the optimal tiny-pointer size is $\Theta(\log \log \log n + \log k) $ bits in the fixed-size case, and $ \Theta (\log k) $ expected bits in the variable-size case. Our tiny-pointer constructions also require us to revisit several classic problems having to do with balls and bins; these results may be of independent interest.
