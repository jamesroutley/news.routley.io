<p>I’m going to be quick here. Let’s examine just one chart (usually that is not enough, but will do the job now).</p>

<p>Up until 2014 US GDP was similar to EU. In the past 10 years US GDP grew 10T USD, while EU grew 3T USD.</p>
<p>I believe that US foreign policy in 2025 is partially a result of this growth. American administration feels too powerful because it’s backed by the economy.</p>
<p>Previously the collective West was united by few simple ideas - a) trade benefits all parties (economically and safety-wise) b) security is better to do collectively.</p>
<p>America is currently responsible for 25% of the World GDP (106 T USD). It makes everything very unbalanced and it allows American politicians and oligarchs to have too much influence on the world and lives of people.</p>
<p>I think decentralization is the important idea we should try to pursue. Idea of decentralization is the foundation of America itself. I think it should work on the global scale too.</p>
<p>International politics often seems to be the derivative of economic situation. So it’s important to decentralize economy globally (and that would prevent political centralization - where we are one election away from some disaster).</p>
<p>Ok. What can one do?</p>
<p>I do not know about you but I came to the following conclusion.</p>
<p>I owe America a lot. This is the place where I’ve built my career, learned a lot and where  I’ve earned most of my lifetime income.</p>
<p>I’m very grateful to America and wish the best. I came to the conclusion that 25% of world total GDP is not good for the world and not good for America!
American idea is to have US States to be decentralized as much as possible, similarly the world should work with no clear centers (political, economical, cultural etc).</p>
<p>So I’ll continue to earn money in America but I will try to spend more and more money outside (Ukraine, EU, Canada, UK, New Zealand, Australia etc).</p>
<p>Every dollar I spend outside will reduce American GDP a bit but will grow GDP of another country.</p>
<p>I’m going to update this post with actual changes I’ve made.</p>
