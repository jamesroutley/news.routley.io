      <p data-block-key="yx97h">The internet was born as a way to connect people and data together around the world. Today, machine learning is upending the way that we interact with data and information. Language and multi-media models seek ever-larger datasets to train on – including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784257/google-ai-bard-privacy-policy-train-web-scraping">the entirety of the internet</a>. There are <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozillas-ai-funding-principles-open-source-building-blocks-for-philanthropy/">complex sociological and regulatory questions at play</a>; critical decisions to be made about copyright, safety, transparency, access, and representation.</p><p data-block-key="bu6uc"><a href="https://memorycache.ai/">MemoryCache</a>, a Mozilla Innovation Project, is an early exploration project that augments an on-device, personal model with local files saved from the browser to reflect a more personalized and tailored experience through the lens of privacy and agency.</p>

      <p data-block-key="3scq2">The way that humans think is uniquely personal to each individual. While individuals share many principles, values and properties of their surrounding communities and organizations, each of us has a unique perspective and set of information that we&#39;re exposed to on a regular basis. The process of making new insights from the content we create and consume is not a &#34;one-size-fits-all&#34; opportunity, and machine learning capabilities open up a vast range of new computing advancements and paradigms.</p>

      <p data-block-key="aieh9">Today, MemoryCache is a set of scripts and simple tools to augment a local copy of <a href="http://privategpt.dev/">privateGPT</a>. The project contains:</p><ul><li data-block-key="fro2t">A Firefox extension that acts as a simple &#34;printer&#34; to save pages to a subdirectory in your<code> /Downloads/</code> folder, and includes the ability to quickly save notes and information from your browser to your local machine</li><li data-block-key="al824">A shell script that listens for changes in the <code>/Downloads/MemoryCache</code> directory and runs the privateGPT <code>ingest.py</code> script</li><li data-block-key="9vlcq">Code to (optionally) update the Firefox <code>SaveAsPDF</code> API on a <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/linux_build.html">local build of Firefox</a> to enable a flag that silently saves webpages as PDF for easier human readability (by default, pages need to be saved as HTML in Firefox)</li></ul><p data-block-key="7qqdc">We see MemoryCache as a sandbox for experimenting with some of the quirkier, more unique parts of the brainstorming and idea generation process, all done entirely locally. Our test ground for MemoryCache is a gaming PC with an Intel i7-8700 processor, using <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/gpt4all-j">Nomic AI&#39;s groovy.ggml version of gpt-4-all model</a>. We&#39;re using the <a href="https://github.com/misslivirose/privateGPT">primordial version of privateGPT</a>, because our preliminary evaluations have found that newer models and versions of the application start to over-generalize the responses even after augmenting the model with personal data – in our environment, 75.3MB of documents saved from the browser and from personal blog posts, notes, and journal entries.</p><p data-block-key="598h8">MemoryCache is early, experimental, and a sandbox for exploration. You can follow along with <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/Memory-Cache">the project on GitHub</a>, or check <a href="https://memorycache.ai/">out our website</a> to stay up to date with our progress!</p>
