    <h1>Give Your Metrics an Expiry Date</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>(I wrote this back in May and failed to hit publish for some reason — which I discovered when I wanted to point somebody else to it. So publishing now!)</em></p><hr/><p>Today the expiry date for a dashboard metric came up. It’s a proxy trailing metric for Something We Care About. The details are unimportant.</p><p>Tracking it for the last eighteen months has helped us spot some opportunities to improve.</p><p>In the last six months exploring some of those opportunities has helped us improve month-on-month for the last six months.</p><p>Which is delightful!</p><p>But having an expiry date means we get to take a step back and reassess whether it’s still useful. While it’s still a half way decent proxy:</p><ul><li>we now have more of an idea what specific actions move Something We Care About — and can track those directly</li><li>while the metric lets us know we are improving, it doesn’t give a lot of signal on the rate of improvement</li><li>we’ve not used the metric to make any decisions with over the last three months</li></ul><p>The metric has turned from something valuable — something that helped us make decisions and drive action — to a little number that’s always saying “it’s good”.</p><p>It’s now failing the <a href="https://adrianhoward.com/posts/three-questions-to-help-triage-your-dashboards/">three questions I use to assess dashboard metrics</a>:</p><ol><li>Is it visible at the right time?</li><li>Is it actionable?</li><li>Is it used?</li></ol><p>So… time for that particular metric to be thanked for its service and retired!</p><hr/><p>Would we have retired it if we didn’t have the nudge from an expiry date? Probably not.</p><p>Looking at dashboards and metrics become a habit — that’s part of their value — and breaking habits is hard. Which can lead to a huge mess of unactionable and irrelevant pretty graphs — and a false sense of confidence that everything important is tracked and under control.</p><p>Which is why setting up little nudges to check whether a metric is still effective is so useful.</p><p>TL;DR: Set expiry dates for your metrics ;-)</p><p>ttfn.</p></div></div>
