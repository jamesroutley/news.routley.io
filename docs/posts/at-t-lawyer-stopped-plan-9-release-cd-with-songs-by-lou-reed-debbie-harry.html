    <h1>AT&amp;T lawyer stopped Plan 9 release CD with songs by Lou Reed, Debbie Harry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Plan 9 CD-ROM needed about 100MB for the full distribution, if that. We
hatched a plan to fill up the rest with encoded music and include the
software to decode it. (We wanted to get the encoder out too, but lawyers
stood in the way. Keep reading.) Using connections I had with folks in the
area, and some very helpful friends in the music business, I got permission
to distribute several hours of existing recorded stuff from groups like the
Residents and Wire. Lou Reed gave a couple of pieces too - he was very
interested in Ken and Sean&#39;s work (which, it should be noted, was built on
groundbreaking work done in the acoustics center at Bell Labs) and visited
us to check it out. Debby Harry even recorded an original song for us in
the studio.

We had permission for all this of course, and releases from everyone
involved. It was very exciting.

So naturally, just before release, an asshole (I am being kind) lawyer at
AT&amp;T headquarters in Manhattan stopped the project cold. In a phone call
that treated me as shabbily as I have ever been, he said he didn&#39;t know who
these &#34;assholes&#34; (again, but this time his term) were and therefore the
releases were meaningless because anyone could have written them.

And that, my friends, is why MP-3 took off instead of the far better
follow-on system we were on the cusp of getting out the door.

P.S. No, I don&#39;t have the music any more. Too sad to keep.

 was rather less than a CD.

 psycho-acoustic thing comparing compressed to uncompressed for
 somebody, or improving on the fraunhoffer algorithms which became MP3.
 The point was, the rest of us had to listen to CDs and Ken had the
 complete works of Bach (or something) on a hard drive, which we were
 told he kept in the office, and played at home over a landline of some
 horrendously high bandwidth, un-imaginable speeds like a megabit,
 imagine, a MILLION of those suckers. How dare he. Thats more than the
 whole of queensland. I imagine the truth is much less interesting, and
 there was no major IPR fraud going on at the labs coding stuff as MP3
 like we imagined, under the table.

 I imagine this would also have been a Datakit T-1. But surely that was
 a 1.44mbit carrier? T1 was smaller than E1 because europeans and
 asians learned to count to 32 not 24.

 This reminds me of a Ken story from the late &#39;90s.  I was at a conference
 that I won&#39;t name where Ken gave a talk about his compression work; if I
 remember correctly his goal was to fit all of the Billboard Top 100 songs
 of all time onto a single CD.  He showed us the big stack of disks that </p></div><p> he
</p><p>  made to give to us, but then said that to his
surprise the the lawyers
 refused to give permission.  At that point he became very focused on </p><p> messing
</p><p>  with his slides while everyone got up, got in
line, and took a disc. </p><p> After
</p><p>  the pile was gone Ken looked up and nonchalantly
continued his talk.

 That might also have been the conference at which Ken showed us videos of
 him in a MIG.
