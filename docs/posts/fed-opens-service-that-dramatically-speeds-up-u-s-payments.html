    <h1>Fed Opens Service That Dramatically Speeds Up U.S. Payments</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-module-name="article-body" data-module-version="1.0.0"><section><div><div><div data-submodule-name="composer-content"><div><p>The U.S. Federal Reserve&#39;s controversial instant payments service, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230720a.htm" target="_blank">FedNow, went live Thursday</a> with 35 banks and credit unions participating, the central bank announced.</p></div><div><p>Early adopters include JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, with 16 other institutions supporting processing of payments that the Fed argues will offer just-in-time access to paychecks and invoices.</p></div><div><p>&#34;The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient,&#34; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement.</p></div><div><div><p>Although FedNow has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/desantis-rfk-jr-misconstrue-fednow-digital-dollar-plans-rcna78591" target="_blank">faced some criticism</a> over potentially building a bridge to a future digital dollar, in a July 10 FAQ, the central bank <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/is-fednow-replacing-cash-is-it-a-central-bank-digital-currency.htm" target="_blank">denied the move was tied to putative plans to issue the dollar in digital form. </a></p></div></div><div><p>“The FedNow Service is not related to a digital currency,” the Fed said, with officials such as the Treasury&#39;s Janet Yellen arguing the U.S. should consider a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/13/yellen-stresses-need-for-central-bank-digital-currency/" target="_blank">central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC). “The FedNow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.”</p></div><div><p>The Fed says its new service will operate for <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fednow_about.htm">24 hours every single day</a>. While continuing to use commercial banks as intermediaries, central bank officials have previously said it will allow payments to be processed <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/collections/speeches/2023/sp-20230712-update-on-the-federal-reserves-instant-payments-service">in a matter of seconds</a>, something that’s already the norm in many other jurisdictions across the world. That compares to a same-day service from the existing U.S. automated clearinghouse system, or delays of days or weeks for cashing a check.</p></div><div><p>Officials including Powell have previously said the real-time payment network is needed to avoid having to depend on private sector alternatives, like the now abandoned stablecoin Diem (previously named Libra) by Marc Zuckerberg&#39;s Meta (previously Facebook) while some have seen it as a step towards a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/29/federal-reserves-fednow-set-for-mid-2023-debut/">central bank digital currency</a>.</p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Jul 20, 15:12 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds paragraph with extra details about the FedNow service.</i></p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Jul 20, 15:44 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds Fed Reserve&#39;s FAQ statement regarding CBDC.</i></p></div><div><p><i><b>UPDATE (Jul 20, 15:56 UTC): </b></i><i>Adds link to FAQ and clarifies date posted.</i></p></div><p>Edited by <!-- --> <!-- -->Sandali Handagama.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div></div>
