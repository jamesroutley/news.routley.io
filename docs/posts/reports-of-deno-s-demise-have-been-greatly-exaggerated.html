    <h1>Reports of Deno&#39;s Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been some criticism lately about Deno - about Deploy, KV, Fresh, and our
momentum in general. You may have seen some of the criticism online; it’s made
the rounds in the usual places, and attracted a fair amount of attention.</p>
<p>Some of that criticism is valid. In fact, I think it’s fair to say we’ve had a
hand in causing some amount of fear and uncertainty by being too quiet about
what we’re working on, and the future direction of our company and products.
That’s on us.</p>
<p>In other places, recent criticisms have been inaccurate, or speculative. That’s
why we’re writing this post; to set the record straight. This is a catch-up on
where we are, what we’ve learned, and what we’re building next. Some have feared
that Deno itself is diminishing or fading away, but this couldn’t be further
from the truth. Since the release of <a href="https://deno.com/2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno 2</a> last October - barely over six
months ago! - Deno adoption has more than doubled according to our monthly
active user metrics. Deno 2’s robust Node compatibility effectively removed a
major adoption barrier, unblocking a wide range of serious use cases. The
platform has gotten faster, simpler, and more capable. Deno is now used more
widely - and more seriously - than ever before.</p>

<p>One of the biggest questions we’ve been hearing is about Deno Deploy —
specifically, the reduction in available regions. While we understand the optics
of this scaling back, it isn’t for the reasons often feared or accused.</p>
<p>Rather, reality is: most applications don’t need to run everywhere. They need to
be fast, close to their data, easy to debug, and compliant with local
regulations. We are optimizing for that.</p>
<p>We launched Deno Deploy in 2021 to explore a new model for serverless
JavaScript. It started in 25 regions, grew to 35, and now runs in 6. That
reduction was driven by cost, yes - but also by usage. Most developers weren’t
deploying simple stateless functions. They were building full-stack apps: apps
that talk to a database, that almost always is located in a single region. We
saw that most of the time, the excess regions were mostly unused. When traffic
spikes came, the idle regions would hit capacity quickly causing latency spikes.
We found that routing to a further away larger region was often faster than
running in a nearby cold one.</p>
<p>We were chasing a vision of “edge” that didn’t match how people were actually
using the service. We shouldn’t have been silent about this.</p>
<p>Deno Deploy is under heavy development - we haven’t quite released the latest
version yet, but it’s imminent. You can
<a href="https://dash.deno.com/account" rel="noopener noreferrer">request early access here</a>.</p>
<p>Deploy is evolving into a platform for hosting applications - not just
functions. It’ll support subprocesses, background tasks, OpenTelemetry, build
pipelines, caching, and even self-hosted regions. It runs full-stack frameworks
like Next.js, SvelteKit, and of course, Fresh.</p>
<p>Soon, you’ll be able to pin your app to a region - or run it in your own cloud.
That’s something we’ve heard again and again from users who care about control,
compliance, and performance. More coming soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://deno.com/kv" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno KV</a> is our zero-setup, globally consistent key-value store with a
simple API and
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/examples/kv_watch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">real-time capabilities</a>. We realize
that for things like session data, feature flags, and collaborative presence, KV
works great. Developers love it for what it is: a zero-config global store that
just works.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t solve everything. It’s not a general-purpose database, and it
doesn’t replace relational systems for most applications. To address these
broader needs for state management, we have multiple efforts in the pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, we’re working on making traditional relational databases more readily
available and simpler to use within Deno Deploy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>And secondly, we believe that Deno KV itself doesn’t go far enough in
simplifying how compute and state are bound. So, inspired by systems like
Cloudflare’s Durable Objects, we are working on a new project to achieve this
deeper integration, aiming to bind state directly to computation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these new directions, Deno KV will remain in beta. We will continue to
address critical bugs and security issues for its current version. While KV is
useful for its intended purpose, its role is not to be the central or evolving
solution for all state management in Deno. We reserve the right to make
significant changes to Deno KV in the future as these other state initiatives
mature and our overall platform strategy evolves. We’re excited to share more on
these new pipeline projects soon.</p>

<p>Fresh is alive and well - it powers every app and website we build. We know many
of you have been eagerly anticipating Fresh 2, and perhaps some have felt
frustrated by the wait. We hear you. We could have shipped something sooner, but
it was crucial to get the fundamentals right and we didn’t want to compromise on
quality for a quick marketing splash. We depend on Fresh for all our sites, so
its excellence is paramount. We just wrote a detailed
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/an-update-on-fresh" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> about the significant improvements coming in
Fresh 2 – go read it! A stable release is coming later this year.</p>

<p>Deno isn’t just a runtime anymore; it’s a complete platform for building and
running JavaScript systems. Here’s what’s built in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/typescript/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</a> and
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/jsx/" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSX</a> support</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Granular permissions and sandboxing</a>
for secure execution</li>
<li>A full
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/lsp_integration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Language Server Protocol</a>
(LSP), <a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code extension</a>,
and <a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/check/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>deno check</code></a> for
type checking</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/jupyter/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter notebook integration</a>
with LSP-powered TypeScript type checking</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/compile/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>deno compile</code></a> to
generate standalone binaries</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/node/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong Node/npm compatibility</a>,
including
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/workspaces/" rel="noopener noreferrer">workspace support</a></li>
<li>First-class observability via
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/open_telemetry/" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in OpenTelemetry</a>,
providing structured tracing out-of-the-box. <strong>This is an essential
infrastructure piece, not an afterthought, as some have derided.</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/fmt/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>deno fmt</code></a> for
auto-formatting JavaScript, TypeScript
(<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v2.3#improvements-to-deno-fmt" rel="noopener noreferrer">and even CSS or SQL within template strings</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/modules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundamentally built on ES Modules</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/web_platform_apis/" rel="noopener noreferrer">web standards</a></li>
<li>A global deploy surface (via <a href="https://deno.com/deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno Deploy</a>)</li>
<li>A publishing system (<a href="https://jsr.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSR</a>) with open governance,
<a href="https://jsr.io/@std" rel="noopener noreferrer">a growing standard library</a>, and excellent workspace
support</li>
</ul>
<p>You can write, run, test, deploy, and monitor - all with a single toolchain.
We’ve been tightening integration. Fewer flags. Better defaults. Smaller gaps.
The pieces work together better than ever before.</p>
<p>We’re not chasing feature parity with other runtimes. We’re building a cohesive
system. We’re trying to fundamentally improve JavaScript development. If we have
faulted, it’s because we’ve stretched too far in this goal. But I don’t think
anyone can argue that Deno isn’t striving for a better world for the world’s
default programming language.</p>

<p>Scripting languages are the ergonomic end-state for a large class of problems:
business logic where engineering time is the limiting factor.</p>
<p>Ruby, Python, Lua, Perl, and JavaScript all follow that thread. But JavaScript
is the one distributed on every device, with standards bodies, independent
implementations across tech conglomerates, and a massive vibrant ecosystem. The
scripting language with a future we believe is JavaScript (and TypeScript). It
deserves a platform to match, not a patchwork of ad hoc tools. A single
batteries included system.</p>
<p>Just like JavaScript gives you garbage collection and built-in arrays, Deno
gives you a permissions system, a web server, observability, linting, and type
safety - all out of the box. You don’t need to glue it together. Deno is the
glue.</p>

<p>We’re not winding down. We’re winding up.</p>
<p>We’re continuing to improve performance, compatibility, and polish across the
platform. JSR is maturing. We’ve
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/jsr-open-governance-board" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently established</a> an Open Governance Board
and are actively working to transition JSR into an independent, community-driven
foundation.</p>
<p>Our work in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-source-phase-imports" rel="noopener noreferrer">TC39</a> and
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/wintertc" rel="noopener noreferrer">WinterTC (formerly WinterCG)</a> continues. We’re
also
<a href="https://javascript.tm/" rel="noopener noreferrer">actively challenging Oracle’s misleading JavaScript
trademark</a>. This is all part of our broad effort to
improve and grow the JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>We’re building new products based on everything we’ve learned from Deploy and
KV, not yet released. They aim to make persistent, distributed applications
simpler. More on that very soon.</p>
<p>We recognize that our silence has sometimes been a source of uncertainty, and
we’re committed to improving our communication as we move forward with these
exciting developments.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. And to everyone building with Deno: thank you.</p>
