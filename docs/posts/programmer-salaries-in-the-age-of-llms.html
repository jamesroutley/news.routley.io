                <p>What happens to the distribution of programmer salaries in the age of LLMs? I argue they will separate bimodally, much like what happened to lawyers’ salaries in the 1990s due to the rise of the Internet.</p>



<p>Dan Luu has <a href="https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/">previously written</a> about lawyers’ salaries. I will paste some graphs from his article. First, lawyers in 1991:</p>

<p>Next, lawyers in 2000:</p>

<p>What happened? Well, if you’re an elite lawyer in the modern age, you probably command a large team of lower-tier lawyers, cheap paralegals, and so on, who are very good at using the Internet to look up case law and draft your opinions and so on. In contrast, if you’re an elite lawyer in the year 1990, it’s much more valuable for you specifically to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all the relevant case law, and it’s much harder for you to delegate modular pieces of work off to less competent people.</p>



<p>Indeed Cowen makes a similar point about lawyers in <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/12/who-gains-and-loses-from-the-new-ai.html">Who gains and loses from the new AI?</a> where he writes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The returns to factual knowledge are falling, continuing a trend that started with databases, search engines and Wikipedia. It is no longer so profitable to be a lawyer who knows a large amount of accumulated case law. Instead, the skills of synthesis and persuasion are more critical for success.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I claim that the trend which AI/ML continues for lawyers is one that it starts for programmers. Just like how a partner at Cravath likely sketches an outline of how they want to approach a particular case and swarms of largely replaceable lawyers fill in the details, we are perhaps converging to a future where a FAANG L7 can just sketch out architectural details and the programmer equivalent of paralegals will simply query the latest LLM and clean up the output. Note that querying LLMs and making the outputted code conform to specifications is probably a lot easier than writing the code yourself ー and other LLMs can also help you fix up the code and integrate the different modules together!</p>



<p>More generally, the farther such technologies advance, the more existing technical professions will undergo a sort of “paralegalization” and bifurcation of the talent distribution.</p>



<p>Somewhat-above-average programmers (including myself) had a decent run of it, but it may be over for us before too long.</p>



<p>P.S. If your objection is that you played with ChatGPT and wasn’t impressed, you should try projecting trends beyond the t=1 month timescale.</p>
