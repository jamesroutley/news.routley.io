    <h1>Fulfilling a reader&#39;s request for my &#34;dot files&#34;</h1>
    
    
<p>
I got a bit of feedback the other day from Nate asking if I had dot 
files.  I certainly do.  I assume what they meant is if I have 
particular customizations, and then if I would care to share them.
I definitely have a bunch of particular changes, and as for sharing 
them, why not.  It lets me get a bunch of shots in at things that have 
become annoying over the years, and that means it&#39;s perfect for stirring 
up the hornet nests with a Friday night post.
</p>
<p>
Starting on my daily driver box that runs Debian, then:
</p>
<p>
I have a .bashrc that has a bunch of dumb two- or three-letter aliases 
which amount to &#39;ssh (otherbox)&#39;.  For some reason that is lost to time, 
they all start with the letter m, and then the second letter sometimes 
reflects the name of the target system - &#34;mm&#34; takes me to my Mac Mini 
(which also runs Debian), for instance.
</p>
<p>
The stock PS1 bugged me a bit, so I mangled it down to this:
</p>
<p>
export PS1=&#39;\h:\w\$ &#39;
</p>
<p>
... which turns into &#34;hostname:/some/path$ &#34;, in other words.
</p>
<p>
I think I&#39;ve had a prompt like that on my personal machines basically 
forever - probably back to 1994 if not before.  That&#39;s fine when I&#39;m 
just running things as myself.  If I run sudo, I get the stock setting
which ends up looking like this:
</p>
<p>
root@hostname:/some/path#
</p>
<p>
... and that&#39;s fine, too.  Making it look a bit different when rootly 
powers are in force is a good thing.
</p>
<p>
The next one is switching off another annoyance:
</p>
<p>
alias ls=&#39;/bin/ls -N&#39;
</p>
<p>
The -N switch to ls says &#34;print entry names without quoting&#34; ... and 
it&#39;s the difference between having just the filename shown, spaces or 
no, and having it &#39;wrapped like this&#39;.  The way I see it, if you&#39;re 
printing quotes there, they&#39;d better <em>be part of the damn name</em>.
It reminds me of the time they started doing crazy UTF-8 &#34;smart quotes&#34; 
in their error messages and I didn&#39;t know it had changed.  Cue me going 
&#34;WTF is this gunk in this filename?&#34; and thinking we had major 
corruption in the system somewhere.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d probably put up with the quoting if it didn&#39;t bump everything else 
out to the right another column.  Two spaces between the time and the 
filename?  Heresy!
</p>
<p>
The next two are filed under &#34;everyone sucks at setting colors in Unix 
tools so stop adding it to everything&#34;.  The first one is for sar:
</p>
<p>
export S_COLORS=never
</p>
<p>
... and the second one is something I 
<a href="https://no-color.org">found</a> a little later which seems to be
something that might work across multiple programs (assuming they&#39;ve
been patched to recognize it):
</p>
<p>
export NO_COLOR=&#34;eat flaming death you [elided]&#34;
</p>
<p>
You can guess what the rest of it says.  The actual value doesn&#39;t 
matter.  Just having it set does the job.  The value I put there is just 
to make me feel better every time I have to fight to get back to the 
perfectly working system I&#39;ve had.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for .bashrc.  Next, I have .gitconfig which is mostly boring.  
There&#39;s a [user] section which has name= and email=, and those are set 
to about what you would expect.
</p>
<p>
I have pull.rebase set to true because that&#39;s always what I would use 
anyway when doing a pull, and it started whining at some point.  So I 
put this in here to make it keep doing what I wanted.  This is because I 
don&#39;t do branches and other goofiness and just want a nice simple 
continuous timeline for my commits.
</p>
<p>
I also have init.defaultBranch set to main because, eh, why not?  I&#39;ve 
designed enough systems based on the old broken naming schemes and don&#39;t 
need any more.
</p>
<p>
I have a .gdbinit.  Why?  Same old story: the default now sucks.  It has 
one line:
</p>
<p>
set style_enabled off
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s amazing just how awful it is when it changes colors every time it 
hits a ( or &#34; or whatever.  How do people deal with that stuff?  So bad.
It&#39;s so nasty.
</p>
<p>
Next up, .nanorc, and this one is a three-ring circus.  Basically, for 
the longest time, I didn&#39;t need one of these.  Now, I add about one 
line on average every three or four years because - again - things keep 
changing for the worse.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s where things are now:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">syntax &#34;all&#34; &#34;.*&#34;
color yellow &#34;^$&#34;
unset locking
set emptyline
set breaklonglines
</pre>
<p>
The first two have been with me for quite a while now, and serve to 
disable syntax highlighting across the board.  Again, not my thing.
</p>
<p>
Line three stops it from pooping out stupid ~ files everywhere.  Not 
wanted, not needed, didn&#39;t ask for it, was forced upon me, had to murder 
it with a setting.
</p>
<p>
Lines four and five just put back behaviors that they dumped in 4.0: the 
blank line right below the status bar at the top, and the wordwrap that 
happens when you hit a certain column.  I use that all the time, like, 
well, *right now* writing this post.  It hard-wraps at 72, because OF 
COURSE it does.
</p>
<p>
Next is my .Xresources which provides a way to disable some obnoxious 
behavior in urxvt without having to recompile it.  For the longest time, 
I&#39;d chop it out and drop a custom binary into my bin directory.  Then I 
realized it could be tamed without such mangling, and here we are:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">URxvt.perl-ext:
URxvt.perl-ext-common:
</pre>
<p>
This has the effect of making it so a double-click highlights the whole 
word, and a third click highlights the whole line *even if* someone&#39;s 
holding a
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/12/21/env/">LISP convention</a>
on that particular row of the terminal.
</p>
<p>
Then I have a .xsessionrc which needs to exist because I now log in 
through xdm, and the window manager (fluxbox) ends up inheriting *that* 
environment.  Yep, it doesn&#39;t get a .bashrc type thing applied to it.  
(Not gonna lie - this took a while to figure out.  Quick, which of 
.bashrc, .bash_profile, .profile et al get run for any given type of 
login you do to a box?  Text mode, X *and* ssh all matter.)  Anyway, 
that means I have to twiddle my PATH in there, or the commands that 
fluxbox runs for me won&#39;t find anything in those extra directories.
</p>
<p>
That is, I like my .fluxbox/menu entries to be short and sweet, like 
&#34;term&#34;.  That&#39;s a small stupid script in my bin directory.  If that&#39;s 
not in my PATH then I&#39;d have to spell out the whole /home/blahblah 
thing, and that&#39;s just idiotic.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of fluxbox, that has a dot directory, and a startup script in 
there to set a few things up properly.
</p>
<pre class="terminal">xset b off
xset r rate 250 30
xset dpms 1900 2000 2100
xscreensaver &amp;
</pre>
<p>
Line one turns off the console beep - not that my machine has a PC 
squeaker any more, but I think some things try to be &#34;helpful&#34; by 
sending a beep into the system audio path.  That can be really 
obnoxious, like when I&#39;m deliberately holding down a key for whatever 
reason and get to the beginning of the line.
</p>
<p>
Line two is about getting that key-repeat going at a speed I like.  If I 
end up on a machine where that&#39;s not fast enough, it becomes obvious 
pretty quickly, and I have to go adjust things.  Not every situation 
allows for things like ^W to eat a word or ^U to eat the whole line, and 
so holding down backspace to change the wording of something is what I 
want.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, if I want to put a &#34;-------------&#34; divider somewhere, I don&#39;t 
want to wait for it to get going.  It looks like that means &#34;wait 250 ms 
before repeating, and then repeat at 30 Hz&#34;, but I had to look it up 
because it&#39;s been set like that for as long as I can recall.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe I want to hold down the cursor key to scroll something, or just 
move somewhere else on the line.  Same thing.
</p>
<p>
Annoyingly, this seems to be set in the keyboard itself and not on 
anything local to the machine, so if I have to replug the keyboard for 
some reason, I have to run that again or it&#39;ll be stuck in stock 
molasses mode.  This feels like a regression from the PS/2 days but I 
haven&#39;t bothered plugging in one of my old model Ms to verify this.
</p>
<p>
Line three just sets up the power-saver specifics on the monitor.  Those 
don&#39;t usually matter too much since I have a hotkey that explicitly 
locks things and then forces it to go to sleep right away, and I push 
that when I&#39;m done using this thing.
</p>
<p>
Line four, well, that&#39;s my dose of jwz, and that&#39;s what actually keeps 
the screen locked, as opposed to the legions of craptacular also-ran 
&#34;lock&#34; programs that always end up sucking and failing open.  I can&#39;t 
imagine how many years in total my screens have been protected by 
xscreensaver in &#34;lock&#34; mode.
</p>
<p>
The rest of that file just starts my three Window Maker-era widgets and 
those aren&#39;t important or even interesting.  There&#39;s a clock/calendar, 
the CPU load, and something to twiddle the system volume for when I have 
speakers or headphones connected.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s about it.  I don&#39;t use .plan or .project files any more since I 
haven&#39;t run fingerd for decades, and besides, my machines are all just 
me and nobody else, and so a local finger is also not a thing.  (Oh, get 
your minds out of the gutter.  It&#39;s the &#34;ratting out to the cops&#34; sense 
of &#34;finger&#34;.)
</p>
<p>
Want to see the last time I used that stuff?  Here&#39;s the file in my  
homedir archive from the last machine which had that running:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">-r-------- 1 rkroll rkroll 34 Apr 28  1996 .plan
</pre>
<p>
See, told you it&#39;s been decades.  All I did was rip off a line that I 
had seen in someone else&#39;s file that was intended to sow confusion:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">Segmentation fault (core dumped).
</pre>
<p>
The idea is that you&#39;d think that the far-end finger process crashed, or 
the far-end finger daemon, or maybe even *your local finger client*, and 
then you&#39;d run around trying to figure it out.  Then you&#39;d eventually 
realize what was going on and shoot a nerf dart at whoever wasted your 
time.
</p>
<p>
Ah, the &#39;90s.
