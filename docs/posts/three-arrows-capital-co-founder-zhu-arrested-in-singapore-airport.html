				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>The liquidators behind</span> Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the now-defunct crypto hedge fund, shared that the firm’s co-founder Su Zhu was arrested in Singapore at the Changi Airport while trying to leave the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teneo.com/service/financial-advisory/sector-expertise/financial-services/cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teneo</a>, a financial advisory firm controlling the liquidation and management of affairs for the defunct crypto hedge fund, said it got a “committal order” against Zhu after he failed to comply with court orders to cooperate with the liquidation investigation. The order sentenced Zhu to four months in prison, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The advisory firm added that a similar committal order was granted against the other 3AC co-founder, Kyle Davies, who is also being called for four month imprisonment. Davies’ whereabouts remain unknown, according to Teneo.</p>
<p>For context, the firm once managed an estimated $10 billion in assets and was a major entity among crypto market players. In July 2022, 3AC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/crypto-mega-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-reportedly-files-for-bankruptcy-in-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy</a> in New York.</p>
<p>The hedge fund’s prior insolvency forced major crypto players to rearrange their operations and limit customer withdrawals amid a crypto sell-off that seemed to catch plenty of mega firms off guard at the time, after the collapse of the Terra/LUNA project.</p>
<p>Teneo did not immediately reply to a request for comment from TechCrunch.</p>
