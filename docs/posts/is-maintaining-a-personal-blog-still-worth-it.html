    <h1>Ask HN: Is maintaining a personal blog still worth it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Remember when maintaining a blog was THE way to build your developer brand?</p><p>When thoughtful technical writing could lead to speaking gigs, job offers, and meaningful connections?</p><p>But in 2025, the landscape has shifted dramatically:</p><p>- LinkedIn&#39;s algorithmic feed heavily favors short-form &#34;broetry&#34; over substantive technical content
- Twitter/X has become a battleground of AI-generated hot takes
- Medium is drowning in SEO-optimized tutorials that all say the same thing</p><p>Unless you&#39;re already established or willing to play the AI-SEO game, it feels impossible to build genuine readership for a technical blog in 2025.</p><p>Yet part of me wonders if I&#39;m just being cynical. Maybe there&#39;s still value in writing for its own sake? Or perhaps there are distribution channels I haven&#39;t considered?</p><p>For those still maintaining personal blogs: How do you find readers? Where do you share your content? And most importantly - why do you keep writing?</p></div></div></div>
