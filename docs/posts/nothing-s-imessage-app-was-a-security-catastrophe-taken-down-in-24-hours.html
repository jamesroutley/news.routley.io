<p>It turns out companies that stonewall the media&#39;s security questions actually aren&#39;t good at security. Last Tuesday, Nothing Chats—a chat app from Android manufacturer &#34;Nothing&#34; and upstart app company Sunbird—brazenly claimed to be able to hack into Apple&#39;s iMessage protocol and give Android users blue bubbles. We <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/nothing-phone-says-it-will-hack-into-imessage-bring-blue-bubbles-to-android/">immediately flagged</a> Sunbird as a company that had been making empty promises for almost a year and seemed negligent about security. The app launched Friday anyway and was immediately ripped to shreds by the Internet for many security issues. It didn&#39;t last 24 hours before Nothing pulled the app from the Play Store Saturday morning. The Sunbird app, which Nothing Chat is just a reskin of, has also been put &#34;on pause.&#34;</p>
<p>The initial sales pitch for this app—that it would log you into iMessage on Android if you handed over your Apple username and password—was a huge security red flag that meant Sunbird would need an ultra-secure infrastructure to avoid disaster. Instead, the app turned out to be about as unsecure as you could possibly be. Here&#39;s Nothing&#39;s statement:</p>

<p>How bad are the security issues? Both <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/11/18/nothing-chats-sunbird-unencrypted-data-privacy-nightmare/">9to5Google</a> and <a href="https://texts.blog/2023/11/18/sunbird-security/">Text.com</a> (which is owned by <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the company behind WordPress) uncovered shockingly bad security practices. Not only was the app not end-to-end encrypted, as claimed numerous times by Nothing and Sunbird, but Sunbird actually logged and stored messages in plain text on both the error reporting software <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">Sentry</a> <em>and</em> in a Firebase store. Authentication tokens were sent over unencrypted HTTP so this token could be intercepted and used to read your messages.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The Text.com investigation uncovered a pile of vulnerabilities. The blog says, &#34;When a message or an attachment is received by a user, they are unencrypted on the server side until the client sends a request acknowledging, and deleting them from the database. This means that an attacker subscribed to the Firebase Realtime DB will always be able to access the messages before or at the moment they are read by the user.&#34; Text.com was able to intercept an authentication token sent over unencrypted HTTP and subscribe to changes occurring to the database. This meant live updates of &#34;Messages in, out, account changes, etc&#34; not just from themselves, but other users, too.
</p><p>Text.com released a <a href="https://github.com/batuhan/sunbird-poc/tree/main">proof-of-concept</a> app that could fetch your supposedly end-to-end encrypted messages from Sunbird&#39;s servers. <a href="https://twitter.com/batuhan/status/1725985096463724838">Batuhan Içöz</a>, a product engineer for Text.com, also released a tool that will delete some of your data from Sunbird&#39;s servers. Içöz reccomends that any Sunbird/Nothing Chat users change their Apple IDs now, revoke Sunbird&#39;s session, and &#34;Assume your data is already compromised.&#34;</p>
<p>9to5Google&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1725872540873081000">Dylan Roussel</a> investigated the app and found that, in addition to all of the public text data, &#34;All of the documents (images, videos, audios, pdfs, vCards...) sent through Nothing Chat AND Sunbird are public.&#34; Roussel found 630,000 media files are currently stored by Sunbird, and apparently he could access some. Sunbird&#39;s app suggested that users transfer vCards—virtual business cards full of contact data—and Roussel says the personal information of 2,300-plus users are accessible. Roussel calls the whole fiasco &#34;probably the biggest &#34;privacy nightmare&#34; I&#39;ve seen by a phone manufacturer in years.&#34;</p>
