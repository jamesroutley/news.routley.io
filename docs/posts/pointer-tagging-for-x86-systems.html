Pointers are a fact of life for developers working in numerous languages.
It is often convenient to be able to associate a small
amount — a few bits at most — of ancillary information with a pointer.
This can often be done within the pointer value itself with some careful
masking and shifting.  CPU manufacturers have been adding ways to support
the addition of this sort of &#34;tag&#34; to pointers; the most recent may be
AMD&#39;s &#34;upper address ignore&#34; (UAI) feature, support for which was
recently <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220310111545.10852-1-bharata@amd.com/">posted</a>
by Bharata B Rao.  This feature has an uncertain future in Linux, though,
as the result of a fundamental design decision.
</p><p>
On a 64-bit system, a pointer is, naturally, 64 bits wide.  But the CPU
does not actually need all of those bits to dereference an address stored
in a pointer.  There are no systems (yet) that require — or can provide —
all of the memory that can be addressed by 64 bits, meaning that there
are ranges of address space that do not map to physical memory.  Normally,
user-space addresses start at (or near) zero and increase from there; that
means that the highest-order bits will be zero even with the largest
possible addresses.  As a result, it can be possible to use those
high-order bits to store other types of information.
</p><p>
There are numerous use cases for stashing metadata into those unused bits.
Memory allocators could use that space to track different memory pools, for
example, or for garbage collection.  Database management systems have their
own uses for that space.  Applications can implement this sort of tagging
now, but it must be done with care; an address with extra bits set is no
longer a valid pointer, so that metadata must be masked out before
dereferencing that pointer or passing it into code that does not understand
the tagging scheme.  That is error-prone and may slow down the application.
</p><p>
To make life easier for the developers of this sort of application, CPU
manufacturers have been adding the ability for the processor to simply
ignore the non-address bits in an address value.  Naturally, every
manufacturer has invented its own way of supporting this feature.  The AMD
version, UAI, specifically allows the uppermost seven bits of an address to
be used for ancillary data.
</p><p>
If accepted, AMD&#39;s implementation of this feature would not be the first;
support for the Arm &#34;top-byte ignore&#34; feature was merged for the 5.4 kernel
in 2019.  At that time, a set of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html"><tt>prctl()</tt></a>
commands was added to control the use of this feature.  Top-byte ignore
can be enabled with:
</p><pre>    int prctl(PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL, PR_TAGGED_ADDR_ENABLE, 0, 0, 0);
</pre>
<p>
This interface was designed around Arm&#39;s implementation, which makes eight
bits available for tag data.  The AMD implementation only allows for seven
bits, meaning that applications wanting to use tagged addresses will need a
way to discover how many bits are available.  So Rao&#39;s patch set starts
with <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220310111545.10852-2-bharata@amd.com/">a
patch from Kirill Shutemov</a> (intended to add support for a similar Intel
feature, more about that below) adding two new parameters to the above
<tt>prctl()</tt> call, both of which are integer pointers.  The first of
those is for the caller to specify how many bits they would like to use for
pointer metadata; the kernel will update that value to reflect the number
of bits that are actually available.  The second pointer tells the kernel
where to store the number of bits to right-shift a pointer value to obtain
the tag data.
</p><p>
The subsequent patches then implement support for UAI in the Linux kernel.
</p><p>
The idea is simple enough, and this feature already exists for the Arm
architecture, but the UAI patches have still run into pushback, for a
number of reasons.  Perhaps the most fundamental of those is that UAI
allows the most-significant bit of the address to be used by user space.
In current systems, only kernel-space addresses have that bit set.  Turning
on UAI would allow user space to create pointer values that <i>look</i> like
kernel addresses, but which would actually be valid user-space pointers.
Those pointers can, of course, be passed into the kernel via
system calls where, in the absence of due care, they might be interpreted
as kernel-space addresses.  The consequences of such confusion would not be
good, and the possibility of it happening is relatively high.
</p><p>
This mechanism could probably be made to work safely, but, as Andy Lutomirski
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/6a5076ad-405e-4e5e-af55-fe2a6b01467d@www.fastmail.com/">said</a>:
&#34;<span>A lot of auditing of existing code would be needed to make it safe</span>&#34;.
Even more auditing would be required, of course, to keep it safe in a
rapidly evolving kernel.  It sounds like a recipe for ongoing security
problems, which is why Thomas Gleixner <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/87fsnac3pb.ffs@tglx/">said</a> that &#34;<span>there is
no justification for the bit 63 abuse</span>&#34;.  He suggested that AMD
should rework the feature in its processors to disallow that bit in address
tags; he did not 
say that this problem would block the merging of UAI, but the meaning was
reasonably clear.
</p><p>
Another problem that Lutomirski pointed out is that UAI is not specific to
any running context; once it is enabled, it is turned on for the entire
CPU.  That, too, could lead to unpleasant surprises, so he suggested that
the kernel would need to make the UAI settings process-local, even if it
slows down context switches considerably.
</p><p>
Finally, there is the issue of Intel&#39;s similar feature, called &#34;Linear
Address Masking&#34; (LAM).  It does not have the most-significant-bit issue
that UAI has, and it is managed as part of the process context.  It
supports two modes, with either six or 15 bits being made available
for ancillary data; the 15-bit mode only works if five-level page tables
are not in use.  LAM has been around for a while, and <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20210205151631.43511-1-kirill.shutemov%40linux.intel.com/">support
patches</a> were posted (by Shutemov) in early 2021.  That work seems to
have stalled after that posting, but can be expected to come back at some
point.
</p><p>
Rao&#39;s UAI patch set deliberately keeps the AMD implementation entirely
separate from the proposed LAM implementation, even though the two are
doing essentially the same thing.  That led recently appointed x86
co-maintainer Dave Hansen to <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/81b6f618-05bc-f7d0-5461-4c3f0ca42d3f@intel.com/">object</a>:
&#34;<span>We&#39;ll have one x86 implementation of address bit masking.  Both the
Intel and AMD implementations will feed into a shared
implementation</span>&#34;.  So this is something that would certainly need to
be fixed before this work could be considered for mainline merging.
</p><p>
The other issues are tied to the design of the hardware, though, and will
be rather harder to fix in kernel code.  For these reasons, the sentiment
among kernel developers seems to be that LAM is a better-designed
implementation of pointer tagging and should perhaps be what all x86
systems use.  In the above-linked message, Lutomirski concluded:
</p><blockquote>
	I believe it&#39;s possible for a high-quality kernel UAI
	implementation to exist, but, as above, I think it would be slow,
	and it might be quite complex and fragile.  Are we sure that it&#39;s
	worth supporting it?
</blockquote>
<p>
A better solution, he suggested, would be for AMD to go back to the drawing
board and create its own implementation of LAM instead.
</p><p>
In the early days of Linux, kernel developers had to adapt to whatever the
hardware manufacturers put out; the alternative was to not have hardware to
run on at all.  In 2022, though, those developers feel more confident in
their ability to reject support for hardware features that, for whatever
reason, they feel do not fit in well with the design of the system.  If AMD
is unable to get support for UAI into the kernel (it&#39;s worth noting that
Rao <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/b0861376-e628-06bd-713e-8837e0dc9d0b@amd.com/">hasn&#39;t
given up yet</a>), UAI is likely to go
mostly unused and developers needing pointer tagging may gravitate toward
competing CPUs.  According to Gleixner (linked above), AMD was told about
the problems with its implementation some time ago; the company may yet
have reason to wish it had listened.</p>
