    <h2>Two Years and Over 700 Websites Later</h2>
<time datetime="2022-07-18T00:00:00-04:00">Mon, 18 Jul 2022</time>
<p>Although the second “birthday” of the 1MB Club is officially <em>November 19</em>, I couldn’t help by write down some of my thoughts about this project over the past two years. I honestly have nothing but positive things to say and the amount of interest in this silly side project has been wonderful!</p>

<h2 id="some-fun-stats">Some Fun Stats</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at some stats that don’t mean anything of <em>real</em> importance (please note - these figures are based on stats collected at the time of writing):</p>

<p>The <strong>Github</strong> repo has the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>290 stars</li>
  <li>197 forks</li>
  <li>391 commits</li>
  <li>246 contributors</li>
  <li>351 pull requests (all closed!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some fun facts about the <strong>website</strong> itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>742 total members</li>
  <li>Total size of all member websites combined: <strong>169.4 MB</strong></li>
  <li>Average member website size: <strong>228.3 KB</strong></li>
  <li>8 <a href="https://1mb.club/#hof">Hall of Fame</a> members (thank you!)</li>
  <li>3 website redesigns since launch (<a href="https://1mb.club/blog/club-updates/">read more</a>)</li>
  <li>Switched hosting from Netlify to NearlyFreeSpeech.NET</li>
  <li>Recently added a web-focused <a href="https://1mb.club/blog">blog</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>I’m still passionate about making a leaner, more performance-based web. I still get excited seeing another member request pop into my inbox. I love getting to visit those submitted websites and discovering something <em>new</em> on the internet. Something I otherwise would have probably missed. It’s a good reminder how truly massive the size of the internet is.</p>

<p>I should also mention that the members who have requested to join have been nothing but nice. It’s been great interacting with so many others who share the same passion for a “smaller” web footprint. My hope is to keep this collection growing for as long as I possibly can.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

<p>– Brad</p>
