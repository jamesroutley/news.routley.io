    <h1>Ask HN: What Is a COO?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Throughout my career I&#39;ve held exclusively engineering positions. However, I&#39;ve noticed the parts of my work I enjoy the most aren&#39;t necessarily the technical challenges, but instead improvements to process and productivity.</p><p>My favourite books are &#39;Getting Things Done&#39; [0], and &#39;Deep Work&#39; [1]. I also consistently try to find improvements to communication, requirement clarification, and decision making.</p><p>Is this mindset aligned with what would be expected from a COO? I know virtually nothing about the position apart from a line that stuck with me (paraphrased): &#39;A COO is similar to a CEO, where they have to do the same amount of work but don&#39;t get to make any of the decisions&#39;.</p><p>Do you have any insights or books/article recommendations for what the role of COO looks like? It would be greatly appreciated</p><p>[0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done
