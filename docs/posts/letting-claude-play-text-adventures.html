    <h1>Letting Claude play text adventures</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The other day I went to an <a href="https://luma.com/ycc02hpc">AI hackathon</a> organized by my friends
<a href="https://x.com/lucia_quirke">Lucia</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mahlenr">Malin</a>. The theme was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanistic_interpretability">mech interp</a>, but I hardly
know PyTorch so I planned to do something at the API layer rather than the model
layer.</p>

<p>Something I think about a lot is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_architecture">cognitive architectures</a> (like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soar_(cognitive_architecture)">Soar</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT-R">ACT-R</a>). This is like a continuation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI">GOFAI</a>
research, inspired by cognitive science. And like GOFAI it’s never yielded
anything useful. But I often think: can we scaffold LLMs with cog arch-inspired
harnesses to overcome their limitations?</p>

<p>LLM agents like <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">Claude Code</a> are basically “accidental” cognitive
architectures: they are designed and built my practitioners rather than
theorists, but they have commonalities, they all need a way to manage memory,
tool use, a task agenda etc. Maybe building an agent on a more “principled”
foundation, one informed by cognitive science, yields a higher-performing
architecture.</p>

<p>So I sat around a while thinking how to adapt Soar’s architecture to an LLM
agent. And I sketched something out, but then I thought: how can I prove this
performs better than baseline? I need an eval, a task.</p>

<p>Math problems? Too one-shottable. A chatbot? Too interactive, I want something
hands-off and long-horizon. A coding agent? That’s too freeform and requires too
much tool use. And then I thought: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">text adventures</a>! You have a stylized,
hierarchically-structured world accessible entirely tthrough text, long-term
goals, puzzles, physical exploration and discovery of the environment. Even the
data model of text adventures resembles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)">frame-based</a> knowledge
representation systems. And there’s a <a href="https://ifdb.org/">vast collection</a> of games available
online.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorhead"><em>Anchorhead</em></a>, which I played years ago, is a Lovecraft-inspired text
adventure by Michael S. Gentry. It takes on the order of hundrds of turns to win
across multiple in-game days. And the game world is huge and very open. In other
words: a perfect long-horizon task.</p>

<p>So I started hacking. The <a href="https://davidgriffith.gitlab.io/frotz/">frotz</a> interpreter runs on the command line and has a
“dumb” interface called <code>dfrotz</code>, which takes the ncurses fluff out, and gives
you a very stripped command-line experience. It looks like this:</p>

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent&#39;s office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

 Alley                                               day one

Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.

<p>Now we can play the game from Python: send commands, get game output. Now we
need the dual of this: a player.</p>

<p>The trivial harness is basically nothing at all: treat the LLM/game interaction
like a chat history. The LLM reads the game output from the interpreter, writes
some reasoning tokens, and writes a command that is sent via <code>stdin</code> to the
interpreter.</p>

Hello Claude. Your task is to play an adventure game. I&#39;ve hooked up
your output to the dfrotz (dumb frotz) interpreter.

The structure of your output is fairly freeform. The first line that
starts with `&gt;` (and only the first line!) is interpreted as a game
command, everything else is uninterpreted commentary, e.g. you may
write:

    We should go north to explore the church.

    &gt;go north

    Maybe we can use the silver key there.

If you write multiple `&gt;` lines in one response, all but the first
will be ignored.

Have fun! 😊

<p>And this works well enough. Haiku 4.5 would mostly wander around the game map,
but Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 manage to solve the game’s first puzzle—breaking
into the real estate office, and finding the keys to the mansion—readily
enough. It takes about ~200 turns for Claude to get to the second in-game day.</p>

<p>The way I thought this would fail is: attention gets smeared across the long
context, the model gets confused about the geometry of the world, its goal and
task state, and starts confabulating, going in circles, etc.</p>

<p>As usual, I was outsmarting myself. The reason this fails is you run out of
credits. By the time you get to day two, each turn costs tens of thousands of
input tokens. No good! We need a way to save money.</p>



<p>Ok, let’s try something that’s easier on my Claude credits. We’ll show Claude
the most recent five turns (this is the perceptual working memory), and give it
a simple semantic memory: a list of strings that it can append entries to, and
remove entries from using tool use.</p>

<p>This keeps the token usage down:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/letting-claude-play-text-adventures/plot.png" alt="A line plot of tokens per request over time. A red line, representing the trivial harness, goes up linearly, reaching over 40,000 tokens per request at around turn 350. A green line, representing the memory-augmented harness, climbs more slowly, reaching only 10,000 tokens at turn 500."/></p>

<p>The problem is the narrow time horizon. With the trivial harness, Claude can
break into the real estate office in ~10 turns, and does so right at the start
of the game. With this new harness, Claude wanders about the town, taking
copious notes, before returning to the real estate office, and it spends ~40
turns fumbling around with the garbage cans before managing to break into the
real estate office.</p>

<p>The next step, after getting the keys to the house, is to meet your husband
Michael at the University and head home. Claude with the trivial harness takes
about ~100 turns to find the house, with some tangential wandering about the
town, and reaches day two around turn 150.</p>

<p>Claude, with the memory harness, took ~250 turns just to get the keys to the
house. And then it spends hundreds of turns just wandering in circles around the
town, accumulating redundant memories, and hits the turn limit before even
finding the house.</p>



<p><em>Anchorhead</em> is a long, broad game, and from the very beginning you can forget
the plot and wander about most of the town. It takes a long time to see if a run
with an agent goes anywhere. So I thought: I need something smaller.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Claude can make its own games. The <a href="https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/">Inform 7</a> package for
NixOS was broken (though <a href="https://github.com/mbrock">Mikael</a> has <a href="https://github.com/mbrock/inform7-nix">fixed this</a> recently) so I had
to use <a href="https://www.inform-fiction.org/">Inform 6</a>. I started with a trivial escape-the-room type game, which
was less than 100 lines of <code>.inf</code> code and any Claude could beat it less than 10
turns. Then I asked for a larger, multi-room heist game.</p>

<p>This one was more fun. It’s short enough that Claude can win with just the
trivial harness. I tried a different harness, where Claude has access to only
the last five turns of the game’s history, and a read-write memory
scratchpad. And this one was interesting.</p>

<p>First, because Claude only ever adds to its own memory, it never deletes
memories. I thought it would do more to trim and edit its scratchpad.</p>

<p>Second, because Claude become fixated on this red-herring room: a garden with a
well. It kept going in circles, trying to tie a rope to the well and climb
down. Because of the limited game history, it only realized it was stuck when it
saw that the most recent ~20 entries it wrote to its memories related to various
attempts to go down the well. Then I watched Claude walk away from the garden
and solve the final puzzle, and hit the turn limit just two turns short of
winning.</p>

<p>Tangent: I wonder if models are better at playing games created by other
instances of the same model, by noticing tiny correlations in the text to infer
what puzzles and obstacles they would have written.</p>

<p>In the end I abandoned the “small worlds” approach because the games are too
stylized, linear, and uninteresting. <em>Anchorhead</em> is more unwieldy, but more
natural.</p>



<p>I have a bunch of ideas I want to test, to better learn how harness
implementations affect performance. But I’m short on time, so I’m cutting it
here and listing these as todos:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Domain-Specific Memories:</strong> Claude’s notes are all jumbled with information
on tasks, locations, etc. It might be better to have separate memories: a todo
list, a memory of locations and their connections, etc. This is close to the
Soar approach.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Geography:</strong> related to the above, the harness can inspect the
game output and build up a graph of rooms and their connections, and format it
in the context. This saves Claude having to note those things manually using a
tool.</li>
  <li><strong>Manual Geography:</strong> the automatic geography approach has a few
drawbacks. Without integration into the Z-machine interpreter, it requires
some work to implement (parsing the currente location from the <code>dfrotz</code>
output, keeping track of the command history to find standard travel commands
e.g. <code>go south</code>) but isn’t 100% deterministic, so that mazes and dynamic rooms
(e.g. elevators) will confuse the system. So, instead of doing it manually, we
could give Claude a tool like <code>link(room, direction, other_room)</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Episodic Memory:</strong> this feels like cheating, but, at the end of a run, you
can show Claude the session transcript and ask it to summarize: what it
accomplished and how, where it failed and why. Including a short walkthrough
for how to get to the “last successful state”. This allows future runs to save
time in getting up to speed.</li>
</ul>
