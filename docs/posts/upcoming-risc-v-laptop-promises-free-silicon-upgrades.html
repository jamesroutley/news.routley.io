<p>The world&#39;s first laptop to use the RISC-V open source instruction set architecture (ISA) will reportedly start shipping in September.</p>
<p>The Roma laptop is available for preorder on Xcalibyte&#39;s <a href="https://xcalibyte.com.cn/en/roma-preorder/">website</a>, but the site merely takes interested parties&#39; information without providing much detail or any pricing. The laptop will start shipping in September, according to spokespeople from Xcalibyte, which did system tuning for the laptop; a company called DeepComputing, which engineered the laptop; and RISC-V International in a report Friday from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/01/riscv_roma_laptop/">The Register</a>.</p>
<p>According to the announcement from DeepComputing (which shares the same CEO with Xcalibyte, The Register reported), the Roma uses an unspecified quad-core processor with a 28 nm or, for the &#34;pro&#34; version, 12 nm node in a system-on-module (SoM) package. There&#39;s also an Arm SecurCore SC300 security enclave processor, an unnamed GPU and neural processing unit, and a feature accelerator.</p>
<p>The system-on-chip&#39;s motherboard is supposed to be user-upgradeable, too. DeepComputing&#39;s announcement said that owners of a Roma will have access to SoC and SoM upgrades for free.</p>
<p>&#34;The Roma platform will benefit developers who want to test their software running natively on RISC-V, and it should be easy to transfer code developed on this platform to embedded systems,&#34; Mark Himelstein, CTO for RISC-V International, said in RISC-V International&#39;s <a href="https://riscv.org/blog/2022/07/deepcomputing-and-xcalibyte-open-pre-orders-for-first-native-risc-v-development-laptop-quantities-limited-xcalibyte-and-deep-computing/">blog post</a> on Friday.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>RISC-V processors are typically less powerful than the more common x86-64 or Arm chips, but they have more open intellectual property, so it&#39;s easier for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/new-risc-v-cpu-claims-recordbreaking-performance-per-watt/">anyone</a> to make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/intels-strategy-for-outflanking-arm-takes-shape-with-bet-on-risc-v/">RISC-V CPUs</a>. We&#39;ve seen RISC-V adopted in products like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/seeed-and-beagleboard-team-up-to-provide-a-new-risc-v-based-linux-pc/">BeagleBoard V</a> single-board computer, embedded processors, and development kits, as well as for enterprise workloads, like high-performance computing. But the Roma is the first RISC-V product announced in laptop form.</p>
<p>&#34;This design is a crucial bridge between development boards and RISC-V-based business laptops that will be used for day-to-day work,&#34; Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International, said on the nonprofit&#39;s blog.</p>
<p>Beyond its RISC-V heritage, the Roma comes with up to 16GB of LPDDR4x memory and 256GB of storage. It also supports &#34;most&#34; versions of Linux, according to DeepComputing.</p>
<p>The laptop also has a questionable focus on NFTs, promising 100 of them to the first pre-orders, claiming to be &#34;Web3-friendly,&#34; and, according to RISC-V International&#39;s blog, partnering with companies like the <a href="https://latticex.foundation/about">LatticeX.Foundation</a> for NFTs and proof-of-stake blockchain.</p>
<p>While PCs based on the RISC-V ISA are far from mainstream, the Roma represents a small step toward options beyond just x86 and Arm. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/sifives-brand-new-p550-is-one-of-the-worlds-fastest-risc-v-cpus/">SiFive</a>, which licenses RISC-V-based CPU designs, has shown microcontrollers that could lead to supporting phones and laptops. And in March, the company told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/16/sifive_175m_series_f/">The Register</a> that its customers could release RISC-V SoCs for PCs by 2025.</p>
