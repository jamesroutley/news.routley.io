				<h2>Quickly see everything your application is doing, without modifying any of your code</h2>
				<div>
					<p>FunctionTrace can be called on existing Python applications with absolutely no modifications, and provides a complete and precise view of your application&#39;s entire execution.  You&#39;ll see what functions your various Python processes and threads executed over time, when and what information was logged, where allocations occurred, and more.</p>
					<p>FunctionTrace supports all of the useful profiling views you&#39;re familiar with, including Stack Charts, Flame Graphs, and Call Trees, thanks to its integration with the <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/&#34;" target="_blank">Firefox Profiler</a>.</p>

				<h2>Features</h2>
			</header>
			<div>
				<section>
					<p><img src="https://functiontrace.com/images/multi_process_small.png" alt="Shown profiling an application with three processes and six threads"/></p>
					<div>
						<h3>Profile multithread and multiprocess applications with ease</h3>
						<p>See precise profiling information throughout your entire application, rather than being limited to just one process or thread.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><img src="https://functiontrace.com/images/allocations.png" alt="Shown profiling memory with a flame graph of allocations"/></p>
					<div>
						<h3>Trace memory allocations throughout your application</h3>
						<p>FunctionTrace can track allocations throughout function calls in your application, telling you where to focus your optimization efforts.</p>
					</div>

					<p><img src="https://functiontrace.com/images/precise_profile.png" alt="Shown profiling function calls taking fractions of a millisecond"/></p>
					<div>
						<h3>Profiling is non-sampled and low-overhead</h3>
						<p>You&#39;ll never miss small but interesting function calls when looking at a FunctionTrace profile, as all information is recorded.  You also don&#39;t need to pay for this - profiling overhead is &lt;10%, even on complex applications.</p>

					<div>
						<h3>Profiles can easily be uploaded and shared</h3>
						<p>When a developer encounters a bug or performance issue, they can easily send the recorded FunctionTrace profile to their team, allowing multiple people to investigate the issue without needing to reproduce it.</p>

					<h2>Installation and Use</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<h3>Installing FunctionTrace (Nix)</h3>
					<p>
                    If you use Nix, you can easily try a recent version of FunctionTrace with <code>nix-shell -p functiontrace</code>, or install it via <code>pkgs.functiontrace</code>.
					</p>

					<h3>Installing FunctionTrace (Linux/Mac)</h3>
					<p>
					FunctionTrace comes in two necessary pieces: a server, and a language-specific client.</p>
					<pre><code><i># Install the server</i>
<b>$ <a href="https://crates.io/crates/functiontrace-server" target="_blank">cargo install functiontrace-server</a></b>

<i># Install the Python client</i>
<b>$ <a href="https://pypi.org/project/functiontrace/" target="_blank">pip install functiontrace</a></b>
</code></pre>

					<h3>Installing FunctionTrace (Windows)</h3>
					<p>
					FunctionTrace is not currently supported on Windows.  Pull requests to add support are welcome.
					</p>

					<h3>Tracing Your Application</h3>
					<p>
					To trace a Python application <i>Foo.py</i>, load it via <code>functiontrace</code>:
					</p><pre><code>$ <b>functiontrace</b> Foo.py arguments_for_foo</code></pre>
					

					<p>
					Alternatively, you can modify your code to start tracing at some point during its runtime:
					</p><pre><code>import <b>functiontrace</b>
functiontrace.trace()
</code></pre>
					By default, FunctionTrace will emit a trace file (in the form of <code>functiontrace.<i>time</i>.json</code>) to the current directory, though the location can be controlled via the <code>--output-dir</code> switch when running <code>functiontrace</code>.
					

					<h3>Viewing Traces</h3>
					<p>
					To view a recorded trace file, go to <b><a href="https://profiler.firefox.com" target="_blank">the Firefox Profiler</a></b> and choose <i>Load a profile from file</i>, then select the desired trace file.  This step will perform some processing, but is entirely local - your trace file never leaves your own machine!
					</p>
					<p>
					You&#39;ll likely want to start with the <i>Stack Chart</i> view to get an overview of your application&#39;s execution, then use the <i>Flame Graph</i> view if you want to dive into optimization opportunities.
					</p><p>
					Traces can also be loaded directly from the internet, which can be particularly useful when examining services on remote servers or sharing traces with others.  For an example, you can play with this
