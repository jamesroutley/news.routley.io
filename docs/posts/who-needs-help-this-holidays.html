    <h1>Ask HN: Who needs help this holidays?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have decided to post this thread a bit earlier this year.</p><p>Last year we had an incredible response to a thread offering assistance to those in the HN community. You can read it here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34122118</p><p>Last year we were able to provide nearly $20k worth of support to community members. I know things have only gotten more challenging since then for a number of us, so I wanted to make sure I provided more time this year for people to reach out.</p><p>As usual, this is not a request for donations. Last year and this year I am content to finance this operation myself (although a number of people did step up and offer additional support). All I ask is that you let us know your financial needs and their general purpose so that we can maximize the number of people we can help.</p><p>To be clear, while the original intent was to provide dinner expenses for the holidays, this need not be the only reason you ask for funds. Reasonable requests include:</p><p>- Holiday housing</p><p>- Toys/gifts for family members</p><p>- Food</p><p>- Travel assistance</p><p>- Medical expenses</p><p>- Entertainment for the family</p><p>I understand, as a formerly homeless person myself, that it can be tough to ask for help. The majority of those who request assistance do so over email and I assure you that I will keep your request and information private and between us.</p><p>I am happy to use this thread for any questions the community and potential beneficiaries may have.</p><p>Happy holidays!</p><p>- Alexander</p></div></div></div>
