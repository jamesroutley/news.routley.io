					<div><p>A fascinating article was recently uncovered and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1b1c9rx/goodbye_mr_chips_could_commodore_have_changed_the/">posted to Reddit</a> that was originally published on May 17, 1994, in <em>The Village Voice</em>. For those that don&#39;t know, the Voice was an American news and culture publication based in Greenwich Village, New York City, known for being the country&#39;s first alternative newsweekly. The printed newspaper edition ceased publication in 2017, while the online version <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/">lives on</a>. A user on Reddit that goes by the moniker 8bitaficionado actually made a special trip to New York Public Library in order to look up an archive of the periodical and laboriously transcribed its contents. The issue in question is nowhere to be found online in its entirety. </p></div>
