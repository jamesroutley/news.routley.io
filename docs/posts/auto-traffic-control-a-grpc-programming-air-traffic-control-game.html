Your task is to
create a program that can safely manage the airspace above two airports. Score
points by landing airplanes, and make sure no aircraft get too close together!</p><p>The game is designed to provide an open-ended sandbox that players can use to
freely practice programming. The game provides a language-agnostic
<a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gRPC</a> API, giving players free choice of programming language or paradigm.</p><h2 id="features">Features<a href="#features" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>❤️ Write code in your favorite programming language<!-- -->
