Why does the moon change size when you snipe it?

<p>The artists gave me a texture for the moon in III. I placed the moon in the sky, made sure it was visible at night and that it was a reasonable size.</p><p>A few days later 4 artists were at my desk asking me to change the size of the moon.</p><p>&#34;No problem&#34; I said.</p><p>It turned out they couldn&#39;t decide what the size of the moon should be. 2 of them wanted it smaller to be more realistic. The other 2 wanted it larger to be more cinematic.</p><p>This went on a bit and I suggested to make the size of the moon changeable in the game. This way they could decide in their own time and let me know the conclusion. Since I was working on the sniper rifle, I made it so that the moon toggled through 3 sizes (small, medium, large) as the player sniped it.</p><p>The artists never got back to me so I just left it in. It was still there in SA.</p>

There was a 6 weeks gap between finishing gta3 and the release. This was needed for burning the cd and distribution. In those days you couldn&#39;t patch so there was no point hanging around. The company gave the team some time off and most people took some extra time also. After the release, we started on Vice City. It was RockStar New York&#39;s idea to set the game in the 80s in Miami. Originally it was supposed to be a mission pack to gta3. Only once gta3 did as well as it did and Vice City started to look sufficiently different from gta3 was the decision made to make it a standalone game. This was quite far into the project. (maybe 6 months or so) We did the PC conversion of gta3 ourselves. This took the programmers about 6 months. In the mean time the artists and level designers were able to get straight onto Vice City. This worked well as there aren&#39;t that many code changes from gta3 to Vice whereas it did involve building a whole new city and new missions. The artists and l

(Warning: techy) The cheats in the trilogy were activated by simply typing a sequence of characters. On PC the sequence would be something like ILOVESCOTLAND to make it rain or GUNSGUNSGUNS to give the player loads of weapons. The game remembers the last 20 or so keypresses and every time a new key is pressed, these keypresses are compared with the cheats. If there is a match, the cheat will activate. The straightforward way of doing this would be to compare the string &#34;ILOVESCOTLAND&#34; with the string of keypresses. This approach would mean that the strings for the cheats would be in memory as readable text. Any hacker could easily find the cheats and they would all be discovered on the day of release. This is why I used &#39;hash codes&#39; to store the cheats. A hash code is a number that is calculated from a string. As an example; a simple hash algorithm could add up the ASCII values of each character of the string. The hash code for ILOVESCOTLAND would be 983. For GUNSGUNS
