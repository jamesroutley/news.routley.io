Why does the moon change size when you snipe it?

<p>The artists gave me a texture for the moon in III. I placed the moon in the sky, made sure it was visible at night and that it was a reasonable size.</p><p>A few days later 4 artists were at my desk asking me to change the size of the moon.</p><p>&#34;No problem&#34; I said.</p><p>It turned out they couldn&#39;t decide what the size of the moon should be. 2 of them wanted it smaller to be more realistic. The other 2 wanted it larger to be more cinematic.</p><p>This went on a bit and I suggested to make the size of the moon changeable in the game. This way they could decide in their own time and let me know the conclusion. Since I was working on the sniper rifle, I made it so that the moon toggled through 3 sizes (small, medium, large) as the player sniped it.</p><p>The artists never got back to me so I just left it in. It was still there in SA.</p>

There was a 6 weeks gap between finishing gta3 and the release. This was needed for burning the cd and distribution. In those days you couldn&#39;t patch so there was no point hanging around. The company gave the team some time off and most people took some extra time also. After the release, we started on Vice City. It was RockStar New York&#39;s idea to set the game in the 80s in Miami. Originally it was supposed to be a mission pack to gta3. Only once gta3 did as well as it did and Vice City started to look sufficiently different from gta3 was the decision made to make it a standalone game. This was quite far into the project. (maybe 6 months or so) We did the PC conversion of gta3 ourselves. This took the programmers about 6 months. In the mean time the artists and level designers were able to get straight onto Vice City. This worked well as there aren&#39;t that many code changes from gta3 to Vice whereas it did involve building a whole new city and new missions. The artists and l

Making games is hard word and after a while you really want a change. After Vice City there was a sense within North that it would be nice to do something else. Something that wasn&#39;t gta. Some of the artists wanted to do a zombie survival game. Programmers like fantasy. Artists like zombies. Not sure why that is. We pursued the zombie idea for a while. Working title for the game was Z (Pronounced Zed not Zee). The idea was to use the Vice code as is. The game was to take place on a windswept foggy Scottish island. The player would be under constant attack from zombies. The player would need to use vehicles to get around but vehicles would need fuel. Acquiring the fuel would be a big part of the game. I can&#39;t quite remember how long we worked on Z. Maybe a month or so. The idea seemed depressing and quickly ran out of steam. Even the people who originally coined the idea lost faith. We dropped the idea and got on with San Andreas. After San Andreas we REALLY wanted to do somethi
