    <h1>Two women recall coming of age in Victorian London (1970) [video]</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this excerpt from the BBC documentary <em>Yesterday’s Witness: Two Victorian Girls</em> (1970), a pair of women in their 90s recount coming of age in London in the late-Victorian era. Berta Ruck, who relocated from Wales and went on to become a successful romance novelist, and Frances ‘Effy’ Jones, one of the first women to be trained to work as a typist, prove charismatic storytellers as they recount the clothes, manners and mounds of mud that defined London at the time. What emerges is a portrait of the city as a place of widespread poverty and conservative values, but also excitement and new opportunities for women.</p>
