But the story didn&#39;t end there. In fact, it was just beginning.</p><p>Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.</p><p>Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada&#39;s Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.</p><p>More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.</p><p>Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. &#34;I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,&#34; he recalled. &#34;And an image of a cluster became more clear.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e267/live/9e06a820-e448-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A look at the industrial port in the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, with the river and sky both prominent.

(Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.</p><p>Over the next five years, Marrero&#39;s cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper&#39;s authors told the BBC, a &#34;house of cards&#34;.</p><p>To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.</p><p>We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was &#34;degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause&#34;. At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.</p><p>The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.</p><p>Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it&#39;s financially motivated,&#34; said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. &#34;There&#39;s all these different levels.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Grey line "/></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy.

New Brunswick&#39;s chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.</p><p>Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s like reading a movie script,&#34; emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.</p><p>&#34;We are all in the movie!&#34;, a senior federal scientist replied.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b1d/live/98d150b0-ed4b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Marrero, in a blue suit coat, white shirt and red tie, looks out from behind the window glass at his home in New Brunswick."/></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. &#34;I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,&#34; he said.

All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.</p><p>And the mystery disease got a name: the &#34;New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause&#34;. In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it &#34;one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen&#34;.</p><p>&#34;We all owe you a debt of gratitude,&#34; he wrote.</p><p>But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero&#39;s office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling &#34;flabbergasted&#34; at Marrero&#39;s notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a &#34;diarrhea of symptoms&#34;.</p><p>Jansen saw clues in the patients&#39; files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer&#39;s disease and Lewy body dementia.</p><p>He was alarmed.

Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.</p><p>Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick&#39;s forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson&#39;s disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was &#34;not expected to pose risks&#34; to human health or the environment.)</p><p>According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. &#34;I don&#39;t want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let&#39;s say it&#39;s an unusual number.

Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full &#34;boots-on-the-ground&#34; investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p>But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. &#34;Everybody received that email like a cold shower,&#34; he said.</p><p>None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero&#39;s methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.</p><p>But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.</p><p>&#34;They pulled the plug because they just don&#39;t want anybody looking,&#34; Lanteigne said. &#34;Full stop.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ea95/live/d5a93700-ec79-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Grey line"/></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients&#39; medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.</p><p>Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses.

Jillian Lucas&#39;s symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.</p><p>At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said.

When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.</p><p>&#34;He said, there&#39;s a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you&#39;re experiencing, and I don&#39;t have answers for it yet,&#34; stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. &#34;He told her that she wasn&#39;t alone.&#34;</p><p>There was one test Marrero couldn&#39;t secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier&#39;s parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.</p><p>After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.</p><p>The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.</p><p>A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>The call didn&#39;t sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.</p><p>&#34;There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,&#34; said her father Andre, angrily.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying &#39;We are not a mystery, &#39;We stand by Doctor Marrero&#39; and other slogans.

Because nobody has the facts.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4310/live/44874040-e44b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Marrero, in a navy suit and red tie, sits in a wooden chair in his home office, in the light coming in from the door windows.

Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. &#34;Lives hang in the balance,&#34; read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. &#34;It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,&#34; the letter said. &#34;Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.&#34;</p><p>The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.</p><p>Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. &#34;I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,&#34; she said.</p><p>Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.</p><p>&#34;What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,&#34; Lang said.</p><p>&#34;I would even go further,&#34; Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. &#34;I would say they are being abused.&#34;</p><p>Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.</p><p>And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.</p><p>&#34;It has to be a patient complaint,&#34; they said. &#34;And all his patients love him.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="grey line "/></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago.
