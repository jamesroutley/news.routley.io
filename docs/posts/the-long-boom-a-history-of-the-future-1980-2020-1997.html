    <h1>The Long Boom: A History of the Future, 1980–2020 (1997)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The effort to build a truly inclusive society does not just impact Americans. At the turn of the century, the United States is the closest thing the world has to a workable multicultural society. Almost all the cultures of the world have some representation, several in significant proportions. As the century moves on, it becomes clear to most people on the planet that all cultures must coexist in relative harmony on a global scale. On a meta level, it seems that the world is heading toward a future that&#39;s prefaced by what&#39;s happening in the United States.</p><p>A Civilization of Civilizations</p><p>In 2020, humans arrive on <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/mars/">Mars</a>. It&#39;s an extraordinary event by any measure, coming a half century after people first <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/moon-landing/">set foot on the Moon</a>. The four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment. The expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet, the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal. A remarkable enough technical achievement, the Mars landing is even more important for what it symbolizes.</p><p>As the global viewing audience stares at the image of a distant Earth, seen from a neighboring planet 35 million miles away, the point is made as never before: We are one world. All organisms crammed on the globe are intricately interdependent. Plants, animals, humans need to find a way to live together on that tiny little place. By 2020, most people are acting on that belief. The population has largely stabilized. The spreading prosperity nudged a large enough block of people into middle-class lifestyles to curtail high birth rates. In some pockets of the world large families are still highly valued, but most people strive only to replicate themselves, and no more. Just as important, the world economy has evolved to a point roughly in balance with nature. To be sure, the ecosystem is not in perfect equilibrium. More pollution enters the world than many would like. But the rates of contamination have been greatly reduced, and the trajectory of these trends looks promising. The regeneration of the global environment is in sight.</p><p>The images from Mars drive home another point: We&#39;re one global society, one human race. The divisions we impose on ourselves look ludicrous from afar. The concept of a planet of warring nations, a state of affairs that defined the previous century, makes no sense. Far better to channel the aspirations of the world&#39;s people into collectively pushing outward to the stars. Far better to turn our technologies not against one another but toward a joint effort that benefits all. And the artificial divisions we perpetuate between races and genders look strange as well. All humans stand on equal footing. They&#39;re not the same, but they&#39;re treated as equals and given equal opportunities to excel. In 2020, this point, only recently an empty platitude, is accepted by almost all.</p><p>We&#39;re forming a new civilization, a global civilization, distinct from those that arose on the planet before. It&#39;s not just Western civilization writ large—one hegemonic culture forcing itself on others. It&#39;s not a resurgent Chinese civilization struggling to reassert itself after years of being thwarted. It&#39;s a strange blend of both—and the others. It&#39;s something different, something as yet being born. In 2020, information technologies have spread to every corner of the planet. Real-time language translation is reliable. The great cross-fertilization of ideas, the ongoing, never-ending planetary conversation has begun. From this, the new crossroads of all civilizations, the new civilization will emerge.</p><p>In many ways, it&#39;s a civilization of civilizations, to use a phrase coined by Samuel Huntington. We&#39;re building a framework where all the world&#39;s civilizations can exist side by side and thrive. Where the best attributes of each can stand out and make their unique contributions. Where the peculiarities are cherished and allowed to live on. We&#39;re entering an age where diversity is truly valued—the more options the better. Our ecosystem works best that way. Our market economy works best that way. Our civilization, the realm of our ideas, works best that way, too.</p><p>The Millennial Generation</p><p>By 2020, the world is about to go through a changeover in power. This happens not through force, but through natural succession, a generational transition. The aging baby boomers, born in the wake of World War II, at the beginning of the 20th century&#39;s 40-year global economic boom, are fading from their prominent positions of economic and moral leadership. The tough-minded, techno-savvy generation that trails them, the digital generation, has the new world wired. But these two generations have simply laid the groundwork, prepared the foundations for the society, the civilization that comes next.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/millennials/">The millennial generation</a> is coming of age. These are the children born in the 1980s and 1990s, at the front end of this boom of all booms. These are the kids who have spent their entire lives steeped in the new technologies, living in a networked world. They have been educated in wired schools, they have taken their first jobs implicitly understanding computer technologies. Now they&#39;re doing the bulk of society&#39;s work. They are reaching their 40s and turning their attention to the next generation of problems that remain to be cracked.</p><p>These are higher-level concerns, the intractable problems—such as eradicating poverty on the planet—that people throughout history have believed impossible to solve. Yet this generation has witnessed an extraordinary spread of prosperity across the planet. They see no inherent barrier to keep them from extending that prosperity to—why not?—everyone. Then there&#39;s the environment. The millennial generation has inherited a planet that&#39;s not getting much worse. Now comes the more difficult problem of restoration, starting with the rain forests. Then there&#39;s governance. Americans can vote electronically from home starting with the presidential election of 2008. But e-voting is just an extension of the 250-year-old system of liberal democracy. Interactive technologies may allow radically new forms of participatory democracy on a scale never imagined. Many young people say that the end of the nation-state is in sight.</p></div></div></div></div>
