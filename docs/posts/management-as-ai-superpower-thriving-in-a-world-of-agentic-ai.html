    <h1>Management as AI superpower: Thriving in a world of agentic AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p>I just taught an experimental class at the University of Pennsylvania where I challenged students to create a startup from scratch in four days. Most of the people in the class were in the executive MBA program, so they were taking classes while also working as doctors, managers, or leaders in a variety of large and small companies. Few had ever coded. I introduced them to Claude Code and Google Antigravity, which they needed to use to build a working prototype. But a prototype alone is not a startup, so they used ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to accelerate the idea generation, market research, competitive positioning, pitching, and financial modelling processes. I was curious how far they could get in such a short time. It turns out they got very far.</p><p>I’ve been teaching entrepreneurship for a decade and a half, and I&#39;ve seen thousands of startup ideas (some of which turned into large companies) so I have a good sense of the expectations for what a class of smart MBA students can accomplish. I would estimate that what I saw in a couple of days was an order of magnitude further along the path to a real startup than I had seen out of students working over a full semester before AI. Most of the prototypes were not just sample screens but actually had a core feature working. Ideas were far more diverse and interesting than usual. Market and customer analyses were insightful. It was really impressive. These were not yet working startups nor were they fully operational products (with a couple exceptions) — but they had shaved months and huge amounts of money and effort from the traditional process. And there was something else: most early startups need to pivot, changing direction as they learn more about what the market wants and what is technically possible. By lowering the costs of pivoting, it was much easier to explore the possibilities without being locked in or even explore multiple startups at once: you just tell the AI what you want.</p><p>I wish I could say this impressive output was the result of my brilliant teaching, but we don’t really have a great framework yet for how to use all these tools, the students largely figured it out on their own. It helped that they had some management and subject matter expertise because it turns out that the key to success was actually the last bit of the previous paragraph: telling the AI what you want. As AIs are increasingly capable of tasks that would take a human hours to do, and as evaluating those results becomes increasingly time consuming, the value of being good at delegation increases. But when should you delegate to AI?</p><p><span>We actually have an answer, but it is a bit complicated. Consider three factors: First, because of the </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-shape-of-ai-jaggedness-bottlenecks" rel="">Jagged Frontier of AI ability</a><span>, you don’t reliably know what the AI will be good or bad at on complex tasks. Second, whether the AI is good or bad, it is definitely fast. It produces work in minutes that would take many hours for a human to do. Third, it is cheap (relative to professional wages), and it doesn’t mind if you generate multiple versions and throw most of them away.</span></p><p>These three factors mean that deciding to delegate to AI depends on three variables:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Human Baseline Time:</strong><span> how long the task would take you to do yourself</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Probability of Success:</strong><span> how likely the AI is to produce an output that meets your bar on a given attempt</span></p></li><li><p><strong>AI Process Time:</strong><span> how long it takes you to request, wait for, and evaluate an AI output</span></p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg" width="1456" height="794" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:794,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:3231930,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/i/185639446?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6M7R!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec5279eb-e12f-408f-8727-ffcc7b1f3ba7_2816x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><span>A useful mental model is that you’re trading off “doing the whole task” (</span><strong>Human Baseline Time</strong><span>) against “paying the overhead cost” (</span><strong>AI Process Time</strong><span>), possibly multiple times until you get something acceptable.

We can give better instructions, setting clear goals that the AI can execute on with a higher chance of succeeding. We can get better at evaluation and feedback, so we need to make fewer attempts to get the AI to do the right thing. And we can make it easier to evaluate whether the AI is good or bad at a task without spending as much time. All of these factors are improved by subject matter expertise — an expert knows what instructions to give, they can better see when something goes wrong, and they are better at correcting it.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg" width="1456" height="794" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:794,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:3071899,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/i/185639446?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SjMz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b08f126-d32d-470b-b3ff-04f6bd8182c3_2816x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><span>If you don’t need something specific, AI models have become incredibly capable of figuring out how to solve problems themselves.

But real work, and real delegation, means that you have a specific output in mind, and that is where things can get tricky. How do you communicate your intention to the AI to execute on what you want, so it can use “judgement” to solve problems while still giving you the output you desire?</p><p><span>This problem existed long before AI and is so universal that every field has invented their own paperwork to solve it. Software developers write </span><a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-spec/" rel="">Product Requirements Documents</a><span>. Film directors hand off shot lists. Architects create design intent documents. The Marines use Five Paragraph Orders (situation, mission, execution, administration, command). Consultants scope engagements with detailed deliverable specs.  All of these documents work remarkably well as AI prompts for this new world of agentic work (and the AI can handle many pages of instructions at a time). The reason you can use so many formats to instruct AI is that all of these are really the same thing: attempts to get what’s in one person’s head into someone else’s actions.</span></p><p>When you look at what actually goes into good delegation documentation, it’s remarkably consistent: What are we trying to accomplish, and why? Where are the limits of the delegated authority? What does “done” look like? What specific outputs do I need? What interim outputs do I need to follow your progress? And what should you check before telling me you’re finished? If these are well-specified, the AI, like humans, is far more likely to do a good job.</p><p>And in figuring out how to give these instructions to the AI, it turns out you are basically reinventing management.</p><p>I find it interesting to watch as some of the most well-known software developers at the major AI labs note how their jobs are changing from mostly programming to mostly management of AI agents. Coding has always had a very organized structure, with clearly verifiable outputs (the code either works or it doesn’t) so it has been one of the first areas where AI tools have matured, and thus the first profession to feel this change. It isn’t the last.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png" width="1456" height="560" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:560,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:218942,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/i/185639446?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4PIq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd126edf-ce22-42d4-bc81-7725bfd4c9aa_1590x612.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>As a business school professor, I think many people have the skills they need, or can learn them, in order to work with AI agents - they are management 101 skills. If you can explain what you need, give effective feedback, and design ways of evaluating work, you are going to be able to work with agents. In many ways, at least in your area of expertise, it is much easier than trying to design clever prompts to help you get work done, as it is more like working with people. At the same time, management has always assumed scarcity: you delegate because you can’t do everything yourself, and because talent is limited and expensive. AI changes the equation. Now the “talent” is abundant and cheap. What’s scarce is knowing what to ask for.</p><p>This is why my students did so well. They weren’t AI experts. But they’d spent years learning how to scope problems in their fields of expertise, define deliverables, and recognize when a financial model or medical report was off. They had hard-earned frameworks from classes and jobs, and those frameworks became their prompts. The skills that are so often dismissed as “soft” turned out to be the hard ones.</p><p>I don’t know exactly what work looks like when everyone is a manager with an army of tireless agents. But I suspect the people who thrive will be the ones who know what good looks like — and can explain it clearly enough that even an AI can deliver it. My students figured this out in four days. Not because they were AI natives, but because they already knew how to manage.
