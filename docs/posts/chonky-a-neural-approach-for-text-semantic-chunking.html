    <h1>Show HN: Chonky – a neural approach for text semantic chunking</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p dir="auto"><strong>Chonky</strong> is a Python library that intelligently segments text into meaningful semantic chunks using a fine-tuned transformer model. This library can be used in the RAG systems.</p><div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from chonky import TextSplitter

# on the first run it will download the transformer model

text = &#34;&#34;&#34;Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn&#39;t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep. The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called &#34;data processing.&#34; This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district&#39;s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain&#39;s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.&#34;&#34;&#34;
