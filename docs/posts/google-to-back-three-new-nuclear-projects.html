    <h1>Google to back three new nuclear projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Google announced today the launch of a new collaboration with South Carolina-based nuclear project developer Elementl Power, including an agreement to invest in three advanced nuclear energy projects.</p> <p>The agreement comes as Google and its tech giant peers increasingly turn to nuclear energy to help address the growing emissions impact of their rapidly expanding data center footprints. While Google has set 2030 goals to reach net zero emissions across its operations and value chain, and to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 absolute emissions, on a 2019 basis, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-asks-large-suppliers-to-commit-to-100-renewable-energy-as-emissions-continue-to-rise/">the company recently reported</a> that its emissions increased by 13% in 2023, and are up by 48% since 2019, as its growing data center electricity consumption has outpaced its ability to bring carbon free energy projects online. Google has also <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-achieves-zero-lifetime-net-carbon-footprint-now-aiming-for-100-carbon-free-energy/">set a goal</a> in 2020 to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030, matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-signs-first-nuclear-energy-deal-to-address-growing-ai-carbon-footprint/">Google signed its first advanced nuclear agreement</a> with nuclear technology company Kairos Power aimed at deploying a fleet of small advanced nuclear power projects across the U.S. to provide up to 500 MW of carbon-free energy.goals.</p> <p>As part of the new agreement with Elementl, Google will commit early-stage development capital to advance the development of three projects, each of which will be able to generate at least 600 MW of power capacity.</p> <p>Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy at Google, said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy. Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation.”</p></blockquote> <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/amazon-google-and-meta-join-pledge-to-help-triple-global-nuclear-energy-capacity/">Google and Meta</a> joined a group of major companies pledging to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The pledge notes that “energy demand in many industries is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” adding that tripling nuclear capacity will “help achieve global goals for enhanced energy resiliency and security, and continuous firm clean energy supply.”</p> <p>Established in 2023, Elementl Power develops, finances, and manages nuclear power projects, using next-generation technology that it claims is the safest form of energy generation.</p> <p>With the support of Google, Elementl said that it is advancing its goal to bring more than 10 gigawatts online in the U.S. by 2035, working collaboratively with regulated utilities, independent power producers and technology suppliers.</p> <p>Elementl Power Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Colbert said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals. We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid.”</p></blockquote> <div id="esgto-864566167"><p><a data-no-instant="1" href="https://www.esgtoday.com/esgtoday-events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" aria-label="1280×250"><img alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" width="900" height="180" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-768x150.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-610x119.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-260x51.jpg 260w" nitro-lazy-src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NDkwOjk0OQ==-1" src="data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NDkwOjk0OQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTI4MCAyNTAiIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjI1MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4="/></a></p></div></div></div>
