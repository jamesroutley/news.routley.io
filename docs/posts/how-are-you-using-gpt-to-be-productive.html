    <h1>Ask HN: How are you using GPT to be productive?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>With GPT so hot in the news right now, and seeing lots of impressive demos, I&#39;m curious to know, how are you actively using GPT to be productive in your daily workflow? And what tools are you using in tandem with GPT to make it more effective? Have you written your own tools, or do you use it in tandem with third party tools?</p><p>I&#39;d be particularly interested to hear how you use GPT to write or correct code beyond Copilot or asking ChatGPT about code in chat format.</p><p>But I&#39;m also interested in hearing about useful prompts that you use to increase your productivity.</p></div></div></div>
