              <p>Hi all - I wanted to share here some exciting news we shared <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/12/anthropic-invests-in-python.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">on our blog</a> this morning: Anthropic has donated $1.5 million over two years to the PSF! Their landmark gift is focused on supporting our security work.</p>
<p>Here’s what we shared on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big news: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Anthropic</a> is investing $1.5 million in the Python Software Foundation, focused on Python ecosystem security. This gift will make an enormous impact on the PSF and the safety and security of millions of Python and PyPI users.</p>
<p>Anthropic’s funds will enable the PSF to make progress on our security roadmap, including work designed to protect millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. Anthropic’s support will also go towards the PSF’s core work, including the Developer in Residence program driving contributions to CPython, community support through grants and other programs, running core infrastructure such as PyPI, and more.</p>
<p>We couldn’t be more grateful for Anthropic’s remarkable support, and we hope you will join us in thanking them for their landmark investment in the PSF and the Python community.</p>
