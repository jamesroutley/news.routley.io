    <h1>We need to talk about funding</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogpost-content">
            <p>You might have missed this, but since 2016 my full-time work on OctoPrint has been
<strong>100% funded by people like you.</strong> OctoPrint, at its core, is still
mostly a one-woman show, with me its creator as its only full time resource, and Iâ€™ve only been 
able to keep working on it thanks to the generous support of the community.</p>

<p>Sadly, the financial crisis currently happening across the globe is also affecting me, and things 
are starting to get worrying. While OctoPrintâ€™s <strong>usage numbers have steadily grown by 30% since 2021</strong>
to an all time high of now over 150000 active instances (and thatâ€™s just the ones I know about), 
<strong>financial support for my work on OctoPrint has dropped by over 30% over that same time</strong>, with most of this 
decline happening over the course of the past 12 months. And meanwhile, thanks to 
the ongoing inflation, my expenses have only increased as well - power, hosting of website, forums and
tracking server, various domains, backups, etc, all of that costs money, and that doesnâ€™t even yet
include my own living expenses. Long story short, <strong>if things continue the way they are,
I will have to throw in the towel</strong>, and that will be the end of OctoPrint for me.</p>

<p>I love working on OctoPrint, and I love being able to provide it to you for free. But I also need to
pay my bills, and I canâ€™t do that if financial support keeps dropping like this. <strong>Thereâ€™s still time to turn this around</strong>,
but that will require your help, and some changes.</p>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>

<p>If you are using OctoPrint, please consider chipping in and supporting my work on it. There are several 
ways to do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/users/foosel/sponsorship">Become a GitHub Sponsor</a> (<strong>recurring</strong> &amp; one-time)</li>
  <li><a href="https://patreon.com/foosel">Become a Patreon Patron</a> (<strong>recurring</strong>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://ko-fi.com/octoprint/10">Support me on Ko-Fi</a> (<strong>recurring</strong> &amp; one-time) ðŸ†•</li>
  <li><a href="https://donorbox.org/support-octoprint">Support me on Donorbox</a> (<strong>recurring</strong> &amp; one-time)</li>
  <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/foosel/donate">Support me on Liberapay</a> (<strong>recurring</strong>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://paypal.me/octoprint3d">Support me on PayPal</a> (one-time)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also find all of these on the <a href="https://octoprint.org/support-octoprint/">dedicated support page</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously Iâ€™m not expecting everyone to chip in, <strong>but if you are using OctoPrint and can afford to
support its development</strong>, please consider doing so. Even a small amount helps, and if enough people
chip in, it can make a huge difference. Even more so when itâ€™s given <strong>recurringly</strong>. 
And <strong>if you canâ€™t afford to chip in</strong>, please consider spreading
the word instead. The more people know about this, the better.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>if you are a company and are using OctoPrint in your business</strong>, please consider becoming a
corporate sponsor. Youâ€™ll not only ensure OctoPrintâ€™s future development and thus its usefulness to you, 
but depending on your contribution youâ€™ll also get your link and logo on octoprint.org and get 
mentioned in the about dialog of OctoPrint itself. And letâ€™s be honest, itâ€™s the right thing to do! ðŸ˜‰ <a href="mailto:sponsoring@octoprint.org">Get in touch with me!</a></p>

<h2 id="what-i-will-do-on-my-end">What I will do on my end</h2>

<p>Since the general feedback I got over the years was that people didnâ€™t even know they could financially support
my work on OctoPrint, I will be making this a more prominent topic in the future. <strong>Iâ€™ve already started
work on some changes for OctoPrint 1.10.0 that will put options to financially support my work on OctoPrint</strong> more into the 
spotlight, and I will also be making some more changes to octoprint.org and the forums to make it easier to find the support options.</p>

<p>I apologize in advance to those of you whoâ€™ve been supporting me throughout the years and might feel
a bit annoyed by this, but I hope you understand that I need to do this in order to keep working on
OctoPrint. I will try to keep it as unobtrusive as possible, but I also need to make sure that people
know that they can support my work on OctoPrint if they want to, and how to do that.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for your understanding and your support! Letâ€™s turn this around!</strong></p>
