    <h1>First User Framework</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I might have accidentally discovered a framework that tries to address work-life balance and side project burnout. For some engineers and builders, this might sound like “common sense”, but it took me a bit of time (a decade - lol) to arrive at this wisdom.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: When you have an idea for a project (that light-bulb moment) or when a friend calls you up and says, “Hey, why don’t we build this side project?” your builder instinct kicks in and replies, “Let’s do it!”</p>
<p>That moment right there is causing a drift in your timeline. I want you to be conscious of that. The thing is, there are only 24 hours in a day, and by signing up to build this new project, you will devote a significant chunk of those hours to it. This might prevent you from doing other activities that are essential for your “work-life balance”.</p>
<p>How do you find time then? Well, you don’t need to find time for projects. Instead, try finding the right projects for your time.</p>
<h2 id="Who-is-this-for"><a href="#Who-is-this-for" title="Who is this for?"></a>Who is this for?</h2><p>Before I continue, I would like to state that this piece of advice is contextual and doesn’t apply to everyone. This advice best applies to you if </p>
<ul>
<li>You have a full-time job.</li>
<li>You are living with your family (and looking to spend your precious evenings with them)</li>
<li>You are having trouble prioritizing “what to work on”, “what to study”, etc.</li>
<li>You are having trouble scheduling time.</li>
<li>You are having constant thoughts of building new projects.</li>
<li>You sometimes regret spending like 10 hours a week on a project that didn’t go anywhere.</li>
<li>(I guess you get it)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-Framework"><a href="#The-Framework" title="The Framework"></a>The Framework</h2><p>The truth is, you are building one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project with no users</li>
<li>a project where you are the user</li>
<li>a project where you have a user (who is not you)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you start building a new project, it should fall under one of the above categories. It will eventually lead to one of the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best case: Your project is thriving and being used (hopefully by a good number of audience)</li>
<li>Average case: You hack on your project for a while and eventually forget about it.</li>
<li>Worst case: You question yourself, “What am I doing with my life?” after weeks/months (hopefully not “years”) of working on the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like how most startups go nowhere, I am guessing that most of the side projects don’t hit the best-case outcome. They usually end up in worst or average-case outcomes. From my personal experience, I think I have been part of projects that fall under all (if not most) of the categories and outcomes defined above. Based on that, I have come to the following deduction:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>What you should do</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>No users</td>
<td>Run away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You are the user</td>
<td>Don’t build it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You have a first user</td>
<td>Build it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>First User Framework</strong>: Start a project only after you have the first user, who is ready to try it out and provide feedback from day 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> If a category 1 and 2 (no users and you are the user) project seems attractive to you, then challenge yourself to put yourself out there and turn it into category 3 (you have a first user) and then work on it. Instead of taking four months to build a project that no one uses, you will find yourself making meaningful progress in a week if you are able to qualify the project to be category 3 upfront. (we are looking at exponential time gains here; that should be more attractive to you)</p>
<p>On the other hand, this makes you ruthless about your time and priorities. You might already be working on a short-term goal that is important for you. At times like that, this framework will shine. Either your short-term goal is more important and you pass on the opportunity or this new “category 3” project becomes your short-term goal.</p>
<h2 id="But-my-passion-project"><a href="#But-my-passion-project" title="But my passion project?"></a>But my passion project?</h2><p>Usually, passion projects fall under category 1 or 2. So this blog post makes me a villain in the eyes of passion projects. As I mentioned above, this framework is contextual and is written for people who are not finding time and balance in life. If you have the time and freedom to work on a passion project, you should probably do it! There is an immense sense of satisfaction that comes with it.</p>
<p>For example, I did a category 2 (passion) project: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/scriptnull/sblog">a small binary to kick-start my blog writing process</a>. I have been a solo user of it for the past 5 years. I have zero regrets about the time I put into it. So my point is not “don’t work on passion projects”. My point is “Be mindful of your time”.</p>

<p>“But my friends are calling me to build the next Google?”</p>
<p>Well, attend the call and ask them, “Where is our first user?”</p>
