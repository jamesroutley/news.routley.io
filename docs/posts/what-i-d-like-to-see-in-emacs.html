<span title="00:00:08.960" data-start="00:00:08.960" data-video="mainVideo-rms">in GNU Emacs in the future,</span>
<span title="00:00:11.240" data-start="00:00:11.240" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and what I would prefer not to find there.</span>
<span title="00:00:17.600" data-start="00:00:17.600" data-video="mainVideo-rms">This is all within the context</span>
<span title="00:00:22.080" data-start="00:00:22.080" data-video="mainVideo-rms">of GNU Emacs and its purpose.</span>
<span title="00:00:25.360" data-start="00:00:25.360" data-video="mainVideo-rms">GNU Emacs is a part of the GNU operating system,</span>
<span title="00:00:30.600" data-start="00:00:30.600" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and the purpose of the GNU operating system</span>
<span title="00:00:33.400" data-start="00:00:33.400" data-video="mainVideo-rms">is not simply to do a good job technically,</span>
<span title="00:00:38.840" data-start="00:00:38.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">not simply to be good to use.</span>
<span title="00:00:42.640" data-start="00:00:42.640" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Its main purpose, its overall purpose,</span>
<span title="00:00:45.760" data-start="00:00:45.760" data-video="mainVideo-rms">is to give people freedom,</span>
<span title="00:00:48.560" data-start="00:00:48.560" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and to help them value and defend that freedom.</span>
<span title="00:00:54.760" data-start="00:00:54.760" data-video="mainVideo-rms">A GNU package, by being a convenient, well-written program,</span>
<span title="00:01:00.160" data-start="00:01:00.160" data-video="mainVideo-rms">should contribute to that overall ethical and social goal,</span>
<span title="00:01:06.000" data-start="00:01:06.000" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and not only to the usefulness of our software.</span>
<span title="00:01:10.440" data-start="00:01:10.440" data-video="mainVideo-rms">This is true for GNU Emacs</span>
<span title="00:01:14.080" data-start="00:01:14.080" data-video="mainVideo-rms">as much as it is for any other free program weâ€™ve developed.</span>
<span title="00:01:18.720" data-start="00:01:18.720" data-video="mainVideo-rms">In fact, GNU Emacs is the first GNU program that I released.</span>
<span title="00:01:25.320" data-start="00:01:25.320" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I had written some other things before that,</span>
<span title="00:01:28.800" data-start="00:01:28.800" data-video="mainVideo-rms">but didn&#39;t release them at that time.</span>
<span title="00:01:30.600" data-start="00:01:30.600" data-video="mainVideo-rms">There was no particular use in doing so.</span>
<span title="00:01:34.200" data-start="00:01:34.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">So it was through GNU Emacs</span>
<span title="00:01:36.107" data-start="00:01:36.107" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that I learned about various things</span>
<span title="00:01:38.407" data-start="00:01:38.407" data-video="mainVideo-rms">such as software licenses and how to defend freedom.</span>
<span title="00:01:44.240" data-start="00:01:44.240" data-video="mainVideo-rms">You&#39;re of course familiar with what GNU Emacs is today,</span>
<span title="00:01:50.507" data-start="00:01:50.507" data-video="mainVideo-rms">thanks to the contributions of thousands of other people</span>
<span title="00:01:54.340" data-start="00:01:54.340" data-video="mainVideo-rms">who came after me.</span>
<span title="00:01:57.067" data-start="00:01:57.067" data-video="mainVideo-rms">What would I like?</span>
<span title="00:01:58.880" data-start="00:01:58.880" data-video="mainVideo-rms">What would other people like?</span>
<span title="00:02:01.533" data-start="00:02:01.533" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Lots of people come to Emacs familiar with VS Code,</span>
<span title="00:02:06.480" data-start="00:02:06.480" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and they say, &#34;Please make Emacs more like VS Code.</span>
<span title="00:02:10.520" data-start="00:02:10.520" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Change everything that you did in the 1980s and 90s</span>
<span title="00:02:15.840" data-start="00:02:15.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to be like that other thing.&#34;</span>
<span title="00:02:18.320" data-start="00:02:18.320" data-video="mainVideo-rms">That wouldn&#39;t be feasible even if we wanted to.</span>
<span title="00:02:24.200" data-start="00:02:24.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Our goal is not to be... not resembling VS Code.</span>
<span title="00:02:30.440" data-start="00:02:30.440" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Any resemblance is coincidental.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:02:33.640" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:02:33.640]</a> <span data-start="00:02:33.640" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">But in particular,</span>
<span title="00:02:38.040" data-start="00:02:38.040" data-video="mainVideo-rms">we do not want to have extension languages other than Lisp.</span>
<span title="00:02:43.874" data-start="00:02:43.874" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Emacs Lisp is the variant of Lisp</span>
<span title="00:02:47.574" data-start="00:02:47.574" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that we&#39;ve always supported,</span>
<span title="00:02:49.574" data-start="00:02:49.574" data-video="mainVideo-rms">which has evolved along with Emacs.</span>
<span title="00:02:52.960" data-start="00:02:52.960" data-video="mainVideo-rms">We can conceivably have Scheme as well,</span>
<span title="00:02:57.400" data-start="00:02:57.400" data-video="mainVideo-rms">if we can sufficiently solve the problems,</span>
<span title="00:03:01.140" data-start="00:03:01.140" data-video="mainVideo-rms">the technical problems of making Scheme</span>
<span title="00:03:03.760" data-start="00:03:03.760" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and Emacs Lisp interoperate.</span>
<span title="00:03:06.480" data-start="00:03:06.480" data-video="mainVideo-rms">We did some design work, I think that was with Tom Lord,</span>
<span title="00:03:11.600" data-start="00:03:11.600" data-video="mainVideo-rms">whom the community will greatly miss.</span>
<span title="00:03:15.880" data-start="00:03:15.880" data-video="mainVideo-rms">In the 1990s, there are challenges that remain;</span>
<span title="00:03:19.340" data-start="00:03:19.340" data-video="mainVideo-rms">maybe it can be done.</span>
<span title="00:03:21.360" data-start="00:03:21.360" data-video="mainVideo-rms">But a non-Lispy language would be a mistake.</span>
<span title="00:03:27.960" data-start="00:03:27.960" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It would divert our development focus into areas</span>
<span title="00:03:33.000" data-start="00:03:33.000" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that we don&#39;t need, languages that are less powerful,</span>
<span title="00:03:37.480" data-start="00:03:37.480" data-video="mainVideo-rms">less beautiful, and less desirable for the purpose.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:03:46.280" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:03:46.280]</a> <span data-start="00:03:46.280" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">However, the language that we above all shouldn&#39;t support</span>
<span title="00:03:52.120" data-start="00:03:52.120" data-video="mainVideo-rms">is JavaScript. That&#39;s not because of the language itself.</span>
<span title="00:03:57.333" data-start="00:03:57.333" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I don&#39;t know the JavaScript language,</span>
<span title="00:04:00.480" data-start="00:04:00.480" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I&#39;ve heard people say it&#39;s rather clumsy</span>
<span title="00:04:04.200" data-start="00:04:04.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and not well designed, but I don&#39;t know this.</span>
<span title="00:04:07.520" data-start="00:04:07.520" data-video="mainVideo-rms">In any case, it&#39;s not what my views are based on.</span>
<span title="00:04:12.400" data-start="00:04:12.400" data-video="mainVideo-rms">There&#39;s something much worse about JavaScript,</span>
<span title="00:04:14.840" data-start="00:04:14.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">which is not the language itself, but how people use it.</span>
<span title="00:04:18.800" data-start="00:04:18.800" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Namely, it&#39;s been adopted as a way for a network server</span>
<span title="00:04:23.640" data-start="00:04:23.640" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to send a program to your machine</span>
<span title="00:04:26.120" data-start="00:04:26.120" data-video="mainVideo-rms">without your even noticing, so that this program,</span>
<span title="00:04:30.120" data-start="00:04:30.120" data-video="mainVideo-rms">written by you don&#39;t know who, will run on your computer</span>
<span title="00:04:35.107" data-start="00:04:35.107" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and do you don&#39;t know what.</span>
<span title="00:04:37.200" data-start="00:04:37.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">And you&#39;re supposed to just trust</span>
<span title="00:04:39.774" data-start="00:04:39.774" data-video="mainVideo-rms">all and sundry developers of software</span>
<span title="00:04:43.640" data-start="00:04:43.640" data-video="mainVideo-rms">for the sites you visit,</span>
<span title="00:04:45.840" data-start="00:04:45.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">which very commonly do malicious things, often unknown</span>
<span title="00:04:51.320" data-start="00:04:51.320" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to the people who are running the server itself.</span>
<span title="00:04:55.680" data-start="00:04:55.680" data-video="mainVideo-rms">They paid someone else to design a website</span>
<span title="00:04:59.320" data-start="00:04:59.320" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and they probably said, oh,</span>
<span title="00:05:01.407" data-start="00:05:01.407" data-video="mainVideo-rms">make it fashionable and attractive.</span>
<span title="00:05:04.440" data-start="00:05:04.440" data-video="mainVideo-rms">And they didn&#39;t insist, don&#39;t snoop on the visitors,</span>
<span title="00:05:09.760" data-start="00:05:09.760" data-video="mainVideo-rms">even if they understood what the issue was.</span>
<span title="00:05:12.840" data-start="00:05:12.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">So these sites snoop. It&#39;s a serious problem.</span>
<span title="00:05:20.480" data-start="00:05:20.480" data-video="mainVideo-rms">The problem comes not from the language JavaScript,</span>
<span title="00:05:24.080" data-start="00:05:24.080" data-video="mainVideo-rms">but from the fact that browsers, by default,</span>
<span title="00:05:28.680" data-start="00:05:28.680" data-video="mainVideo-rms">will pull in JavaScript code that gets sent to them</span>
<span title="00:05:32.440" data-start="00:05:32.440" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and run it to do anything at all.</span>
<span title="00:05:35.933" data-start="00:05:35.933" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Emacs is supposed to defend your freedom.</span>
<span title="00:05:39.320" data-start="00:05:39.320" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It&#39;s supposed to help you to defend your freedom,</span>
<span title="00:05:42.520" data-start="00:05:42.520" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and lead you to defend your freedom,</span>
<span title="00:05:45.640" data-start="00:05:45.640" data-video="mainVideo-rms">which means it shouldn&#39;t lead you</span>
<span title="00:05:47.200" data-start="00:05:47.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to throw your freedom away as soon as you visit a site</span>
<span title="00:05:50.960" data-start="00:05:50.960" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that tries to send you a non-free program</span>
<span title="00:05:53.920" data-start="00:05:53.920" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to run straight off of that other machine.</span>
<span title="00:05:58.280" data-start="00:05:58.280" data-video="mainVideo-rms">So it&#39;s important not to lead users</span>
<span title="00:06:04.080" data-start="00:06:04.080" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to do computing this way.</span>
<span title="00:06:06.520" data-start="00:06:06.520" data-video="mainVideo-rms">So what are some good things</span>
<span title="00:06:10.800" data-start="00:06:10.800" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that we would want instead of this?</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:06:14.640" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:06:14.640]</a> <span data-start="00:06:14.640" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">One thing we want</span>
<span title="00:06:19.874" data-start="00:06:19.874" data-video="mainVideo-rms">is to update the &#34;Introduction to Emacs Lisp Programming&#34;</span>
<span title="00:06:26.574" data-start="00:06:26.574" data-video="mainVideo-rms">by the late Bob Chassell.</span>
<span title="00:06:29.480" data-start="00:06:29.480" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It&#39;s a book that makes it easy for even non-programmers</span>
<span title="00:06:34.720" data-start="00:06:34.720" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to learn to write simple programs in Emacs Lisp.</span>
<span title="00:06:38.000" data-start="00:06:38.000" data-video="mainVideo-rms">And from there, they can go on to do better.</span>
<span title="00:06:41.200" data-start="00:06:41.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">We made a pretty big change in Emacs Lisp</span>
<span title="00:06:44.800" data-start="00:06:44.800" data-video="mainVideo-rms">a few years ago, implementing lexical scoping by default.</span>
<span title="00:06:49.480" data-start="00:06:49.480" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Originally, Emacs Lisp used to be entirely dynamic scoping,</span>
<span title="00:06:57.360" data-start="00:06:57.360" data-video="mainVideo-rms">like some of the earliest Lisp interpreters.</span>
<span title="00:07:01.960" data-start="00:07:01.960" data-video="mainVideo-rms">This is a change that should have a careful job</span>
<span title="00:07:06.520" data-start="00:07:06.520" data-video="mainVideo-rms">of updating for the introduction.</span>
<span title="00:07:10.560" data-start="00:07:10.560" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve made it clear in the reference manual,</span>
<span title="00:07:14.600" data-start="00:07:14.600" data-video="mainVideo-rms">but that&#39;s not what beginners read first.</span>
<span title="00:07:18.400" data-start="00:07:18.400" data-video="mainVideo-rms">We need something to teach them in lexical scoping.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:07:23.407" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:07:23.407]</a> <span data-start="00:07:23.407" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Another thing we could use is to make it easier</span>
<span title="00:07:30.440" data-start="00:07:30.440" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to understand the facilities that we have.</span>
<span title="00:07:33.880" data-start="00:07:33.880" data-video="mainVideo-rms">For instance, I think every package</span>
<span title="00:07:38.560" data-start="00:07:38.560" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that you might load into your Emacs and run</span>
<span title="00:07:42.200" data-start="00:07:42.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">should have a name that helps you remember what job it does.</span>
<span title="00:07:47.680" data-start="00:07:47.680" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It doesn&#39;t have to be super long to tell you</span>
<span title="00:07:51.374" data-start="00:07:51.374" data-video="mainVideo-rms">what job that package does.</span>
<span title="00:07:53.607" data-start="00:07:53.607" data-video="mainVideo-rms">You can read the description to learn that.</span>
<span title="00:07:56.874" data-start="00:07:56.874" data-video="mainVideo-rms">But once you&#39;ve read the description,</span>
<span title="00:07:59.600" data-start="00:07:59.600" data-video="mainVideo-rms">it should be memorable. When you see that name again,</span>
<span title="00:08:03.074" data-start="00:08:03.074" data-video="mainVideo-rms">you should realize, oh, that&#39;s the package I could use</span>
<span title="00:08:06.607" data-start="00:08:06.607" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to do &#34;less&#34; and so. We&#39;ve had a tendency</span>
<span title="00:08:11.880" data-start="00:08:11.880" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to give packages names for the sake of pure wordplay</span>
<span title="00:08:17.940" data-start="00:08:17.940" data-video="mainVideo-rms">or lack of obvious meaning,</span>
<span title="00:08:23.574" data-start="00:08:23.574" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and I think we should add on, to those packages,</span>
<span title="00:08:28.189" data-start="00:08:28.189" data-video="mainVideo-rms">names that people will remember.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:08:31.807" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:08:31.807]</a> <span data-start="00:08:31.807" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Also, there are ways we can simplify the command interface</span>
<span title="00:08:39.200" data-start="00:08:39.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">of Emacs. For instance, there are many different parameters</span>
<span title="00:08:43.760" data-start="00:08:43.760" data-video="mainVideo-rms">users can specify that can have several values,</span>
<span title="00:08:48.000" data-start="00:08:48.000" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and sometimes you do various kinds of editing</span>
<span title="00:08:51.807" data-start="00:08:51.807" data-video="mainVideo-rms">in one session. That&#39;s normal in Emacs,</span>
<span title="00:08:54.440" data-start="00:08:54.440" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and you might want different parameter settings</span>
<span title="00:08:57.840" data-start="00:08:57.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">for different kinds of editing.</span>
<span title="00:09:00.407" data-start="00:09:00.407" data-video="mainVideo-rms">So you specify parameter value A, do some editing,</span>
<span title="00:09:06.200" data-start="00:09:06.200" data-video="mainVideo-rms">you specify parameter value B, and do some editing,</span>
<span title="00:09:10.240" data-start="00:09:10.240" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and you&#39;d switch back and forth, so you want</span>
<span title="00:09:13.720" data-start="00:09:13.720" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to switch back and forth between these parameters.</span>
<span title="00:09:17.440" data-start="00:09:17.440" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I think we should aim ...</span>
<span title="00:09:22.707" data-start="00:09:22.707" data-video="mainVideo-rms">People have added various commands to switch</span>
<span title="00:09:26.740" data-start="00:09:26.740" data-video="mainVideo-rms">between the last two or n values of this parameter,</span>
<span title="00:09:30.500" data-start="00:09:30.500" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and another command to switch</span>
<span title="00:09:32.774" data-start="00:09:32.774" data-video="mainVideo-rms">between the last two or n values of this [other] parameter,</span>
<span title="00:09:36.840" data-start="00:09:36.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and then that parameter, you know, and that parameter.</span>
<span title="00:09:41.360" data-start="00:09:41.360" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I think we should be able to have</span>
<span title="00:09:44.767" data-start="00:09:44.767" data-video="mainVideo-rms">a switch between the last n values command</span>
<span title="00:09:49.120" data-start="00:09:49.120" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that works on various different parameters,</span>
<span title="00:09:54.320" data-start="00:09:54.320" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and thus makes it easy to remember</span>
<span title="00:09:57.040" data-start="00:09:57.040" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that there is this facility.</span>
<span title="00:09:59.340" data-start="00:09:59.340" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Because right now the commands to do that are all ad-hoc,</span>
<span title="00:10:03.874" data-start="00:10:03.874" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and if you don&#39;t use a toggling among the last n values</span>
<span title="00:10:08.640" data-start="00:10:08.640" data-video="mainVideo-rms">of a given parameter, you won&#39;t know how to do it.</span>
<span title="00:10:11.840" data-start="00:10:11.840" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It won&#39;t be obvious that there is a way,</span>
<span title="00:10:15.367" data-start="00:10:15.367" data-video="mainVideo-rms">so you&#39;d have to go to a suitable manual</span>
<span title="00:10:17.767" data-start="00:10:17.767" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and study for a while to think of that.</span>
<span title="00:10:20.100" data-start="00:10:20.100" data-video="mainVideo-rms">We could make this easily discoverable.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:10:23.620" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:10:23.620]</a> <span data-start="00:10:23.620" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">There is another kind of modularity that&#39;s important,</span>
<span title="00:10:30.140" data-start="00:10:30.140" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and that is modularity at the level of maintenance.</span>
<span title="00:10:34.100" data-start="00:10:34.100" data-video="mainVideo-rms">This is something all programmers know about, of course,</span>
<span title="00:10:38.307" data-start="00:10:38.307" data-video="mainVideo-rms">but in Emacs, various parts interact with other parts,</span>
<span title="00:10:43.300" data-start="00:10:43.300" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and we&#39;ve tried to make them modular in design</span>
<span title="00:10:47.980" data-start="00:10:47.980" data-video="mainVideo-rms">by using lots of hooks,</span>
<span title="00:10:50.380" data-start="00:10:50.380" data-video="mainVideo-rms">but we haven&#39;t gone as far as we could.</span>
<span title="00:10:54.380" data-start="00:10:54.380" data-video="mainVideo-rms">With some effort, we could find calls</span>
<span title="00:10:58.060" data-start="00:10:58.060" data-video="mainVideo-rms">from over here to over there</span>
<span title="00:11:00.220" data-start="00:11:00.220" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that could be replaced by use of hooks,</span>
<span title="00:11:03.140" data-start="00:11:03.140" data-video="mainVideo-rms">so that we could reduce the extent</span>
<span title="00:11:05.940" data-start="00:11:05.940" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to which you need to know about one part of Emacs</span>
<span title="00:11:09.974" data-start="00:11:09.974" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to maintain another part of Emacs,</span>
<span title="00:11:12.707" data-start="00:11:12.707" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and I think that as we keep adding more facilities to Emacs,</span>
<span title="00:11:17.580" data-start="00:11:17.580" data-video="mainVideo-rms">this kind of modularity will be an investment that pays off.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:11:22.220" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:11:22.220]</a> <span data-start="00:11:22.220" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Thereâ€™s one big area of features</span>
<span title="00:11:27.240" data-start="00:11:27.240" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that I would like to see in Emacs,</span>
<span title="00:11:30.800" data-start="00:11:30.800" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and that&#39;s the ability to edit</span>
<span title="00:11:33.180" data-start="00:11:33.180" data-video="mainVideo-rms">formatted documents in WYSIWYG, to be able to edit</span>
<span title="00:11:40.340" data-start="00:11:40.340" data-video="mainVideo-rms">a letter or a scientific mathematical paper with formulas</span>
<span title="00:11:47.940" data-start="00:11:47.940" data-video="mainVideo-rms">or a nicely laid out manual,</span>
<span title="00:11:52.900" data-start="00:11:52.900" data-video="mainVideo-rms">looking at what it&#39;s really going to look like.</span>
<span title="00:11:56.660" data-start="00:11:56.660" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Now we have free software to do this.</span>
<span title="00:12:00.460" data-start="00:12:00.460" data-video="mainVideo-rms">For instance, I use LibreOffice some of the time.</span>
<span title="00:12:04.660" data-start="00:12:04.660" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Sometimes it&#39;s faster than writing something</span>
<span title="00:12:08.100" data-start="00:12:08.100" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to be formatted with a text formatter</span>
<span title="00:12:11.860" data-start="00:12:11.860" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and then formatting it. But when I use LibreOffice,</span>
<span title="00:12:16.180" data-start="00:12:16.180" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I always miss the commands and facilities,</span>
<span title="00:12:19.220" data-start="00:12:19.220" data-video="mainVideo-rms">the editing facilities of Emacs.</span>
<span title="00:12:22.674" data-start="00:12:22.674" data-video="mainVideo-rms">I&#39;d like to have them both together, something with</span>
<span title="00:12:26.500" data-start="00:12:26.500" data-video="mainVideo-rms">the text formatting capabilities of LibreOffice</span>
<span title="00:12:30.340" data-start="00:12:30.340" data-video="mainVideo-rms">or even better of TeX, but the editing commands</span>
<span title="00:12:36.060" data-start="00:12:36.060" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and facilities of Emacs. This would be a big job,</span>
<span title="00:12:40.300" data-start="00:12:40.300" data-video="mainVideo-rms">but it can be made up of a lot of medium-sized jobs.</span>
<span title="00:12:45.980" data-start="00:12:45.980" data-video="mainVideo-rms">If people start working on those medium-sized jobs,</span>
<span title="00:12:50.020" data-start="00:12:50.020" data-video="mainVideo-rms">then in a number of years</span>
<span title="00:12:52.060" data-start="00:12:52.060" data-video="mainVideo-rms">we&#39;ll have something absolutely amazing.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:12:55.460" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:12:55.460]</a> <span data-start="00:12:55.460" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">But one thing I think we really shouldn&#39;t have</span>
<span title="00:13:01.140" data-start="00:13:01.140" data-video="mainVideo-rms">is the equivalent of a modern web browser.</span>
<span title="00:13:06.500" data-start="00:13:06.500" data-video="mainVideo-rms">The World Wide Web started out in the 1990s</span>
<span title="00:13:10.940" data-start="00:13:10.940" data-video="mainVideo-rms">in a much simpler form,</span>
<span title="00:13:13.874" data-start="00:13:13.874" data-video="mainVideo-rms">where a web page described its contents,</span>
<span title="00:13:17.820" data-start="00:13:17.820" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and the web browser laid them out,</span>
<span title="00:13:21.180" data-start="00:13:21.180" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and the user could parameterize</span>
<span title="00:13:23.807" data-start="00:13:23.807" data-video="mainVideo-rms">how to lay out various kinds of situations.</span>
<span title="00:13:27.140" data-start="00:13:27.140" data-video="mainVideo-rms">This was not only convenient for users</span>
<span title="00:13:31.807" data-start="00:13:31.807" data-video="mainVideo-rms">who wanted to control things and understand things,</span>
<span title="00:13:35.974" data-start="00:13:35.974" data-video="mainVideo-rms">it was also freedom-respecting</span>
<span title="00:13:39.740" data-start="00:13:39.740" data-video="mainVideo-rms">because the layout was done by your browser.</span>
<span title="00:13:43.020" data-start="00:13:43.020" data-video="mainVideo-rms">If you had a free browser, you were in control,</span>
<span title="00:13:48.100" data-start="00:13:48.100" data-video="mainVideo-rms">even though the browser was complicated already.</span>
<span title="00:13:51.620" data-start="00:13:51.620" data-video="mainVideo-rms">But starting around two decades ago,</span>
<span title="00:13:54.807" data-start="00:13:54.807" data-video="mainVideo-rms">there was an explosion in the complexity of browsers</span>
<span title="00:13:58.820" data-start="00:13:58.820" data-video="mainVideo-rms">as companies wanted to have more and more control</span>
<span title="00:14:02.780" data-start="00:14:02.780" data-video="mainVideo-rms">over exactly what would appear on a user&#39;s screen.</span>
<span title="00:14:07.700" data-start="00:14:07.700" data-video="mainVideo-rms">So they invented lots of features to control that,</span>
<span title="00:14:12.474" data-start="00:14:12.474" data-video="mainVideo-rms">features where the user couldn&#39;t really customize</span>
<span title="00:14:16.007" data-start="00:14:16.007" data-video="mainVideo-rms">how something would actually appear</span>
<span title="00:14:18.407" data-start="00:14:18.407" data-video="mainVideo-rms">because the whole point was that</span>
<span title="00:14:21.307" data-start="00:14:21.307" data-video="mainVideo-rms">the company could control that.</span>
<span title="00:14:23.807" data-start="00:14:23.807" data-video="mainVideo-rms">And JavaScript was sort of the ultimate level</span>
<span title="00:14:27.020" data-start="00:14:27.020" data-video="mainVideo-rms">of &#34;the company controls everything.&#34;</span>
<span title="00:14:32.107" data-start="00:14:32.107" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Because of this, going beyond the simple level</span>
<span title="00:14:38.500" data-start="00:14:38.500" data-video="mainVideo-rms">of web page formatting features in Emacs</span>
<span title="00:14:43.540" data-start="00:14:43.540" data-video="mainVideo-rms">is basically heading down a path that leads to subjugation.</span>
<span title="00:14:50.940" data-start="00:14:50.940" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It&#39;s a path that we need to stay away from.</span>
<span title="00:14:54.740" data-start="00:14:54.740" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It&#39;s a path to an unjust world of computing</span>
<span title="00:15:00.407" data-start="00:15:00.407" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that you can easily see around you.</span>
<span title="00:15:03.420" data-start="00:15:03.420" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Web browsers nowadays are designed to display ads</span>
<span title="00:15:08.700" data-start="00:15:08.700" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that you may not want to see.</span>
<span title="00:15:11.667" data-start="00:15:11.667" data-video="mainVideo-rms">They&#39;re designed for DRM.</span>
<span title="00:15:17.900" data-start="00:15:17.900" data-video="mainVideo-rms">They&#39;re designed for companies to snoop on you</span>
<span title="00:15:22.420" data-start="00:15:22.420" data-video="mainVideo-rms">in unobvious ways. And all of that</span>
<span title="00:15:26.300" data-start="00:15:26.300" data-video="mainVideo-rms">we should protect ourselves from,</span>
<span title="00:15:28.980" data-start="00:15:28.980" data-video="mainVideo-rms">protect our users from.</span></p>

<p><a href="#mainVideo-rms" data-start="00:15:31.300" data-video="mainVideo-rms">[00:15:31.300]</a> <span data-start="00:15:31.300" title="" data-video="mainVideo-rms">So I hope that some of you will be enthusiastic</span>
<span title="00:15:39.980" data-start="00:15:39.980" data-video="mainVideo-rms">about some of these changes,</span>
<span title="00:15:42.060" data-start="00:15:42.060" data-video="mainVideo-rms">especially towards editing formatted text.</span>
<span title="00:15:46.940" data-start="00:15:46.940" data-video="mainVideo-rms">If you want to get involved, we have</span>
<span title="00:15:51.980" data-start="00:15:51.980" data-video="mainVideo-rms">a development discussion list called emacs-devel@gnu.org.</span>
<span title="00:15:57.820" data-start="00:15:57.820" data-video="mainVideo-rms">You can join that. You can also,</span>
<span title="00:16:02.380" data-start="00:16:02.380" data-video="mainVideo-rms">if you get interested in working on a package</span>
<span title="00:16:05.740" data-start="00:16:05.740" data-video="mainVideo-rms">and you&#39;re not an experienced Emacs Lisp developer,</span>
<span title="00:16:09.500" data-start="00:16:09.500" data-video="mainVideo-rms">it&#39;s a very good idea to look for an experienced developer</span>
<span title="00:16:13.740" data-start="00:16:13.740" data-video="mainVideo-rms">to talk with.</span>
<span title="00:16:14.980" data-start="00:16:14.980" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Make sure you can write programs in Emacs Lisp first.</span>
<span title="00:16:19.220" data-start="00:16:19.220" data-video="mainVideo-rms">It&#39;s not useful to take up the expertâ€™s time learning that.</span>
<span title="00:16:24.260" data-start="00:16:24.260" data-video="mainVideo-rms">You can still learn it from the introduction.</span>
<span title="00:16:27.407" data-start="00:16:27.407" data-video="mainVideo-rms">But after that, when it&#39;s a matter of how to design</span>
<span title="00:16:31.660" data-start="00:16:31.660" data-video="mainVideo-rms">your favorite package, do have a discussion with developers.</span>
<span title="00:16:36.180" data-start="00:16:36.180" data-video="mainVideo-rms">They&#39;ll give you design ideas</span>
<span title="00:16:39.060" data-start="00:16:39.060" data-video="mainVideo-rms">that will help you make a package that we put into Emacs.</span>
<span title="00:16:43.180" data-start="00:16:43.180" data-video="mainVideo-rms">Now it&#39;s time for questions.</span></p>
