    <h1>Self-hosting is being enshittified</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Self-hosting is hard. I know this because I self-host as many services as I can.</p><p>2025 was a big year for self-hosting. The good news? It&#39;s going mainstream:</p><ul><li>More people are choosing <a href="https://immich.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Immich</a> as a backup or as an alternative to cloud options as they show how unreliable they are <a href="https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">time and time again</a>.</li><li><a href="https://about.gitea.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gitea</a> and <a href="https://forgejo.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forgejo</a> are becoming more relevant after <a href="https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub decided to charge for self-hosted runners</a>.</li><li>Apparently, even non-tech YouTubers with 9-digit subscribers counts are promoting self-hosting.</li></ul><p>But it was also the year when self-hosting got way harder in multiple ways.</p><p>You&#39;ve probably heard that already — DRAM prices are insane already, ~3-4x higher compared to September 2025, and flash prices are slowly catching up. Here&#39;s a great summary video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUrJVdF2me0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamersNexus</a>.</p><p>If you&#39;re reading this article and you were planning on getting a new computer, then you better act fast. When I saw the price charts, I ordered a maxed-out Framework Desktop. Not because I needed it immediately, but because I felt that it could be the last chance to cover my abstract hardware needs for next 3 years at reasonable prices.</p><p>Just a couple of days ago Framework increased RAM prices to $10/GB across their laptops, I expect Desktop to follow soon. At these prices, 128GB RAM would cost around $1280 — that&#39;s <a href="https://xcancel.com/FrameworkPuter/status/2003904160551579793" rel="noopener" target="_blank">almost 65% of total price</a> of Framework Desktop. At $1999 today it&#39;s an absolute steal.</p><p>I also bought a new NVMe for it, Samsung 990 Pro 1TB. I paid €100 for it in late November, now it goes for around €150 at the same seller — price increased by 50% in a month. It doesn&#39;t stop here; consumer GPU prices will be affected too. Nvidia is reportedly <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-might-cut-rtx-50-gpu-supply-by-up-to-40-in-2026-due-to-memory-shortages" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cutting production of GeForce series by 40% next year</a>.</p><p>SBCs are feeling the pressure too — Raspberry Pi introduced <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/1gb-raspberry-pi-5-now-available-at-45-and-memory-driven-price-rises/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new RPi 5 1GB model</a> and raised prices for other variants. Even old hardware isn&#39;t safe: DDR4 prices are also affected, so that tiny ThinkCentre M720 won&#39;t save us.</p><p>It will get worse before it gets better. I don&#39;t expect it to improve in 2026 or even in 2027. Multi-billion companies don&#39;t care about ordinary consumers, they&#39;d rather sell their products to other multi-billion companies. That alone has made 2025 a tough year for self-hosting. But there&#39;s another issue that&#39;s arguably worse: the software is becoming less trustworthy.</p><p>Another notable development in 2025: popular self-hosted software going through enshittification. Let&#39;s take a look at some noteworthy examples.</p><p>Plex, a popular media streaming software, has been going through similar developments for years, but this year it dropped to a new low. First, Plex added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kcgw3c/no_longer_free_to_stream_personal_content_on_plex/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a paid license for remote streaming, a feature that was previously free</a>. And then Plex decided to also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kwyqs5/plex_want_to_sell_my_personal_data_now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sell personal data</a> — I sure love self-hosted software spying on me.</p><p>MinIO removed <a href="https://github.com/minio/object-browser/pull/3509" rel="noopener" target="_blank">admin UI</a> causing a massive backlash. And then they moved open-source variant into <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/27742d469462e1561c776f88ca7a1f26816d69e2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">maintenance</a> without any prior announcements, basically killing it and forcing users to look for a replacement.</p><p>Mattermost suddenly introduced <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/34271" rel="noopener" target="_blank">10K messages limit</a>. <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/34271#issuecomment-3456991701" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This comment</a> perfectly captures my thoughts:</p><blockquote><p>Our server, our database, but it&#39;s limited to 10K. It seems a joke</p></blockquote><p>Such incidents raise a lot of questions and concerns. What&#39;s the point of self-hosting if the software you&#39;re hosting can unilaterally decide to limit features, harvest data, or abandon open-source development? The whole appeal was avoiding this exact behavior. And the hardest question of them all — how do I trust new self-hosted software?</p><p>I expect more of the same. Self-hosting has always been hard, and it&#39;s not getting easier. Each year brings fresh challenges — rising costs, projects changing direction, infrastructure complexity. The challenges just never end.</p><p>That&#39;s the trade-off we make to claw back control and flexibility. The only actionable advice I have: choose your software carefully and be ready to migrate. Because with self-hosting, the question isn&#39;t <em>if</em> something will break or change — it&#39;s <em>when</em>.</p><hr/></section></div>
