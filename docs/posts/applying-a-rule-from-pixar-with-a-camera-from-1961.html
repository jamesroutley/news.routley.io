    <h1>Applying a rule from Pixar with a camera from 1961</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>While I love my digital camera, I felt the need for a camera that would challenge me and pull me out of my habits. A camera that I could bring anywhere, wouldn&#39;t use in the same situations as my digital camera, and would challenge me creatively. </p><h3 id="what-is-this-camera">What is this camera?</h3><figure><img src="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/image-1.jpeg" alt="Olympus pen ee3" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-1.jpeg 600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-1.jpeg 1000w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/image-1.jpeg 1600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/image-1.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>While visiting Tokyo&#39;s fabulous vintage camera stores, I discovered the Olympus Pen ee3.</p><p>This camera has an interesting origin story. Yoshihisa Maitani, the legendary Olympus camera designer, was on his way to work in Tokyo. He happened to see a mother photographing her young son with one of the cameras he designed. While watching her, he realised the pictures would be out of focus because of the settings. He then decided to design a camera that won&#39;t let you make a mistake. This camera is the Olympus Pen ee series.</p><p>The best part about it is that it&#39;s all automatic, no batteries are needed! (the exposure is measured through the selenium meter ring that you can see around the lens). Using something entirely mechanical feels magical. The ee3 is actually from 1973 but the design is nearly identical to the first model from 1961. </p><p>My favorite detail is probably the frame counter which reminds me of an old car&#39;s speedometer.</p><figure><img src="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/image-2.jpeg" alt="Olympus pen ee3 frame counter" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-2.jpeg 600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-2.jpeg 1000w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/image-2.jpeg 1600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/image-2.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>As you can see it goes up to 72, not the usual 36. The reason is that it is a <strong>half-frame</strong> camera. It splits a normal exposure into 2 vertical pictures, which allows you to do those double compositions called diptychs. And that&#39;s where Pixar comes in.</p><h3 id="the-pixar-rule">The Pixar rule</h3><blockquote>Don&#39;t give the audience 4, give them 2 + 2.</blockquote><p>Giving out the pieces and letting your audience make the connection feels more gratifying. It demands participation from the viewer to make them work; the same way books, comics, and sketches do.</p><p>With that in mind, I went out walking in Tokyo to experiment with different strategies around that concept.</p><h3 id="traveling-through-the-picture">Traveling through the picture</h3><p>I remember as a kid looking at the images on the back of video game cases and wishing I could explore these worlds. I tried to bring that feeling into these diptychs. I wanted to give a sense that you could walk through the photograph.</p><figure><img src="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/IMG_5186.jpeg" alt="Tokyo station [Olympus pen ee3, Kodak Gold]" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1389" srcset="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/IMG_5186.jpeg 600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/IMG_5186.jpeg 1000w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/IMG_5186.jpeg 1600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/IMG_5186.jpeg 2211w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><figure><img src="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/IMG_5192-2-1.JPG" alt="Akihabara arcade center [Olympus pen ee3, Kodak Gold]" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1389" srcset="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/IMG_5192-2-1.JPG 600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/IMG_5192-2-1.JPG 1000w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/IMG_5192-2-1.JPG 1600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/IMG_5192-2-1.JPG 2211w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><figure><img src="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/IMG_5173.JPG" alt="Parking in Tokyo [Olympus pen ee3, Kodak Gold]" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1389" srcset="https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/IMG_5173.JPG 600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/IMG_5173.JPG 1000w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/IMG_5173.JPG 1600w, https://news.gregjeanneau.com/content/images/2022/07/IMG_5173.JPG 2211w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h3 id="paradoxical-connections">Paradoxical connections</h3><p>I wanted these compositions to look arresting.
