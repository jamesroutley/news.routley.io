    <h1>Ask HN: How do you find developers for open source bug bounties?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><i>Background: There&#39;s a WebRTC Chromium bug that is making life difficult for us. I&#39;d like to pay a developer to fix it, but I don&#39;t know where/how to find people.</i></p><p>But this leads to a higher level question.  When you want to sponsor open source bug fixes and/or feature and there isn&#39;t a clear &#34;sponsor&#34; link or button, how do you find qualified people?  For example, is there a site/app you typically search?</p></div></div></div>
