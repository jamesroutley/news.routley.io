    <h1>5GSimWaveform: Open Source Common Waveform Simulator for 5G Physical Layer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>Intro</b></p>
<p>Qamcom is spending a considerable part of its budget on research activities (both external and internal). Some of the results are not considered confidential and are therefore made publicly available. This can be in the form of research papers but also in the form of source code.</p>
<p>On this site we publish source-code that has been developed in the context of 5G research.</p>
<p><b>Waveform Simulator (5GSimWaveform)</b></p>
<p>5GSimWave is a waveform simulator that was originally developed to investigate which waveforms that would be suitable for 5G applications on mm-wave. It was used to investigate different waveforms and their robustness towards analog impairments such as phase-noise and non-linearities. Metrics that were typically analysed where symbol error rate as well as the transmit spectrum generated by different waveforms.</p>

<p>Please free to contact us for technical requests under: <a href="mailto:5GSim@qamcom.se">5GSimTeam</a>.</p>
<p>The project was originally started as an inhouse activity at Qamcom and then further developed/polished in research collaborations such as: <a href="https://5g-mmmagic.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mmMagic</a> and <a href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/chaseon/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C</a><a href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/chaseon/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hase</a>.</p>
<p>If you would be interested in working further with simulator and convert it to an open source project with continuous development, please contact <a href="mailto:5GSim@qamcom.se">5GSimTeam</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the simulator contains a simple channel model but can be run with the <a href="http://quadriga-channel-model.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quadriga</a> model instead. In order to use the Quadriga model you must <a href="http://quadriga-channel-model.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/QuaDriGa_2016.09.05_v1.4.8-571.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> it form the Quadriga website and copy the content in the Quadriga source folder into the subfolder ./channelModels/Quadriga.</p>
