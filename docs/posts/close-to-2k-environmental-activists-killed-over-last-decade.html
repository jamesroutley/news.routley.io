<p>Between 2012 and 2022, at least 1,910 people advocating for environmental protection were killed worldwide, a new report finds.</p>
<p>In 2022 alone, 177 environmental activists were murdered, or roughly one every other day, according to <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/standing-firm/">Global Witness</a>, a U.K.-based watchdog group. “Violence, intimidation, and harassment are also being inflicted to silence defenders around the world,” Shruti Suresh, of Global Witness, said in a <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/almost-2000-land-and-environmental-defenders-killed-between-2012-and-2022-protecting-planet/">statement</a>. </p>
<p>Nearly nine in 10 killings last year took place in Latin America, with three in 10 occurring in Colombia, the most dangerous country for <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/series/environmentalists-at-risk">environmental activists</a>. Colombia saw murders nearly double between 2021 and 2022, though last year ended on a hopeful note. In October, it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/colombia-environment-idUSKBN2R61D1">ratified</a> the Escazú Agreement, a <a href="https://www.universal-rights.org/the-escazu-agreement-a-landmark-regional-treaty-for-environmental-defenders/">regional pact</a> requiring countries to prevent attacks on environmental defenders. </p>
<p>Brazil saw the second-most killings, including the high-profile <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/after-two-murders-a-brazilian-indigenous-leader-steps-up-his-fight">murders</a> of Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips. Brazil was followed by Mexico, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/honduras-berta-caceres-murder-activists-environmentalists-at-risk">Honduras</a>, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Globally, one-third of victims were Indigenous people. “Research has shown again and again that Indigenous peoples are the best guardians of the forests and therefore play a fundamental role in mitigating the climate crisis,” said Laura Furones, of Global Witness. “Yet they are under siege in countries like Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela for doing precisely that.”</p>
