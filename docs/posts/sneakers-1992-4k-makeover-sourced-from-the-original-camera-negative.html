    <p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>Scour is now checking <strong>over 3,000 sources</strong> (3,034 to be precise) for content matching your interests. This month, it scoured <strong>281,968</strong> posts.</p>
<p>Here are the new features I added:</p>
<h2 id="hot-mode">üî• Hot Mode</h2><p>Scour now has a hot mode that shows content from the past week while balancing between relevance and recency. This will show you a mix of very recent posts with especially relevant ones from a few days ago that you might have missed.</p>
<p>Right now, Hot mode is the default. If you prefer a different timeframe (for example, the past day), you can set that in your <a href="https://scour.ing/settings">settings</a>. Thanks <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/16">justmoon</a> for the suggestion!</p>
<p>(One thing I&#39;m not so happy about with Hot mode is that it takes closer to ~250ms to load, rather than the &lt;100ms I&#39;m aiming for. I&#39;m working on getting that back down so your feed feels extra snappy, no matter which timeframe you pick.)</p>
<h2 id="extra-liking-posts">üå∞ Extra-Liking Posts</h2><p>You can now Love especially great posts you find on Scour using the acorn icon. It&#39;s up to you what counts as a Love versus a Like, but I&#39;m personally using it to mark those posts that make me think &#34;wow, I&#39;m so glad I found that! That&#39;s so timely and I definitely would have missed it otherwise.&#34; Thanks to everyone who voted for <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/45">this idea</a>.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/52">Vahe Hovhannisyan</a> brought up a good point that thinking about whether to like or love a post introduces extra decision fatigue. Please weigh in on this if you agree or disagree! I might make the love reaction an optional setting, hide it somehow, or remove it in the future.</p>
<h2 id="single-interest-view">üîç Single-Interest View</h2><p>You can click on any one of your interests on the <a href="https://scour.ing/interests">Interests page</a> or on the tags next to post titles to see only posts related to that interest.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://scour.ing/browse/users">browse other users&#39; pages</a>, you can also see posts related to any one of their interests. And, if you like a topic someone else has added, you can easily add that interest to your set. Thanks also to <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/30">justmoon</a> for this suggestion!</p>
<h2 id="design-update">üíÖ Design Update</h2><p>Scour got a design refresh! The website should look and feel a bit more modern and polished now. Let me know if you run into any little design issues.</p>
<p>(For those that are interested, I switched from PicoCSS to Tailwind. Pico was great for getting off the ground quickly, but I found I was fighting with it more and more as I built out more features.)</p>
<h2 id="email-updates-coming-soon">üì® Email Updates (Coming Soon!)</h2><p>I&#39;m almost done building out automatic email updates so you&#39;ll hopefully have the first personalized weekly roundup in your inboxes this Friday. Thanks to <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/7">Allen Kramer</a> for this suggestion!</p>
<h2 id="other-updates">üë∑ Other Updates</h2><ul>
<li>Added a Logout button on the Settings page. Thanks to the <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/47">anonymous contributor</a> who suggested this!</li>
<li>Also added an option to delete your account on the Settings page. Thanks to the other <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/48">anonymous contributor</a> who suggested this -- though I&#39;m sorry to see you go!</li>
<li>The JSON Feed version of all Scour-created feeds includes the score, quality, and quality probability for each post. Thanks to the <a href="https://feedback.scour.ing/50">anonymous contributor</a> who requested that!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-of-my-favorite-posts">üîñ Some of My Favorite Posts</h2><p>Here were a couple of <a href="https://scour.ing/@emschwartz/likes">my favorite posts</a> that I found on Scour this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2025/copying-sqlite-databases/">A faster way to copy SQLite databases between computers</a> (what a clever little trick! TL;DR using a DB dump to avoid copying indices)</li>
<li><a href="https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2025/04/29/two-tower.html">Two tower embeddings instead of &#39;hybrid search&#39;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.shaped.ai/blog/cross-encoder-rediscovers-a-semantic-variant-of-bm25">Cross-Encoder Rediscovers a Semantic Variant of BM25</a> (ü§Ø)</li>
