                              <p>The English alphabet didn&#39;t always go from <em>A</em> to <em>Z</em>. If you&#39;d been learning your ABC&#39;s in the 19th century it&#39;s very likely that your alphabet would have had a 27th member: <em>&amp;</em>. </p>

<p>The symbol, according to Keith Houston&#39;s charming and authoritative <em>Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols &amp; Other Typographical Marks</em>, appears in the historical record for the first time in some anonymous graffiti in the most famously ruined of ancient ruined cities: Pompeii. The exact date of its appearance is unknown, but the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which buried the city in volcanic ash, does, as Houston notes, &#34;impose a rather hard upper limit on the possible range of dates.&#34;</p>

<p>That very first ampersand was a <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/dictionary/ligature">ligature</a>—that is, a character consisting of two or more letters joined together. Its creator was joining the letters <em>e</em> and <em>t</em>, of the Latin word <em>et</em>, meaning &#34;and.&#34;</p>

<p>The first known example of the word <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/dictionary/ampersand"><em>ampersand</em></a> in English is from the late 18th century, but the word&#39;s origin lies in a linguistic tradition that dates to several centuries earlier. Starting in the late Middle Ages, single letters that also functioned as words—think <em>I</em> and <em>A</em>—were referred to as letters with the aid of the phrase <em>per se</em>, to clarify that it was the letter being referred to, and not the word. The letter <em>I</em>, for example, would be referred to with the phrase <em>I per se, I</em>, which means in Latin &#34;<em>I</em> by itself (is the word) <em>I</em>.&#34; When the 27th quasi-letter <em>&amp;</em> was referred to it was called <em>&amp; per se, and</em>, meaning &#34;<em>&amp;</em> by itself (is the word) <em>and</em>.&#34; That read as &#34;and per se and.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;And per se, and&#34; eventually evolved into <em>ampersand</em>, the word we know and love today. &amp; the rest is history.</p>
