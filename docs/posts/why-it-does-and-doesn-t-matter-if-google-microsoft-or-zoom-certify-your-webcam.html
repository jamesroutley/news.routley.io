<p>Logitech made a peculiar announcement in January.</p>
<p>It proudly <a href="https://blog.logitech.com/2023/01/03/logitechs-mice-keyboards-now-part-of-engineered-for-intel-evo-laptops-accessory-program/">declared</a> that its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/logitech-mx-master-3s-review-the-best-wireless-mouse-gets-slightly-better/">MX Master 3S</a> wireless mouse, along with some of its other peripherals, had been certified to work with Intel Evo laptops. (Evo laptops are Intel-certified premium ultralights meeting <a href="https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/performance/benchmarks/intel-evo/">certain criteria</a>, like providing at least eight hours of battery life with a QHD display.) Imagine my shock when I realized I had been using that very mouse with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/dell-xps-13-2022-review/">Dell XPS 13</a> (an Evo laptop) for almost eight months <em>without Intel&#39;s blessing.</em></p>
<p>Of course, even before the mouse gained Intel&#39;s stamp of approval, I had enjoyed hours of problem-free use. The same can be said of every functioning USB webcam I&#39;ve ever plugged into a computer. But that hasn&#39;t stopped countless peripheral makers from touting that their devices have been certified for Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.</p>
<p>And while we&#39;re at it, what&#39;s the point of the <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/workswithchromebook/">Works With Chromebook</a> certification program? Chromebooks are famous for the simplistic ChromeOS operating system. Does anyone really need proof beyond listed ChromeOS support that a mouse, keyboard, or webcam will work with a $200 Chromebook?</p>
<p>At best, vendor certification programs for peripherals seem to merely ensure support for something that&#39;s almost certainly a given. At worst, these programs could potentially lead tech novices to believe that a PC accessory won&#39;t work with their system just because a tech giant like Intel or Google hasn&#39;t said so outright.</p>
<p>Do these programs hold any value for tech-savvy users or IT managers, or are they all just marketing programs in disguise? I spoke with Intel, Google, Microsoft, and Zoom about their peripheral certification procedures to find out.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Most companies have specific, relevant requirements for their PC accessory certification programs, but the majority don&#39;t broadcast this information to the general public. But you may be pleasantly surprised by the sort of testing some of these programs put PC peripherals through. No, you don&#39;t need Intel to tell you that a mouse will work with a pricey laptop using one of its processors, but the Evo stamp demands the inclusion of features that could be helpful—such as a confirmed Bluetooth range of at least 32.8 feet—and it may bring an elevated experience beyond basic compatibility.</p>
<p>Companies are relatively tight-lipped about these requirements, however. Not only does that make it seem like the stamps are redundant marketing gimmicks, it diminishes the value they could provide to tech-savvy consumers.</p>
<h2>Other verifications with validity</h2>
<p>Certification programs for PC peripherals have been around forever. When a certification requires that a product meet stringent standards designed around real potential use cases, it offers clear value. A well-planned verification scheme can help end users and even IT teams identify products for niche or power users, create a baseline for testing, and draw attention to critical specs and features.</p>
<p>Standards or certification programs created as a joint effort between various industry experts and companies, such as VESA’s <a href="https://displayhdr.org/">DisplayHDR</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/vesas-latest-standard-grades-displays-on-motion-blur/">ClearMR</a> monitor certifications, the USB Implementers Forum&#39;s (USB-IF&#39;s) USB standards, or the Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group&#39;s PCIe standards, detail capabilities and performance that aren&#39;t a given otherwise.</p>
<p>But in contrast to industry standards, the programs we&#39;re about to discuss—the ones from Google, Microsoft, Intel, and Zoom—are each controlled by a single tech company and highlight a peripheral&#39;s compatibility with one of the company&#39;s specific platforms.</p>
<p>These programs might call to mind Apple&#39;s <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/">MFi program</a>, but that certification doesn&#39;t focus on computer peripherals. Apple products also have a history of not playing nicely with other third-party products, so there&#39;s a more obvious need for the MFi program, even though that need is self-inflicted.</p>
