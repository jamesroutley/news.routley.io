            TYRANNY of STRUCTURELESSNESS</SPAN></b></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
          earliest version of this article was given as a talk at a conference
          called by the Southern Female Rights Union, held in Beulah, Mississippi
          in May 1970. It was written up for <u>Notes from the Third Year</u> (1971),
          but the editors did not use it. It was then submitted to several movement
          publications, but only one asked permission to publish it; others did
          so without permission. The first official place of publication was
          in Vol. 2, No. 1 of <u>The Second Wave</u> (1972). This early version
          in movement publications was authored by Joreen. Different versions
          were published in the <u>Berkeley Journal of Sociology</u>, Vol. 17,
          1972-73, pp. 151-165, and <u>Ms.</u> magazine, July 1973, pp. 76-78,
          86-89, authored by Jo Freeman. This piece spread all over the world.
          Numerous people have edited, reprinted, cut, and translated &#34;Tyranny&#34; for
          magazines, books and web sites, usually without the permission or knowledge
          of the author. The version below is a blend of the three cited here. </SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>During 
        the years in which the women&#39;s liberation movement has been taking shape, 
        a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless 
        groups as the main -- if not sole -- organizational form of the movement. 
        The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the over-structured 
        society in which most of us found ourselves, and the inevitable control 
        this gave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left 
        and similar groups among those who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness.</SPAN></p>

          basic problems didn&#39;t appear until individual rap groups exhausted
          the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do
          something more specific. At this point they usually foundered because
          most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed
          their tasks. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of &#34;structurelessness&#34; without
          realizing the limitations of its uses. People would try to use the &#34;structureless&#34; group
          and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable
          out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything
          but oppressive.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FORMAL 
        AND INFORMAL STRUCTURES</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>Contrary 
        to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a structureless 
        group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for 
        any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in 
        some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it 
        may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the 
        members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, 
        personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that 
        we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds 
        makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any 
        basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness -- and that is 
        not the nature of a human group.</SPAN></p>

      <p> <SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>For
          everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and
          to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not
          implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to
          everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is
          not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy
          the informal structure. It usually doesn&#39;t. But it does hinder the
          informal structure from having predominant control and make available
          some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least
          responsible to the needs of the group at large. &#34;Structurelessness&#34; is
          organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured
          or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured
          one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer
          to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups
          which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner.
          Structured will refer to those which have. A Structured group always
          has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure.
          It is this informal structure, particularly in Unstructured groups,
          which forms the basis for elites.</SPAN></p>

        NATURE OF ELITISM</SPAN></p>

        is probably the most abused word in the women&#39;s liberation movement. It 
        is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as &#34;pinko&#34; 
        was used in the fifties. It is rarely used correctly. Within the movement 
        it commonly refers to individuals, though the personal characteristics 
        and activities of those to whom it is directed may differ widely: An individual, 
        as an individual can never be an elitist, because the only proper application 
        of the term &#34;elite&#34; is to groups. Any individual, regardless 
        of how well-known that person may be, can never be an elite.</SPAN></p>

          of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar
          major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there
          are not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the
          personal relationship necessary to have a voice in the decision-making.
          That is why formal structures of decision making are a boon to the
          overworked person. Having an established process for decision-making
          ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        THE &#34;STAR&#34; SYSTEM</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>The 
        idea of &#34;structurelessness&#34; has created the &#34;star&#34; 
        system. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions 
        and to select people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. 
        The press and the public do not know how to listen seriously to individual 
        women as women; they want to know how the group feels. Only three techniques 
        have ever been developed for establishing mass group opinion: the vote 
        or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire, and the selection 
        of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women&#39;s liberation 
        movement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither 
        the movement as a whole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it 
        have established a means of explaining their position on various issues. 
        But the public is conditioned to look for spokespeople.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">POLITICAL 
        IMPOTENCE</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>Unstructured 
        groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives; 
        they aren&#39;t very good for getting things done. It is when people get tired 
        of &#34;just talking&#34; and want to do something more that the groups 
        flounder, unless they change the nature of their operation. Occasionally, 
        the developed informal structure of the group coincides with an available 
        need that the group can fill in such a way as to give the appearance that 
        an Unstructured group &#34;works.&#34; That is, the group has fortuitously 
        developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging in 
        a particular project. </SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>1)<i> 
        It is task oriented</i>. Its function is very narrow and very specific, 
        like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task 
        that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to 
        be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people 
        can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>While 
        these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not 
        possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most 
        cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much 
        more effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal 
        structure is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people 
        to be able to operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion 
        and few results. Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are 
        not as innocuous as the results&#39; and their victim is the movement itself.</SPAN></p>

          end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and
          the lack of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The
          women the movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or
          seek other alternatives of action. There are few that are available.
          Some women just &#34;do their own thing.&#34; This can lead to a
          great deal of individual creativity, much of which is useful for the
          movement, but it is not a viable alternative for most women and certainly
          does not foster a spirit of cooperative group effort. Other women drift
          out of the movement entirely because they don&#39;t want to develop an
          individual project and they have found no way of discovering, joining,
          or starting group projects that interest them.</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PRINCIPLES 
        OF DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURING</SPAN></p>
      <p><SPAN size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10"/>Once 
        the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of &#34;structurelessness,&#34; 
        it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy 
        functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme 
        and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. But neither 
        should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional techniques 
        will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into 
        what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs 
        to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment 
        with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques 
        to use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which 
        has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, 
        but is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before 
        we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that 
        there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself -- only its excess 
        use.<br/>

                  engaging in this trial-and-error process, there are some principles

                  and are also politically effective:<br/>

                <u>Delegation</u> of specific authority to specific individuals 
                for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume 
                jobs or tasks only by default means they are not dependably done. 
                If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing 
                an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment 
                which cannot so easily be ignored.</SPAN></p>

                are developed by different movement groups will be controlled 
                by and responsible to the group. The group of people in positions 
                of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary. They 
                will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their 
                power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at 
                large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise 
                authority within it.</SPAN></p>
