 <li><p>Local regulators in 21 states filed requests with the agency to forgive pollution and, in 20 of those states, had them approved.</p></li>
 <li><p>In total, local regulators made note of almost<strong> </strong>700 exceptional events. The EPA agreed to adjust the data on 139 of them.</p></li>
 <li><p>The adjustments came in more than 70 counties across 20 states. The affected areas stretched from the forested Oregon coast to the Ohio rust belt, from the craggy Rhode Island coastline down to the bayous of Louisiana.</p></li>
 <li><p>In more than half of the states where exceptional events were forgiven, industry lobbyists and business interests pressed to make that happen, sometimes as the only public voice in the regulatory process. Also, to protect the status quo, some regulators spent millions of taxpayer dollars doing research for and making exceptional events requests, sometimes working hand in hand with industry stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul><p>Meeting air-quality standards matters a lot to industry and politicians. Violations can add up to stricter, more costly and potentially unpopular pollution controls.</p><p>Critics say the growing use of the exceptional events rule for wildfires is of deep concern. “You need to level with the public about the number of days when the air quality was unhealthy,” said Eric Schaeffer, a former regulator who directs the Environmental Integrity Project.</p><p>“We have saved more lives in this country because we cleaned up the air than almost any other environmental policy,” said Michael Wara, the director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment. “And that’s what’s being undermined.</p><p>“The world has changed,” he said. “We are living in a different world when it comes to wildfire and all of its consequences, including air pollution.”</p><figure id="075a7535-cff3-495c-ac70-1cd276ac08d8" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Two people walk across a bridge" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6023676891ae9d6b7ad817de42942d41e9994169/260_0_6580_4672/master/6580.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="315.9635258358663" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The 49 Bridge over the south Yuba River in Nevada county, California, is a popular area for hikers and advanced river activities.

Limaye, of the NRDC, called it a “toxic soup of air pollution”. It carries soot and ash, regulated as particulate pollution, as well as hydrocarbons and other gases that, cooked in sunlight, help form ground-level ozone. It’s a growing concern for public health, both near the source and thousands of miles away. Smoke, especially from a long-burning fire, can travel long distances and linger at dangerous levels for weeks at a time.</p><p>We analyzed data recorded at air monitors nationwide. For every US county, on a day where the EPA excluded any data, we counted that day.

Hunter, the local regulator, said her district was likely to seek more exceptional events there, including for fires in the last two years.</p><figure id="81c2200a-38d9-4e54-8901-c18e5933cb05" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Close view of firefighters putting out a fire" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4a4ea1bad9f521e21f1d737735db4433fac3af/0_0_4017_2678/master/4017.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="465" height="310" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Firefighters clear a break at the Victor fire on 25 July 2023 in Santa Clarita, California.</span> Photograph: Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>“If we take out wildfire smoke as one of the things that we look at, then we’re not going to be addressing problems that really affect our community here,” said Stevens, who directs the health clinic.<strong> </strong>The surge of asthma and other health problems from smoke can be overlooked when it happens in a rural community, she said: “I think it’s maybe a way that we don’t put enough attention into fixing something that can be fixed.”</p><p>Officials at the California air resources board (Carb) stress that state law works toward mitigating the effects of climate change, and state policies are supposed to minimize the risk of catastrophic fire.</p><p>“We really are trying to pull out all the stops,” Michael Benjamin, the chief of Carb’s air-quality planning and science division, said.

They left their Santa Rosa, California, home with their young children in the early hours of the morning; the fire that eventually swirled through went on to kill 22 people and destroy more than 5,600 structures.</p><p>Afterward, “I was starting to sense the emotional drain, from everyone having to go through this,” she said. She searched the internet with worry about how smoke could harm her children, then three and seven years old.</p><p>In 2021, they left for the suburbs of Chicago. They could afford to buy a house; the family would be closer to friends and relatives – and further, she hoped, from wildfire and smoke.</p><p>Growing up in India in the 1980s and 1990s, and working as a climate educator, Siruguri knows very well that there is no escape hatch leading away from environmental problems. “We are all inheriting this, in every part of the world,” she said.</p><p>Wara, of Stanford’s Woods Institute, argues that such an inheritance requires investment. Rather than trying to protect the status quo, he said, governments could make a new cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>“It would not be unreasonable” to boost spending significantly to manage public and private lands to minimize smoke, “something like what we think is reasonable when it comes to coal-fired power plants, which is billions of dollars per year”, he said. “Because the harms that are being created by the smoke are large.”</p><p>This summer, as air quality worsened across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/illinois" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Illinois</a> from Canadian fires, Siruguri worried anew in Naperville.
