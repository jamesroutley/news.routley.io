      Someone has asked me the origin of the word <i>daemon</i> as it applies to computing. Best I can tell based on my research, the word was first used by
      people on your team at Project MAC using the IBM 7094 in 1963. The first daemon (an abbreviation for Disk And Executive MONitor) was a program that
      automatically made tape backups of the file system.Â  Does this sound about right? Any corrections or additions?Â

      <i> daemon</i> is correct in that
      my group began using the term around that time frame.  However the acronym explanation is a new one on me.  Our use of the word
      <i> daemon</i>
      was inspired by the Maxwell&#39;s daemon of physics and thermodynamics.  (My background is Physics.)  Maxwell&#39;s daemon was an
      imaginary agent which helped sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in the background.  We fancifully began to use the
      word <i> daemon</i> to describe background processes which worked tirelessly to perform system chores.  I found a very good explanation
      of all this online at:</SPAN></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><SPAN color="#008000" face="Comic Sans MS">I am interested in the origin of the word <i>daemon</i>.  I work in
          information technology and I have always heard of system processes referred to as daemons.  I assumed that it is an older spelling of
          <i>demon</i>.  Can you shed some light on this point?</SPAN></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><SPAN color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Why certainly.  Someone give us some of those phosphorescent genes
        that have recently been spliced to mice DNA and we&#39;ll shed light like mad.
        <i>  Demon</i> and <i> daemon</i> were once used interchangeably.  The former
        came to English from medieval Latin, while the latter was from classical Latin.  The earliest use appears to have been in the phrase
        <i>daemon of Socrates</i>, which was his &#34;attendant, ministering, or indwelling spirit; genius&#34;.  That was in the late 14th century.  It
        was a short time later that the term <i> demon</i> came to refer to &#34;an evil
        spirit&#34; by influence of its usage in various versions of the Bible. The Greek form was used to translate Hebrew words for &#34;lords, idols&#34;
        and &#34;hairy ones (satyrs)&#34;.  Wyclif translated it from Greek to English <i>fiend</i> or
        <i>devil</i>.  This is how the evil connotation arose.  By the late 16th century, the general supernatural meaning was being distinguished
        with the spelling <i>daemon</i>, while the evil meaning remained with <i>demon</i>.
        Today <i> daemon</i> can mean &#34;a supernatural being of a nature intermediate
        between that of gods and men&#34; or &#34;a guiding spirit&#34;.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">[Warning: This paragraph is about science so, if this topic causes you
        undue alarm, please close your eyes until you&#39;ve finished reading it.] The 19th century scientist
        James Maxwell once daydreamed (the polite term is &#34;thought experiment&#34;) about a problem in physics.  He imagined a
        closed container which was divided in half.  In the middle of the divider was a tiny gate, just large enough to admit one molecule of
        gas.  This gate, in Maxwell&#39;s imagination, was operated by a tiny daemon.  This daemon observed the speed (i.e. temperature) of the
        molecules heading for the gate and, depending on the speed, let them through.  If he let only slow molecules pass from side A to side B and
        only fast molecules pass from side B to side A, then A would get hot while B cooled.  Maxwell&#39;s daemon was only imaginary, of course, but
        as it seemed to evade the laws of thermodynamics it caused quite a stir.  Eventually, though, the theory of quantum mechanics showed why
        it wouldn&#39;t work.  [OK, you may open your eyes, now.]</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN face="Comic Sans MS"><SPAN color="#000000">As you probably know, the &#34;system processes&#34; called
        <i> daemons</i> monitor other tasks and perform predetermined actions depending on their
        behavior.  This is so reminiscent of Maxwell&#39;s daemon watching his molecules that we can only assume that whoever dubbed these &#34;system
        processes&#34; had Maxwell&#39;s daemon in mind.  Unfortunately, we have found no hard evidence to support this.Â 
        </SPAN><SPAN color="#800000">[Now, of course, we have!]</SPAN></SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN face="Comic Sans MS"><SPAN color="#000000">We also assume that this is the meaning behind the
        daemon.co.uk, host to many United Kingdom web sites.<br/>

    </blockquote>
    <p><SPAN color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Jerome H. Saltzer, who also worked on
    Project MAC, confirms the Maxwell&#39;s demon explanation.Â  He is
    currently working on pinpointing the origin of the erroneous acronym
    etymology for <i>daemon</i> in this sense.Â  [We have edited Issue 129
    to reflect this confirmation of our original assumption.Â  Isn&#39;t it

  <p><SPAN face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">While <i>au jus</i> does mean literally &#34;with juice&#34;, it is short for
  <i>sauce au

  glance.Â  OK, so maybe I could be an anti-curmudgeon after all.  Is there some
  requirement out there that I be consistent?</SPAN></p>

 <i> Avec</i> is French for &#34;with&#34;; <i> au</i> is French for &#34;in&#34;.Â  But, silly me, I just learned that from a high
 school friend.</SPAN>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p><SPAN face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Fred, but in this case <i>au</i> is
 usually translated as &#34;with&#34;.Â  Look at <i>cafe au lait</i>.Â 
 You don&#39;t say &#34;coffee in milk&#34;, do you?Â  Tell your high school
 friend to study a bit harder, and don&#39;t believe everything you hear (the
 cardinal rule of critical thinking).</SPAN></p><p><SPAN face="Comic Sans MS">From
 Richard Hershberger:</SPAN>
 </p><blockquote>
  <p><SPAN color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">In the <i> Sez You</i> page of issue 145,  Ken Williams
  comments on the waitress who asked if he wanted his roast beef sandwich &#34;with au jus&#34;, to which you
  responded with &#34;Aaargh!&#34;  While the waitress clearly was not fluent in French, her English was impeccable.Â 
  English syntax requires a preposition in that construction.  &#34;Au jus&#34; lacks an English preposition,
  so she provided the one.  The fact that there is a French preposition in the phrase is irrelevant, since
  the construction as a whole has been adopted into English and reanalyzed to fit English syntax.  This is
  a normal process which has occurred innumerable times in the past.  It only seems incongruous because it is
  recent and because some of us have enough knowledge of French to recognize the original syntactical
  structure.</SPAN>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p><SPAN face="Comic Sans MS">Again, Barb and Malcolm ask, do you say
 &#34;apple pie with <i>a la mode</i>&#34;?Â  They don&#39;t agree that the
 presence of a French preposition is irrelevant.Â  To be consistent with
 constructions like &#34;apple pie <i>a la mode</i>&#34;, one should not add
 an English preposition.Â  The phrase <i>au jus</i> should be treated as an
 adjective if it isn&#39;t going to be parsed as a prepositional phrase.</SPAN>

  these labels often use one common word between a French and an English descriptive word. As a result I have heard people refer to  &#34;The Jeux
  Canada Games&#34;  (Jeux Canada being the French name for The Canada Games) Another more common one is &#34;old fort cheese&#34; which I admit to using. Old
  fort cheese has almost become legitimate now. It has been used on  the CBC national radio programme &#34;This Morning&#34; at least twice, and if the
  CBC sanctions it, it must be correct.Â  Thanks for many amusing discussions.</SPAN>

  </blockquote>
  <p><SPAN color="#354A2F" face="Comic Sans MS">This reminds me of an old joke (from

 </blockquote>
 <p><SPAN face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, all of these rabbit words are related.Â 
 The English and Welsh forms come from the Latin, and it is thought that Latin
 borrowed it from an ancient Iberian language.Â  Good joke, by the way!</SPAN></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p><SPAN size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">The most widely spoken language in Kenya, other than English, is Swahili. It&#39;s been a long, long time since I learned Swahili in the Peace Corps, but I still remember that the word for &#34;pepper&#34; is
        <i>pilipili</i>. It&#39;s easy to see how that could become <i>piripiri</i>. However, the term does not seem to have originated in Kenya&#39;s Indian community.</SPAN></p>
        <p><SPAN size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">The grammar of Swahili is
        Bantu. Most of its vocabulary is also Bantu, but it borrows many words from Arabic, Persian, Portuguese, German, and English, reflecting the region&#39;s trading and colonial history. According to the Oxford &#34;Standard Swahili-English Dictionary,&#34;
        <i> pilipili</i> is derived from a Persian word that I transliterate (with some difficulty, because I don&#39;t know the alphabet, and initial, medial, and final forms of letters are different) as
        <i> plpl</i> (vowels are not shown). Persian is closely related to Sanskrit, and the similarity to Sanskrit

        <p><i><SPAN size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F">Plpl</SPAN></i> <SPAN size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#354A2F"> immediately reminded me of Hebrew pilpul, a form of Talmudic disputation that involves close examination of minute distinctions. Sure enough,
        <i> pilpul</i> is the Aramaic word, and cognate to the Hebrew word, for &#34;pepper,&#34; from, I&#39;m guessing, either the finely divided nature of the ground spice or its fiery taste.Â </SPAN></p>
