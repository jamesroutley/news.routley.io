    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div width="50"><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><div><div><h2>What are the fun features of flat.social?</h2><p><img height="40" width="40" src="https://files.flat.social/assets/icons/chevron_down_white.svg"/></p></div><div><p>From flying around to playing football and doing a frog dance, there is plenty! We built those features to make<!-- --> <a href="https://flat.social">flat.social</a> the most fun place to organise an event online. Read more<!-- --> <a href="https://flat.social/online-meeting-features">features that we built.</a></p></div></div><div><div><h2>Is there a need to install anything?</h2><p><img height="40" width="40" src="https://files.flat.social/assets/icons/chevron_down_white.svg"/></p></div><div><p>No need to install anything new. It all runs in the web browser both on desktop and mobile. Safari and Chrome are doing great, Firefox is catching up!</p></div></div><div><div><h2>Do you support simultaneous screensharing?</h2><p><img height="40" width="40" src="https://files.flat.social/assets/icons/chevron_down_white.svg"/></p></div><div><p>Yep, a number of participants can screenshare at the same time. Those can be positioned next to each other or distributed in various locations around the virtual space.</p></div></div><div><div><h2>How much does it cost?</h2><p><img height="40" width="40" src="https://files.flat.social/assets/icons/chevron_down_white.svg"/></p></div><div><p>Check out the<a href="https://flat.social/pricing">pricing page</a> to see free and pro plans available.</p></div></div><div><div><h2>Can I use it to build my own metaverse?</h2><p><img height="40" width="40" src="https://files.flat.social/assets/icons/chevron_down_white.svg"/></p></div><div><div><p>...or a flatverse! Even though the definition of metaverse term is under debate, virtual spaces created in flat.social do check quite a couple boxes of what a metaverse can be.</p><p>Moving around, portals between spaces, teleporting, interactions with other participants of the virtual experience are at the core of what flat.social is.</p><p>Does a metaverse has to be 3D though? Let&#39;s leave the debate of dimensionality to philosophers and call a number of interconnected flats a flatverse :)</p></div></div></div><div><div><h2>Can I use it as an alternative to ZOOM or Microsoft Teams?</h2><p><img height="40" width="40" src="https://files.flat.social/assets/icons/chevron_down_white.svg"/></p></div><div><div><p>Sure, if all you do is fun and creative meetings! (we sincerly hope so:)</p><p>Over the past 3 years we learned that while ZOOM and Microsoft teams are amazing tools to keep you productive, they&#39;re not optimized to to keep a group of people connected, engaged and happy.</p><p>Hence, flat.social was created. It does not aim to be a complete replacement - it&#39;s an addition for when the priorities switch from productivity to human interaction. It&#39;s here to bring smile and show that spontanous creative moments and connections can happen without having to travel to an office or an event venue.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
