    <h1>Ask HN: What are some actual use cases of AI Agents right now?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>There are quite a few start ups/OSS working on making LLMs do things on your behalf and not just complete your words. These projects range from small atomic actions to  web scrapers to more general ambitious assistants.</p><p>That all makes sense to me and I think is the right direction to be headed. However, it&#39;s been a bit since the inception of some of these projects/cool demos but I haven&#39;t seen anyone who uses agents as a core/regular part of their workflow.</p><p>I&#39;m curious if you use these agents regularly or know someone that does. Or if you&#39;re working on one of these, I&#39;d love to know what are some of the hidden challenges to making a useful product with agents? What&#39;s the main bottle neck?</p><p>Any thoughts are welcome!</p></div></div></div>
