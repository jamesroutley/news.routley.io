    <p>After a long long time, I managed to attend a hackathon - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fossunited.org/fosshack/2023">FOSS Hack 3.0</a></p>
<h2 id="Confession"><a href="#Confession" title="Confession"></a>Confession</h2><p>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I have had a secret hackathon burnout all these years. The last time I attended a hackathon might have been in 2016 or 2017.</p>
<p>But this hackathon is different. I didn‚Äôt face any burnout or pressure.</p>
<p>Instead, I just kept working on what I wanted to work on.</p>
<p>One of the things that I did differently in this event compared to my previous hackathons is to work on a project that I would use in the real world.</p>
<p>In my previous hackathons, I used to work on some random app(s) or game(s) which was far out of my reach. This time: I had a well-scoped and practical idea.</p>
<p>Besides, this hackathon is very special to me - because it is for building Open-source software. How cool is it! (dreamed about something like this to happen in India around 2013-14-ish timeline)</p>
<h2 id="And-my-new-project-is"><a href="#And-my-new-project-is" title="And my new project is"></a>And my new project is</h2><p>I worked on a new project called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond">waymond</a> which I had been looking to get started on for a long time. I used the hackathon as an excuse to work on it üòÄ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>waymond is</p>
<ul>
<li>An open-source autoscaler.</li>
<li>Aiming to provide autoscaling for a wide variety of infrastructure.</li>
<li>Modular and extensible.</li>
<li>Built with Go.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The project‚Äôs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond#readme">README</a> contains a good deal of information about the project if you are interested. If you find it useful/interesting, consider giving a üåü on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond">GitHub</a> - helps with my dopamine levels üòÖ</p>
<p>I got the chance to learn some Go and explore some libraries while working on the project. I want to share all my learnings here in this blog. At the same time, I would love to keep working and maintaining the project moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="Progress"><a href="#Progress" title="Progress"></a>Progress</h2><p>I was able to make <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond/releases/tag/v0.1.0">v0.1.0 release</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helped me arrive at a design for the system</li>
<li>Helped me in prototyping a very basic use case</li>
<li>Helped me to write the ‚Äúcore‚Äù parts of the software. (of course, I might most probably need to refactor it once I have a better understanding)</li>
<li>Gave me the chance to write an elaborate README for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>I already prepared a thin milestone <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond/milestone/1">v0.2.0</a> for the project. The aim is to deploy it on real-world workloads (yeah, I do have them and will talk about it in detail once I am there)</p>
<h2 id="Demo"><a href="#Demo" title="Demo"></a>Demo</h2><p>I also recorded a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/DuKksePAJ_o">small demo</a> to show my progress so far (also needed to submit it at the end of the hackathon)</p>

<h2 id="Online-and-solo-this-time"><a href="#Online-and-solo-this-time" title="Online and solo this time"></a>Online and solo this time</h2><p>It was happening both in-person and online. I attended it online, as I couldn‚Äôt travel to Bangalore at the moment.</p>
<p>Also, I had to do some solo hacking this time. Because the project that I have been working on is in its very early stages and it would have been hard to collaborate with a team. (so, I didn‚Äôt want to disturb my friends with lot of unknowns at this point.)</p>
<p>But I wished the opposite in both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wished to attend it online.</li>
<li>I wished to work on it with a team.</li>
</ul>
<p>maybe next time!</p>
<p>But the good thing is I was able to make some decent progress on the project and it is already at an ok-ish level to accept Open Source contributions for it. So, if you are looking to contribute to an OSS project written in Go, then this is your chance!

<p>I am still very shy to show my code, but it‚Äôs a hackathon project - so I hope you wouldn‚Äôt mind my 222 lines long <code>main.go</code> file.</p>
