                    We learn topology, materials, and environment map lighting jointly from 2D supervision. We
                    directly optimize topology of a triangle mesh, learn materials through volumetric texturing, 
                    and leverage differentiable split sum environment lighting. 
                    Our output representation is a triangle mesh with spatially varying 2D textures and a high dynamic range environment map, 
                    which can be used unmodified in standard game engines. <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/">Spot model</a>

        <p>
            We present an efficient method for joint optimization of topology, materials and lighting 
            from multi-view image observations. Unlike recent multi-view reconstruction approaches, 
            which typically produce entangled 3D representations encoded in neural networks, we output 
            triangle meshes with spatially-varying materials and environment 
            lighting that can be deployed in any traditional graphics engine unmodified.
            We leverage recent work in differentiable rendering, 
            coordinate-based networks to compactly represent volumetric texturing, 
            alongside differentiable marching tetrahedrons to enable gradient-based optimization directly 
            on the surface mesh. Finally, we introduce a differentiable formulation of the split sum 
            approximation of environment lighting to efficiently recover all-frequency lighting. 
            Experiments show our extracted models used in advanced scene editing, material decomposition, 
            and high quality view interpolation, all running at interactive rates in triangle-based 
            renderers (rasterizers and path tracers).

                We reconstruct a triangular mesh with unknown topology, spatially-varying materials, and lighting from a set of multi-view
                images. We show examples of scene manipulation using off-the-shelf modeling tools, enabled by our reconstructed 3D model.

                Environment lighting approximated with Spherical Gaussians using 128 lobes vs. Split Sum. The training set consists of 256
                path traced images with Monte Carlo sampled environment lighting using a high resolution HDR probe. We assume known geometry and
                optimize materials and lighting using identical settings for both methods. Reported image metrics are the arithmetic mean of the 16 (novel)
                views in the test set. Note that the split sum approximation is able to capture high frequency lighting.
