			    <p>I launched my podcast, Ignore All Previous Instructions! It is available on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and your neighborhood RSS reader. I record an episode with a guest every other week, or sometimes a solo episode.</p>
<p>You can watch to the podcast on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@techcultpodcast">YouTube</a>, or listen on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2pbdE882Dbct2K7jfTEQmL?si=d24f9cd5ecee4f63](https://open.spotify.com/show/2pbdE882Dbct2K7jfTEQmL?si=d24f9cd5ecee4f63">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ignore-all-previous-instructions/id1768796826](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ignore-all-previous-instructions/id1768796826">Apple</a>, or your use your friendly neighborhood <a href="https://anchor.fm/s/fa549200/podcast/rss">RSS reader</a>.</p>
<p>I also made an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/techcult.podcast/">Instagram</a> and TikTok (also @techcult.podcast) to do some social media for it, but YMMV there.</p>
<p>Ignore All Previous Instructions is “a podcast about tech, culture, and society at large.” It’s very conversational. It often gets kinda philosophical. I am down with this pattern.</p>
<p>There were a few inspirations for the podcast …</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of comments while listening to other podcasts and thinking, “why not share my own ideas?”</li>
<li>That I had fun recording <a href="https://thewebivore.com/new-podcast-turing-incomplete/">Turing-Incomplete</a> in the past with Len, Jearvon, and Justin, and podcasting was fun</li>
<li>That I could do my own show</li>
<li>It could be fun</li>
</ul>
<p>I started seriously pondering this idea this summer and I’d like to thank my pal Sarah Withee for filming the pilot with me, and for Dawn Wages and Jasmine Greenway for also being on pre-launch episodes. It gave me the space to out different podcast software and generally Figured Some Stuff Out. I also want to thank my pal Mira for working with me to envision the logo of the podcast, which I then made myself.</p>
<p>If you’d like to support the show with money or see more behind the scenes, I did make <a href="https://www.patreon.com/techcultpodcast">a Patreon</a> for it because I think I should allow people to support the show if they’re so inclined. I also made stickers that I can bribe you with.</p>
