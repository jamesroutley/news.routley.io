   <p>
        Some time ago, I wrote <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Arduino/">a Beginner&#39;s Guide to Arduino</a> that seems to be very popular, so I decided to create a follow-up: <b>A Beginner&#39;s Guide to the ESP8266</b>. That&#39;s right, a tutorial on how to use the world&#39;s most popular $3 Wi-Fi board.
   </p>
   
   <p>
        This is going to be a very in-depth tutorial, covering some networking concepts as well. If you&#39;re a beginner, and just want to go straight to the more exciting Wi-Fi part, feel free to do so, I included short <i>TL;DR&#39;s </i>in the longer, more technical parts.
   </p>
   
   <p>
        A short overview of what I&#39;ll cover in this article: 
   </p>
   <div>
       <ol>
           <li><b>What is an ESP8266?</b> A short overview of what an ESP8266 is, and what you can do with it</li>
           <li><b>Deciding on what board to buy</b>: There&#39;s loads of different ESP8266 available these days, finding the one that&#39;s best for you can be hard</li>
           <li><b>Installing the software</b>: you need to install some software to program the ESP8266, and maybe a USB driver</li>
           <li><b>Setting up the hardware</b>: some modules and boards need some external components</li>
           <li><b>The ESP8266 as a microcontroller</b>: the ESP8266 can be used as a normal microcontroller, just like an Arduino</li>
           <li><b>Network protocols</b>: Before we start using the Wi-Fi capabilities of the ESP8266, I&#39;ll teach you some of the network protocols involved</li>
           <li><b>Setting up a Wi-Fi connection</b>: That&#39;s probably why you&#39;re reading this, right?</li>
           <li><b>Name resolution</b>: Find the ESP8266 on your local network using mDNS</li>
           <li><b>Setting up a simple web server</b>: This enables you to add web pages to the ESP8266, and browse them from your computer or phone</li>
           <li><b>Setting up an advanced web server</b>: a more advanced server with a real file system that allows you to upload new files over Wi-Fi</li>
           <li><b>OTA - uploading programs over Wi-Fi</b>: You don&#39;t have to upload programs over USB, you can use Wi-Fi instead</li>
           <li><b>Wirelessly controlling your RGB lighting</b>: Change the color of your LED strips using your phone or computer</li>
           <li><b>Getting the time</b>: Connect to a time server using NTP and sync the ESP&#39;s clock</li>
           <li><b>Monitoring sensors</b>: log the temperature in your living room, save it in flash memory and show it in a fancy graph in your browser</li>
           <li><b>Getting email notifications</b>: Turn on a notification light when you&#39;ve got unread emails</li>
           <li><b>Advanced features</b>: use DNS, captive portals, Wi-Fi connector libraries, OSC ...</li>
       </ol>

        This guide expects some basic knowledge of microcontrollers like the Arduino. If that&#39;s something you&#39;re not already familiar with, I&#39;d recommend you to read my <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Arduino/">Beginner&#39;s Guide to Arduino</a> first, it covers a lot of the basics that I won&#39;t go into in this article.
   </p>
   <p>
        I really want to focus on the ESP8266-specific things, like Wi-Fi and other network protocols, the ESP&#39;s hardware, software, IoT, etc ...
   </p>
   <h3>What is an ESP8266?</h3>
   <p>
        The ESP8266 is a System on a Chip (SoC), manufactured by the Chinese company <a href="https://espressif.com/en/">Espressif</a>. It consists of a Tensilica L106 32-bit <b>micro controller</b> unit (MCU) and a <b>Wi-Fi transceiver</b>. It has <b>11 GPIO pins</b>* (General Purpose Input/Output pins), and an <b>analog input</b> as well. This means that you can program it like any normal Arduino or other microcontroller. And on top of that, you get Wi-Fi communication, so you can use it to connect to your Wi-Fi network, connect to the Internet, host a web server with real web pages, let your smartphone connect to it, etc ... The possibilities are endless! It&#39;s no wonder that this chip has become the most popular IOT device available. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
        There are many different modules available, standalone modules like the <a href="http://en.ai-thinker.com/html/Products/WIFI_Module/ESP_01-14Series/">ESP-## series</a> by AI Thinker, or complete development boards like the <a href="http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html">NodeMCU DevKit</a> or the <a href="http://www.wemos.cc/">WeMos D1</a>. Different boards may have different pins broken out, have different Wi-Fi antennas, or a different amount of flash memory on board.
   </p>
   
   <p><small>(*) The ESP8266 chip itself has 17 GPIO pins, but 6 of these pins (6-11) are used for communication with the on-board flash memory chip.</small>
   </p>
   <h3>Programming</h3>
   <p>
        There are different ways to program the ESP8266, but I&#39;ll only cover the method using the Arduino IDE. This is really easy for beginners, and it&#39;s a very familiar environment if you&#39;ve used Arduino boards before. 
   </p>
   <p>
        Just keep in mind that it&#39;s not limited to this option: there&#39;s also an official SDK available to program it in real C, this is very useful if you want to optimize your code or do some advanced tricks that aren&#39;t supported by the Arduino IDE. Another possibility is to flash it with a <a href="https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware">LUA</a> interpreter, so you can upload and run LUA scripts. Or maybe you&#39;re more familiar with Python? Then you should check out the <a href="http://micropython.org/download#esp8266">MicroPython firmware</a> to interpret MicroPython scripts. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other languages available as well, so just do a quick Google search and write your code in the language of your choice.
   </p>
   <h3>Requirements</h3>
   <p>
        You&#39;ll need a couple of things in order to follow this guide:
   </p>
   <div>
       <ul>
           <li>An ESP8266 board</li>
           <li>A computer that can run the Arduino IDE (Windows, Mac or Linux)</li>
           <li>A USB-to-Serial converter, it is very important that you use a <b>3.3V</b> model*</li>
           <li>A USB cable</li>
           <li>A 3.3V power supply or voltage regulator*</li>
           <li>A Wi-Fi network to connect to</li>
       </ul>
       <p><small>(*) Your board may already include these. More information can be found in the next chapter.</small>
