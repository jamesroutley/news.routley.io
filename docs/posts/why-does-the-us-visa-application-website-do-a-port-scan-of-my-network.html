    <h1>Ask HN: Why does the US Visa application website do a port-scan of my network?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have recently installed this extension on FF: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/port-authority/" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/port-authorit...</a> and yesterday I visited this website: <a href="https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/" rel="nofollow">https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/</a> and I got a notification that the website tried to do a port-scan of my private network.</p><p>Is this a common thing? I have just recently installed the extension, so I am not sure if there are a lot of other websites who do it.</p><p>Since looking into it, I noticed that uBlock Origin already has the default list &#34;Block Outsider Intrusion into LAN&#34; but it wasn&#39;t enabled.</p></div></div></div>
