<p>This rhythm feels different than 11. More salty dog, down at tavern. I want to draw the differences. I want to draw the poem while listening to them. I do see and hear the differences between 11 and 12. 12 Swings more. I feel the impact of this on Joyce.  There is something about style overcoming history. That each canto mixes history in a different way, each canto collapses history, the difference in each is an aesthetic or stylistic feature. It is like AI style transfer.  unlike the last canto no lines start with AND.</p>
