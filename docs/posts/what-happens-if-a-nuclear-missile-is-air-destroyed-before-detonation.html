    <h1>Ask HN: What happens if a nuclear missile is air-destroyed before detonation?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So, Party A launches the nuclear missile at Party B, and Party B uses its now-apparently-at-least-occasionally-working missile defense systems to take out/destroy the missile/bomb before it can be detonated. What happens?</p><p>I am thinking about how the US detonated its Hiroshima nuke about 45 seconds after dropping it from the plane, and how it was detonated, as designed I believe, about 1/3 mile above Hiroshima.</p></div></div></div>
