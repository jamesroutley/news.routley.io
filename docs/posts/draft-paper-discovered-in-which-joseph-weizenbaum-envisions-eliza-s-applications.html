(Michael and I worked together on the </span><a href="https://www.sri.com/work/projects/aura" target="_blank"><span>AURA project at SRI</span></a><span> for about a year around 2013.)</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Michael writes:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;About 1985 I typed in a version of your BASIC Eliza from a public library copy of the &#39;Creative Computing Computer Games&#39; book, into my Amstrad CPC 464 home computer. The book had been translated into German, and so was Eliza! I wish the editors hadn&#39;t done so, as it makes much less sense!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Back then I owned a speech synthesizer (the Amstrad SSA-1 for the CPC), and I had extended your BASIC Eliza with speech capabilities. The audio/speech quality was as awful as some of the TRS 80 speech synths you can hear on YouTube.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Now, 32 years later or so I am working on a little spare time hobby project - a modern, understandable speech synthesizer for the Amstrad CPC, which is designed to be compatible with that original &#34;retro&#34; Amstrad SSA-1 speech synthesizer. And indeed, the old Eliza that got extended with SSA-1 speech output is working well with my modern speech synthesizer.&#34;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTxufTKfrYk" target="_blank"><span>Here&#39;s a youtube video of Michael&#39;s German-speaking Eliza</span></a><span>.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckCTHi5_2f8" target="_blank"><span>And here is another version for the CPC</span></a><span>, also with speech output.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Michael continues:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;With respect to the second video (the English one), the original author of this Eliza version also mentions your Eliza as the source for the program, but he says he extended it significantly, and then I added speech output, this time using the &#39;native mode&#39; of my speech synthesizer, which gives much better speech quality than the emulated &#39;retro SSA-1&#39; compatibility mode, as you can hear.&#34;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>As I mentioned above, Michael and I worked closely together at SRI for about a year. He concluded his note this way: &#34;It&#39;s really a funny and strange coincidence that our ways have crossed; What are the chances that you get to work with someone whose BASIC program you typed in from a public library book 30 years ago? Sometimes, the world is small!&#34;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>I couldn&#39;t agree more!</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="h.442afe913571ba0a_138"></section><section id="h.442afe913571ba0a_110"></section><section id="h.442afe913571ba0a_97"><div><div tabindex="-1"><div><div><div jscontroller="sGwD4d" jsaction="zXBUYb:zTPCnb;zQF9Uc:Qxe3nd;" jsname="F57UId"><div><div id="h.442afe913571ba0a_94"><div><div><h2 id="h.n5yqvbpw72bn_l" dir="ltr"></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>20170728</span><span>: Through the efforts of Dave Walden and Bernie Cosell, the tapes and listings of Bernie&#39;s original Lisp version of Eliza/Doctor have been accepted into the </span><a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/tag/archives/" target="_blank"><span>Computer History Museum archives</span></a><span> as lot number: X8258.2017.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>20170307</span><span>: Jeffrey Perrone pointed out </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk7QQfifov4" target="_blank"><span>this hysterical video of Eliza talking to Eliza on two side-by-side Google Home systems</span></a><span>!</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>20151122</span><span>: John D. writes (email to Jeff Shrager of 2015-11-22): &#34;Back in 1979, Radio Shack released their own commercial version of Eliza for their TRS-80 Model I, sold in their stores. It was written in machine language, not Basic, on cassette tape. In fact, the tape had two versions: a regular one, and a special version that gave Eliza&#39;s response through the expensive Voice Synthesizer they were selling (a Votrax derivative).&#34;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>&#34;The interesting thing about Radio Shack&#39;s version is that it seemed a bit more sophisticated than the original Weizenbaum version. It recognized more words. (Including swear words--just so it could react with &#39;There&#39;s no need for that language.&#39;-- which is weird to see inside a mass-market product sold by a major corporation!)
