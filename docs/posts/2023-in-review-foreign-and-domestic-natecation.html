<p>For the first time in five years — since 2018, when I graduated high school and entered college <a href="https://www.youtube.com/michigan-application/">at Michigan</a> — I was a full-time student for the entire calendar year. So for me, 2023 was mainly defined by a renewed focus on school (although not entirely in Los Angeles).</p>
<p>I spent most of the first half of the year, from January to mid-June, on campus at UCLA rounding out the core of my math major, finishing the undergraduate analysis and abstract algebra sequences: hard work, but rewarding. The second half of the year, from mid-June onwards, was a bit of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/commencement-2022-in-review/">return to old ways</a>: I started the summer in San Francisco working for a blockchain company, then spent three weeks backpacking in Alaska. Nonetheless, I was back in school in early August (albeit in Argentina) where I began a four-month <a href="https://uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/programs/human-rights-and-cultural-memory">UC study abroad program</a>. I had an amazing time abroad, sojourning all over South America — my first time outside of the United States in at least six years — before finally returning stateside in late December, flying back to Philadelphia to spend the holidays with family.</p>

<p>In spring quarter, I also started doing homework together more regularly with a group of people from my math classes, and we kicked off an informal tradition of meeting on weekends to work for a few hours, then doing a nearby hike. We hit a bunch of spots — the Hollywood Sign, the Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains, Runyon Canyon, etc. — and it was a fun way to unwind after spending some time working through our problem sets.</p>

<p>That feeling of immense relief after having completed all of my exams at the end of spring quarter — I hadn’t felt that in a while. For the first time since my last winter semester at Michigan in 2019, I felt a deep appreciation for the freedom of the summer in a way that I hadn’t really been able to during my time out of school.</p>

<p>Santiago was a nice change of pace from Buenos Aires. It was exciting to be closer to mountains and local hiking trails, and my homestay was in a quieter residential area, away from the city center. Overall, Santiago was more geographically interesting than Buenos Aires, with various hills interspersed between city blocks and spectacular 360-degree views of the entire cityscape at their summits.</p>

<p>In the last week of the program, at the end of November, my family came down to visit me in Santiago; we traveled back to Buenos Aires together once classes ended. The wide, tree-lined <em>porteño</em> boulevards were magnificent in the late spring sun; blooming jacarandas blanketed the sidewalks with delicate purple confetti. While Buenos Aires had always been beautiful, now, it was stunning.</p>


<p>The next morning, we took a bus over the border to Puerto Natales, Chile and then connected with a second bus to Torres del Paine National Park, where we began the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/chile/magallanes/torres-del-paine-circuito-w">W Trek</a>.</p>
<p>The W Trek was spectacular. We got super lucky with the weather and had two days of clear blue skies; the pristine snow on the mountains looked like a layer of vanilla icing, gorgeously complementing the brilliant turquoise waters of the lake.</p>

<p>Before 2023, I’d only ever spent one full academic year in college: 2018–19 at the University of Michigan. After spending two years out of school traveling and working in tech, I made the decision to go back. I wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking for, but I just had a feeling that there was something worthwhile in it — in the “college experience” — that I should find before I got too old for it. In 2023, I think I got a little closer to figuring out what it was.</p>





<hr/>
<p>This whole discussion reminds me of an idea of Sam Altman’s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do new things often. This seems to be really important. Not only does doing new things seem to slow down the perception of time, increase happiness, and keep life interesting, but it seems to prevent people from calcifying in the ways that they think. Aim to do something big, new, and risky every year in your personal and professional life.</p>
<p><cite><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short">“The days are long but the decades are short”</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To a certain extent, this idea could describe the past five years of my life. In 2019, the “big, new, and risky” thing was leaving college and moving to San Francisco to join a startup as employee #1. In 2020, it was living in Montana for six weeks and leaving that first startup job. In 2021, it was interning in New York City and deciding to go back to school at UCLA. In 2022, it was working full-time in crypto and hiking 1,700 miles through the California wilderness. In 2023, it was doubling down on learning math and studying abroad in South America for four months.</p>
<p>We’ll see what 2024 brings. In terms of post-graduation plans, I’m now thinking much more intentionally about entrepreneurship: ideation, talking with potential cofounders, etc. is all on a secondary thread as I finish up the last few requirements for my degree. I’m also hoping to have more conversations with older and more experienced folks about diving into entrepreneurship vs. working a little bit first. Lots of stuff is up in the air, and I truly have no idea what I’ll be up to in the second half of the year. All I can say is it will be something big, new, and risky.</p>
