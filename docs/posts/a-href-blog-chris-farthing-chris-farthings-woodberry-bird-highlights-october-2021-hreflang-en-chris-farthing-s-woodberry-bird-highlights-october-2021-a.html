    <div><p>October is a month when the majority of the action takes place in the air. It is peak time for passerine migration, so many birds, in particular thrushes and finches, pass over as they leave their breeding grounds and head to their favoured overwintering sites. It is also a time for duck movement, as waterfowl moulting season has finished and birds will often have different priorities when choosing a site for safe moulting compared with choosing an overwintering site. </p></div>

  <div>
          <div><p>The most unusual duck seen in October was a <strong>hybrid (above, and flight picture below)</strong> and the identity of its parents are still not known for sure. The duck was seen on the 26<sup>th</sup> and mostly stayed on its own although it did appear to approach a few pochard occasionally, which showed very little interest. Expert opinion suggests the bird is a hybrid of mallard and one of the pochard species, possibly red-crested pochard.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>October saw significant changes in the numbers of our more regular ducks. <strong>Gadwall</strong> increases markedly, starting the month at around 20, but increasing to over 80 by the end of the month. <strong>Shoveler</strong> went the other way, starting the month at more than 50 but being down to a handful by the end. The small flock of <strong>red-crested pochard</strong> which had been here through september stayed until around mid-october, whilst<strong> teal</strong> numbers remained at low single figures all month. The reservoir has supported a single breeding pair of <strong>mute swan</strong> for many years (not always the same pair), who vigorously defend the site when any interlopers turn up. This month though, a group of interlopers have proved too numerous to eject, and this has led to an accumulation of around twenty swans of various ages. The situation is relatively harmonious at present but is unlikely to stay that way as we get closer to the breeding season.</p></div>

  <div>
          <div><p>We had a few visits from an adult <strong>yellow-legged gull</strong> (above flanked by <strong>lesser black-backed gulls</strong>) around the middle of October. Large raptors were fairly well represented with sightings of both <strong>red kite</strong> and <strong>common buzzard</strong>.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The first <strong>water rail</strong> of winter was heard in the reed-bed on the 7<sup>th</sup>, and <strong>snipe</strong> were present all month although not seen very often. <strong>Redwings (above)</strong> started to pass over on the 12<sup>th</sup>, although flocks were relatively small, up to about 20. Birds were sometimes seen in trees along the woodland trail. The first <strong>fieldfare</strong> of winter flew out of an oak on the north side of the site on the 23<sup>rd</sup>. Other migrating birds noted were flocks of up to 25 <strong>jackdaw</strong>, up to 7 <strong>meadow</strong> <strong>pipit</strong>, and plenty of the common finches. Three <strong>house</strong> <strong>martin</strong> seen on the 5<sup>th</sup> were a late record.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in October 2021 was 63, about 3 or 4 less than the historical October average.</p>
