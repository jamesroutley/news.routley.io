  <section><p>Sharing a short note about something which surprised me today.</p>
<p>I’ve just started working on a self-healing Bittorrent tracker, which uses
tracker-level tools (peer allocation algorithms and error messages) to handle
unhealthy Bittorrent swarms. Ordinarily, such unhealthy swarms (low seeder to
leecher ratio, broken clients, etc.) are either ignored or are handled
outside the protocol using a separate frontend. I want to explore to what
extent they can be handled by the tracker itself, within the constraints of the
Bittorrent protocol. For more information, check out the README on my Github,
although none of this is actually implemented yet:
<a href="https://github.com/dmoerner/etracker">https://github.com/dmoerner/etracker</a>.</p>
<p>Bittorrent trackers use the Bittorrent
<a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html#bencoding">bencoding</a> format to
send messages to peers. Bittorrent trackers also need to be highly scalable.
I noticed that existing bencoding implementations, like
<a href="https://github.com/jackpal/bencode-go">https://github.com/jackpal/bencode-go</a>, use reflection to implement <code>Marshal</code>
and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions, similar to the well-known examples for JSON and XML.</p>
<p>However, I recalled reading that reflection involves significant performance
penalties. <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/"><em>Learning
Go</em></a> by
Jon Bodner says that a simple filter function implemented using reflection is
50–75 times slower than the same function implemented with generics (p. 425).</p>
<p>With performance at a premium, and a tracker needing to implement only a proper
subset of bencoding (since it receives messages from peers with GET requests),
I decided to hand-implement that subset of bencoding using <code>bytes.Buffer</code>, and
use benchmarks to compare it to the <code>bencode-go</code> library which uses reflection.
The results:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="&gt;">goos: linux
goarch: amd64
pkg: etracker
cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz
BenchmarkNonReflect-2       	   16438	     68255 ns/op
BenchmarkReflectLibrary-2   	   17455	     68031 ns/op
PASS
ok  	etracker	3.766s
</code></pre><p>There’s no difference at all! This was surprising. Unless I’m missing
something, <code>bencode.Marshal</code> does use reflection. I suspect that the subset of
bencoding I’m implementing is so simple that we don’t run into any overhead
from reflection. But still, I would have expected to at least see something.</p>
