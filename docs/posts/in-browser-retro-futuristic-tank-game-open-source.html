    <h2>Retro Shooter Cyberpunk Tank Game: Battlezone + Blade Runner 2049 + Synthwave</h2>

    <p>
        The goal of Synth Blast is to complete as many levels as possible as quickly as possible. Levels are policed
        by malevolent tanks that home in on your position.
    </p>

    <p>
        SYNTH BLAST is inspired by the first-person, futuristic tank shooter games of the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s as well as
        classic synthesizer music. The neon colors, the Miami nights, the music, the
        trees lining the road, the infinite road trip into the sunset that extends all through the night...
        What&#39;s not to love about the 80&#39;s?
