    <h1>HP avoids monetary damages over bricked printers in class-action settlement</h1>

<p>HP also now provides disclaimers on the product pages for most of the printers that it sells, stating that the device “is intended to work only with cartridges that have a new or reused HP chip” and uses Dynamic Security “to block cartridges using a non-HP chip.”</p>
<p>“Periodic firmware updates will maintain the effectiveness of these measures and block cartridges that previously worked. A reused HP chip enables the use of reused, remanufactured, and refilled cartridges,” the disclaimer says, adding a link to <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_7470520-7449625-16">a support page</a> about Dynamic Security. The support page notes that “most HP printers can be configured to receive updates either automatically or with a notification that allows you to choose whether to update or not.&#34; However, some HP programs, like Instant Ink, require users to enable automatic firmware updates on HP printers.</p>
<p>All this means that, despite the recently approved settlement, Dynamic Security remains a critical part of most HP printers, and HP will continue to feel entitled to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/customers-fume-as-hp-blocks-third-party-ink-from-more-of-its-printers/">use firmware updates</a> to suddenly block printers made after December 1, 2016, from using non-HP ink and toner. Owners of HP printers made after that date that allow automatic updates and still work with third-party accessories shouldn’t be surprised if that ability is suddenly bricked one day.</p>
<h2>Dynamic litigation</h2>
<p>While HP isn&#39;t paying a sum to class-action members this time, it has previously agreed to pay millions in relation to bricking printers: In 2022, it agreed to pay <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/hp-to-pay-eu-printer-customers-1-35-million-for-disabling-third-party-ink/">$1.35 million to European customers</a>, and in 2020, the Italian Antitrust Authority fined HP for 10 million euros. In 2019, HP said it would pay <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/hp-ink-cartridge-monopoly-class-action-lawsuit-settles-1-5m/">$1.5 million</a> to settle a similar class-action case in California, and it paid approximately <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/03/hp_inc_to_compensate_buyers_for_blocking_third_party_ink_cartridges/">AUD$50 </a>each to Australian customers impacted by Dynamic Security in 2018.</p>
<p>There’s also an open case against HP regarding its ink practices, a class-action complaint filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in January 2024. The lawsuit centers on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-sued-again-for-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-accused-of-monopoly/">Dynamic Security firmware updates</a> pushed “in late 2022 and early 2023&#34; and accuses HP of creating a “monopoly in the aftermarket for replacement cartridges” [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HP_Janunary_5_2023.pdf">PDF</a>]. The plaintiffs seek an order declaring that HP broke the law, an injunction against Dynamic Security, and monetary and punitive damages.</p>
<p>Another lawsuit, filed in mid-2022 about some HP all-in-one <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">printers failing to scan or fax without ink</a>, was dismissed.</p>
<p>HP’s printer arm has other pressing matters to address, though. Earlier this month, a firmware update <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/firmware-update-bricks-hp-printers-makes-them-unable-to-use-hp-cartridges/">broke specific HP printer models</a>, preventing them from printing, even when using HP-brand ink. HP told Ars last week that it’s “actively working on a solution.”</p>
