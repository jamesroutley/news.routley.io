    <h1>Android phones will soon reboot themselves after sitting unused for three days</h1>

          <p>A silent update rolling out to virtually all Android devices will make your phone more secure, and all you have to do is not touch it for a few days. The new feature implements auto-restart of a locked device, which will make your personal data harder to extract. It&#39;s coming as part of a Google Play Services update, though, so there&#39;s nothing you can do to speed along the process.</p>
<p>Google is preparing to release a <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">new update to Play Services</a> (v25.14), which brings a raft of tweaks and improvements. First <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/android-auto-restart-security/">spotted</a> by 9to5Google, the update was officially released on April 14, but as with all Play Services updates, it could take a week or more to reach all devices. When 25.14 arrives, Android devices will see a few minor improvements, including prettier settings screens, improved connection with cars and watches, and content previews when using Quick Share.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Play Services 25.14 adds a feature that Google describes thusly: &#34;With this feature, your device automatically restarts if locked for 3 consecutive days.&#34;</p>
<p>This is similar to a feature known as Inactivity Reboot that Apple added to the iPhone in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/apple-releases-ios-18-1-macos-15-1-with-apple-intelligence/">iOS 18.1</a>. This actually caused some annoyance among law enforcement officials who believed they had suspects&#39; phones stored in a readable state, only to find they were rebooting and becoming harder to access due to this feature.</p>
