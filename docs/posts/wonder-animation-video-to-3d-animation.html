<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s been five months since we </span><a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/pressrelease/autodesk-acquires-wonder-dynamics-offering-cloud-based-ai-technology-to-empower-more-artists-to-create-more-3d-content-across-media-and-entertainment-industries/"><span data-contrast="none">joined Autodesk</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, and the time spent has only reinforced that the foundational Wonder Dynamics vision aligns perfectly with Autodesk’s longstanding commitment to advancing the Media &amp; Entertainment industry through innovation. Together, we believe in using artificial intelligence (AI) more intentionally to enhance creativity and efficiency, so artists can spend more time on the creative aspects of storytelling. We formed Wonder Dynamics and developed Wonder Studio (our cloud-based 3D animation and VFX solution) out of our passion for storytelling coupled with our commitment to make VFX work accessible to more creators and filmmakers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Today, Wonder Dynamics is excited to announce the beta launch of Wonder Studio’s newest feature: </span><strong>Wonder Animation</strong><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="none">which is powered by groundbreaking Video </span><span data-contrast="none">to </span><span data-contrast="none">3D </span><span data-contrast="none">s</span><span data-contrast="none">cene technology that enables artists to shoot a scene with any camera, in any location, and turn the sequence into an animated scene with CG characters in a 3D environment. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The most innovative part of Wonder Animation’s </span><span data-contrast="none">Video to 3D scene technology</span> <span data-contrast="none">is its ability to </span><span data-contrast="auto">film and edit sequences with multiple cuts and various shots (wide, medium, close-ups)</span><span data-contrast="auto">. T</span><span data-contrast="none">he technology then uses AI to reconstruct the scene in a 3D space and matches the position and movement of each camera’s relationship to the characters and environment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559738&#34;:240,&#34;335559739&#34;:240,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This essentially creates a virtual representation of an artist’s live-action scene containing all camera setups and character body and face animation in one 3D scene, with fully editable elements (animation, character, environment, lighting, and camera tracking data) in their preferred software, such as Maya, Blender or Unreal.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:240,&#34;335559739&#34;:240,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Even though there have been tremendous advancements in AI, there is a current misconception that AI is a one click solution–but we know that’s not the case. </span><span data-contrast="none">Wonder Animation</span><span data-contrast="none"> underscores our focus on bringing the artist one step closer to producing fully animated films while ensuring they retain full creative control. Unlike the black-box approach of most generative AI tools currently on the market, we’re empowering artists to shape their vision instead of just relying on automated outputs. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
