<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>I&#39;m not big-brained enough to use cameras on Linux, so I decided to write my own camera stack (based on a real story).</p>

<p>The libobscura experiment exists to find out what a point-and-shoot API abstracting Video4Linux should look like. It has its roots on one hand in the Librem 5 project, where I wrote some 70% of the camera stack, and on the other hand in libcamera, which I found too difficult to use.</p>

<p>You think controlling a modern camera is easy? Think again. Between pixel formats, depths, media entities, pads and links, sensitivity, denoising, phase detection, shutter lengths, DMAbuf, OpenGL, feedback loops, requests, and statistics, there&#39;s enough opportunities to get lost in the detail.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Prototype Fund thinks I&#39;m up for the challenge, so they are funding me through libobscura in order to get lost, and maybe find something in the process.</p>
