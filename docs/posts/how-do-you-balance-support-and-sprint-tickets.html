    <h1>Ask HN: How do you balance support and sprint tickets?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Our DevOps/SRE team has been trying to do Scrum for over a year but the sprints are always derailed by support work.</p><p>They&#39;ve tried to add support tickets to the sprint as they come in, but that changes the sprint scope and renders the &#34;velocity&#34; metrics useless.</p><p>They&#39;ve tried to exclude support tickets from the sprint and keep the scope very small. Some weeks it works, other weeks they overdeliver by a lot (because there were fewer support tickets and they got a lot of tickets from the backlog).</p><p>I&#39;m thinking Scrum is useless for that team but management insists all engineering teams must use scrum.</p><p>Do you have any advice for managing tasks in a team that has support/adhoc and project tickets?</p></div></div></div>
