    <h1>Richard Garwin’s role in designing the hydrogen bomb was obscured</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Enrico Fermi’s battle with cancer was nearing its end in late 1954 when he received a visitor.</p><p>Fermi, a Nobel laureate in physics, had fled fascism in Europe and become <a href="https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/enrico-fermi/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a founder of the nuclear age</a>, helping bring the world’s first reactor and first atom bomb to life.</p><p>The visitor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/science/richard-l-garwin-dead.html" title="">Richard L. Garwin</a>, had been Fermi’s student at the University of Chicago, the laureate <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.212.4496.763" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling him</a> “the only true genius I have ever met.” Now, he had done something known at the time only by Fermi and a handful of other experts. Not even his family knew. Three years earlier, the boy wonder, then 23, had designed the world’s first hydrogen bomb, which brought the fury of the stars to Earth.</p><p>In a test, it had exploded with a force nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/30/books/the-race-to-armageddon.html" title="">1,000 times as powerful</a> as the atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima, its power greater than all the explosives used in World War II.</p><p>To his reverential student, Fermi <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Faj2DAAAQBAJ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confided a regret</a>. He felt his life had involved too little participation in crucial issues of public policy. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1954/11/29/archives/enrico-fermi-dead-at-53-architect-of-atomic-bomb-noted-nuclear.html" title="">died</a> a few weeks later at 53.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>After that visit, Dr. Garwin set out on a new path, <a href="https://rlg.fas.org/Physicists%20and%20Effective%20Public%20Policy.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seeing nuclear scientists</a> as having a responsibility to speak out. His resolve, he later <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-richard-l-2020-april-14" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a historian</a>, came from a desire to honor the memory of the scientist he had known best and admired most.</p><p>“I modeled myself to whatever extent I could after Fermi,” he said.</p><p>Dr. Garwin, the designer of the world’s deadliest weapon, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/science/richard-l-garwin-dead.html" title="">died last Tuesday</a> at age 97, leaving behind a legacy of nuclear horrors he devoted his life to countering. But he also left a strange puzzle.</p><p>Why for a half-century did he hide what Fermi and a dozen presidents knew? It was a topic I discussed with him this January in an interview, the last of many.</p><p>The riddle is especially odd because his central role in creating the H-bomb became the motivating force that drove him forward, that helped him turn Fermi’s regrets into a life of political and social activism, that made him an inconspicuous giant of nuclear arms control.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><p>“If I could wave a wand” to make the H-bomb vanish, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/24/science/who-built-the-h-bomb-debate-revives.html" title="">once told me</a>, “I would.”</p></div><div data-testid="DiptychBlock-5"><div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Dr. Garwin in 1954.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Francis Bello/Science Source</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Enrico Fermi, Dr. Garwin’s mentor, in 1954.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Keystone/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>In a blinding flash, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay killed <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/08/counting-the-dead-at-hiroshima-and-nagasaki/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at least 70,000 people</a>. Deadly like no earlier weapon, it was still quite limited in contrast with Dr. Garwin’s superweapon. One <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2021/11/the-untold-story-of-the-worlds-biggest-nuclear-bomb/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed version</a> had the force of more than 600,000 Hiroshimas. The mind boggles at such numbers. Even so, Cold War analysts <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0404590.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coolly judged</a> that it could reduce a region the size of France to ashes. His weapon was a planet shaker. It could end civilization.</p><p>That bomb wasn’t the only feat driven by Dr. Garwin’s prodigious intellect. He made basic discoveries about the structure of the universe, laid the groundwork for wonders of health care and computers, and won many awards. He pushed back frontiers in astronomy, physics, superconductors, orbital reconnaissance and a multitude of other topics he investigated, often at the U.S. government’s behest.</p><p>But what drove him, what made him eager to advise presidents, was not his gift for coming up with marvels of discovery and innovation but, courtesy of Fermi, a personal crusade to save the world from his own creation.</p><p>Henry A. Kissinger <a href="https://statemag.state.gov/2024/03/0324feat02/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advised at least 12 American presidents</a> in some capacity. Dr. Garwin never officially joined any president’s cabinet, as Kissinger had. But in our last interview, the physicist looked over a list of presidents and one by one identified the commanders-in-chief he had counseled. There were 13.</p><p>While eager to counter his brainchild, Dr. Garwin took no personal or moral responsibility for bringing the H-bomb into existence. Its birth, he argued, was inevitable.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div><p>“Maybe I sped up its development by a year or two,” he said in 2021. “That’s all.” Historians of the age <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article-abstract/70/4/40/850821/The-secret-of-the-Soviet-hydrogen-bombWas-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tend to agree</a>. The Soviet Union quickly followed his pioneering lead, then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/18/world/nuclear-anxiety-the-overview-india-detonated-a-hydrogen-bomb-experts-confirm.html" title="">a half-dozen other nations</a>. Today, hydrogen bombs have replaced atom bombs in most arsenals, creating a world of uneasy standoffs among nuclear foes.</p><p>By all accounts, Dr. Garwin believed that he — and sometimes he alone — could peer into the chaos of the universe and discern its underlying order. Like <a href="https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/j-robert-oppenheimer/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, who during World War II led the making of the first atomic bomb, he could also be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4069#:~:text=%E2%80%9D%20Less%20flatteringly%2C%20Freeman%20Dyson%2C%20a%20fellow%20JASON%20member%20and&amp;text=Something%20wrong%20is%20wrong%20and%20he%20would,grind%20you%20to%20the%20ground%20for%20it" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cruel and intolerant</a> of those he saw as less gifted.</p><p>Even so, Dr. Garwin showed a knack for teamwork and generosity with peers he respected. Over decades, the physicist <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/rainer-weiss-ligo-origins-0211" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worked hard</a> to advance the hunt for gravitational waves — ripples in the fabric of space-time that Einstein predicted. He supported the construction of costly detectors, which, in 2015, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html" title="">successfully observed</a> the ripples, opening a new window on the universe. Dr. Garwin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/science/science-nobel-astronomy.html" title="">beamed with pride</a> when the finding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/science/nobel-prize-physics.html" title="">won a Nobel Prize</a>.</p><p>So too, Dr. Garwin managed to walk a tricky path through the nation’s military-industrial complex, which <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vZFR6TGNBLcC&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=kai+bird+american+prometheus&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crushed Oppenheimer</a> and coddled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/us/edward-teller-a-fierce-architect-of-the-hydrogen-bomb-is-dead-at-95.html" title="">Edward Teller</a>, an early proponent of hydrogen bomb research.

The physicist told newcomers to the federal apparatus that they could get something done or get credit, but not both. He was, in some respects, the antithesis of Kissinger, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/us/politics/henry-kissinger-image-obituary.html" title="">carefully tended</a> his public image.</p><p>The left loved Dr. Garwin’s attacks on the American military establishment, but his own compass seemed to align less with politics than pragmatism.

The two-term president described the physicist as advising White House occupants “rather bluntly.”</p><p>Overall, Dr. Garwin’s life can be seen as a tale of genius in which key manifestations were obscured by a wall of silence. Why, for instance, did he <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-lois-july-1-2004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wait so long to tell his family</a> about his H-bomb role?

His father <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-richard-l-2004-session-i-june-26-2004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taught electronics</a> at a technical high school.</p><p>As a child, Richard, called Dick, <a href="https://repository.aip.org/goldfarb-marguerite-october-2004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">impressed adults</a> with his language and math abilities. He loved to take apart and reassemble things, including a vacuum cleaner.</p><p>Despite his obvious talents and his early entry into high school, an English teacher there told his parents that Dick would <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-lois-july-1-2004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never get into college</a>. He defied that prediction, studying physics <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-richard-l-2020-april-14" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at the Case School of Applied Science</a>, in Cleveland.

Two years later, in 1949, Dr. Garwin graduated from Chicago with a doctorate in physics and became an instructor at the school.</p><p>The 21-year-old had been too young to play a role in the Manhattan Project, but now found himself deeply involved in what followed.</p><p>Like many Americans, Dr. Garwin <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.212.4496.763" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew concerned</a> when Moscow that summer detonated its first atom bomb. How would Washington respond? In early 1950, President Harry S. Truman <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-president-the-hydrogen-bomb" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that the nation would seek to make “the so-called hydrogen or superbomb.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Fermi invited Dr. Garwin to join him at Los Alamos, the base set amid the tall pines and deep canyons of New Mexico’s backcountry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/17/us/politics/atomic-bomb-secret-funding-congress.html" title="">where Oppenheimer’s bomb</a> was born. Now on the agenda for the sprawling lab: trying to make good on Truman’s threat.</p><p>Deep inside every star, extraordinarily high heats and pressures fuse hydrogen atoms into helium, releasing bursts of energy. The Los Alamos idea was to mimic that fusion process. The experts called it thermonuclear — in part to distinguish its high-temperature reactions from those of atomic bombs, which start at room temperature.</p><p>The general plan was that an exploding atom bomb would act as a match to ignite the hydrogen fuel. The question was how. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5Yc60EVbNoQC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Early ideas</a> had atomic and hydrogen fuels layered in alternating bands, similar to the insides of a baseball.</p><p>The breakthrough came in early 1951. Teller and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/15/obituaries/stanislaw-ulam-theorist-on-hydrogen-bomb.html" title="Times obituary, May 15, 1984.">Stanislaw Ulam</a>, a Los Alamos colleague, envisioned two distinct stages set next to each other inside a cylindrical casing.</p><p>Moving at the speed of light, radiation from the exploding atom bomb would hit the casing’s inner wall and, in a rebound, flood the interior with a colossal burst of rays that would compress and ignite the hydrogen fuel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>The new idea gave the bomb unlimited power. Because the hydrogen fuel was separate from the initial mayhem of atomic debris and shock waves, it could, in theory, be infinitely large.</p><p>Teller asked Dr. Garwin to draw up a detailed plan. He <a href="https://archive.org/details/memoirstwentieth0000tell/page/372/mode/2up?q=%22every+conceivable+doubt%22" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a> that it would have to address “every conceivable doubt” of top scientists. “Garwin’s paper was criticized up and down,” Teller wrote in his memoirs, but the young man’s plan “remained unchanged.”</p><p>The prodigy turned the rough idea into <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-richard-l-2020-april-14" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a four-page plan</a> that’s still classified top secret. He attached a large schematic diagram.</p><p>On a coral atoll in the Western Pacific, the device <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5Yc60EVbNoQC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew slowly</a>. Dr. Garwin never visited the test site where his finished creation stood <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5Yc60EVbNoQC" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two stories high</a> and weighed 82 tons.</p><p>The test blast, code-named Ivy Mike, took place on Nov. 1, 1952. It vaporized a Pacific isle and produced a mushroom cloud 100 miles wide.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>Dr. Garwin, then 24, kept his head down. No news accounts cited his name. No one condemned or praised him.

Nixon wanted Moscow and Washington to sign a historic pact to limit their nuclear arms.</p><p>Formal talks <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/salt" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">began in 1969</a>, the year he took office. In parallel, the president and his advisers sought ways to better assess the size of the Soviet arsenal and thus verify compliance with any accord. The overall aim was to make the balance of nuclear terror — the threat of mutually assured destruction — more stable, and a stronger deterrent to war.</p><p>A new generation of spy satellites would be a central tool. High above the Earth, they would open a new lens on the secretive movements of Soviet bombers, submarines and missiles capable of hurling thermonuclear arms at the United States. Dr. Garwin, already one of President Nixon’s science advisers, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Cbf5swEACAAJ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threw himself</a> into the satellite effort.</p><p>The nation’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/12/science/spy-satellites-early-role-as-floodlight-coming-clear.html" title="">early spy satellites</a>, which relied on photographic film, were slow, clumsy and wasteful. It could take weeks for exposed film to get to photo analysts. And the costly orbiters, once out of film, went into the celestial junkyard.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-17"><div><p>Dr. Garwin led a team of experts who foresaw a more advanced type of spacecraft that would replace film with microelectronics and radio transmitters. Fresh images would flash to Earth. The team also called for powerful new telescopes. In effect, the spy craft were to be precursors to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/hubble-space-telescope" title="">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, but aimed at the Earth.</p><p>Even by the usual standards of federal secrecy, the satellite project was extremely hush-hush. In July 1971, Dr. Garwin had drafts of <a href="https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/MAJOR%20NRO%20PROGRAMS%20&amp;%20PROJECTS/NRO%20EOI/SC-2016-00001_C05093200.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the final report</a> delivered by <a href="https://rlg.fas.org/land.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a special class of courier</a> to members of his team. They were required to read them, return them and keep no copies.</p><p>The next month, Dr. Garwin and a colleague <a href="https://rlg.fas.org/seven-decades.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">briefed Kissinger</a>, who backed the new electrooptical approach. Remarkably, the innovation was decades ahead of the shift in consumer cameras from film to digital.</p><p>That September, President Nixon <a href="https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/docs/HOSR/SC-2017-00006e.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved a plan</a> to develop the new spy satellite, which became the archetype for all that followed. For East-West relations, the technology was seen as raising predictability and lessening surprise, thus lowering tensions between the superpowers.</p><p>The next year, Nixon met in Moscow with the Soviet leader Leonid I.

It had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/05/world/hiroshima-bomb-s-radiation-remains-a-scientific-mystery.html" title="">no test explosion</a>. H-bombs were tricker. By definition, they needed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/21/us/us-researchers-foresee-a-big-rise-in-nuclear-tests.html" title="">multiple tests</a> to uncover flaws and optimize results.</p><p>For decades, Dr. Garwin’s push for a comprehensive ban on test detonations rested primarily on that fact — no testing, no H-bomb. Though he saw Kennedy’s space ban as a good start, he wanted to head off not only new arms races, but also new states aspiring to the world’s most destructive weapons.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-20"><div><p>The end of the Cold War seemed like the moment. In 1993, President Bill Clinton <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-radio-address-546" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced plans</a> for a treaty in which all nations would forgo all nuclear blasts, as Washington was doing unilaterally. This meant banning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/20/science/china-nuclear-tests-lop-nur.html" title="">tests even underground</a>, the last permissible zone.</p><p>In 1993, Dr. Garwin became chair of the Arms Control and Nonproliferation Advisory Board in the State Department, which guided senior federal officials, including in the White House. It also helped build public support for a test-ban agreement.</p><p>Crucially, in August 1995, Dr. Garwin helped resolve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/world/atom-powers-want-to-test-despite-treaty.html" title="">a technical dispute</a> that was threatening to become a deal-breaker in the treaty negotiations. It centered on whether a ban should allow minuscule blasts. He addressed it as a longtime member of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/books/review/rentagenius.html" title="">the Jasons</a>, a secretive group of independent federal science advisers. In <a href="https://rlg.fas.org/jsr-95-320.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lengthy report</a>, the group backed the comprehensive ban, saying the United States could sign a treaty even if it ruled out minute tests.</p><p>Days later, Mr. Clinton echoed that finding in announcing that he would seek what experts called a zero-yield treaty. “I hope,” <a href="https://scipp.ucsc.edu/~haber/UC_CORP/ctbt-cli.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he said</a>, “it will lead to an early consensus” at the negotiating table.</p><p>Instead, the talks dragged on.

The long, hard process of hammering out a global consensus on the merits of a ban, embraced by thermonuclear states, led to a more stable new era. Gone were the shock waves that had radiated from underground test sites and ricocheted around the globe. Since then, the United States and other main nuclear powers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/science/nuclear-testing-nnsa-williams.html" title="">have tested no weapons</a>.

Keyworth II</a>, Teller’s friend, who later served as President Ronald Reagan’s science adviser, gave me a transcript of the tape recording and I <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/24/science/who-built-the-h-bomb-debate-revives.html" title="">wrote about it</a> for The New York Times. It was noticed, including <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-richard-l-2020-april-14" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by Dr. Garwin</a> and his family.</p><p>Though Teller had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/science/richard-l-garwin-dead.html" title="">previously acknowledged</a> the young physicist’s role, those mentions were buried in specialist writings and meetings. Now, suddenly — a half-century after the fact — Dr. Garwin gained wide public recognition as the H-bomb’s designer.</p><p>“That was when people really knew,” Lois, his wife, <a href="https://repository.aip.org/garwin-lois-july-1-2004" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told a historian</a>. “And people who knew Dick very, very well, and had known him for a very long time, expressed real surprise.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-25"><div><p>After that, as much as ever, he raced ahead. The polymath lectured and wrote papers on space weapons, land mines, terrorism, pandemics, submarines, science advising, food aid programs, automatic teller machines, Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the nation’s electrical grid, the disposal of radioactive waste, catastrophic risks and nuclear disarmament. The last entry in his <a href="https://rlg.fas.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comprehensive archive</a> is dated early this year.</p><p>Around that time, I decided that the elder statesman of nuclear arms control, like Teller, was probably not going to live forever.

The great danger, he added, is “so many nuclear weapons,” which raise the risk of theft, missteps, accidents, unauthorized use — and the world falling from mutual deterrence into a thermonuclear abyss.</p><p>To me, that last visit with Dr. Garwin was another glimpse of a bygone era in which he struggled inconspicuously to counter an existential threat to humankind.</p><p>I asked if he had ever considered a memoir.</p><p>“I tried,” said the man known for his blunt honesty. “It’s an impossible job.”</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p>William J.
