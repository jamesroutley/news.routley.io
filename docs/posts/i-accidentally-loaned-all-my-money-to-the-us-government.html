    <h1>I accidentally loaned all my money to the US government</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I learned that the US government offers a little gift called I-bonds, and that this is the month to buy them. Depending on your perspective, I-bonds are either free money or the only true money storage. They&#39;re zero-risk bonds with an interest rate that always matches or exceeds inflation. The interest rate trails inflation a bit and changes at 6 month intervals, so the math works out such that if you buy before May this year, you get a guaranteed ~8.5% return over the next 12 months, but if you miss this month you might get screwed. After a year you&#39;re allowed to withdraw, with almost negligible penalties. But the government only lets each person buy $10,000 of I-bonds a year. Still, that&#39;s a free $850.</p><p>So last week I hopped on treasurydirect.gov for the first time to buy my bonds. I gotta say, not to blame anyone else for my blunders, but I&#39;ve seen a lot of bad UXs in my life, and treasurydirect.gov just might top the list.</p><p>First, they require you to enter your password by clicking on a virtual keyboard.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/beanlog-images/ibonds/virtual-keyboard.png"/></p><p>This pseudo-security measure actually only slows down humans, not bots, because you can still edit the value of the text field using Javascript (and in fact it&#39;s easier to do it that way if you know how).</p><p>Next, if you try to go back to the previous page at any point, there&#39;s a good chance you get kicked out and have to log back in with the virtual keyboard.</p><p>Lastly, when you pick a security to buy, the interest rates are nowhere to be seen. As a result, you&#39;re never totally sure you&#39;re doing the right thing.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/beanlog-images/ibonds/bonds.png"/></p><p>I was afraid to immediately dump $10k using this interface, so I first bought $25 of I-bonds just to test the waters. It took a couple days for them to process the transaction, but it seemed to go through smoothly.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/beanlog-images/ibonds/savings.png"/></p><p>So I was ready to make the real investment.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/beanlog-images/ibonds/purchase.png"/></p><p>It was on this screen that a dumb thought crossed my mind that would seal my fate. Obviously I was only allowed to buy another $9,975. But if I tried to buy $10,000, what would happen? It must be a common type of error. Would they let $9,975 go through and return $25? Would they reject the whole transaction? Would the rejection happen immediately, in an hour, in a day? It was a morbid curiosity. I already knew I was using lackluster software, yet I wanted to see just how inept it could be. No real damage could be done, I figured.</p><p>The request went through successfully, so I figured I’d get an email later saying I screwed up. That email came, and indeed I did screw up.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/beanlog-images/ibonds/email.png"/></p><p>They already took my money and will take 8-10 weeks to give it back?! Do they even have backend servers or is it just rodents passing around slips of paper?</p><p>Whatever, I thought, I still have a little over $10k left in my bank, and my next paycheck will come soon. I went back on <!-- --><a href="http://treasurydirect.gov">treasurydirect.gov</a> and bought $9,975 of I-bonds, like I was supposed to before, and went on with my day.<!-- --></p><p>A couple days later I got another “limit exceeded” email, saying it’ll be another 8-10 weeks to get a refund. Huh. Slowly it dawned on me that not only did I just loan $19,975 to the government for 2 months with zero interest, but I’d locked myself out of the golden window for buying I-bonds. I sat there with my $173.12 of remaining savings and $25 in I-bonds, feeling like I had accomplished something truly remarkable.</p></div></div>
