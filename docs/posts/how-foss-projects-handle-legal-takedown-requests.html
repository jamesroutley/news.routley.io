    <h1>How FOSS Projects Handle Legal Takedown Requests</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When a legal takedown request arrives, whether it’s about copyright,
censorship, privacy, or something more vague, how a Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) project responds can make all the difference.</p>

<p>Handled well, a takedown request can be a manageable administrative step. Handled poorly, it can cause panic, disrupt infrastructure, or even put contributors at legal risk.</p>

<p>As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.</p>

<h2 id="a-pattern-emerges">A Pattern Emerges</h2>

<p>Despite differences in jurisdiction, size, and mission, a few common themes
from our research emerged when we asked how other projects handle takedown
requests:</p>

<h3 id="1-dont-be-a-soft-target">1. Don’t Be a Soft Target</h3>

<p>Legal threats often follow the path of least resistance. FOSS projects that
publish a formal takedown policy, require legal submissions through specific
channels, and insist on a valid legal basis are much less likely to receive,
or comply with, vague or harassing demands.</p>

<p>One FOSS organization, for example, requires all legal correspondence to be submitted by postal mail in the national language and citing local law. Most complaints evaporate once asked to comply.</p>

<h3 id="2-creating-a-transparent-and-documented-process">2. Creating a transparent and documented process</h3>

<p>Several digital rights organizations advised setting up structured response
steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Require submissions to a dedicated legal@ or abuse@ email.</li>
  <li>Insist on full documentation: legal basis, jurisdiction, evidence of the
infringement and identity of the complainant.</li>
  <li>Review for sufficiency, proportionality, and standing before acting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates proper documentation to process valid claims, while protecting projects from illegitimate or unfounded requests.</p>

<h3 id="3-use-jurisdiction-strategically">3. Use Jurisdiction Strategically</h3>

<p>Projects based in civil law jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, are often
better positioned to deflect legal demands from foreign entities. Several
organizations emphasized that complying with vague or extrajudicial
requests, especially those originating outside your jurisdiction, can
increase risk unnecessarily. Instead, they recommended requiring a valid
legal basis grounded in the project’s home country. Formal legal processes,
such as court orders or official government channels, were seen as the
appropriate threshold, not informal emails or unverifiable demands.</p>

<h2 id="notification-and-appeals-fairness-and-transparency">Notification and Appeals: Fairness and Transparency</h2>

<p>All of the projects we consulted emphasized the importance of notifying
developers whose apps are being targeted, informing them (if possible) of
the seriousness of the claim, and the proposed strategy F-Droid is taking to
handle the claim. </p>

<p>If a threat is deemed to be valid and a developer’s content is flagged for
takedown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The developer or maintainer is informed, unless prohibited by law (gag
orders).</li>
  <li>A window for response (commonly 14 days) is offered, unless unfeasible due
to seriousness and time restraints of the request itself</li>
  <li>If the developer disputes the claim and provides supporting information
(e.g. license, public domain status, fair use justification), the claim is
reviewed.</li>
  <li>If the claim is upheld, the content is removed, but always with an
internal record and opportunity to appeal.</li>
</ul>

<p>This mirrors principles embedded in international norms (like the <a href="https://manilaprinciples.org/principles.html">Manila Principles</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy">GitHub’s DMCA takedown policy</a>) and avoids overcompliance with weak or abusive claims.</p>

<h2 id="transparency-censorship-and-what-you-can-legally-publish">Transparency, Censorship, and What You Can (Legally) Publish</h2>

<p>Takedown requests occupy a complex space between legal enforcement and
censorship. While some are legitimate claims, like copyright violations or
privacy breaches, others are vague, politically motivated, or intended to
silence dissent. For FOSS projects that have a global user base, it’s not
always obvious how to respond. Complying too quickly can reinforce
censorship practices; resisting without process can lead to full website
shut downs, <a href="https://dn.org/government-influence-on-dns-through-domain-seizures-and-takedowns/">domain names being taken
away</a>
(as in the US) or <a href="https://calyxinstitute.org/about/press/2010-merrill-speaks-at-27th-CCC-berlin">large and costly legal
battles</a>.</p>

<p>One strategy that helps balance this tension is radical
transparency. Several projects we spoke with emphasized the importance of
documenting what actions were taken and why, not just for accountability,
but as a form of resistance. A well-known example is GitHub’s DMCA takedown
policy (as of July 2025), which mandates compliance with valid takedown
requests, but also posts each one publicly in their <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">github/dmca
repository</a>. The result: potential abusers
know their requests will face public scrutiny, which acts as a deterrent.</p>

<p>However, not all jurisdictions allow this kind of transparency. In India,
for example, we were informed that it is often illegal to disclose that you
have received a government request, even to the developer of the affected
app. In contrast, in Russia, takedown requests can often be <a href="https://reestr.rublacklist.net/en/">legally
posted</a>, though by doing so you may be
putting yourself at risk for retaliation, additional takedown requests and
legal troubles.</p>

<p>With that in mind, some best practices for FOSS projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publishing biannual transparency reports, even if redacted or aggregated.</li>
  <li>Maintaining an internal log of all takedown activity, with public
disclosure where legally possible.</li>
  <li>Explaining the general reasons for content removals, who made the request,
under what law, and what action was taken, unless legally prohibited.</li>
  <li>Being explicit about what cannot be shared, and why.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transparency won’t prevent all forms of censorship, but it can slow them
down, raise awareness, and provide a record that strengthens the broader
FOSS ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-doing-at-f-droid">What We’re Doing at F-Droid</h2>

<p>F-Droid is revising its own takedown policy, informed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dutch law and EU regulations</li>
  <li>The structural support provided by The Commons Conservancy</li>
  <li>Practical lessons from long-standing FOSS organizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Our draft process includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Written takedown submission request to legal@f-droid.org including the
   required information.:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the specific material in question (e.g. app name)</li>
  <li>Include valid legal basis under applicable jurisdiction (e.g. copyright
  law, court order statutory basis)</li>
  <li>Indicate jurisdiction in which the legal basis is claimed to apply</li>
  <li>Include sufficient evidence of the alleged infringement (e.g. copyright
  certificate, ownership declaration)</li>
  <li>Clearly state that the complaintant is authorized to act on behalf of the
  rights holder</li>
  <li>Include full contact details and a verifiable identity (subject to
  exceptions, such as gag orders or whistleblower protection)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Verification of jurisdiction and legal basis, including evidence</li>
  <li>Developer notification and appeal procedures</li>
  <li>Rejection of requests lacking documentation or legal authority may be
   rejected or ignored</li>
  <li>Biannual transparency reports and public tracking of takedown requests</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re also working to improve contributor education about potential exposure
when contributing to F-Droid, document internal escalation paths, and ensure
consistent handling of international claims.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Takedown requests are not going away in fact, they’re becoming more frequent
and more complex. But FOSS projects don’t have to face them unprepared.</p>

<p>By building processes, establishing clear jurisdiction, and protecting individuals through structure and policy, we can handle these challenges with the seriousness they deserve without letting them derail our mission.</p>
