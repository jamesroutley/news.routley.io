    <h1>Ask HN: What to do when someone clones your site?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Our B2B SaaS had its entire website cloned at another domain. The cloner then took the time to create a new logo and change a few colors.</p><p>We reached out to the hosting provider, and the registrar, neither care.</p><p>The cloned website is hosted in Europe (Germany), with a small hosting provider. Domain registration appears to be hostinger.com.</p><p>Our concerns: Search engine trouble, potential customer confusion, lost sales.</p><p>We found the clone when ahrefs started reporting a new domain linking to one of our sites, because they&#39;d helpfully cloned our entire footer.</p><p>Thanks for all your advice!</p></div></div></div>
