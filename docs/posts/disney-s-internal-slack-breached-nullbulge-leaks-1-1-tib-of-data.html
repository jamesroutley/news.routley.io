    <h1>Disney&#39;s Internal Slack Breached? NullBulge Leaks 1.1 TiB of Data</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Hacktivist group NullBulge claims to have breached Disney, leaking 1.1 TiB of internal Slack data. The leak allegedly includes messages, files, code, and more. This comes amidst breaches affecting AT&amp;T and Ticketmaster.</p>


<p>A self-proclaimed hacktivist group named NullBulge, aiming to “protect artists’ rights and ensure fair compensation for their work,” claims to have breached Disney and leaked 1.1 TiB (1.2 TB) of the company’s internal Slack infrastructure. These claims were posted on the notorious cybercrime and hacker platform <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/breach-forums-return-clearnet-dark-web-fbi-seizure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="117113" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breach Forums</a></strong> on July 12, 2024.</p>



<p>The breach, which is yet to be verified, allegedly contains a complete copy of the company’s Slack communications used by their development team including messages, files, and other data exchanged within the Slack workspace.</p>



<p>The hackers further claim the dump includes “almost 10,000 channels, every message and file possible, unreleased projects, raw images, code, logins, links to internal API/web pages, and more!”</p>

<p>NullBulge also used X (formerly Twitter) to <strong><a href="https://x.com/NullBulgeGroup/status/1811656487514546466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announce</a> </strong>the alleged hack, stating, “Disney has had their entire dev Slack dumped. 1.1 TiB of files and chat messages. Anything we could get our hands on, we downloaded and packaged up. Want to see what goes on behind the doors? Go grab it.”</p>

<p>The origins of the NullBulge Group are unknown. However, their official website claims the group aims to protect artists’ rights and ensure fair compensation for their work. <a href="https://x.com/ValeryMarchive/status/1811785640834383931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Rumours</strong></a> suggest that NullBulge might be linked to the LockBit ransomware gang, as they appear to be using LockBit’s leaked builder.</p>

<p>As for Disney, in recent years, the company has faced criticism and legal issues regarding the payment of fair shares to artists and writers. Prominent figures like Neil Gaiman have <strong><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/623157/neil-gaiman-calls-out-disney-for-failing-to-pay-royalties-to-writers-and-artists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a> </strong>that Disney has stopped paying royalties to some writers and artists for works that include novelizations and graphic novels of Disney-owned properties. This issue affected various creators who worked on popular franchises such as “Star Wars” and “Alien.</p>



<p>The problem came into the spotlight when author Alan Dean Foster publicly stated that he had not received royalties for his “Star Wars” and “Alien” novels after Disney acquired the respective franchises. </p>



<p>Despite some high-profile settlements, many writers and artists <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2022/05/writers-and-artists-still-fighting-to-receive-overdue-royalties-from-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>continue to struggle</strong></a> to get their due payments. Organizations like the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) have been actively campaigning for these creators, forming task forces to pressure Disney into fulfilling its financial obligations​.</p>



<p>Hackread.com has reached out to Disney for comment. Meanwhile, VX-Underground, an online malware repository, <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1811783405127749647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>tweeted</strong></a> that if proven legitimate, the hack could be the work of infostealer malware. </p>


<p>Nevertheless, the alleged data breach is just another in a series affecting companies based in the United States. On July 12, 2024, <strong><a href="https://hackread.com/att-data-breach-hackers-steal-call-text-records/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AT&amp;T announced</a> </strong>that hackers had stolen call records and text message logs of “nearly all” customers, impacting over 110 million Americans.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://hackread.com/hackers-ticketmaster-data-breach-560m-users-sale/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="117148" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Ticketmaster data breach</strong></a> continues to cause headaches for Live Nation as hackers leaked <a href="https://hackread.com/hackers-leak-10-million-ticketmaster-tickets/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="118713" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>10 million ticketing barcodes</strong> </a>related to top celebrities’ concerts. The hackers are demanding an $8 million ransom to stop future leaks.</p>
