<p><b>tl;dr</b> This post shows how to create loaded dice, and how to use these dice to gain between 5-15 additional resource cards per game of Settlers of Catan. </p><!--
Surprisingly, we'll prove that your opponents cannot use the standard scientific method to prove that the dice are loaded in the middle of a game.
--><p> Surprisingly, we’ll prove that standard scientific tests are not powerful enough to determine that the dice are unfair while playing a game. This essentially means that it’s impossible for your opponents to scientifically prove that you’re cheating. This impossibility is due to methodological defects in the current state of scientific practice, and we’ll highlight some ongoing work to fix these defects.

<h3 id="loading-the-dice">Loading the dice</h3>
<p>My copy of Settlers of Catan came with two normal wooden dice. To load these dice, I placed them in a small plate of water overnight, leaving the 6 side exposed.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/wooden-dice-in-water.jpg"/>
</center>
<p>The submerged area absorbed water, becoming heavier. My hope was that when rolled, the heavier wet sides would be more likely to land face down, and the lighter dry side would be more likely to land face up. So by leaving the 6 exposed, I was hoping to create dice that roll 6’s more often.</p>
<!--
I left the dice in overnight for about 12 hours.
After drying for another hour, the dice look dry on the outside,
but they still have 0.1 grams of water hidden inside.
Before soaking they weighed 0.65 grams,
and afterward they weighed 0.75 grams.

<!--
If you have a newer game with plastic dice,
you can [follow these instructions](http://www.instructables.com/id/Loaded-Dice/) to create loaded dice or simply [buy some from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Character-Builder-Loaded-Koplow-Games/dp/B001N1JIU8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1512718476&sr=8-2&keywords=loaded+dice).

<p>This effect is called the <em>bias</em> of the dice. To measure this bias, my wife and I spent the next 7 days rolling dice while eating dinner. (She must love me a <em>lot</em>!)</p>

<p>Looking at the data, it’s “obvious” that our dice are biased: The 6 gets rolled more times than any of the other numbers. Before we prove this bias formally, however, let’s design a strategy to exploit this bias while playing Settlers of Catan.</p>
<h3 id="a-strategy-for-loaded-dice">A strategy for loaded dice</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.settlers-strategy.com/settlers_of_catan_strategy_placement_1.html">key to winning at Settlers of Catan</a> is to get a lot of resources. We want to figure out how many extra resources we can get using our biased dice.</p>
<p>First, let’s quickly review the rules. Each settlement is placed on the corner of three tiles, and each tile has a number token. Whenever the dice are rolled, if they add up to one of the numbers on the tokens, you collect the corresponding resource card. For example:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/settlers-of-catan-rules-dice-resource.jpg"/>
</center>
<p>A good settlement will be placed next to numbers that will be rolled often.</p>
<p>To make strategizing easier, the game designers put helpful dots on each token below the number. These dots count the ways to roll that token’s number using two dice.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/settlers-numbers-pips.jpg"/>
</center>
<p>We can use these dots to calculate the probability of rolling each number. For example, a <span>\(4\)</span> can be rolled in three ways. If we name our two dice <span>\(A\)</span> and <span>\(B\)</span>, then the possible combinations are <span>\((A=1,B=3)\)</span>, <span>\((A=2,B=2)\)</span>, <span>\((A=3,B=1)\)</span>. To calculate the probability of rolling a 4, we calculate the probability of each of these rolls and add them together. For fair dice, the probability of every roll is the same <span>\((1/6)\)</span>, so the calculation is:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{align}
Pr(A+B = 4) 
&amp;= Pr(A = 1)Pr(B=3) + Pr(A=2)Pr(B=2) + Pr(A=3)Pr(B=1)    \\
&amp;= (1/6)(1/6) + (1/6)(1/6) + (1/6)(1/6)              \\
&amp;= 1/12                                 \\
&amp;\approx 0.08333
\end{align}\]</span></p><!--
To calculate the probability of rolling each number:
(1) list the ways of rolling that number,
(2) calculate the probability of each combination,
and (3) sum the results.
For example,
-->
<p>For our biased dice, the probability of each roll is different. Using the numbers from the table above, we get:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{align}
Pr(A+B = 4) 
&amp;= Pr(A = 1)Pr(B=3) + Pr(A=2)Pr(B=2) + Pr(A=3)Pr(B=1)    \\
&amp;= (0.151)(0.157) + (0.169)(0.169) + (0.157)(0.151)      \\
&amp;= 0.07597
\end{align}\]</span></p><p>So rolling a <span>\(4\)</span> is now less likely with our biased dice. Performing this calculation for each possible number gives us the following chart.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/twodice.png"/>
</center>
<p>All the numbers below <span>\(7\)</span> are now less likely, and the numbers above 7 are now more likely. The shift is small, but it has important strategic implications.</p>
<p>Consider the two initial settlement placements below.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/red-v-blue-settlers2.png"/>
</center>
<p>The <SPAN color="red">naughty</SPAN> player knows that the dice are biased and puts her settlements on locations with high numbers, but the <SPAN color="blue">nice</SPAN> player doesn’t know the dice are biased and puts her settlements on locations with low numbers. Notice that if the dice were fair, both settlement locations would be equally good because they have the same number of dots.</p>
<p>The following formula calculates the average number of cards a player receives on each dice roll:</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{expected cards per roll} = \sum_{\text{adjacent tokens}} Pr(A+B=\text{token value})
\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the appropriate values gives us the following results.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="3">

</tbody></table>

<p>So the difference between the <SPAN color="red">naughty</SPAN> and <SPAN color="blue">nice</SPAN> player is <span>\(0.086\)</span> cards per roll of the biased dice. A typical game of Settlers contains about 60 dice rolls (about 15 turns per player in a 4 player game), so this results in <span>\(0.086*60=5.16\)</span> more cards for the <SPAN color="red">naughty</SPAN> player. <!--
By varying the exact number tokens in the scenario above,
we can get this difference to be anywhere from $4.9$ to $5.4$.
--></p>
<p>And this is only considering the two starting settlements. As the game progresses, more settlements will be built, and some settlements will be upgraded to cities (which receive two cards per roll instead of one). Calculating the exact effect of these additional sources of cards is difficult because these improvements will be built at random points throughout the game. We’ll have to make some additional assumptions.</p>
<p>If we assume that the <SPAN color="red">naughty</SPAN> player gets 0.043 more cards per roll per settlement/city than the <SPAN color="blue">nice</SPAN> player (this exact number will vary depending on the quality of the settlement), and that both players build settlement/cities at turns 10,20,25,30,35,40,45, and 50, then the <SPAN color="red">naughty</SPAN> player will on average receive 15.050 more cards than the <SPAN color="blue">nice</SPAN> player.</p>
<p>To summarize, the <SPAN color="red">naughty</SPAN> player will receive somewhere between 5 and 15 more resource cards depending on how their future settlements and cities are built. This advantage can’t guarantee a victory, but it’ll definitely help.</p>
<h3 id="a-scientific-analysis">A scientific analysis</h3><p>
Now we’re going to do some simple statistics to prove two things:
</p><ol>
<li>
The dice really are biased. So the fact that the 6 was rolled more times than the other numbers wasn’t just due to random chance.
</li><li>
There are not enough dice rolls in a game of Settlers for our opponents to scientifically prove that the dice are biased. So it’s scientifically impossible for our opponents to know that we’re cheating.
</li></ol>
<!--
Proving that the dice are biased uses a subtle statistical argument called [hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing).
To prove that the dice are really biased,
we use a statistical proof by contradiction.
-->
<p>To show that the dice are biased, we will use a standard scientific technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Null_hypothesis_statistical_significance_testing">null hypothesis significance testing</a>. <!-- the [$p$-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value).--> We begin by assuming a hypothesis that we want to <em>disprove</em>. In our case, we assume that the dice are <em>not</em> biased. In other words, we assume that each number on the dice has a <span>\(1/6\approx 0.166\)</span> chance of being rolled. <!--(This assumption is called a [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis).)--> Our goal is to show that under this assumption, the number of 6’s rolled above is very unlikely. We therefore conclude that our hypothesis is also unlikely, and that the dice probably are in fact biased.</p>
<!--
To accomplish this task, we'll compute a [$p$-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value).
--><p>
More formally, we let <span>\(X\)</span> be a random variable that represents the total number of 6’s we would roll if we were to repeat our initial experiment with fair dice. Then <span>\(X\)</span> follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a> whose density is plotted below.
</p><center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/binomial.png"/>
</center><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><span>\(p\)</span>-value</a> for our experiment is defined informally to be the probability of getting results similar to the results we observed if the dice are <em>not</em> biased. The formal definition and formula is
<span>\[\begin{equation}
p\text{-value}=
Pr(X\ge k)
=
%1-\sum_{i=0}^k {4310\choose 812} (1/6)^i(1-1/6)^{n-i}
1-\sum_{i=0}^k {n\choose k} q^i(1-q)^{n-i}
,
\end{equation}\]</span></p><p>where <span>\(n\)</span> is the total number of dice rolls (4310), <span>\(k\)</span> is the number of 6’s actually rolled (812), and <span>\(q\)</span> is the assumed probability of rolling a 6 (1/6). Substituting these numbers gives us <span>\[
p\text{-value}=
Pr(X\ge k)
\approx
0.0000884
.
\]</span> In other words, if we repeated this experiment one million times with fair dice, we would expect to get results similar to the results we actually got only 88 times. Since this is so unlikely, we conclude that our original assumption (that the dice are not biased) is probably false. Most science classes teach that <span>\(p\)</span>-values less than 0.05 are “significant.” We are very far below that threshold, so our result is “very significant.”</p>
<!--

<!--<center><img src=/img/settlers/reaction.gif></centeR>-->
<p>Our <span>\(p\)</span>-value is so low because the number of trials we conducted was very large <span>\((n=4310)\)</span>. In a typical game of Settlers, however, there will be many fewer trials. This makes it hard for our opponents to prove that we’re cheating.</p>
<p>We said before that there are 60 dice rolls in a typical game. Since we have two dice, that means <span>\(n=120\)</span>. To keep the math simple, we’ll assume that we role an average number of 6’s. That is, the number of sixes rolled during the game is <span>\[
k=812\cdot \frac{120}{4310}\approx23.
\]</span> Substituting into our formula for the <span>\(p\)</span>-value, we get <span>\[
p\text{-value}=P(X\ge k) \approx 0.265
.
\]</span> In words, this means that if the dice were actually fair, then we would still role this number of 6’s <span>\(26.5\%\)</span> of the time. Since this probability is so high, the standard scientific protocol tells us to conclude that we have no “significant” evidence that the dice are biased. (Notice that this is subtly different from having evidence that the dice are not biased! Confusing these two statements is a common mistake, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877414/">even for trained phd scientists</a>, and <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/17/statistical-literacy-among-doctors-now-lower-than-chance/">especially for medical doctors</a>.)</p>
<p>So how many games can we play without getting caught? It turns out that if we play 6 games (so <span>\(n=6*120=720\)</span>, and <span>\(k=812\cdot(720/4310)\approx136\)</span>), then the resulting <span>\(p\)</span>-value is 0.05. In other words, as long as we play fewer than 6 games, then our opponents won’t have enough data to conclude that their measurements of the biased dice are “significant.” The standard scientific method won’t prove we’re cheating.</p>
<!--
The density of the binomial distribution is
$$
Pr(X=k) = {n \choose k} q^k(1-q)^{n-k}
%,
%~~~~\text{where}~~~~q=1/6
$$
In our case, $n=4310$ and $q=1/6$.
Plotting the resulting function gives us
<center><img src=/img/settlers/binomial.png></center>

The definition of the $p$-value is
\begin{equation}
Pr(X\ge x | H)
=
1-\sum_{i=0}^k {n\choose k} p^i(1-p)^{n-i}
\end{equation}

Substituting $q=1/6\approx0.16666$ gives us a p-value of $0$.
-->
<!--If we instead use $q=0.186$, then our p-value comes out to be $0.044$.-->
<h3 id="some-flaws-with-the-p-value-and-significance">Some flaws with the <span>\(p\)</span>-value and “significance”</h3>
<p>The <span>\(p\)</span>-value argument above is how most scientists currently test their hypotheses. But there’s some major flaws with this approach. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <span>\(p\)</span>-value test doesn’t use all the available information. In particular, our opponents may have other reasons to believe that the dice are loaded. If you look closely at the dice, you’ll notice some slight discoloration where it was submerged in water.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/dice-discolored2.jpg" width="650"/>
</center>
<p>This discoloration was caused because the water spread the ink on the die’s face. If you see similar discoloration on the dice in your game, it makes sense to be extra suspicious about the dice’s bias.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way to incorporate this suspicion into the <span>\(p\)</span>-value analysis we conducted above. An alternative to the <span>\(p\)</span>-value called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor">bayes factor</a> can incorporate this prior evidence. So if our opponent uses a bayes factor analysis, they may be able to determine that we’re cheating. The bayes factor is more complicated than the <span>\(p\)</span>-value, however, and so it is not widely taught to undergraduate science majors. It is rarely even used in phd-level scientific publications, and many statisticians are calling for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07522-z">increased use of these more sophisticated analysis techniques</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Another weakness of the <span>\(p\)</span>-value test is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives</a> are very common. Using the standard significance threshold of <span>\(p\le0.05\)</span> means that 5 of every 100 games will have “significant” evidence that the dice are biased to role 6’s. Common sense, however, tells us that cheating at Settlers of Catan is almost certainly not this common because most people just don’t want to cheat. But when you run many experiments, some of them will give “significant” results just by random chance. This is one of the many reasons why some scientists have concluded that <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">most published research is false</a>. This effect is thought to be one of the reasons that <a href="https://understandinguncertainty.org/node/1286">evidence of extra sensorial perception (ESP) continues to be published in scientific journals</a>. Some less scrupulous scientists exploit this deficiency in a process called <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106">p-hacking</a> to make their research seem more important.</p>
<p>To alleviate the problem of false positives, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/big-names-in-statistics-want-to-shake-up-much-maligned-p-value-1.22375">a group of statisticians is proposing a new significance threshold of <span>\(p\le0.005\)</span></a> for a result to qualify as “significant”. While this reduces the risk of false positives, it also makes detecting true effects harder. Under this new criterion, we’d have to play 16 games (for <span>\(n=1920\)</span> dice roles) to get statistically significant evidence that the dice are biased.</p>
<!--
<li>
It's easy to lie with $p$-values.
What if instead of loading the dice so that 6's came up more often,
we loaded the dice so that a different number came up more often?
What if we loaded the dice in such a way that only I knew 

This technique called [p-hacking](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) is currently a major problem in the [biological](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/E5112.short) and social sciences.
-->
</li></ol>
<p>At this point, you might be feeling overwhelmed at the complexity of statistical analysis. And this is just for the toy problem of detecting loaded dice in a game. Real world problems like evaluating the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs are much more complicated, and so require much more complicated statistical analyses. Doing science is hard!</p>

<p><b>Edit after peer review:</b> <a href="http://http://vijaylulla.com/">Vijay Lulla</a> sent me the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<i> The blog mentions that you rolled the dice 4310 times and all your calculations are based on it, but the frequency table adds up to 4312. </i>
</blockquote>
<p>Whooops! It looks like a messed up my addition. Fortunately, this mistake is small enough that it won’t affect any of the numbers in the article by much.</p>
<p>A lot of people mistakenly think that peer review is where other scientists repeat an experiment to test the conclusion. But that’s not the case. The purpose for peer review is for scientists like Vijay to just do a sanity check on the whole procedure to make sure obvious mistakes like this get caught. Sadly, another commonly made mistake in science is that <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/06/17/born-open-data/">researchers don’t publish their data</a>, so there’s no way for checks like this to be performed.</p>
<p>If this were a real publication in a scientific journal, I would redo all the calculations. But since it’s not, I’ll leave the mistake for posterity.</p>
<p><b>Edit 2:</b> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/7k0ufr/i_wrote_a_blog_post_about_using_settlers_of_catan/">There’s a good discussion on reddit’s /r/statistics</a>. This discussion provides a much more nuanced view about significance testing than my discussion above, and a few users point out ways that I might be overstating some conclusions.</p>

Doing science right is much harder than most people believe.
Furthermore, a technique called [p-hacking](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) is often (wrongly) used to test many hypotheses at once.

<!--
For all of these reasons,
there is a growing movement among scientists to stop using $p$-values in favor of more powerful statistical tests.

<hr>

[Settlers of Catan](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005BM07P0) is a great board game... but I hate losing at it... so I figured out a way to cheat.  In the game, dice are used to determine which resource cards you collect.  For example, if the number nine is rolled, and you have a settlement next to a nine, you'll get some resources.  Obviously, more resources helps you win.  So if we load the dice, we can control which numbers come up more frequently, helping us win more often.  This post describes how to physically load the dice and how to do statistical tests to prove we'll win more often.

![]()

In a previous post, we saw that it's [pretty hard to make a loaded coin](/blog/how-to-create-an-unfair-coin-and-prove-it-with-math.html).  But making loaded dice is actually pretty easy.  I decided to make make the number six come up more often than every other number.  To do this, we'll add some weight to the opposite side as the six.  Since the numbers on opposite sides of dice always add to seven, we'll have to add weight to the one side.  When we roll the dice, the weight will pull the one down towards the table, pushing the six to the top.

Amazon sells [preweighted dice](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008Z23BOM) that you can buy.  But it's really easy to weight the dice that come with Settlers of Catan yourself.  The dice are made out of wood---if we set them in water, the wood will absorb the water.  The water weighs down that side of the dice.  

The picture below shows the two settlers dice in a small dish.  If you look closely, you can see there is water covering just the bottom of the dice:

![settlers dice sitting in water to get biased and weighted](/img/dice/in-water.jpg)

My beautiful wife Kristen rolled the dice for me and I recorded the results.  We used a very scientific method to determine how many rolls to do: we stopped when Kristen got too bored!

It certainly looks like we're getting a lot more sixes.  But how can we be sure this isn't just random variations?  And if the dice really are loaded, how much will this affect our game of Settlers?  To answer these questions, we'll have to do some math.

### now for the math

Dice rolling is a [multinomial process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution).  This just means that every trial can have a limited number of outcomes and is independent of every other trial.  For us, each dice roll is a trial; there's only six outcomes; and each roll is unaffected by the rolls that happened just before and after it.  We want to know what's the probability that we'll roll a given number on the dice.  The obvious way to calculate this probability that number $i$ is rolled is to divide the number of times we rolled $i$ by the number of times we rolled the dice.  Unfortunately, this doesn't give us a good idea bout how accurate our estimate is.

Enter the [dirichlet distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution).  This is a distribution over the bias of a multinomial process.  In other words, it gives us the probability that a probability is what we think it should be.  That's a convoluted definition!  Some examples should make it clearer.

The dirichlet distribution takes a single parameter $\alpha$, but $\alpha$ is a vector with one entry for every outcome of our trials.  The value 

One of the most challenging tasks in statistics is visualizing multivariate distributions.  We'll use a technique called [dimensionality reduction]().  The basic idea is that we'll use some prior information that we have to reduce our high-dimensional distribution down to just two or three dimensions.  Then plot the result.  In our case, we suspect that the bias on sides 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the dice should be the same.  Therefore, we're going to lump all of these results into a single dimension.  In effect, there's only three dice rolls that we care about: 1, 6, and everything else.

Three dimensional distributions are conveniently plotted using [barycentric charts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system).
