I appreciate it more than you probably think. Most people simply don’t take the time to get this stuff right, and if you’re a journalist or media producer who is taking that time then I want to thank you profusely.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-9QpQK1GvIs" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>If you take away nothing else from this essay I’d like you to take this: one of the core mottos of our community comes from South African disability rights activism: “</p><p>Nothing About Us Without Us.</p><p>” If you can keep those five words in your mind when writing about Autistic people your journalism is going to get a lot better.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-02MUYrViFN" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>If you take two things (and let’s be real, I want you to take more than two things but I’m a pragmatist) it’s that </p><p>you shouldn’t be writing about Autism if you don’t understand the Double Empathy problem</p><p>, covered below.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-apIHf4KIkZ" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Finally, if this whole thing is overwhelming,</p><p> let me please ask that before you bail out you scroll to the end and look at the </p><p>Resources</p><p> section</p><p>. I’ve provided links to groups who can help you fact-check and sensitivity-read your work.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-ZBGpdkyW3j" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>After all, you wouldn’t write about gay people without interviewing gay people, right? You wouldn’t support a women’s rights organization run entirely by men, whose policies directly contravene what the women they’re advocating for say they want, I assume? You wouldn’t listen to the caretaker of a speaking but physically disabled person speak over that person in a story about disability, right?</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-OGws9PtHnA" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>So remember that we have been systemically excluded from agency in our own lives, in small and large ways, for decades. And understand that when we say “Nothing about us without us” </p><p>we are not expressing a preference</p><p>, we are setting a boundary in terms of what respectful representation looks like.</p></div><h2 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-MWaijqVb6o" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Why Should You Listen To Me?</p></h2><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-OX8ihLctkA" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>I’m not a doctor or a researcher. I’m a 38 year old Autistic and ADHD software engineer. That means that I have 38 years of lived experience navigating Autistic and ADHD life. No neurotypical expert who has studied Autism or ADHD has a better window into the lived experience than I do, and no non-Autistic person can understand or relate to our culture in the ways that I can. </p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-gdJmUZqpGL" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>I’m coming to you now as an ambassador of that culture</p><p> — and I appreciate you taking the time to hear me.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-KPvIt5ozVv" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>I’m not here to present you with an authoritative definition of Autism — I’m here to complicate your narratives in a way that makes room for me and people like me to f</p><p>inally </p><p>be included in the conversation. It’s my great hope that a lot of what I say just </p><p>makes sense</p><p> once you hear it framed this way. You can always find me to ask me questions on twitter, where I spend all of my free time as </p><p>.</p></div><h2 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-S9uT8Qc6hH" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Context and Introduction</p></h2><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-xwJjqY-q34" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Recently, </p><p> promoted and </p><p> talking about marijuana and Autism. Some of the language in the promotions was a bit problematic, and suggested to me that Doctor Gupta may not have spoken with many </p><p> individuals when preparing this work. So, without any real expectation, I tweeted at Doctor Gupta and asked if he would be open to some gentle feedback about how he was framing and discussing Autism.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-MFkJhgp824" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>To my incredible surprise, Doctor Gupta not only responded via DM but added me to the short list of people he follows on Twitter. He asked if we could have a phone call, so we did, and it went really well from my perspective. Doctor Gupta shared how much he cares about accurately representing patients the way they want to be represented, making it clear that he learned to use person-first language for instance early in his career when covering Diabetes. But he then did something I’ve honestly never seen — he reflected for a moment and said that he understood why Autism may not be the same kind of thing as Diabetes, and said that it was possible he needed to be educated on the matter.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-FSIMBt6v_w" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>We talked about PFL vs IFL, about “severe” autism and about how to reason about self-harming behaviors. Throughout the entire conversation he listened carefully and asked incisive questions to make sure he was understanding what I was saying. He made me feel heard and respected, and I appreciate that. I summarize the interaction in </p><p>, if you’re curious.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-V2cqcmQtKn" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>What the conversation made me realize is that a lot of folks in the media really </p><p>want</p><p> to do better but don’t know how. They have experts they call when they want a blurb about Autism, and none of those experts are actually Autistic. Why would Doctor Gupta listen to me over a distinguished chair of the neurology department at some prestigious university when we disagree?</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-SRa_0SeCPV" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>So there was a lot of pressure on me in that phone call to not only represent the Autistic perspective but to argue as to why it was necessary to seek it out. I did my best, but walked away wishing I’d covered so many more things.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-RYDmzWdNCB" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Fortunately, Doctor Gupta promised he’d look over any links I sent him — so I’m drafting this essay partly as a way to provide feedback to Doctor Gupta, but more broadly as a way to help people in the Media understand when they’re being harmful or offensive in the way they talk about us.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-W5VKFzaalH" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>If you are in the media and are not Autistic and are reading this to help inform your reporting, I want to thank you. You are doing more work than almost anyone else in your industry to understand the people you are covering. </p><p>I’d also like to ask that if you find anything in this document educational to please consider sharing it with other journalists. We </p><p>need</p><p> Autistic voices to join the chorus of non-Autistic experts you consult when discussing us if we want to see improvement.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line block-level-1 kr-h2 z628VJht" data-editable-id="cl-sg-6HKgRE7" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>So let’s talk about how to talk about Autism respectfully.</p></div><h2 data-next-line="kr-line block-level-1 kr-h2 z628VJht" data-editable-id="cl-o4BBrLY9zd" data-kr-drop-target="true"></h2><h2 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-GmzNj__uQ-" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Understanding Disability</p></h2><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-fvtqWcHOyI" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>The first thing you’ll want to do is understand that Autism is a disability. Now, not every Autistic person agrees with this claim — the term “disability” is loaded, and its definition is complex. It’s one of those words that is particularly subject to cultural baggage — it means something a bit different in Europe, for instance, than it means in the United States, in ways that can be hard to quantify.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-7ns1SPbomX" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>So let me give you this quick pointer: if an autistic person says “Autism is not a disability” they are correct and you should believe them. If an Autistic person says “Autism is a disability”  they are also correct, and you should believe them. </p><p>I release you from the perceived obligation of reconciling these claims — just understand that this is a complex subject and both “Autism” and “Disability” are hard to define in objective terms.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-4y_oQ_j2i8" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>But I want to be clear about one thing: to call Autism a disability is </p><p>not</p><p> to call it a pathology. Autism is a valid way of being, and while there may be certain pathologies that only affect Autistic people it’s not the case that we are intrinsically broken.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-9mwglC4Uz5" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>But that doesn’t mean we aren’t disabled, and in American culture at least it’s important to understand the ways in which the disabled community is let down by journalists if we want to understand how to do better by Autistic people. So.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-zawGUhnPb4" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>To many people disability evokes feelings of revulsion or pity — disability sounds like a bad word to people who don’t have to deal with it. In reality, 25% of human beings are disabled and </p><p>most</p><p> humans will spend at least some portion of their life with a disability.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-gAGL-qNRC4" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>A lot of media coverage of Autism fails in the way that news coverage of all disability fails — it uncritically embraces the revulsion and pity that the author may be feeling. We can feel this when it happens, it’s really obvious. </p><p>This may make for journalism that abled readers can relate to more easily, but it does so by treating the disabled people as objects of pity and revulsion rather than as full, complex human beings</p><p> with their own perspectives.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-Q6cduA2Hbf" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>There are a lot of ways to learn more about disability, and one way in may be </p><p> I wrote on twitter that polls abled people about some questions relating to disability and then analyzes their responses. But my key advice here is really simple:</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-N1hfW7EDZP" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: Interview Disabled People</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-J7gksXmTQj" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>You can mitigate almost all of this (unintentional! understandable!) harm by making sure that your interviews include the actually disabled people, not just the people in their lives. Sometimes this may seem complex — not all Autistic people can speak, for instance, and even if they can they aren’t necessarily treated by caregivers as trusted narrators of their own experiences and you may experience pushback simply for asking for their perspective. It is still your job to seek out authentic and relevant disabled voices for your piece.</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-RxqLKzswPX" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: We Are Not A Monolith</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-XDoEKtZ_kW" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Every disabled person is different. Every experience of disability is unique. It’s often not enough to interview a single disabled source, especially if that’s juxtaposed against a dozen abled sources. That way lies tokenism. The truth is if you want bonus points you can find disagreement within the disabled community, and use that to enrich the complexity of your reporting in a way that doesn’t pick sides but recognizes that these issues aren’t black and white.</p></div><h2 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-08CNyLMTIL" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>The Double-Empathy Problem</p></h2><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-ZX070YcXRU" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>There’s a fascinating bit of research by Damian Milton that up-ends a lot of assumptions that a lot of people make about Autism, and it’s called the “</p><p>”. </p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-D2Sgw5uxe_" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Let me put this in no uncertain terms:</p><p> if you do not understand the Double Empathy problem you have no business writing </p><p>anything at all</p><p> about autism for general consumption. </p><p>This is not because you are a bad person — it’s because you have missed the most important memo in Autism research in decades.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-djsjPbU8gC" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>The Double-Empathy problem conclusively demonstrates that the communication breakdowns that Autistic people experience </p><p>are not one-sided</p><p>. In other words, it is NOT THE CASE that autistic people have a communication deficit; rather, it seems to be the case that the more two people diverge in terms of the way they experience the world the less able to understand each other </p><p>they both become</p><p>.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-IpT1uDDey6" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Because most people in the world are not Autistic it seems “obvious” that Autistic people have a communication problem; what’s really mind-blowing is the realization that it’s not a property of Autism but rather a property of expectation mismatch between Autistic and non-Autistic communicators.</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-a-Vt2_xq0X" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: It’s Not a Deficit</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-_jMs_YIq0k" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>This means that anyone talking about “deficits” in Autistic communication is blaming Autistic people for a systemic problem that exists squarely in the interplay between Autistic and non-Autistic expectations. We are not broken, and we are not responsible for the fact that our communication style is </p><p>different</p><p>. We must be respected as such.</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-zkUOSxV4Yy" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: Notice the Emotional Labor</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-EMsqabhIfZ" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>The implications here are staggering. It means that Autistic people have taken the blame for these communication breakdowns wholesale, and we spend our lives trying make up for what we’re told is a deficit on our end.</p><p> Nobody grants us the same benefit of the doubt and interpretive generosity that we are trained to give others — we have to get it right on the first try or we’re seen as problems.</p></div><h2 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-nUcbXDaEPy" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Identity-First Language</p></h2><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-pfj2gbhEMx" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>You probably learned to refer to disabled people using something called “person-first language”. This means if you’re referring to someone with diabetes you’ll say “Person with Diabetes”, not “Diabetic Person”. This is valid, and many people with e.g. Diabetes want to be referred to this way.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-v2523C-fB-" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>You should always defer to the individual when referring to them</p><p>, because some people feel strongly about this. Some people with Diabetes will prefer to be called Diabetics, even if they’re a minority, and their will should be respected too.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-T4yQ-q3Rr_" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>In the Autistic community we often feel differently about person-first language. Many of us have a lifetime of trauma from parents, caregivers, teachers, friends and partners trying to separate the “problematic” parts of us from the “real” parts of us.</p><p> “Person with Autism” is the language of someone who wants to think of the Autistic person in their life as experiencing an external challenge that can be overcome.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-q8HRzWhjUK" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>We overwhelmingly prefer “Autistic Person”, because it turns out our Autism is not some pathology that interferes with the functioning and expression of the “real” us — it is in fact a core part of our identity, and trying to erase that truth is in fact a way to erase important parts of our experience.</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-nTtLAUoAxm" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: Individual Choice Matters</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-Ac0xcxGR5f" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>My next “key takeaway” is going to be to tell you that there is </p><p> for “identity-first language” in the Autistic Community. Please note I am not saying “There is unanimous support”. Plenty of Autistic people DO feel like their Autism is a pathology that they don’t want to identify with, and prefer PFL. Their individual choices must be respected too.</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-fvY2pRKuB4" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: Overwhelming Autistic Preference</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-FQZ-QQwk1k" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>That said, most Autistic adults on </p><p> say that they prefer “Autistic Person” to “Person with Autism”. </p><p>So when you write or talk about Autism in your coverage one thing we all look at is whether you chose to use IFL or PFL. It’s not that choosing PFL is that big a deal in the big picture (though some people feel strongly about it!) — it’s that by choosing PFL you are signaling to your readers that you either don’t know or don’t care that most Autistic adults prefer IFL,</p><p> and we will read your coverage accordingly.</p></div><h2 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-BTsg41MqbQ" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>What Is Autism?</p></h2><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-qeooEVGVR4" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>One thing you’ll find as you do your research into the Autistic community is that this is actually a pretty difficult question to answer. One way to answer it is to look at what the DSM5 says — this is how American mental health professionals define Autism. But there’s a problem with the DSM-5 criteria — they’re written entirely as a set of observations of behavior of Autistic children. At no point does the DSM go into motivations, and at no point does the DSM suggest that Autism could be anything other than a pathology. </p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-veqDoIhPFZ" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>When you read </p><p> of Autism you end up seeing Autism as fundamentally alien and unrelateable. </p><p>So I translated it.</p><p> to humanize what they’re saying and turn it into a mirror instead of a weapon.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl--lyeiQOU7Q" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>But note: that’s just my interpretation of their interpretation. </p><p>That’s not how I’d personally </p><p>define</p><p> autism. I’d define it today as something like this: “Different things are obvious to me than are obvious to you.”</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-y6YcnXMHUh" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>When you try to get into a more specific definition you run into a </p><p>: </p><p>almost everything you can say will have some Autistic person responding and saying “Actually the opposite is true for me!”</p><p> Some autistics are hypersensitive to certain stimuli, some are hyposensitive. Some can’t speak, some don’t stop talking. Some autistics love to socialize, some hate it. Some have high support needs, some don’t have any apparent support needs. “When you’ve met one autistic person you’ve met one autistic person” is the phrase often bandied about.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-SGqD0i2g2w" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>That doesn’t mean that we don’t share experiences in common. Most of us struggle to relate to neurotypical people in the ways that neurotypical people relate to each other (see Double Empathy, above). Most of us experience emotions extremely intensely. Most of us have some degree of trauma from a lifetime of being misunderstood. Many of us struggle with the inability to name our own feelings (called </p><p>) and many of us have co-occuring conditions ranging from ADHD to Epilepsy to Learning Disabilities, and one common form of Autistic erasure is to conflate the Autistic experience of these co-occuring conditions as making someone “more Autistic”. See below to learn more about so-called “Severe Autism”.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-EIFGS21o-K" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>One place where novel and interesting research is being done is on the subject of </p><p> — basically, Dinah Murray noticed that some brains seem to be optimized for thinking about many things at once and some brains seem to be optimized for concentrating deeply on a single train of thought and posited that many if not most Autistic people (and, interestingly, people with ADHD) seem to be </p><p>monotropic thinkers</p><p> in a way that neurotypical people are not. </p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-gR6i_7krSv" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>We may struggle, for instance, with talking about something we find interesting while at the same time paying attention to the interest levels, engagement and social cues of the people we’re talking to, while paying attention to the facial expressions we’re making, etc all at the same time, while keeping track of time, etc. Those are all separate threads of thought that we have to remember to attend to manually, and each one interrupts something else. (As a result, being Autistic is in a sense an ongoing exercise in applied phenomenology, but that’s a paper for another time...) </p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-9JNAshoytB" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>All of this is subtle, subjective, and manifests differently depending on the individual. That’s why Autism is so hard to define — because its outward manifestations are such a horrible way to try to quantify something so purely subjectively experienced. So what do we do? How do we talk about Autism in a way that people can relate to?</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-AqUbtZxfET" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Well, an interesting and novel form of emergent Neurodivergent literature is the “list of traits”. It’s important to understand that things like Autism and ADHD and all these other neurotypes, they’re not objectively measurable phenomena they’re subjectively experienced ways of being. So unless someone conforms to an obvious cliche they often have no idea that they’re walking around with a different neurotype until they read something like </p><p> and see aspects of their own life reflected that they’ve never seen before. Often, they just think they were bad at being a person. That sucks!</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-8_wj2fTxbo" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: Assumptions About Autism Don’t Generalize</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-4cnhGMzJ50" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>What this means is that you have to be very careful when making claims about what Autistic people are like. You are probably going to end up referring to some subset of Autistic people in some way that makes a claim that turns out to be wildly false when made against some other subset of Autistic people. Your reporting should reflect this nuance, and you should be open to feedback when you get it wrong. </p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-SxoC6lLo2Y" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: Don’t Just Listen To Me</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-aW2v_s5ffO" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>I really appreciate you taking the time to read this — but I am only one Autistic voice. What I hope you’ll walk away with is an understanding that every Autistic person you interview will give you a unique perspective into what Autism is, how it manifests and what kinds of challenges it’s associated with. Each of these perspectives is as valid as any other.</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-0qxhtL1XC-" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: Trust in Subjective Experience</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line block-level-1 kr-h2 z628VJht" data-editable-id="cl--Br3QSj7BI" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Nobody can prove their Autism to you. Nobody can take a blood test and say “Yep, Autistic!” Autism is a purely subjective experience that can manifest in </p><p>many very different ways</p><p>, and only some of those ways are medically recognized as “Autism”.

You’ve just interviewed a family of an Autistic kid who can’t speak, maybe self-harms and harms others, and is in a constant state of distress that seems to be getting worse as the kid gets bigger. Soon they’re going to be dangerous to themselves and their caregivers, and nobody really knows what to do about this.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl--m6pH6SJTw" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>And it is trying your patience to sit here and listen to me tell you that there’s something harmful in telling the story about the obviously struggling family when they are the ones you most clearly relate to.

For instance, just because an Autistic person can’t speak doesn’t mean that their Autism is “severe” — most frequently it means that they’re dealing with co-occurring apraxia, a neurological condition that makes it difficult to use the fine motor skills required for careful coordination in tasks like speaking words. These people can and do write, and it turns out their inner lives are just as rich and interesting as ours — they just don’t have access to speech.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-yf8ImWIVkB" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Does that make them “severely autistic”?

That’s Autism, and there can be more or less of it in a person.” That’s not how it works. Some people are Autistic, and that means that different things are obvious to them, and that’s that.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-X5eDPrQPlc" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Some of those people also have sometimes truly debilitating co-occurring conditions.

Is the child “severely autistic”, or does the child have additional unidentified support needs and co-occurring conditions? Are you absolutely certain? If not, please refrain from using phrases like “severe Autism” because they conflate and erase a lot of complexity and nuance and serve ultimately to create a category of Autistic people who are simply written off as irrational and subhuman.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-9u3mifk7HX" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Finally, there is no “severe Autism” in the diagnostic criteria, though some diagnosticians insist on using “functioning levels” as a measure for this. A “high functioning” Autistic is someone like me, who doesn’t have many obvious support needs and who you wouldn’t necessarily recognize as Autistic if you met me. We used to diagnose these people with “Asperger’s Syndrome”. A “Low functioning” autistic is someone like the example kid we’re discussing — they have high support needs and probably some co-occurring conditions.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-2DA1ubGL8f" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>But both of those terms completely erase the subjective experience of the individual.</p><p> I have days where I am “low functioning” by any meaningful definition (but peoples’ expectations of me don’t change), and that kid has days where he’s “high functioning” (but probably not recognized as such).</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl--UewIT1pEu" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>So in the Autistic community we don’t use labels like “High Functioning” or “Low Functioning”, we prefer to speak in terms of “</p><p>” which acknowledges that sometimes we do need support, acknowledges that our support needs can be variable, and doesn’t define us or our autism in a deficit-centered way.</p></div><h3 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-t96rywAqqR" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Key Takeaway: There Is No “Severe” Autism</p></h3><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-F1-45oTUoE" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Using the phrase “severe autism” may do what you intend in terms of conjuring to the public eye a figure of an Autistic person struggling with a number of co-occurring conditions.

His behavior is not irrational and is not malicious — he is not trying to cause harm. He is trying to regulate, and probably trying to articulate that he is in distress in the only way he knows how. When we isolate the distressing behavior and dismiss the motivation as mysterious and unknowable we are damning that child to misunderstanding and isolation.

It means laughing at jokes we don’t find funny and nodding along at stories we don’t understand.

You’ve probably never heard of Neuroclastic, but you’re probably wondering why Autism Speaks isn’t on this list, or NEXT for Autism, or Autistica — those you’ve probably heard about, right?</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-NtTwhJWK_7" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>I hope, after reading this essay, you can understand the frustration of the Autistic community at the very idea that the loudest voice in most discussions of Autism at the policy, communication and research level is a group of non-Autistic people who called themselves, of all things, “Autism Speaks”. </p><p>Not only is their entire framing of Autism pathologizing and negative but they promote a form of behavioral control of Autistic children called “ABA”. Many Autistic adults have said that going through ABA gave them PTSD, and it’s worth exploring why ABA is so well-established and highly promoted — but that’s beyond the scope of this document.</p></div><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-5i6l7gQgQl" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>If you’re familiar with the Autistic community you may also notice that ASAN is not listed. That’s because this site cannot in good conscience promote a group that has time and again harmed and taken work from Autistic people of color and has never once taken any form of accountability around it. Until that happens they are no better than Autism Speaks, as far as this editorial voice is concerned.</p></div><h2 data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-HyPgV76I4k" data-kr-drop-target="true"><p>Comments</p></h2><div data-next-line="kr-line kr-paragraph fIftOrkU" data-editable-id="cl-H8IvacNsit" data-kr-drop-target="true"><div data-editable-id="table-tt_EQLxnPA" data-is-transparent-container="true"><div data-reference-type="table" data-real-object-id="table-tt_EQLxnPA" data-object-id="grid-TXQgDVsWFi" data-view-id="v-MfVj93RS7Q" id="grid-drop-target-grid-TXQgDVsWFi" contenteditable="false" spellcheck="false"><div data-kr-grid-values-scroll-container="true"><div><div data-is-transparent-container="true" data-transparent-container-forward-to-first-child="true"><div data-kr-grid-values="true" data-reference-type="grid-values" data-kr-drop-target="true" data-layer-id-212="true" data-kr-interactive="true" tabindex="-1" data-made-focusable-by-route="true"><div data-reference-type="row-container"><div data-coda-ui-id="row" data-kr-interactive="true" data-coda-cursor-remove-negative-left-margin="true" data-reference-type="row" data-object-id="grid-TXQgDVsWFi" data-row-id="i-xsaETqao4T" data-row-index="0" data-view-id="v-MfVj93RS7Q"><div data-is-transparent-container="true" data-transparent-container-forward-to-first-child="true"><p><span>Thanks for this.
