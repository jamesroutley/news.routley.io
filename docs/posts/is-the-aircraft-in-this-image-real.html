    <h1>Is the aircraft in this image real?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>I am 100% sure this is fake.</p>
<p>I found the same picture on <a href="https://twitter.com/aeroconcepts1/status/1387227601098268672" rel="noreferrer">Twitter in a tweet from April 28,2020</a> , but in higher resolution:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQdIY.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQdIY.jpg" alt="The same picture on Twitter, higher resolution"/></a></p>
<p>You can see the registration on the aircraft clearly: D-AVXA. This registration is an Airbus Test registration, used by Airbus in Hamburg. Below the registration, you can read the Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN) 8557.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-a321-8557.htm" rel="noreferrer">aircraft with MSN 8557</a> is a A321 which was given Test registration D-AVX<strong>F</strong> during production and testing. It was produced for Indigo as passenger version and delivered with registration VT-IUA. The last two letters (UA) of that registration can be seen on the nose gear doors of the freighter aircraft.</p>
<p>Clearly, something does not add up here, and that is only the first indication.</p>
<p>Then, I found a very similar picture of aircraft MSN 8557 in passenger configuration on <a href="https://www.planespotters.net/photo/898071/d-avxf-indigo-airbus-a321-271nx" rel="noreferrer">planespotters.net</a>. It also has the letters UA on the nose gear doors. Note almost the same position on Hamburg Finkenwerder airport (Airbus Assembly site), including the same shades of leaves in the trees (clearly an autumn setting, which matches the date on the planespotters picuture 16 November 2018).</p>
<p>The picture with the split scimitar winglets is dated in April, which does not match the background.</p>
<p>Zooming in on the lower part of the split scimitar winglet, it looks suspicious monochrome. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zegas.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zegas.png" alt="Zoomed-in part of the photo, showing winglet and registration"/></a></p>
<p>Also note that the Indian registration in front of the Indian flag is part of the paint job, and during testing this is covered with a white sticker. The sticker would overlap the Indigo CarGo Truck logo, but here the logo overlaps the sticker. The outline of the original sticker is still vagely visible in the edited photo.</p>
<p>Finally: the Twitter profile of the Twitter post says in the bio:</p>

<p>That really gives it away.</p>
