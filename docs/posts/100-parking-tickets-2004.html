    <h1>100 Parking Tickets (2004)</h1>

      <p>So I was new to California</p>
      <p>Along with a new convertible, I decide to get some personalized plates.</p>
      <p>I could not believe my luck, when I found out that my initials &#34;NV&#34; (ph. &#34;envy&#34;) were available. Not that I think anyone would be envious of me in my Miata, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
      <p><img src="https://100parkingtickets.com/photos/NV.gif" width="328" height="166"/></p>
      <p>But then, I started to get random parking tickets from Los Angeles. Where my car has never been. For every type of car. Except a Mazda. Which is what I drive. No problem, right? Just call them up, deal with a healthy level of skepticism when I tell them the ticket isn&#39;t mine...
        no really. I would ask them what make &amp; color the ticket is for. I would ask them what make &amp; color my car is. They would always be different. Even a highly skeptical city clerk can&#39;t argue with that.</p>
      <p>Then the notices of unpaid violations slowly start to come in from all over California. Because when the license plate is Not Visible, the charming traffic wardens enter &#34;NV&#34; as the license plate. Sometimes they would explain that it was a training issue and they would soon stop bugging me with
        tickets.</p>
      <p>Then the city of Oakland  has a computer upgrade. The first day I get five tickets. The next day... three. And they kept on sending them. For every type of car imaginable including BMW&#39;s and Porsches, every car imaginable, except for a white two door Mazda.</p>

      <p>Now I know what you are thinking, BMW&#39;s &amp; Porsches donâ€™t park in Oakland.  I was surprised too. But more than that, I was tired of sitting on hold for twenty minutes, waiting to talk to a skeptical city employee. So I returned the custom plates to the DMV, and someone at Oakland told me that all fifty tickets would be put under administrative review.</p>
      <p>Problem solved? Not even. First, the DMV refused to issue me my registration, until I got a piece of paper saying I was not guilty. Then I received a notice that the Franchise Tax Board wanted to garnish my wages. Not with cilantro either. Then I get a notice stating that any tax refund I get will be going to the City of Oakland.</p>
      <p>That is when I started feeling a little irate.</p>
      <p>And a little wiser. I tried calling my local police department, to see if there was a bench warrant out for my arrest. The friendly officer told me that I would have to come to the office... in person. And I swear, she said this with what sounded like a straight face.</p>
      <p>As a last resort, I started to post the story on the internet. You never know. Someone might want a collection of over fifty parking violations from seven different counties for all different makes and models. The asking price was the total owed on all the tickets... $3000.</p>
      <p>
        The only thing that made me feel a little better, was that the lovely folks at Oakland told me someone driving a BMW had the license plates &#34;NV&#34;. So if you see a BMW owner with the plates &#34;NV&#34;, give him a wave. Tell him you work for the City of Oakland. For the traffic violations department. See if he goes green. You know, from envy.      </p>
