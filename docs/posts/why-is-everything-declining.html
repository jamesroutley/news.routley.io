    <h1>Ask HN: Why Is Everything Declining?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Is anyone else noticing that for several 5 year blocks (pentad) the world just seems to get markedly worse? It&#39;s like no body seems to give a shit about anyone except themselves anymore. Whats the cause of this? What&#39;s the solution?</p><p>A bunch of things I&#39;ve noticed:</p><p>* Landlords seem extremely greedy and do terrible rent seeking tactics like fees upon fees (250 admin fee to rent here, $75 to apply, $300 non refundable pet deposit, $25 a month pet rent, $12.50 community fee, $15 trash valet, $5 online payment fee, $100 a month community internet (for the $50 a month package), going Month to month after a lease ends is 2x the annual price. And then they use RealPage to collude to make prices higher[1]</p><p>* People are noisy as fuck and dont seem to give a shit. Seems like every night there&#39;s someone with loud as exhaust on &#34;sportish&#34; car ripping around the neihborhood. For months this guy would start up his loud car at 7am and no one care when I complained.</p><p>* General worker apathy is endemic everywhere I go people seem aggravated I would dare to check my order and point out they didn&#39;t put in the ketchup i asked for, or the napkins, or whatever. Or when I dine in the tables are dirty. Or the gym is filthy, the cleaner just drags the mop around looking busy but accomplishing nothing. But in many instances they keep asking for more tips.</p><p>* Software seems to be overrun by a mentality that any future cost is worth it to save even 1 minute of development time today. And this one I think I&#39;ve observed the root, it seems that people get promoted away from their problems so they&#39;re not the ones to solve them. And those who do write good software (albeit slightly slower) are not promotable beacuse they&#39;re &#34;under performing&#34; their peers. Why does it seem management (and many thusly incentivized engineers) have abandoned decades of experience showing how to create reliable, robust, reusable code that is both great the customer, fast to iterate on, and only a tiny tiny bit slower to write.</p><p>* Seems like everything is subscription model and you have to pay N times to access something thats only worth 1-3x . Eg: I Netflix for a couple hours a month. At the price for 4k access I can almost go out to a theatre. Video games are all trending to subscription models. I just learned the other day that the PS4 games I got with my subcription to PSN all are locked because I stopped subscribing (nearly 50 games) .  So I paid them like $125 for access to these games for 24 months, and now I cannot play any of them? At least I still own NES/SNES/N64 Game cartridges that will never lock me out.</p><p>* Police seem to not give a shit anymore. I&#39;ve noticed what seems to be total lawlessness going on in my world. Folks stealing shit. People driving absurdly dangerously in cars that are not designed to travel like that. (tailgating, lane switch, accelerating at the fastest I&#39;ve ever seen a beat up Sentra do...) . I never see cops hit lights and sirens at them. And every year our taxes (their paycheck) and our insurance goes up (a consequence of poor driving habits). And at the same time, we get these cases where a dude like Tyre, at least as I see the body cam, seems to be basically complying and the police freak out on him, he basically complies, and they taze and pepper spay him, no wonder he ran away -- what is someone supposed to think when they say &#34;on the ground&#34; and you get on the ground and then just keep getting more and more aggressive. Like are you gonna just lay on your face while they potentially pull their gun and just shoot you in the back of the head? How do you know what&#39;s going on unless you can face and see them? How can you trust they wont, cause even if it&#39;s 99.999999% they wont, you only get 1 one chance and if you get it wrong you&#39;re dead without any coming back.</p><p>* Over and over again we keep hearing stories of fake people becoming the top paid, respected, or otherwise status people in society. Elizabeth Holmes, Frank/JP Morgan scam for $175M[2], fraudulent crypto schemes</p><p>* And there&#39;s a ton of little things too like the water is poison, the air is poison, the food system is poison or crashing etc.</p><p>I&#39;m aware of pinker&#39;s general argument that many numbers are getting better. But it seems like people just treat eachother like shit these days.</p><p>Anyone else have other examples? I am I way off base here?</p><p>[1]: https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/26/23479034/doj-investigating-rent-setting-software-company-realpage</p><p>[2]: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/21/business/jpmorgan-chase-charlie-javice-fraud.html</p></div></td></div></div>
