    <h1>&#39;Death to Spotify&#39;: the DIY movement to get artists and fans to quit the app</h1>

What began as a small run of talks quickly sold out and drew international interest. People as far away as Barcelona and Bengaluru emailed the organizers asking how to host similar events.</p><figure id="a5baa7bb-6c53-40e8-844c-1a4ce2022d50" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8478432726f1b55dbda3c9aa469f3daf3538ca7c/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8478432726f1b55dbda3c9aa469f3daf3538ca7c/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8478432726f1b55dbda3c9aa469f3daf3538ca7c/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8478432726f1b55dbda3c9aa469f3daf3538ca7c/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8478432726f1b55dbda3c9aa469f3daf3538ca7c/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8478432726f1b55dbda3c9aa469f3daf3538ca7c/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="People sit in a library and watch as a panel of speakers gives a presentation" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8478432726f1b55dbda3c9aa469f3daf3538ca7c/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="333.75" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A Death to Spotify event at Bathers library in San Francisco, California, on 23 September.</span> Photograph: Denise Heredia</figcaption></figure><p>The talks come as the global movement against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify" data-link-name="in body link">Spotify</a> edges into the mainstream. In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”. Spotify’s model, she writes, depends on paying artists a pittance – less still if they agree to be “playlisted” on its Discovery mode, which rewards the kind of bland, coffee-shop muzak that fades neatly into the background.</p><p>Artists have long complained about paltry payouts, but this summer the criticism became personal, targeting Spotify’s billionaire co-founder Daniel Ek for his investment in Helsing, a German firm developing AI for military tech. Groups including Massive Attack, King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof and Hotline TNT <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/18/massive-attack-remove-music-from-spotify-to-protest-ceo-daniel-eks-investment-in-ai-military" data-link-name="in body link">pulled</a> their music from the service in protest. (Spotify has stressed that “Spotify and Helsing are two separate companies”.)</p><figure id="cadaf858-1910-4db7-a438-21b1c24ae404" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Book cover for Liz Pelly’s book Mood Machine" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c924d01318f9b1721269117446184935082a4a7/0_0_1809_2770/master/1809.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="681.3985627418463" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Mood Machine: the Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly.</span> Photograph: Hodder</figcaption></figure><p>In Oakland, California, Stephanie Dukich read Mood Machine, heard about the boycotts, and was inspired.</p><p>Dukich, who investigates complaints against the city’s police, was part of a reading group about digital media at Bathers library. Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”.</p><p>She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born.</p><p>The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”.</p><p>Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.”</p><p>But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm?</p><p>Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/09/shaken-it-off-taylor-swift-ends-spotify-spat" data-link-name="in body link">boycotted</a> the service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back.</p><p>Neil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify.</p><p>Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.”</p><p>Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”.</p><figure id="63a7e532-4d48-4d66-8d9b-20e677812c48" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Two people pose for a photo outside in the dark" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.9891304347826" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Manasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich.</span> Photograph: Eva Tuff</figcaption></figure><p>Others such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too.

Joey DeFrancesco, a member of the punk rock band Downtown Boys and co-founder of UMAW, says the group “unequivocally supports artists taking agency, holding corporations accountable, and making splashes [such as taking music off Spotify] to push back at the company”. At the same time, DeFrancesco says, that kind of individualized boycotting has its “limits”.</p><p>“What we try to do in the labor movement and at UMAW is to act collectively,” he adds. Examples include UMAW’s successful campaign (alongside the Austin for Palestine Coalition) to pressure the music festival South by Southwest to drop the US army and weapons manufacturers as sponsors for the 2025 event, and the Living Wages for Musicians Act, sponsored by representative Rashina Tlaib, a bill that would regulate Spotify payouts to artists.</p><p>The Death to Spotify organizers say their goal is not necessarily to shut the app down. “We just want everyone to think a little bit harder about the ways they listen to music,” Karthikeyan says. “It just flattens culture at its core if we only stick to this algorithmically built comfort zone.”</p></div></div></div>
