    <h1>What I mean by digital independence</h1>

    <p>I recently updated the header on my website to reflect my interest in
writing about “digital independence.” I want to elaborate a bit about
what I mean by this phrase and where I’m trying to go with it.</p>

<p>The kind of digital independence I’m talking about is the idea of
liberating our digital lives from the visibility and control of powerful
and malicious entities. Specifically: large tech companies, prying
government agencies, scrapers for large language models, advertisers,
data brokers; you get the idea. I want to find ways to enjoy the marvels
of modern computation without contributing to their relentless pursuit
of wealth and power at everyone else’s expense.</p>

<p>The goal of this is to discover tangible actions that can be taken by
people and communities, at all levels of technical ability, to pursue
their own versions of digital independence. Each person and community
will have their own path towards this ideal, and this diversity will be
the key to collective success, whatever “success” may look like. All the
while, I want to prove that these acts of resistance can be rewarding,
fun, and tangentially working towards strengthening communities. I want
to show that it’s perfectly possible to use technology to suit
<em>people’s</em> needs and desires rather than the needs and desires of the
powerful. This is a hopeful and constructive narrative that is in stark
contrast to the pessimism I find prolific these days, perhaps because it
isn’t easily squeezed into a 260-character tweet.</p>

<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we are up against a <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2021/09/28/wicked-problems-in-tech.html">wicked
problem</a>
here. There is no explicit end game or point of success where we can
“achieve” digital independence. In order to make any kind of progress,
we need to make the <em>process</em> of resisting control and carving out our
independence be the fun part. There will be no moment of success where
we can call it a day and head home. If we feel like we’re constantly
walking up an insurmountable mountain, that means we’re doing things
right and should keep chugging along.</p>

<p>To be clear, many of my ideas aren’t novel here, but I need to
distinguish them from the open source software movement. My
interpretation of digital independence does not exclude the use of
proprietary or commercial software in the same way the FOSS movement
does. I’m willing to take a less purist stance if it furthers the cause
of resisting technologies that are weaponized against people and
communities. If a company building proprietary software behaves and/or
is organized in ways that are friendly to those that buy their products,
I welcome their use<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>My contribution to this field thus far has been documenting how to
<a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202208100000%20Tech%20Stack%20-%20Docker.html">self-host
services</a>,
<a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2024/04/21/indie-radio.html">getting music suggestions from
humans</a>, and my
favorite: <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2022/02/21/illegibility-digital-lives.html">becoming
“illegible.”</a>
It’s a small and slow start, but I hope identifying the direction I’m
heading in will help me expand further on these ideas. Along these
lines, I’ve assembled a bibliography of <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202405241232.html">books, articles, and
talks</a> that have
been a source of inspiration. They’re worth checking out if any of this
resonates with you.</p>

<p>If you’re picking up what I’m putting down here, just know that the
summit of the mountain we’re climbing is high and far away, and <em>that’s
the good news</em>.</p>
