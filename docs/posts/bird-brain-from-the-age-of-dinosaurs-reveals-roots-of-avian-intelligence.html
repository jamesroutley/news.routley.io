                <p><em>Navaornis</em> is named after William Nava, director of the Museu de Paleontologia de Marília in Brazil’s São Paolo State, who discovered the fossil in 2016 at a site in the neighbouring locality of Presidente Prudente. Tens of millions of years ago, this site was likely a dry area with slow-flowing creeks, which enabled the fossil’s exquisite preservation. This preservation allowed the researchers to use advanced micro-CT scanning technology to reconstruct the bird’s skull and brain in remarkable detail.</p>
                <p>“This fossil is truly so one-of-a-kind that I was awestruck from the moment I first saw it to the moment I finished assembling all the skull bones and the brain, which lets us fully appreciate the anatomy of this early bird,” said Navalón.</p>
                <p>“Modern birds have some of the most advanced cognitive capabilities in the animal kingdom, comparable only with mammals,” said Professor Daniel Field from Cambridge’s Department of Earth Sciences, senior author of the research. “But scientists have struggled to understand how and when the unique brains and remarkable intelligence of birds evolved—the field has been awaiting the discovery of a fossil exactly like this one.”</p>

                <p>Before this discovery, knowledge of the evolutionary transition between the brains of <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and modern birds was practically non-existent. “This represents nearly 70 million years of avian evolution in which all the major lineages of Mesozoic birds originated - including the first representatives of the birds that live today,” said Navalón. “<em>Navaornis</em> sits right in the middle of this 70-million-year gap and informs us about what happened between these two evolutionary points.”</p>
                <p>While the skull of <em>Navaornis</em> somewhat resembles that of a small pigeon at first glance, closer inspection reveals that it is not a modern bird at all but instead a member of a group of early birds named enantiornithines, or the ‘opposite birds.’</p>
                <p>‘Opposite birds’ diverged from modern birds more than 130 million years ago, but had complex feathers and were likely competent flyers like modern birds. However, the brain anatomy of <em>Navaornis</em> poses a new question: how did opposite birds control their flight without the full suite of brain features observed in living birds, including an expanded cerebellum, which is a living bird’s spatial control centre?</p>
                <p>“This fossil represents a species at the midpoint along the evolutionary journey of bird cognition,” said Field, who is also the Strickland Curator of Ornithology at Cambridge’s Museum of Zoology. “Its cognitive abilities may have given <em>Navaornis</em> an advantage when it came to finding food or shelter, and it may have been capable of elaborate mating displays or other complex social behaviour.”</p>
                <p>“This discovery shows that some of the birds flying over the heads of dinosaurs already had a fully modern skull geometry more than 80 million years ago,” said co-lead author Dr Luis Chiappe from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.</p>
                <p>While <em>Navaornis</em> is one of the best-preserved bird fossils ever found from the Mesozoic Era, the researchers believe many more finds from the Brazilian site where it was found could offer further insights into bird evolution.</p>
                <p>“This might be just one fossil, but it’s a key piece in the puzzle of bird brain evolution,” said Field. “With <em>Navaornis</em>, we’ve got a clearer view of the evolutionary changes that occurred between <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and today’s intelligent, behaviourally complex birds like crows and parrots.”</p>
                <p>While the discovery is a significant breakthrough, the researchers say it is only the first step in understanding the evolution of bird intelligence. Future studies may reveal how <em>Navaornis</em> interacted with its environment, helping to answer broader questions about the evolution of bird cognition over time.</p>

                <p><em>Navaornis</em> is the most recent in a quartet of Mesozoic fossil birds described by <a href="https://www.fieldpalaeo.com/">Field’s research group</a> since 2018, joining <em>Ichthyornis</em>, <em>Asteriornis</em> (<a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/wonderchicken">the ‘Wonderchicken’</a>), and <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/the-last-toothed-bird"><em>Janavis</em></a>. The group’s work on new fossil discoveries combined with advanced visualisation and analytical techniques have revealed fundamental insights into the origins of birds, the most diverse group of living vertebrate animals.</p>
                <p>The research was supported in part by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Daniel Field is a Fellow of Christ’s College, Cambridge.</p>
