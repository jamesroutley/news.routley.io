            <span>Abstract:</span>  The rise of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked various applications of
this technology in software development. In particular, generative LLMs have
been shown to effectively power AI-based code authoring tools that can suggest
entire statements or blocks of code during code authoring. In this paper we
present CodeCompose, an AI-assisted code authoring tool developed and deployed
at Meta internally. CodeCompose is based on the InCoder LLM that merges
generative capabilities with bi-directionality. We have scaled up CodeCompose
to serve tens of thousands of developers at Meta, across 10+ programming
languages and several coding surfaces.
