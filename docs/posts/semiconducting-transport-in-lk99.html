            <span>Abstract:</span>  The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature
superconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational
attention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite
(Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P). To verify this exciting claim, we have
successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of
these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a
highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9
<a href="http://Ohm.cm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of
~5.22x10^-4 <a href="http://Ohm.cm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits
semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity
of ~1.94x10^4 <a href="http://Ohm.cm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray
diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,
when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial
Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic
levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a
room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful
re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.
