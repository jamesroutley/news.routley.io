<p dir="auto">at the top of the file and then calling <code>BASE64.encode()</code> is more cognitive load. With the new API I have to think about the trait, the current namespace, and why I&#39;m calling a method on a constant. That&#39;s being explicit about the crate&#39;s implementation choices, not just the base64 variant.</p>
<p dir="auto">In contrast, when I see a bare <code>base64::encode()</code> its clear some base64 implementation is being called to encode something in the default config, which is good enough a lot of the time.</p>
