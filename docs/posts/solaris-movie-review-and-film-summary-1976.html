<p>&#34;Solaris&#34; is an interesting exception to the rule. It&#39;s a 2 1/2 hour Russian epic, filmed at great expense, and yet it&#39;s about the lives and emotions of its characters -- not about gadgets or monsters or space opera props. The movie&#39;s based on a novel by <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/stanislas-lem">Stanislas Lem</a>, one of the leading figures of Eastern European science-fiction, and takes place partly on a Soviet space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris, and partly in the imaginations and subconscious of the station&#39;s crew members.</p>

<p>The planet&#39;s surface is covered by a vast ocean that&#39;s apparently alive and sentient. And the ocean has the ability to materialize &#34;guests&#34; on the space station: exact duplicates of people remembered by the crew. A psychologist is sent to the station to sort out the situation, and Solaris obligingly presents him with a duplicate of the girl he loved and left, and who committed suicide many years ago. And this is where the movie gets interesting (after a pretty slow start). It concerns itself with matters of love, dignity and our relationship with God. The girl, or &#34;guest,&#34; is a truly original science-fiction creation. She isn&#39;t one of those aliens in disguise who are out to conquer mankind; in fact, she doesn&#39;t fit into any of the standard categories of aliens who take the shape of men. Even though she&#39;s manufactured from neutrinos, she is the person she appears to be. And what&#39;s a person, anyway?</p><p>To complicate things further, the girl has been provided by Solaris with free will and self-knowledge (those two most burdensome gifts from any god), and knows that the person she&#39;s &#34;based&#34; on is dead. Now there&#39;s a metaphysical double-reverse for you: She&#39;s so real she knows she isn&#39;t real, and so aware she knows she shouldn&#39;t be aware. She forgives the psychologist&#39;s original attempt to kill her, and then tries to kill herself because, you see, she&#39;s just as much in love with him as her &#34;original&#34; was, and so she&#39;s tormented by doubt and inadequacy.</p><p>&#34;Solaris&#34; isn&#39;t a fast-moving action picture; it&#39;s a thoughtful, deep, sensitive movie that uses the freedom of, science-fiction to examine human nature. It starts slow, but once you get involved, it grows on you.</p>
