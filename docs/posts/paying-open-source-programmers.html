    <h1>paying open source programmers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>With the recent Log4J vulnerabilities, there&#39;s been a lot
of discussion about how to pay open source programmers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how open source developers should be paid.</p>

<p>If a company is using an open source project as
an element of their product, they have a vested interest in
keeping the lights on, and ensuring that the project is healthy
and well maintained.</p>

<p>And people who chose to maintain code in the open source
world should certainly be paid for their time: They&#39;re often
doing better and more impactful work than many employees at
large tech companies.</p>

<p>But monetary involvement from companies has a way of warping
products that are otherwise written out of joy. Features are
added to please paying stakeholders, enterprise bullshit invades
and establishes a foothold, and the products become worse</p>

<p>Maybe the problem is open source itself.</p>

<p>Should there be less open source targetted at companies,
and more commercial-hostile open source licenses?</p>

<p>Let the commercial world hire people to build bespoke
solutions for them.</p>

<p>Log4j should have been a company.</p>
