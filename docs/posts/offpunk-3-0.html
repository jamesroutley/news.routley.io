    <h1>Offpunk 3.0</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2026-02-09</p>
<p>For the last four years, I’ve been developing Offpunk, a command-line Web, Gemini, and Gopher browser that allows you to work offline. And I’ve just released version 3.0. It is probably not for everyone, but I use it every single day. I like it, and it seems I’m not alone!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="gemini://offpunk.net">Offpunk, the offline-first command-line browser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Something wonderful happened on the road leading to 3.0: Offpunk became a true cooperative effort. Offpunk 3.0 is probably the first release that contains code I didn’t review line-by-line. Umerdify (by Vincent Jousse), all the translation infrastructure (by the always-present JMCS), and the community packaging effort are areas for which I barely touched the code.</p>
<p>So, before anything else, I want to thank all the people involved for sharing their energy and motivation. I’m very grateful for every contribution the project received. I’m also really happy to see &#34;old names&#34; replying from time to time on the mailing list. It makes me feel like there’s an emerging Offpunk community where everybody can contribute at their own pace.</p>
<p>There were a lot of changes between 2.8 and 3.0, which probably means some new bugs and some regressions. We count on you, yes, you!, to report them and make 3.1 a lot more stable. It’s as easy at typing &#34;bugreport&#34; in offpunk!</p>
<p>From the deepest of my terminal, thank you!</p>
<p>But enough with the cheering, let’s jump to…</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-1">The 11 most important changes in Offpunk 3.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://offpunk.net/install.html">Instructions to install Offpunk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~lioploum/offpunk/refs/v3.0">Dowload Offpunk 3.0</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>0. Use Offpunk in your language.</h3>
<p>Offpunk is now translatable and has been translated into Spanish, Galician, and Dutch. Step-in to translate Offpunk into your language! (awesome work by JMCS with the help of Bert Livens)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://offpunk.net/translation.html">How to help translating Offpunk (offpunk.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Openk as a standalone tool</h3>
<p>&#34;opnk&#34; standalone tool has been renamed to &#34;openk&#34; to make it more obvious. Openk is a command-line tool that tries to open any file in the terminal and, if not possible, opens it in your preferred software, falling back to xdg-open as a last resort. </p>
<p>People using opnk directly should change it everywhere. Users not using &#34;opnk&#34; in their terminal are not affected.</p>
<h3>2. See XKCD comics in your terminal</h3>
<p>&#34;xkcdpunk&#34; is a new standalone tool that allows displaying XKCD comics directly in your terminal.</p>

<h3>3. Get only the good part and remove cruft for thousands of websites</h3>
<p>Offpunk now integrates &#34;unmerdify,&#34; a library written by Vincent Jousse that extracts the content of HTML articles using the &#34;ftr-site-config&#34; set of rules maintained by the FiveFilters community.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/vjousse/unmerdify">Unmerdify on Codeberg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can contribute by creating or improving rules for your frequently visited websites.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.fivefilters.org/full-text-rss/site-patterns.html#github-repository">Site Patterns | FiveFilters.org Docs (help.fivefilters.org)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config">fivefilters/ftr-site-config: Site-specific article extraction rules to aid content extractors, feed readers, and &#39;read later&#39; applications. (github.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If no ftr rule is found, Offpunk falls back to &#34;readability,&#34; as has been the case since 0.1. &#34;info&#34; will tell you if unmerdify or readability was used to display the content of a page.</p>
<p>To use umerdify, users should manually clone the ftr-site-config repository:</p>
<pre>set ftr_site_config /path/to/ftr-site-config
</pre>
<p>Automating this step is an objective for 3.1</p>
<h3>4. Offpunk goes social with &#34;share&#34; and &#34;reply&#34;</h3>
<p>New social functions: &#34;share&#34; to send the URL of a page by email and &#34;reply&#34; to reply to the author if an email is found. &#34;Reply&#34; will remember the email used for each site/capsule/hole.</p>
<h3>5. Browse websites while logged in</h3>
<p>Offpunk doesn’t support login into websites. But the new &#34;cookies&#34; command allows you to import a cookie txt file to be used with a given http domain. </p>
<p>From your traditional browser (Firefox, Librewolf, Chromium, … ), log into the website. Then export the cookie with the &#34;cookie-txt&#34; extension. Once you have this &#34;mycookie.txt&#34; text file, launch Offpunk and run:<br/>
</p>
<pre>cookies import mycookie.txt https://domain-of-the-cookie.net/
</pre>
<p>This allows you, for example, to read LWN.NET if you have a subscription. (contributed by Urja)</p>
<h3>6. Bigger, better images, even in Gemini</h3>
<p>Images are now displayed by default in gemini and their display size has been increased.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://ploum.net/files/gemini_crouzet.png"><img alt="Gemini capsule of Thierry Crouzet displayed in Offpunk" src="https://ploum.net/files/gemini_crouzet.png" width="450"/></a>
<figcaption>Gemini capsule of Thierry Crouzet displayed in Offpunk</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This can be reverted with the following lines in offpunkrc:<br/>
</p>
<pre>set images_size 40
set gemini_images false
</pre>
<p>Remember that images are displayed as &#34;blocks&#34; when reading a page but if you access the image URL directly (by following the yellow link beneath), the image will be displayed perfectly if you are using a sixels-compatible terminal.</p>
<h3>7. Display hidden RSS/Atom links</h3>
<p>If available, links to hidden RSS/Atom feeds are now displayed at the bottom of HTML pages.</p>
<p>This makes the &#34;feed&#34; command a lot less useful and allows you to quickly discover interesting new feeds.</p>
<h3>8. Display blocked links</h3>
<p>Links to blocked domains are now displayed in red by default.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://ploum.net/files/standblog_blocked.png"><img alt="A blocked link to X on standblog.org" src="https://ploum.net/files/standblog_blocked.png" width="450"/></a>
<figcaption>A blocked link to X on standblog.org</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This can be reverted with the following lines in offpunkrc:<br/>
</p>
<pre>theme blocked_link none
</pre>
<h3>9. Preset themes</h3>
<p>Support for multiple themes with &#34;theme preset.&#34; Existing themes are &#34;offpunk1&#34; (default), &#34;cyan,&#34; &#34;yellow&#34; and &#34;bw.&#34; Don’t hesitate to contribute yours!</p>
<h3>10. Better redirects and true blocks</h3>
<p>&#34;redirects&#34; now operate on the netcache level. This means that no requests to blocked URLs should ever be made (which was still happening before)</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-2">And many changes, improvements and bugfixes</h2>
<p>- &#34;root&#34; is now smarter and goes to the root of a website, not the domain. </p>
