    <h1>Repairing Your Car in Your Own Garage Is Considered Illegal in Sacramento, CA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"><p>We&#39;ve seen strict vehicle regulations set forth by <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/27914/missouri-mans-hoa-overlords-say-vintage-1965-ford-f-250-pickup-truck-must-go-or-lose-his-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Homeowners Associations</a> fairly regularly, but a discussion currently taking place at <a href="https://grassrootsmotorsports.com/forum/grm/it-illegal-do-major-repairs-your-car-your-garage-s/155378/page1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Grassroots Motorsports</em></a><a href="https://jalopnik.com/sacramento-county-says-its-illegal-to-work-on-your-own-1836085130" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a> has brought to light a block of <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/maintenance-repair" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anti-vehicle-repair</a> code from the County of <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/29066/california-police-arrest-7-people-for-halting-traffic-on-i-5-with-massive-burnouts-donuts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sacramento</a>, California. In a nutshell, the ordinance prohibits car and homeowners from performing complex repairs on their vehicles, in your own garages.</p><p>An excerpt from the zoning code reveals that residents of the county are permitted to perform &#34;minor automotive repair&#34; at their respective domiciles, so as long as they are working on a car which is registered to someone who lives there. However, the code also states that the repair must be minor (which is defined as &#34;brake part replacement, minor tune-up, change of oil and filter, repair of flat tire, lubrication and other similar operations&#34;) and cannot be performed outdoors if the repair would leave the vehicle inoperable for more than 24 hours.</p><p>As you might have picked up, the code has a bit of vagueness when defining &#34;similar operations,&#34; something it briefly touches on in section <em>5.2.0.B</em> of the <a href="http://www.per.saccounty.net/LandUseRegulationDocuments/Documents/Zoning%20Code%20Final%20Adopted%20July%2022%202015/Updates%20to%202015%20Zoning%20Code/Effective%20May%2011%2C%202018/Zoning%20Code%20Effective%20September%2025%2C%202015%20%5B05-11-2018%5D.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sacramento County Zoning Code</a>. Essentially, the code lumps any repair not listed above into the category of &#34;major automobile repair or maintenance,&#34; which it prohibits occurring both inside and outside of an enclosed garage.</p><p>The code also prohibits individuals to perform repairs which use &#34;tools not normally found in a residence&#34;—another vague term which creates an elucidation of the law, placing it up for deliberation depending on the individual deciphering the legal code.</p><p>For example, someone could be performing a minor repair by replacing the brake shoe on their classic Chevy Camaro, a part which is classified as a &#34;minor automotive repair&#34; as it involves a &#34;brake part replacement.&#34; But because the Camaro uses brake drums, an older technology not typically seen in modern cars (given the popularity of <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/article/16333/boschs-new-tungsten-coated-brakes-help-to-reduce-dust-wear-and-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disc brakes</a>), it can be argued that a brake drum spring tool isn&#39;t a tool &#34;normally found in a residence.&#34; This means that specific repair may fall under a prohibited action in <em>5.2.0.B.1</em> depending on the person interpreting the code.</p><p>As troubling as this might seem, it&#39;s believed that the code is intended to prevent small independent repair shops from popping up in someone&#39;s backyard. And while it may be, it also appears to be hurting enthusiasts at the same time. One particular member of the Grassroots Motorsports forum claims that they were issued a $430 fine for violating the code.</p><p>The code enforcement website, however, explains that the law is in place for environmental and financial reasons:</p><p>&#34;The chemicals involved in major automobile repair can pollute our neighborhoods and endanger the health and wellbeing of our residents,&#34; reads the <a href="http://www.code-enforcement.saccounty.net/Programs/pages/autorepair.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explanation</a>. &#34;Furthermore, this kind of activity increases vehicle traffic and the visual impact can negatively impact property values.&#34;</p><p>Whatever the true reason is for the code to be in place, it&#39;s an upsetting reality for many motoring enthusiasts to know that they can&#39;t perform complex repairs and modifications to their own cars on their own property.</p></div></div>
