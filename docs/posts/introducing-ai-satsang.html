    <h1>Introducing: AI Satsang</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Satsang is a practice I encountered in the Advaita Vedanta or Non-Duality community. It comes from the Sanskrit “Sat”, true essence, and “Sang”, assembly or gathering – an assembly of true essence.  It is a gathering of people investigating the truth of our reality. </p>



<p>I have been holding Satsang’s for a while and am curious to engage with this practice as we increasingly interact with AI and computation. </p>



<p>What is our lived experience with these devices and what sorts of insights will they give us as to their place in the world and our lives?  </p>



<p>What is <em>intelligence</em> beyond computation?</p>



<p>I am hosting a series of zoom satsangs that blends meditation, nondual inquiry, and open dialogue about the future of sentience—human, artificial, and beyond.</p>



<p>In this hour long satsang, we will</p>



<ul>
<li>medtiate for 20 minutes</li>



<li>have a short talk on AI and consciousness</li>



<li>engage in inquiry, descriptions of our experience, and Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>



<p>The sessions start Tuesday November 18 at 9PM Eastern Time · replay provided for those registered.</p>
