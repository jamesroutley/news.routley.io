    <h1>Haier Europe Eases Off on Legal Threat and Seeks Dialogue</h1>

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>After initially sending a cease and desist order to [Andre Basche] – the developer of a Haier hOn plugin for Home Assistant – Haier Europe’s head of Brand and IoT has now penned a much more amicable response, seeking to enter into dialogue in search of a solution for both parties.</p>
<p>This latest development is detailed both in the <a href="https://github.com/Andre0512/hon/issues/147" target="_blank">ongoing GitHub issue</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/Andre0512/hon/blob/main/takedown_faq.md" target="_blank">Takedown FAQ</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Andre0512/hon/blob/main/takedown_timeline.md" target="_blank">Timeline</a> document that [Andre] created to keep track of everything that’s going on <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/01/19/haier-threatens-legal-action-against-home-assistant-plugin-developer/">since we last checked in on the situation</a>. As things stand, there is hope that Haier Europe may relent, especially as the company’s US division has shown no inclinations to join in on the original C&amp;D.</p>
<p>In the confusion following the initial C&amp;D announcement demanding the take-down of [Andre]’s hOn-related repositories, it was not clear to many which Haier was involved. As it turns out, Haier Europe as a separately legal entity apparently decided to go on this course alone, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/19a615l/haier_us_supports_home_assistant_and_open_iot/" target="_blank">Haier US distancing themselves</a> from the issue. In that same Reddit thread it’s noted that GE Appliances (part of Haier US) has had a local API available for years. This makes Haier Europe the odd one out, even as they’re <a href="https://corporate.haier-europe.com/press-release/hon-app-a-message-about-our-iot-and-ecosystem-vision/" target="_blank">attempting some damage control now</a>.</p>
<p>Amidst this whirlwind of developments, we hope that Haier Europe can indeed reach an amicable solution with the community, whether it’s continued API usage, or the development of a local API.</p>
