    <p>The art form <em>cinema</em> meaning motion pictures first appears in 1908 as a generalized short form of <em>cinematograph</em>, a specific technology referenced where we’d now say “movie”. (Other contemporary technologies were <em>vitascope</em> and <em>animatograph</em>. Compare calling a bandage a <em>band-aid</em> or a copier a <em>xerox</em>.) The <em>cinématographe</em> was named by its inventors, French photographers Auguste and Louis Lumière, in 1895. It’s based on the Ancient Greek words κίνημα (kínēma), meaning “motion”; and γράφω (gráphō), meaning “write”, or in this case “record”. Other English words descended from κίνημα include <em>kinetic</em> and <em>kinematics</em>.</p>

<p>Movie theaters being called <em>cinemas</em> is from 1911. <em>Cinematic</em> meaning “movie-like” is from 1913. The more specific art form <em>cinematography</em> is first described in 1920. <em>Montage</em> is a loanword from French montage, meaning “editing”, from 1930. <em>Cinematic universe</em> is from 2011, although the concept of a coherent world shared by unrelated films has been around since the classic horror universe (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man) of the 1940s.</p>
