    <h1>Rancher Desktop 1.0</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div>
					<div><p><span data-contrast="auto">We are happy to announce the 1.0.0 release of </span><a href="https://rancherdesktop.io/"><span data-contrast="none">Rancher Desktop</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This release has been months in the making since development on Rancher Desktop began. After starting small and learning what users needed, we were able to adjust its path and develop the features needed for a 1.0.0 stable community release.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But wait – what is Rancher Desktop again? It’s an open source app for desktop Kubernetes and container management on Mac, Windows and Linux.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<h2 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Why Did SUSE Build Rancher Desktop?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;335559738&#34;:40}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">At SUSE, we want to make the experience of working with Kubernetes on your desktop easier and simpler. Those who develop applications or package them up to run in Kubernetes need an easy-to-use local environment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">When Rancher Desktop started, the existing open source tools that enabled you to run Kubernetes on your desktop were command line tools. Many of these tools relied on other external tools. We knew there were many across the community who wanted a simple and straightforward experience of a desktop application.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We also knew that there are a wide number of Kubernetes versions in production use. We wanted the ability for the local environment to be the same version of Kubernetes as production. With all the nuances in Kubernetes versions and changes in APIs between versions, testing and using the same version locally as in production can be valuable.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">What Rancher Desktop Includes</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;335559738&#34;:40}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Rancher Desktop provides Kubernetes, using the k3s distribution, at the version of your choice. This enables you to setup a local Kubernetes environment at the same version you are using elsewhere, such as in your production environment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s possible to test how your workloads handle a Kubernetes upgrade with Rancher Desktop. When you change the version of Kubernetes that Rancher Desktop is using to a newer version it will upgrade Kubernetes and keep your workloads.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Under the hood, Rancher Desktop is using either containerd or dockerd as a container engine. You can choose which to use. This is directly available to Rancher Desktop users when they use either nerdctl or the Docker CLI. These CLIs will let you build, push, and pull container images and run containers. The images you build with these tools are directly available to run in Kubernetes without the need to push or pull them from a registry. When you choose the dockerd runtime you have a Docker socket available for your other tools to use. This makes it possible to use tools like k3d that communicate directly with the Docker socket.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2><span data-contrast="none">What Comes Next</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;335559738&#34;:40}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There are three things you will find in Rancher Desktop development going forward.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">-First, there will be a stable release process around features and bug fixes. That includes regular patch releases to fix bugs on a predictable schedule. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">– Second, the team is actively working on small features and bigger issues that will be included in feature releases. A simple example of this is improved support for networking when connected to a VPN. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">– The third thing is the development of some new major features. The details of those will be coming in future announcements.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">How You Can Use Rancher Desktop</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;335559738&#34;:40}"> </span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The easiest way to get started is to head over to </span><a href="https://rancherdesktop.io/"><span data-contrast="none">rancherdesktop.io</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to download the app. You can find more details, such as operating system supporting and system requirements, over in the </span><a href="https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/"><span data-contrast="none">Rancher Desktop documentation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
<h3><span data-contrast="auto">Join me for the </span><a href="https://more.suse.com/Global-Meetup-Rancher-Desktop.html"><span data-contrast="none">Global Online Meetup: Rancher Desktop</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> on Feb. 16 at 10am PT. Bring your questions and get psyched for an awesome demo! </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></h3>
