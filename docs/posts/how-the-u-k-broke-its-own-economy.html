Great Britain is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in an era of energy super-production and launched an epoch of productivity advancements that made many life essentials, such as clothes and food, more affordable. Today, the country suffers from the converse of these achievements: a profound energy shortage and a deep affordability crisis. In February, the Bank of England reported an ongoing productivity slump so mysterious that its own economists “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://x.com/surplustakes/status/1887506827664928819">cannot account fully</a>” for it. Real wages have barely grown for 16 years. British politics seems stuck in a cycle of disappointment followed by dramatic promises of growth, followed by yet more disappointment.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A new report, titled <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ukfoundations.co/">“Foundations,”</a> captures the country’s economic malaise in detail. The U.K. desperately needs more houses, more energy, and more transportation infrastructure. “No system can be fixed by people who do not know why it is broken,” write the report’s authors, Sam Bowman, Samuel Hughes, and Ben Southwood. They argue that the source of the country’s woes as well as “the most important economic fact about modern Britain [is] that it is difficult to build almost anything, anywhere.” The nation is gripped by laws and customs that make essentials unacceptably scarce and drive up the cost of construction across the board.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Housing is an especially alarming case in point. The homeownership rate for the typical British worker aged 25 to 34 declined by more than half <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/output_url_files/BN224.pdf">from the 1990s to the 2010s</a>. In that same time, average housing prices more than doubled, even after adjusting for inflation, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/10/uk-economy-disaster-degrowth-brexit/671847/">Read: How the U.K. became one of the poorest countries in Western Europe</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The housing shortage traces back to the postwar period, when a frenzy of nationalization swept the country. The U.K. created the National Health Service, brought hundreds of coal mines under state control, and centralized many of the country’s railways and trucking and electricity providers. In 1947, the U.K. passed the Town and Country Planning Act, which forms the basis of modern housing policy. The TCPA effectively prohibited new development without special permission from the state; “green belts” were established to restrict sprawl into the countryside. Rates of private-home building never returned to their typical prewar levels. With some spikes and troughs, new homes built as a share of the total housing stock have generally declined over the past 60 years.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The TCPA was considered reasonable and even wise at the time. Postwar Britain had been swept up by the theory that nationalization created economies of scale that gave citizens better outcomes than pure capitalism. “There was an idea that if we could rationalize the planning system … then we could build things in the right way—considered, and planned, and environmentally friendly,” Bowman told me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But the costs of nationalization became clear within a few decades. With more choke points for permitting, construction languished from the 1950s through the ’70s. Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Conservatives rolled back nationalization in several areas, such as electricity and gas production. But their efforts to loosen housing policy from the grip of government control was a tremendous failure, especially once it was revealed that Thatcher’s head of housing policy himself opposed new housing developments near his home.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Housing is, as I’ve written, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/08/the-urban-family-exodus-is-a-warning-for-progressives/679350/">the quantum field of urban policy</a>, touching every station of urban life. Broken housing policies have a ripple effect. In London, Bowman said, the most common options are subsidized flats for the low-income and luxury units for the rich, creating a dearth of middle-class housing. As a result, the city is bifurcated between the über-wealthy and the subsidized poor. “I think housing policy is a major driver of a lot of anti-foreigner, white-supremacist, anti-Black, anti-Muslim attitudes among young people who are frustrated that so-called these people get free houses while they have to live in a bedsit or move somewhere an hour outside the city and commute in,” Bowman said.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/08/the-urban-family-exodus-is-a-warning-for-progressives/679350/">Read: The urban family exodus is a warning for progressives</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Constrictive housing policy in Britain has also arguably prevented other great cities from being born. If the University of Cambridge’s breakthroughs in biotech had happened in the 19th century, Bowman said, the city of Cambridge might have bloomed to accommodate new companies and residents, the same way Glasgow grew by an order of magnitude around shipbuilding in the 1800s. Instead Cambridge remains a small city of fewer than 150,000 people, its potential stymied by rules all but prohibiting its growth.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The story for transit and energy is similar: Rules and attitudes that make it difficult to build things in the world have made life worse for the British. “On a per-mile basis, Britain now faces some of the highest railway costs in the world,” Bowman, Hughes, and Southwood write. “This has led to some profoundly dissatisfying outcomes. Leeds is now the largest city in Europe without a metro system.” Despite Thatcher’s embrace of North Sea gas, and more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/15/liz-truss-to-lift-fracking-ban-despite-little-progress-on-earthquake-risk">recent attempts</a> to loosen fracking regulations, Britain’s energy markets are still an omnishambles. Per capita electricity generation in the U.K. is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-electricity-generation?tab=chart&amp;country=GBR~USA">now roughly one-third that of the United States</a>, and energy use per unit of GDP is the lowest in the G7. By these measures, at least, Britain may be the most energy-starved nation in the developed world.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Scarcity is a policy choice. This is as true in energy as it is in housing. In the 1960s, Britain was home to about half of the world’s entire fleet of nuclear reactors. Today, the U.K. has extraordinarily high nuclear-construction costs compared with Asia, and it’s behind much of Europe in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-electricity-nuclear?tab=chart&amp;country=FRA~SWE~GBR~USA~ESP~CHE~FIN~CZE~ROU">share of its electricity</a> generated from nuclear power—not only France but also Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, and Romania.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What happened to British nuclear power? After North Sea oil and gas production ramped up in the 1970s and ’80s, Britain redirected its energy production away from nuclear power. Even this shift has had its own complications. In the past few years, the U.K. has passed several measures to reduce shale-gas extraction, citing earthquake risks, environmental costs, and public opposition. As a result, gas production in the U.K. has declined 70 percent since 2000. Although the country’s renewable-energy market has grown, solar and wind power haven’t increased nearly enough to make up the gap.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The comparison with France makes clear Britain’s policy error: In 2003, very large businesses in both countries paid about the same price for electricity. But by 2024, after decades of self-imposed scarcity and the supply shock of the war in Ukraine, electricity in the U.K. was more than twice as expensive as in France.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">There is an inconvenient subcurrent to the U.K.’s scarcity crisis—and ours. Sixty years ago, the environmentalist revolution transformed the way governments, courts, and individuals thought about their relationship to the natural world. This revolution was not only successful but, in many ways, enormously beneficial. In the U.S., the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/50-years-after-clean-water-act-gauging-progress">brought</a> about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/delaware-river-clean-water-act">exactly</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/accomplishments-and-successes-reducing-air"> that</a>. But over time, American environmental rules, such as those in the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act, have been used to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/03/american-geographic-social-mobility/681439/">stop new housing developments</a> and, ironically, even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncpc.gov/docs/actions/2016June/GSA_Capital_Solar_Challenge_Recommendation_7789_June2016.pdf">clean</a>-<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.liberalcurrents.com/the-case-for-abolishing-the-national-environmental-policy-act/">energy</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-big-nepa-roundup">additions</a>. Similarly, in the U.K., any individual who sues to stop a new project on environmental grounds—say, to oppose a new road or airport—generally has their legal damages capped at £5,000, if they lose in court. “Once you’ve done that,” Bowman said, “you’ve created a one-way system, where people have little incentive to not bring spurious cases to challenge any new development.” Last year, Britain’s high-speed-rail initiative was compelled to spend an additional £100 million on a shield to protect bats in the woods of Buckinghamshire. Finding private investment is generally difficult for infrastructure developers when the path to completion is strewn with nine-figure surprise fees.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Some of Britain’s problems echo across the European continent, including slow growth and high energy prices. More than a decade ago, Germany began to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/why-germanys-confidence-is-shattered-and-its-economy-is-kaput-d1d95890?mod=hp_lead_pos9">phase out</a> nuclear power while failing to ramp up other energy production. The result has been catastrophic for citizens and for the ruling government. In the first half of 2024, Germans paid <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/why-germanys-confidence-is-shattered-and-its-economy-is-kaput-d1d95890?mod=hp_lead_pos9">the highest electricity prices in the European Union</a>. This month, Social Democrats were punished at the polls with their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/26/germany-s-social-democrats-in-turmoil-after-historic-general-election-defeat_6738587_4.html">worst defeat since World War II</a>. Bowman offered a droll summary: “Europe has an energy problem; the Anglosphere has a housing problem; Britain has both.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These problems are obvious to many British politicians. Leaders in the Conservative and Labour Parties often comment on expensive energy and scarce housing. But their goals haven’t been translated into priorities and policies that lead to growth. “Few leaders in the U.K. have thought seriously about the scale of change that we need,” Bowman said. Comprehensive reform is necessary to unlock private investment in housing and energy—including overhauling the TCPA, reducing incentives for anti-growth lawsuits, and directly encouraging nuclear and gas production to build a bridge to a low-carbon-energy economy.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Effective 21st-century governance requires something more than the ability to win elections by decrying the establishment and bemoaning sclerotic institutions. Progress requires a positive vision of the future, a deep understanding of the bottlenecks in the way of building that future, and a plan to add or remove policies to overcome those blockages. In a U.S. context, that might mean making it easier to build advanced semiconductors, or removing bureaucratic kludge for scientists while adding staff at the FDA to accelerate drug approval.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-23/germany-s-social-democrats-ditch-scholz-after-historic-defeat">Read: A simple plan to solve all of America’s problems</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In the U.K., the bottlenecks are all too clear: Decades-old rules make it too easy for the state to block housing developments or for frivolous lawsuits to freeze out energy and infrastructure investment. In their conclusion, Bowman and his co-authors strike a similar tone. “Britain can enjoy such a renewal once more,” they write. “To do so, it need simply remove the barriers that stop the private sector from doing what it already wants to do.”</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>
