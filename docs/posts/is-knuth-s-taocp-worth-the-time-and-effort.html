    <h1>Ask HN: Is Knuth&#39;s TAOCP worth the time and effort?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m starting the first volume.
Right at the start, Knuth introduces Induction Mathematical Proof, and more specifically tries to show that we can describe it as an `algorithm mathematical proof`.</p><p>I showed it to a friend who is quite good at math, and he told me the book may be trying too hard especially in the examples variety, and how it might not be needed for comprehension&#39;s sake.</p><p>Would you still recommend this book, and if yes, in what circumstances?</p></div></div></div>
