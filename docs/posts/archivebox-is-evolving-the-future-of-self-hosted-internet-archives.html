# Big changes are coming to ArchiveBox!

*New features coming to the future of self-hosting internet archives: a full plugin ecosystem, P2P sharing between instances, Cloudflare/CAPTCHA solving, auto-logins, and more...*.
    

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

In the wake of the [recent attack](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266419/internet-archive-ddos-attack-pop-up-message) against Archive.org, [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io) has been getting some increased attention from people wondering how to **self-host their own internet archives**.

ArchiveBox is a strong supporter of Archive.org and their mission to preserve all of human knowledge. We&#39;ve been donating for years, and we urge you to do the same, they provide an invaluable service for all of humanity. 

We completely condemn the DDoS and defacement of their site, and hope it never happens again. Realistically though, they are an attractive target for people who want to supress information or [start IP lawsuits](https://blog.archive.org/2024/07/01/what-happened-last-friday-in-hachette-v-internet-archive/), and this may not be the last time this happens...

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&gt; We envision a future where the world has both a robust centralized archive through Archive.org, and a widespread network of decentralized ArchiveBox.io instances.

### The Limits of Public Archives

In an era where fear of public scrutiny is very tangible, people are afraid of archiving things for eternity. As a result, people choose not to archive at all, effectively erasing that history forever.

We think people should have the power to archive what *matters to them*, on an individual basis. We also think people should be able to *share* these archives with only the people they want.

The modern web is a different beast than it was in the 90&#39;s and people don&#39;t necessarily want everything to be public anymore. Internet archiving tooling should keep up with the times and provide solutions to archive private and semi-private content in this changing landscape.

---

#### Who cares about saving stuff?

All of us have content that we care about, that we want to see preserved, but privately:

- families might want to preserve their photo albums off Facebook, Flickr, Instagram
- individuals might want to save their bookmarks, social feeds, or chats from Signal/Discord
- companies might want to save their internal documents, old sites, competitor analyses, etc.

&lt;sub&gt;*Archiving private content like this [has some inherent security challenges](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41861455), and should be done with care.&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. how do you prevent the cookies used to access the content from being leaked in the archive snapshots?)*&lt;/sub&gt;

---

#### What if the content is evil?

There is also content that unfairly benefits from the existence of free public archives like Archive.org, because they act as a mirror/amplifier when original sites get taken down.

There is value in preserving racism, violence, and hate speech for litigation and historical record, but is there a way we can do it without effectively providing free *public* hosting for it?

## ‚ú® Introducing ArchiveBox&#39;s New Plugin Ecosystem ‚ú®
    
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

[ArchiveBox v0.8](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/releases) is shaping up to be the [**biggest release in the project&#39;s history**](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/pull/1311). We&#39;ve completely re-architected the internals for speed and performance, and we&#39;ve opened up access to allow for a new plugin ecosystem to provide community-supported features.

![](https://docs.monadical.com/uploads/e2ae70b1-2c9c-42b7-a2ca-a0a2b1bd1ae1.png)


We want to follow in the footsteps of great projects like [NextCloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/), and provide a robust &#34;app store&#34; for functionality around bookmark management, web scraping, capture, and sharing.

#### üß© Here&#39;s just a taste of some of the first plugins that will be provided:

- `yt-dlp` for video, audio, subtitles, from Youtube, Soundcloud, YouKu, and more...
- `papers-dl` for automatic download of scientific paper PDFs when DOI numbers are seen
- `gallery-dl` to download photo galleries from Flickr, Instagram, and more
- `forum-dl` for download of older forums and deeply nested comment threads
- `readability` for article text extraction to .txt, .md, .epub
- **`ai`** to send page screenshot + text w/ a custom prompt to an LLM + save the response
- **`webhooks`** trigger any external API, ping Slack, N8N, etc. whenever some results are saved
- and [many more...](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/tree/dev/archivebox/plugins_extractor)

If you&#39;re curious, the plugin system is based on the excellent, well-established libraries [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/). It was a fun challenge to develop a plugin system without over-engineering it, and it took a few iterations to get right!

&gt; I&#39;m excited for the future this will bring! It will allow us to keep the **core** lean and high-quality while getting community help supporting a **wide periphery** of plugins.

&lt;br/&gt;

#### ‚ú® Other things in the  works:

- There is an all-new [`REST API`](https://demo.archivebox.io/api) built with `django-ninja`, already [available in BETA](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/releases)
- [Support for external storage](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Setting-Up-Storage) (AWS/B2/GCP/Google Drive/etc.) (via `rclone`) was added
- We&#39;ve started adding the beginnings of a content-addressable store system with unique &#34;ABID&#34;s (identifiers based on URL + timestamp) that can be shared between instances. This will help us build BitTorrent/IPFS-backed P2P sharing between instances in the future.
- We&#39;ve added a background job system using [`huey`](https://huey.readthedocs.io/)
- new auto-install system `archivebox install` (no more complex `apt` dependencies)
  *(plugin&#39;s cross-platform runtime dependencies are very hard to package and maintain, check out our new [`pydantic-pkgr`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/pydantic-pkgr) library that solves this and use it in your projects!)*

&gt; ArchiveBox is designed to be local-first with [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/famous.html), P2P will always be optional.

&lt;br/&gt;


#### üî¢ For the minimalists who just want something simple:

If you&#39;re an existing ArchiveBox user and feel like this is more than you need, don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re also releasing a new tool called `abx-dl` that will work like like `yt-dlp` or `gallery-dl`.

It will provide a one-shot CLI to quickly download *all* the content on any URL you provide it without having to worry about complex configuration, plugins, setting up a collection, etc.

&lt;br/&gt;
