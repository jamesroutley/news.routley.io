		<h4>Listen to an audio version of this story</h4>


<p><span>E</span><span>arlier this year</span>, scientists were able to create the first successful clone of an endangered North American species. Such advances in technology have led many to wonder whether we could do the same with extinct animals, even woolly mammoths and dinosaurs. We asked Hendrik Poinar, the director of the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre, what it would take to achieve de-extinction.  </p>
<p><strong>What’s involved in trying to clone an animal? </strong></p>
<p>If you’re able to create a copy of the genome, you can then place the modified chromosomes into an egg cell of a very close living surrogate, which can carry it to term. A modified mammoth genome, for example, could be implanted into an Asian elephant.</p>

<p><strong>What about really old DNA? Is it possible to extract it from ancient species? </strong></p>

<p><strong>Could we ever clone a dinosaur? </strong></p>
<p>I never thought that I’d be taking scientific advice from a movie director, but to some degree he’s right. I never used to think it would be possible to get genomes, but we now get genomes. I never thought we could actually reconstruct parts of those genomes, but we’ve done that too. Will we ever find a dinosaur that has viable DNA? I’ve learned to never say never.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> </p>
<p><strong>Scientists have warned about dangers associated with cloning. Should we be worried about de-extinction?</strong></p>
