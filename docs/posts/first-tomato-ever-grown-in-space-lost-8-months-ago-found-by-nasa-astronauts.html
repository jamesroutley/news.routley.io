  <section><p>It has been one of the universe&#39;s greatest mysteries — the disappearance of the first tomato grown in space.</p><p>That is, until this week, when the seven astronauts at the International Space Station <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6guhKg2Rco0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> on the 25th anniversary of the orbiter that they found the rogue fruit.</p><p>&#34;Well, we might have found something that someone had been looking for for quite awhile,&#34; NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli revealed.</p>    
  <p>The tomato was the first to be harvested and grown in space. It was grown in March by American astronaut Frank Rubio, who <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/frank-rubio-nasa-astronaut-two-cosmonauts-return-to-earth-after-us-record-year-in-space/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">holds the record</a></span> for longest spaceflight at 370 days. </p><p>The red robin tomato was harvested as part of a NASA experiment to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/nasa-teams-persevere-through-plant-challenges-in-space/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">grow produce</a> in space for longer-term missions in the future. Rubio said it was a proud moment, right up until the day he lost track of the fresh, fleshy food — a commodity up in space.</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/10/7e4e837e-6640-48d6-9e53-d0d14bb7b8bf/thumbnail/620x407/3d61cfa39bb61977388dc397351fe72e/screen-shot-2023-12-09-at-4-17-55-pm.png?v=170b469460f9b5b4a2670b02bb591e2d#" alt="Astronaut Frank Rubio tending to tomato plants in the ISS " height="407" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/10/7e4e837e-6640-48d6-9e53-d0d14bb7b8bf/thumbnail/620x407/3d61cfa39bb61977388dc397351fe72e/screen-shot-2023-12-09-at-4-17-55-pm.png?v=170b469460f9b5b4a2670b02bb591e2d 1x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D&#39;http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg&#39;%20viewBox%3D&#39;0%200%20620%20407&#39;%2F%3E"/></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>&#34;I harvested, I think, what was the first tomato in space, and I put it in a little bag,&#34; Rubio recalled in a NASA interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT7l_eb0BTY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in October</a>. He said he ended up taking the tomato out of the safety of the Ziploc bag to show some students the prized produce, but seemed to misplace it afterwards.</p>

    

<p>&#34;I was pretty confident that I Velcroed it where I was supposed to Velcro it, and then I came back and it was gone,&#34; the scientist said.</p><p>Rubio said he unsuccessfully spent about 18 to 20 hours searching for the tomato, and assumed it would have &#34;desiccated to the point where you couldn&#39;t tell what it was&#34; and may have been tossed in the trash accidentally.</p><p>Because of the weightless nature of space, any object that is unsecured or not tied down is likely to float off. And in the ISS, which is larger than a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/space-station-facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">six-bedroom house</a>, there&#39;s bound to be a plethora of good hiding spots for a lone-ranger tomato.</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/10/f42072b3-8c36-42b2-ac9d-17a49da6701d/thumbnail/620x348/f046d2b8fa0715d7c0dee99e3301fed1/screen-shot-2023-12-09-at-4-19-14-pm.png?v=170b469460f9b5b4a2670b02bb591e2d#" alt="A red robin tomato on a vine in the ISS " height="348" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/10/f42072b3-8c36-42b2-ac9d-17a49da6701d/thumbnail/620x348/f046d2b8fa0715d7c0dee99e3301fed1/screen-shot-2023-12-09-at-4-19-14-pm.png?v=170b469460f9b5b4a2670b02bb591e2d 1x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D&#39;http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg&#39;%20viewBox%3D&#39;0%200%20620%20348&#39;%2F%3E"/></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>In the months since the juicy piece of produce vanished, some suspected Rubio actually ate the tomato — a claim he denied up until it was found.</p>

    
    

<p>&#34;Hopefully somebody will find it someday, some little shriveled thing in a Ziploc bag and they can prove the fact that I did not eat the tomato in space,&#34; he half-joked, half-manifested in October.</p><p>And Moghbeli was indeed quick to clear Rubio&#39;s name after announcing the discovery.</p><p>&#34;Our good friend, Frank Rubio, who headed home, has been blamed for quite awhile for eating the tomato, but we can exonerate him,&#34; she said.</p><p>Moghbeli didn&#39;t offer details on where the tomato was found, nor what condition it was in. But it&#39;s probably safe to assume it won&#39;t be featured in a gourmet meal anytime soon.</p>
