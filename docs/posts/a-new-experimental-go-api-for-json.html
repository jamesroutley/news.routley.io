<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>
is a simple data interchange format. Almost 15 years ago,
we wrote about <a href="/blog/json">support for JSON in Go</a>,
which introduced the ability to serialize and deserialize Go types to and from JSON data.
Since then, JSON has become the most popular data format used on the Internet.
It is widely read and written by Go programs,
and encoding/json now ranks as the 5th most imported Go package.</p>
<p>Over time, packages evolve with the needs of their users,
and <code>encoding/json</code> is no exception. This blog post is about Go 1.25’s new
experimental <code>encoding/json/v2</code> and <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> packages,
which bring long-awaited improvements and fixes.
This post argues for a new major API version,
provides an overview of the new packages,
and explains how you can make use of it.
The experimental packages are not visible by default and
may undergo future API changes.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-encodingjson">Problems with <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>Overall, <code>encoding/json</code> has held up well.
The idea of marshaling and unmarshaling arbitrary Go types
with some default representation in JSON, combined with the ability to
customize the representation, has proven to be highly flexible.
However, in the years since its introduction,
various users have identified numerous shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-flaws">Behavior flaws</h3>
<p>There are various behavioral flaws in <code>encoding/json</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Imprecise handling of JSON syntax</strong>: Over the years, JSON has seen
increased standardization in order for programs to properly communicate.
Generally, decoders have become stricter at rejecting ambiguous inputs,
to reduce the chance that two implementations will have different
(successful) interpretations of a particular JSON value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts invalid UTF-8,
whereas the latest Internet Standard (RFC 8259) requires valid UTF-8.
The default behavior should report an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8,
instead of introducing silent data corruption,
which may cause problems downstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts objects with duplicate member names.
RFC 8259 does not specify how to handle duplicate names,
so an implementation is free to choose an arbitrary value,
merge the values, discard the values, or report an error.
The presence of a duplicate name results in a JSON value
without a universally agreed upon meaning.
This could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE&amp;t=1057s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">exploited by attackers in security applications</a>
and has been exploited before (as in <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12635" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CVE-2017-12635</a>).
The default behavior should err on the side of safety and reject duplicate names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaking nilness of slices and maps</strong>: JSON is often used to communicate with
programs using JSON implementations that do not allow <code>null</code> to be unmarshaled
into a data type expected to be a JSON array or object.
Since <code>encoding/json</code> marshals a nil slice or map as a JSON <code>null</code>,
this may lead to errors when unmarshaling by other implementations.
<a href="/issue/63397#discussioncomment-7201222">A survey</a>
indicated that most Go users prefer that nil slices and maps
are marshaled as an empty JSON array or object by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case-insensitive unmarshaling</strong>: When unmarshaling, a JSON object member name
is resolved to a Go struct field name using a case-insensitive match.
This is a surprising default, a potential security vulnerability, and a performance limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inconsistent calling of methods</strong>: Due to an implementation detail,
<code>MarshalJSON</code> methods declared on a pointer receiver
are <a href="/issue/22967">inconsistently called by <code>encoding/json</code></a>. While regarded as a bug,
this cannot be fixed as too many applications depend on the current behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="api-deficiencies">API deficiencies</h3>
<p>The API of <code>encoding/json</code> can be tricky or restrictive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to correctly unmarshal from an <code>io.Reader</code>.
Users often write <code>json.NewDecoder(r).Decode(v)</code>,
which fails to reject trailing junk at the end of the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options can be set on the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types,
but cannot be used with the <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions.
Similarly, types implementing the <code>Marshaler</code> and <code>Unmarshaler</code> interfaces
cannot make use of the options and there is no way to plumb options down the call stack.
For example, the <code>Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields</code> option loses its effect
when calling a custom <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Compact</code>, <code>Indent</code>, and <code>HTMLEscape</code> functions write to a <code>bytes.Buffer</code>
instead of something more flexible like a <code>[]byte</code> or <code>io.Writer</code>.
This limits the usability of those functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance-limitations">Performance limitations</h3>
<p>Setting aside internal implementation details,
the public API commits it to certain performance limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>MarshalJSON</code> interface method forces the implementation
to allocate the returned <code>[]byte</code>. Also, the semantics require that
<code>encoding/json</code> verify that the result is valid JSON
and also to reformat it to match the specified indentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UnmarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface method requires that
a complete JSON value be provided (without any trailing data).
This forces <code>encoding/json</code> to parse the JSON value to be unmarshaled
in its entirety to determine where it ends before it can call <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>.
Afterwards, the <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method itself must parse the provided JSON value again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of streaming</strong>: Even though the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types operate
on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>, they buffer the entire JSON value in memory.
The <code>Decoder.Token</code> method for reading individual tokens is allocation-heavy
and there is no corresponding API for writing tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, if the implementation of a <code>MarshalJSON</code> or <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method
recursively calls the <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> function,
then the performance becomes quadratic.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-fix-encodingjson-directly">Trying to fix <code>encoding/json</code> directly</h2>
<p>Introducing a new, incompatible major version of a package is a heavy consideration.
If possible, we should try to fix the existing package.</p>
<p>While it is relatively easy to add new features,
it is difficult to change existing features.
Unfortunately, these problems are inherent consequences of the existing API,
making them practically impossible to fix within the <a href="/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>.</p>
<p>We could in principle declare separate names, such as <code>MarshalV2</code> or <code>UnmarshalV2</code>,
but that is tantamount to creating a parallel namespace within the same package.
This leads us to <code>encoding/json/v2</code> (henceforth called <code>v2</code>),
where we can make these changes within a seperate <code>v2</code> namespace
in contrast to <code>encoding/json</code> (henceforth called <code>v1</code>).</p>
<h2 id="planning-for-encodingjsonv2">Planning for <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>The planning for a new major version of <code>encoding/json</code> spanned years.
In late 2020, spurred on by the inability to fix issues in the current package,
Daniel Martí (one of the maintainers of <code>encoding/json</code>) first drafted his
thoughts on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQGoM44HLinH4NGBEv5drGlw5_RNW-GP7DdGEpm7Y3o" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">what a hypothetical <code>v2</code> package should look like</a>.
Separately, after previous work on the <a href="/blog/protobuf-apiv2">Go API for Protocol Buffers</a>,
Joe Tsai was disapppointed that <a href="/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson">the <code>protojson</code> package</a>
needed to use a custom JSON implementation because <code>encoding/json</code> was
neither capable of adhering to the stricter JSON standard that the
Protocol Buffer specification required,
nor of efficiently serializing JSON in a streaming manner.</p>
<p>Believing a brighter future for JSON was both beneficial and achievable,
Daniel and Joe joined forces to brainstorm on <code>v2</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">started to build a prototype</a>
(with the initial code being a polished version of the JSON serialization logic from the Go protobuf module).
Over time, a few others (Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, and Damien Neil)
joined the effort by providing design review, code review, and regression testing.
Many of the early discussions are publicly available in our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgrQPcV8W8EChkaAvv-3NUu6PYmnGG3b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded meetings</a> and
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rovrOTd-wTawGMPPlPuKhwXaYBg9VszTXR9AQQL5LfI" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting notes</a>.</p>
<p>This work has been public since the beginning,
and we increasingly involved the wider Go community,
first with a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GopherCon talk</a> and
<a href="/issue/63397">discussion posted in late 2023</a>,
<a href="/issue/71497">formal proposal posted in early 2025</a>,
and most recently <a href="/issue/71845">adopting <code>encoding/json/v2</code> as a Go experiment</a>
(available in Go 1.25) for wider-scale testing by all Go users.</p>
<p>The <code>v2</code> effort has been going on for 5 years,
incorporating feedback from many contributors and also gaining valuable
empirical experience from use in production settings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that it&rsquo;s largely been developed and promoted by people
not employed by Google, demonstrating that the Go project is a collaborative endeavor
with a thriving global community dedicated to improving the Go ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="building-on-encodingjsonjsontext">Building on <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></h2>
<p>Before discussing the <code>v2</code> API, we first introduce the experimental
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext"><code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></a> package
that lays the foundation for future improvements to JSON in Go.</p>
<p>JSON serialization in Go can be broken down into two primary components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>syntactic functionality</em> that is concerned with processing JSON based on its grammar, and</li>
<li><em>semantic functionality</em> that defines the relationship between JSON values and Go values.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the terms &ldquo;encode&rdquo; and &ldquo;decode&rdquo; to describe syntactic functionality and
the terms &ldquo;marshal&rdquo; and &ldquo;unmarshal&rdquo; to describe semantic functionality.
We aim to provide a clear distinction between functionality
that is purely concerned with encoding versus that of marshaling.</p>
<img src="jsonv2-exp/api.png" width=100%>
<p>This diagram provides an overview of this separation.
Purple blocks represent types, while blue blocks represent functions or methods.
The direction of the arrows approximately represents the flow of data.
The bottom half of the diagram, implemented by the <code>jsontext</code> package,
contains functionality that is only concerned with syntax,
while the upper half, implemented by the <code>json/v2</code> package,
contains functionality that assigns semantic meaning to syntactic data
handled by the bottom half.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>jsontext</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package jsontext

type Encoder struct { ... }
func NewEncoder(io.Writer, ...Options) *Encoder
func (*Encoder) WriteValue(Value) error
func (*Encoder) WriteToken(Token) error

type Decoder struct { ... }
func NewDecoder(io.Reader, ...Options) *Decoder
func (*Decoder) ReadValue() (Value, error)
func (*Decoder) ReadToken() (Token, error)

type Kind byte
type Value []byte
func (Value) Kind() Kind
type Token struct { ... }
func (Token) Kind() Kind
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>jsontext</code> package provides functionality for interacting with JSON
at a syntactic level and derives its name from
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-2" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8259, section 2</a>
where the grammar for JSON data is literally called <code>JSON-text</code>.
Since it only interacts with JSON at a syntactic level,
it does not depend on Go reflection.</p>
<p>The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Encoder"><code>Encoder</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Decoder"><code>Decoder</code></a>
provide support for encoding and decoding JSON values and tokens.
The constructors
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Options">accept variadic options</a>
that affect the particular behavior of encoding and decoding.
Unlike the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types declared in <code>v1</code>,
the new types in <code>jsontext</code> avoid muddling the distinction between syntax and
semantics and operate in a truly streaming manner.</p>
<p>A JSON value is a complete unit of data and is represented in Go as
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Value">a named <code>[]byte</code></a>.
It is identical to <a href="/pkg/encoding/json#RawMessage"><code>RawMessage</code></a> in <code>v1</code>.
A JSON value is syntactically composed of one or more JSON tokens.
A JSON token is represented in Go as the <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Token">opaque <code>Token</code> type</a>
with constructors and accessor methods.
It is analogous to <a href="/pkg/encoding/json#Token"><code>Token</code></a> in <code>v1</code>
but is designed represent arbitrary JSON tokens without allocation.</p>
<p>To resolve the fundamental performance problems with
the <code>MarshalJSON</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface methods,
we need an efficient way of encoding and decoding JSON
as a streaming sequence of tokens and values.
In <code>v2</code>, we introduce the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods
that operate on an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>, allowing the methods&rsquo; implementations
to process JSON in a purely streaming manner. Thus, the <code>json</code> package need not
be responsible for validating or formatting a JSON value returned by <code>MarshalJSON</code>,
nor would it need to be responsible for determining the boundaries of a JSON value
provided to <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>. These responsibilities belong to the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-encodingjsonv2">Introducing <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>Building on the <code>jsontext</code> package, we now introduce the experimental
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2"><code>encoding/json/v2</code></a> package.
It is designed to fix the aforementioned problems,
while remaining familiar to users of the <code>v1</code> package.
Our goal is that usages of <code>v1</code> will operate <em>mostly</em> the same if directly migrated to <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>In this article, we will primarily cover the high-level API of <code>v2</code>.
For examples on how to use it, we encourage readers to
study <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#pkg-examples">the examples in the <code>v2</code> package</a> or
read <a href="https://antonz.org/go-json-v2/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Anton Zhiyanov&rsquo;s blog covering the topic</a>.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>v2</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package json

func Marshal(in any, opts ...Options) (out []byte, err error)
func MarshalWrite(out io.Writer, in any, opts ...Options) error
func MarshalEncode(out *jsontext.Encoder, in any, opts ...Options) error

func Unmarshal(in []byte, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalRead(in io.Reader, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalDecode(in *jsontext.Decoder, out any, opts ...Options) error
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshal"><code>Marshal</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshal"><code>Unmarshal</code></a> functions
have a signature similar to <code>v1</code>, but accept options to configure their behavior.
The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalWrite"><code>MarshalWrite</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalRead"><code>UnmarshalRead</code></a> functions
directly operate on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>,
avoiding the need to temporarily construct an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>
just to write or read from such types.
The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalEncode"><code>MarshalEncode</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalDecode"><code>UnmarshalDecode</code></a> functions
operate on a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> and <code>jsontext.Decoder</code> and
is actually the underlying implementation of the previously mentioned functions.
Unlike <code>v1</code>, options are a first-class argument to each of the marshal and unmarshal functions,
greatly extending the flexibility and configurability of <code>v2</code>.
There are <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Options">several options available</a>
in <code>v2</code> which are not covered by this article.</p>
<h3 id="type-specified-customization">Type-specified customization</h3>
<p>Similar to <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code> allows types to define their own JSON representation
by satisfying particular interfaces.</p>
<pre><code>type Marshaler interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
type MarshalerTo interface {
    MarshalJSONTo(*jsontext.Encoder) error
}

type Unmarshaler interface {
    UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
type UnmarshalerFrom interface {
    UnmarshalJSONFrom(*jsontext.Decoder) error
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> interfaces
are identical to those in <code>v1</code>.
The new <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a> interfaces
allow a type to represent itself as JSON using a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> or <code>jsontext.Decoder</code>.
This allows options to be forwarded down the call stack, since options
can be retrieved via the <code>Options</code> accessor method on the <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-OrderedObject">the <code>OrderedObject</code> example</a>
for how to implement a custom type that maintains the ordering of JSON object members.</p>
<h3 id="caller-specified-customization">Caller-specified customization</h3>
<p>In <code>v2</code>, the caller of <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> can also specify
a custom JSON representation for any arbitrary type,
where caller-specified functions take precedence over type-defined methods
or the default representation for a particular type.</p>
<pre><code>func WithMarshalers(*Marshalers) Options

type Marshalers struct { ... }
func MarshalFunc[T any](fn func(T) ([]byte, error)) *Marshalers
func MarshalToFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Encoder, T) error) *Marshalers

func WithUnmarshalers(*Unmarshalers) Options

type Unmarshalers struct { ... }
func UnmarshalFunc[T any](fn func([]byte, T) error) *Unmarshalers
func UnmarshalFromFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Decoder, T) error) *Unmarshalers
</code></pre>
<p><a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalFunc"><code>MarshalFunc</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalToFunc"><code>MarshalToFunc</code></a>
construct a custom marshaler that can be passed to a <code>Marshal</code> call
using <code>WithMarshalers</code> to override the marshaling of particular types.
Similarly,
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalFunc"><code>UnmarshalFunc</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalFromFunc"><code>UnmarshalFromFunc</code></a>
support similar customization for <code>Unmarshal</code>.</p>
<p><a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-ProtoJSON">The <code>ProtoJSON</code> example</a>
demonstrates how this feature allows serialization of all
<a href="/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Message"><code>proto.Message</code></a> types
to be handled by the <a href="/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"><code>protojson</code></a> package.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-differences">Behavior differences</h3>
<p>While <code>v2</code> aims to behave <em>mostly</em> the same as <code>v1</code>,
its behavior has changed <a href="/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">in some ways</a>
to address problems in <code>v1</code>, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error if a JSON object contains a duplicate name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> marshals a nil Go slice or Go map as an empty JSON array or JSON object, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> unmarshals a JSON object into a Go struct using a
case-sensitive match from the JSON member name to the Go field name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> redefines the <code>omitempty</code> tag option to omit a field if it would have
encoded as an &ldquo;empty&rdquo; JSON value (which are <code>null</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>[]</code>, and <code>{}</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error when trying to serialize a <code>time.Duration</code>,
which currently has <a href="/issue/71631">no default representation</a>,
but provides options to let the caller decide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For most behavior changes, there is a struct tag option or caller-specified option
that can configure the behavior to operate under <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics,
or even other caller-determined behavior.
See <a href="/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">&ldquo;Migrating to v2&rdquo;</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="performance-optimizations">Performance optimizations</h3>
<p>The <code>Marshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is roughly at parity with <code>v1</code>.
Sometimes it is slightly faster, but other times it is slightly slower.
The <code>Unmarshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is significantly faster than <code>v1</code>,
with benchmarks demonstrating improvements of up to 10x.</p>
<p>In order to obtain greater performance gains,
existing implementations of
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> should
migrate to also implement
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a>,
so that they can benefit from processing JSON in a purely streaming manner.
For example, recursive parsing of OpenAPI specifications in <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> methods
significantly hurt performance in a particular service of Kubernetes
(see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi/issues/315" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes/kube-openapi#315</a>),
while switching to <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> improved performance by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>For more information, see the
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/jsonbench" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>go-json-experiment/jsonbench</code></a>
repository.</p>
<h2 id="retroactively-improving-encodingjson">Retroactively improving <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>We want to avoid two separate JSON implementations in the Go standard library,
so it is critical that, under the hood, <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gradual migration</strong>: The <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions in <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>
represent a set of default behaviors that operate according to <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics.
Options can be specified that configure <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> to operate with
entirely <code>v1</code>, mostly <code>v1</code> with a some <code>v2</code>, a mix of <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>,
mostly <code>v2</code> with some <code>v1</code>, or entirely <code>v2</code> semantics.
This allows for gradual migration between the default behaviors of the two versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature inheritance</strong>: As backward-compatible features are added to <code>v2</code>,
they will inherently be made available in <code>v1</code>. For example, <code>v2</code> adds
support for several new struct tag options such as <code>inline</code> or <code>format</code> and also
support for the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods,
which are both more performant and flexible.
When <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>, it will inherit support for these features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced maintenance</strong>: Maintenance of a widely used package demands significant effort.
By having <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> use the same implementation, the maintenance burden is reduced.
In general, a single change will fix bugs, improve performance, or add functionality to both versions.
There is no need to backport a <code>v2</code> change with an equivalent <code>v1</code> change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While select parts of <code>v1</code> may be deprecated over time (supposing <code>v2</code> graduates from being an experiment),
the package as a whole will never be deprecated.
Migrating to <code>v2</code> will be encouraged, but not required.
The Go project will not drop support for <code>v1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="experimenting-with-jsonv2">Experimenting with <code>jsonv2</code></h2>
<p>The newer API in the <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> packages are not visible by default.
To use them, build your code with <code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2</code> set in your environment or with the <code>goexperiment.jsonv2</code> build tag.
The nature of an experiment is that the API is unstable and may change in the future.
Though the API is unstable, the implementation is of a high quality and
has been successfully used in production by several major projects.</p>
<p>The fact that <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code> means that the underlying implementation of <code>v1</code>
is completely different when building under the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment.
Without changing any code, you should be able to run your tests
under <code>jsonv2</code> and theoretically nothing new should fail:</p>
<pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...
</code></pre>
<p>The re-implementation of <code>v1</code> in terms of <code>v2</code> aims to provide identical behavior
within the bounds of the <a href="/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>,
though some differences might be observable such as the exact wording of error messages.
We encourage you to run your tests under <code>jsonv2</code> and
report any regressions <a href="/issues">on the issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming an experiment in Go 1.25 is a significant milestone on the road to
formally adopting <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> into the standard library.
However, the purpose of the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment is to gain broader experience.
Your feedback will determine our next steps, and the outcome of this experiment,
which may result in anything from abandonment of the effort, to adoption as stable packages of Go 1.26.
Please share your experience on <a href="/issue/71497">go.dev/issue/71497</a>, and help determine the future of Go.</p>
