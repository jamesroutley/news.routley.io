    <h1>Ask HN: Difficulties with going back to school</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m 32, no degree, been working in software development for the last 8 years, and I want to go back to school for mechanical/electrical engineering.</p><p>The problem is, I can&#39;t find a way to make it work. To really commit to it I&#39;d have to do it in person and it would be hard to balance with a full time job and I would need to work to just pay for life. Otherwise, I could take an online only degree which would allow me to work but I know that bench time is really important. I&#39;m not sure how it would work with a fully online degree.</p><p>There&#39;s also the costs. I&#39;m having trouble finding programs under 80k, and coming out of it I would be starting at the bottom of the ladder not making as much. I do have an option to attend at my country of birth, in Eastern Europe, for much cheaper but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s easy to transfer that outside of the EU.</p><p>I just don&#39;t know how to make it work, if I can. I would at least like to have a degree of some sort, even if it&#39;s computer science (easier online) but it&#39;s still an expensive one. I don&#39;t have anyone that can really give me great advice on this so I would appreciate any advice from you all.</p></div></div></div>
