That has led firms from Meta Platforms Inc <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/META.O" target="_blank">(META.O)</a> to Microsoft Corp <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O" target="_blank">(MSFT.O)</a> to shed thousands of jobs.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">&#34;Over the last few months we&#39;ve made a considerable effort to rein in costs, but it simply hasn&#39;t been enough,&#34; Chief Executive Daniel Elk said in a blog post announcing the roughly 600 job cuts.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">&#34;I was too ambitious in investing ahead of our revenue growth,&#34; he added, echoing a sentiment voiced by other tech bosses in recent months.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Spotify&#39;s operating expenditure grew at twice the speed of its revenue last year as the audio-streaming company aggressively poured money into its podcast business, which is more attractive for advertisers due to higher engagement levels.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">At the same time, businesses pulled back on ad spending on the platform, mirroring a trend seen at Meta and Google parent Alphabet Inc <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O" target="_blank">(GOOGL.O)</a>, as rapid interest rate hikes and the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war pressured the economy.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The company, whose shares rose more than 3% in premarket trading, is now restructuring itself in a bid to cut costs and adjust to the deteriorating economic picture.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">It said Dawn Ostroff, the head of content and advertising, was leaving after an over four-year stint at the company. Ostroff helped shape Spotify&#39;s podcast business and guided it through backlash around Joe Rogan&#39;s show for allegedly spreading misinformation about COVID-19.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The company said it is appointing Alex Norström, head of the freemium business, and research and development boss Gustav Söderström as co-presidents.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Spotify had about 9,800 full-time employees as of Sept. 30.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">($1 = 0.9196 euros)</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Shailesh Kuber</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
