Originally, it was just for a Dell OptiPlex desktop (if I remember correctly), and it abused a bug in the ME firmware to allow for arbitrary code execution (which allows one to disable Intel Boot Guard, therefore allowing <code>me_cleaner</code> and coreboot).</p><p>He ported it to the T480 after a little rewrite a few days ago, which is why he got this working (this was my genuine reaction I posted to my friends):</p><p><img src="https://ezntek.com/img/lb_t480/genuinereaction.jpg" alt="my geniune reaction to that information" width="70%"/></p><p>However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/libreboot/comments/1h4e8ym/comment/m007p56/">this commenter</a> revealed that it was already in the libreboot tree, only after a day or two.

To write the ISO to a USB, you must extract the El Torito image within the ISO, as it is not a hybrid ISO that can be <code>dd</code>ed to a USB stick.</p><p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/rainer042/geteltorito">this link</a> and fetch the <code>geteltorito.pl</code> script, and save it somewhere on your computer.

It complained about missing vendor files such as the ME. maybe I had to extract it with <code>ifdtool</code>?</p><p>…so I ran <code>ifdtool --platform sklkbl -x wherever/the/bios/was.bin</code></p><p>and copied <code>flashregion_2_intel_me.bin</code> to vendorfiles/t480. But then it gave me a new error.</p><p><img src="https://ezntek.com/img/lb_t480/error2.jpg" alt="the new error" width="70%"/></p><p>(sorry for not having a proper text log for it, I couldn’t find the pastebin paste I had it on :/)</p><p>The ME region was too big. At this point, I was completely confused and dumbfounded; which is why I took to IRC.</p><p><em><strong>NOTE: go <a href="#back-to-compiling-libreboot">here</a> to skip my encounters on IRC</strong></em></p><h2 id="libreboot-on-liberachat-oh-dear"><code>#libreboot</code> on libera.chat: oh dear</h2><p>On the libreboot website, they recommended people to come to <code>#libreboot</code> on IRC for help…which is what I did. FYI, I almost never use IRC (although I am planning to become more active on IRC networks).</p><p>I expected at least a slightly nice greeting from the IRC people, but that was when I found out that these people are RTFMers. Mad respect for that, but I already read the manual(s) back to back for each applicable thing, and I was sure I knew what I was doing.</p><p>Here were the things they told me:</p><ol><li>RTFM (but I already did!)</li><li>Install dependencies (but I already installed them!)</li><li>Install dependencies again (but I just did a full system update?)</li></ol><p>I think at that point, everyone was clueless. I could tell that <code>fuel</code> (a mod) was a bit clueless and started asking <code>leah</code>. They did eventually discover that I used artix and not arch, and they immediately denied further assistance (expected, they are 2 different distros, arch supported and artix not).</p><p>But I was still skeptical. Those distros literally share the same repo (at least I made it do so), and I have successfully used <code>lbmk</code> on artix once or twice before. Still, no luck.</p><h3 id="psa">PSA</h3><p>Don’t paste raw output on IRC! horrible idea, you will get people barking at you. I did not know, but they could have reminded me a little better (because I am not an IRC user!!)</p><p>Just use pastebin</p><h3 id="back-to-irc-shenanigans">Back to IRC shenanigans</h3><p>They began telling me to try it on debian. I said that I did not want to and I was certain that my distro was not the problem. They insisted. Alright, I would try on debian sid. No luck! I got missing candidate errors (my favorite!).</p><p>I then started bargaining, which really does make sense in this case. Sure, it is an unsupported distro, but why are the dependencies causing <code>me.bin</code> to not be present? the typical process for obtaining any ME dump would be</p><ol><li>somehow get an official BIOS image (in this case, download</li><li>chop the rom up to extract the binary</li><li>copy it to <code>vendorfiles/t480</code></li></ol><p>Why would the dependencies (like GCC libraries and other coreboot dependencies) matter? The process would literally just be</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>curl -fL -o bios.bin https://some.shady/link
magicalextractionutility -o me.bin bios.bin
cp me.bin vendorfiles/t480
</code></pre><p>I suspected that the magical extraction utility would be bundled with coreboot. They did say no, however (which is true, but one utility that is used, <code>innoextract</code> was in the dependencies).</p><p>They then told me void was a supported distro, so I tried it again. <strong>Same error</strong>.</p><p>at that point, even leah became confused, so they decided it was a good idea to clone a fresh lbmk tree<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Turns out they made a commit that tried to do a shortcut to copy me.bin, but that didnt work! one local <code>git revert</code> later, it built!</p><h2 id="back-to-compiling-libreboot">Back to compiling libreboot</h2><p>Libreboot does not provide a MAC address for the Gigabit Ethernet (<code>gbe</code>) ROM, which means that you cannot have many librebooted machines on the same network. Therefore, it is advised to change it.</p><p><a href="https://libreboot.org/docs/install/nvmutil.html">Libreboot has documentation for this</a>.</p><p>This is the process:</p><ol><li>Have <code>ifdtool</code> and <code>nvmutil</code> compied somewhere</li><li><code>ifdtool --platform sklkbl -x libreboot.rom</code> to extract the gbe region</li><li><code>nvm flashregion_3_gbe.bin setmac aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff</code></li></ol><p>where <code>aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff</code>. I recommend you take the first 3 parts of the MAC address, but leave the rest as <code>??</code>, like so:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>nvm flashregion_3_gbe.bin setmac aa:bb:cc:??:??:??
</code></pre><p>To keep the correct network card vendor, but change the device specific address. I did not do this, but I will the next time I flash the computer.</p><h2 id="flash">Flash!</h2><p>This process will take a while, as flashrom does not tell you when it starts writing the flash chip. Run the following as root:</p><p><code>flashrom -p yourprogrammer -c &#34;your chip model&#34; -w your_libreboot_variant.rom</code></p><p>And make sure your chip clip is sat on the chip <strong>tightly!</strong> If the bottom of the clip appears to not have crimped the chip at the very bottom anymore, but has slid up and crimpeed the top, that means your clip is about to die, and you have to hold the chip clip in place after you put it on, and press down with force to make sure it does not fly off.</p><h2 id="usage-report">Usage report</h2><p>That is about as simple as librebooting gets.</p><p>In terms of using the T480 (for buyers who want to try it out):</p><ul><li><p>CPU performance is good. I recommend the <code>i5-8350U</code>, as it has the best CPU performance to price ratio, if buying used. It will be a large jump from a haswell/ivy bridge M series dual core i5 and a relatively good jump from a dual core i7.</p><ul><li>If you are using a quad-core i7 (MQ or QM series chip from Ivy Bridge/Haswell), the performance boost is not very noticeable and is marginal.</li></ul><p>Either way, power efficiency will skyrocket, as these are U series chips after all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Get 16GB of RAM</strong>: tihs is basically a given, make sure you have at least 16. 8 will bottleneck the CPU, and 32 is too much for ost tasks.</p></li><li><p>If youre lucky and get a T480 with the 2280 SSD bracket, you will see a boost in disk speeds, but if you only do tasks such as office work/programming, a normal SATA SSD will have an identical performance. If you want, you can put an <em><strong>M.2 A+E key 2242 SSD</strong></em> into the WWAN slot for extra storage.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>AVOID TN PANELS LIKE THE PLAGUE</strong></em>: If buying used and you are not planning to upgrade the panel, please avoid the TN panels, because they will make your T480 experience horrendous and near unbearable. I recommend the following panels if you upgrade it:</p><ul><li>NV140FHM-N61: <strong>no mounting brackets</strong>, has enough clearance and is 100%sRGB, 30pin eDP, non-touch, IGZO low power, 400 nit and is 1920x1080. Supports 60 and 48hz and is quite bright</li><li>N140HCG-GQ2/GR2: <strong>no mounting brackets</strong>, has enough clearance, 100%sRGB, 30pin eDP, non-touch, IGZO, has pretty damn bad backlight bleed, is 400 nit but quite dim, and is 1920x1080.</li><li>B140HAN01.0/.1/.2/.3: has mounting brackets, has enough clearance, and is 45%NTSC, 30pin eDP, non-touch, not low power, 250~300 nits and is 1920x1080. Colors are quite washed out and is okay-bright. All “compatible” panels are acceptable, much better than a TN.</li></ul><p>you could go for more exotic options, like the NV140FHM-N62, or even 2/4k panels like the B140QAN02.0 (which I used, but swapped out, because it has clearance issues and creates 2 bulges on the bezel. Colors are amazing though). Any panel higher than 1080p requires a 40 pin cable; and swapping the cable out is quite painful as you have to disassemble the hinge.</p></li><li><p>Do the glass trackpad mod if you like using the trackpad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure you have the internal battery!</strong> the PowerBridge system is extremely useful, and even if you do not intend to hotswap batteries, the extra mileage you get is quite important at times. I have a 72wH (in reality, 68 due to it being aftermarket) external 6 cell and an internal 24wH 3 cell, which gives me 9 total cells around ~90wH. My T480 did not even come with an internal battery because Lenovo did not ship these batteries in colder countries due to <em>chemistry™ reasons</em>.</p></li></ul><p>For daily tasks, the T480 smashes all of them, and most definitely can handle video editing, even with just the iGPU. Speaking of which, it gets over 80fps on 22 ren/22 sim chunks medium settings with sodium in a Minecraft Singleplayer world. It is portable, quite light, definitely 1-handable and is a great daily driver.</p><p>The keyboard does only have ~1.8-2mm of travel, which is unlike the classic keyboards and first gen island keyboards on Ivy Bridge ThinkPadswhich have anywhere between 2 and 2.3mm of travel. There are 3 T480 keyboard manufacturers:</p><ul><li>LiteOn (FRU 01HX459 for backlit): This one has the snappiest keyfeel, relatively short travel and slightly MacBook keyboard like, but still very comfortable to type on. The bottom-out is quite harsh.</li><li>Chicony (FRU 01HX419 for backlit): This one is soft but not too soft, has a shorter tactile peak that is more drawn out, and is not that heavy. Travel is definitely deeper than the LiteOn but still with a hard bottom-out.</li><li>Darfon (FRU 01HX449 for backlit): This one is the worst, mushy, not very tactile and keytravel is not that long either. I definitely do not recommend this one, either go with Chicony if you want the more balanced option or LiteOn if you want a snappier keyfeel.</li></ul><p>I personally use the LiteOn and have used the chicony, and do prefer the LiteOn simply because of the tactile bump. If you have ever tried to do the classic keyboard mod, LiteOn is the equivalent to the NMB keyboards, the best-regarded within the community; and LiteOn and NMB are related (I think one bought the other, or one NMB used LiteOn switches in their classic keyboards, because apart from the keytravel, they feel very similar).</p><h2 id="some-libreboot-quirks">Some libreboot quirks</h2><ul><li><p><em><strong><code>thinkpad_acpi</code> does not load correctly, just like on haswell ThinkPads</strong></em>.

Else, you do not get temperature monitoring and fan control.</p></li><li><p>As per the <a href="https://libreboot.org/docs/install/t480.html">T480 libreboot page</a>, thunderbolt does not work as of now, and the brightness keys do not register keysyms within Linux. The settings, bluetooth, kekyboard and star keys on top of F9-F12 register a <code>NoSymbol</code> keysym within <code>wev</code>.</p></li><li><p>Suspend works as expected.</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth is slightly wonky, as it does not automatically turn on, at least for Void Linux; despite the service being enabled. Sometimes I have to restart the bluetooth service (with <code>doas sv restart bluetoothd</code>) to get things to work. Auto-pairing also does not work.</p></li><li><p>The installation process is far easier than compiling a custom coreboot payload (duh)</p></li><li><p><em><strong>leah added support for UEFI through U-boot</strong></em>, which means that you can do an EFI install of linux (I still use good-ol’ BIOS boot).</p></li></ul></div></article></div></div>
