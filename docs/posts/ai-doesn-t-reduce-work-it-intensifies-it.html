<p><strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it">AI Doesn’t Reduce Work—It Intensifies It</a></strong> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945755" title="Hacker News">via</a>) Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye from Berkeley Haas School of Business report initial findings in the HBR from their April to December 2025 study of 200 employees at a &#34;U.S.-based technology company&#34;.</p>
<p>This captures an effect I&#39;ve been observing in my own work with LLMs: the productivity boost these things can provide is <em>exhausting</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI introduced a new rhythm in which workers managed several active threads at once: manually writing code while AI generated an alternative version, running multiple agents in parallel, or reviving long-deferred tasks because AI could “handle them” in the background. They did this, in part, because they felt they had a “partner” that could help them move through their workload.</p>
<p>While this sense of having a “partner” enabled a feeling of momentum, the reality was a continual switching of attention, frequent checking of AI outputs, and a growing number of open tasks. This created cognitive load and a sense of always juggling, even as the work felt productive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m frequently finding myself with work on two or three projects running parallel. I can get <em>so much done</em>, but after just an hour or two my mental energy for the day feels almost entirely depleted.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had conversations with people recently who are losing sleep because they&#39;re finding building yet another feature with &#34;just one more prompt&#34; irresistible.</p>
<p>The HBR piece calls for organizations to build an &#34;AI practice&#34; that structures how AI is used to help avoid burnout and counter effects that &#34;make it harder for organizations to distinguish genuine productivity gains from unsustainable intensity&#34;.</p>
<p>I think we&#39;ve just disrupted decades of existing intuition about sustainable working practices. It&#39;s going to take a while and some discipline to find a good new balance.</p>
