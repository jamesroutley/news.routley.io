              </figcaption></figure><p>Harvard said it received 5% fewer undergraduate applications this year compared with a year earlier, a dip that follows a tumultuous year for the Ivy League school that included the <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/claudine-gay-former-harvard-president-new-york-times-op-ed/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">resignation of President Claudine Gay</a></span> and a backlash over <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antisemitism-campus-harvard-pennsylvania-mit-presidents-testify-congress/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">antisemitic incidents</a></span> on the campus.</p><p>The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school received 54,008 applications for the class of 2028, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/29/harvard-class-of-2028-regular-decision/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according</a> to the Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper. The undergraduate college at Harvard University accepted 1,245 of those applicants, giving the incoming freshman class an acceptance rate of 3.59% — the highest admission rate in four years, the publication noted.</p><p>The decline at Harvard stands in contrast to rising student applications at other Ivy League establishments, with Yale&#39;s admission pool <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2024/03/28/yale-admits-3-7-percent-of-applicants-lowest-acceptance-rate-ever/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">jumping</a> 10% and Columbia University <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/03/28/columbia-admits-2319-students-to-class-of-2028-acceptance-rate-drops-slightly-to-385-percent/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reporting</a> an increase of 5.4%. Because of their larger applicant pool, Yale said its 3.7% acceptance rate was its lowest ever, while Columbia&#39;s admission rate narrowed to 3.85% from 3.9% a year ago. </p>    
  <p>Harvard has drawn ferocious public criticism over the past year, including from some alumni and major donors, over its handling of antisemitic incidents tied to the <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/israel-gaza-conflict/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Israel-Hamas war</a></span>. At the same time, the dip in applications comes after Harvard <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-college-admissions-harvard-north-carolina/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">lost a Supreme Court case</a></span> over using race-conscious admissions policies, a ruling that has affected college admissions policies after effectively ending affirmative action in higher education. </p><p>The university didn&#39;t release data on race and ethnicity for its incoming class, data that it has provided in previous years, the Harvard Crimson noted. </p><figure><div>

<p>Although Harvard&#39;s acceptance rate is its highest in four years, the college remains one of the most competitive universities in the U.S. Some wealthy families are now <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/college-acceptance-ivy-league-750000-consultant/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">paying consultants as much as $750,000</a></span> to prepare their children for college admissions, hoping that the extra expense will pay off with an acceptance letter to a top-ranked university.</p><p>There&#39;s some evidence that a bachelor&#39;s degree from a competitive college can boost a person&#39;s lifetime earnings. Graduates of Ivy League and other elite institutions are 60% more likely to have incomes among the top 1% compared with those who didn&#39;t attend those colleges, Harvard economists <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ivy-league-acceptance-rate-higher-for-wealthy-lowest-for-middle-class/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">found</a></span> in a 2023 study.</p>
