        <p>Do you ever look at knitted items and liken them to dragon scales? - I do.  So when I decided to make generative textured hats it made sense to call them Wyrm Beans.</p><p>Just as we can have generative pixel colors on a screen, we can have generative textures in a hat. We can use the power of randomness to create lacy patterns. Knitting is really just executing code.</p><p>If you knit, patterns are at <a href="https://www.wyrmbean.com/?ref=fractalkitty.com">wyrmbean.com</a>. There you will be able to randomize and download a knitting pattern. Knit at your own risk - these patterns are experimental. I&#39;d love to see pictures if you make one. </p><p>This is a project I&#39;ve been working on while in a batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/?ref=fractalkitty.com">Recurse Center (RC).</a></p><p>Below are some of the knitty-gritty details (pun intended). </p><h2 id="test-beans">Test Beans:</h2><p>The first (plum) needed some editing to make the pattern more general. The second 2 worked well without edits.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/01/ht1.jpg" width="603" height="691" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/ht1.jpg 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/01/ht1.jpg 603w"/></p><p><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/01/B9A35D3D-73CD-4793-AE80-14EC3D083384_4_5005_c.jpeg" width="360" height="480" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><p><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/01/IMG_5068.jpg" width="2000" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/IMG_5068.jpg 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/IMG_5068.jpg 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/IMG_5068.jpg 1600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/01/IMG_5068.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2><p>The prototype and testing was all done in <a href="https://codepen.io/fractalkitty/pen/gbYvxgQ?ref=fractalkitty.com" rel="noreferrer">p5js</a>.
