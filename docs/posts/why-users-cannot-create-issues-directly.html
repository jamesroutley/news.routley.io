    <h1>Why users cannot create Issues directly</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="issue-body-viewer" data-testid="issue-body-viewer"><div data-testid="markdown-body" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false"><div><p dir="auto">Users are not allowed to create Issues directly in this repository - we ask that you create a <a href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions">Discussion</a> first.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike some other projects, Ghostty <strong>does not use the issue tracker for discussion or feature requests</strong>. Instead, we use GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions">discussions</a> for that. Once a discussion reaches a point where a well-understood, actionable item is identified, it is moved to the issue tracker. <strong>This pattern makes it easier for maintainers or contributors to find issues to work on since <em>every issue</em> is ready to be worked on.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This approach is based on years of experience maintaining open source projects and observing that 80-90% of what users think are bugs are either misunderstandings, environmental problems, or configuration errors by the users themselves. For what&#39;s left, the majority are often feature requests (unimplemented features) and not bugs (malfunctioning features). Of the features requests, almost all are underspecified and require more guidance by a maintainer to be worked on.</p>
<p dir="auto">Any Discussion which clearly identifies a problem in Ghostty and can be confirmed or reproduced will be converted to an Issue by a maintainer, so as a user finding a valid problem you don&#39;t do any extra work anyway. Thank you.</p>
