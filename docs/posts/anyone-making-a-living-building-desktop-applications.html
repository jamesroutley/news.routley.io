    <h1>Ask HN: Anyone making a living building desktop applications?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I did ask the same question in 2016 [1] and got some really interesting answers.<p>I&#39;m still chasing the dream of having a side-business and earning some side money, but with web apps it means mostly SaaS. Personally I hate rent-seeking behaviors (I&#39;m not alone, it seems - &#34;Tell HN: A Conversation Needs to Be Had over Subscription Software&#34; [2]), so I&#39;m trying to know what people are doing regarding desktop apps.</p><p>Are people still building desktop apps? More specifically, can you make a living (or earn some side money) in 2022 by selling a desktop app?
Please share it with us, or are we doomed to build web apps and SaaS for the foreseeable future?</p><p>[1] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11658873" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11658873</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30021404" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30021404</a></p></div></div>
