<p><span>20 Oct 2023</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>PDF Portfolio files! PDF is already such a tangled spaghetti mess of a format, and this format is just taking a whole bunch of them and making them into a mega-pasta dish.</p>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/overview-pdf-portfolios.html">overview</a></p>

<p>And Flash is required to make these files! Or at least some of the time!</p>

<p>I won’t be attempting it but seems like it could be fun to try?</p>

<p>Just some statements I find terror-inducing:</p>

<p>“There are 2 different file formats for adobe portfolios. The old format used Adobe Flash technology. The new format doesn’t use this technology.” (<a href="https://www.dot.nd.gov/manuals/design/caddmanual/UG_Meetings/Adobe_Portfolio_Guide_DC1.pdf">ref</a>)</p>

<p>“You can convert multimedia files, such as MP3 to PDF within a PDF Portfolio. You can also convert these files to PDF if they are encoded in H.264 (with AAC audio): MOV, M4V, MP4, 3GP, and 3G2.” (<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-customize-pdf-portfolios.html">ref</a>)</p>

<p>“Always saves as a PDF Portfolio do not want this “ (<a href="https://acrobat.uservoice.com/forums/590923-acrobat-for-windows-and-mac/suggestions/33719989-always-saves-as-a-pdf-portfolio-do-not-want-this">ref</a>)</p>

<p>If you were me, would you consider a PDF Portfolio to be unitary or a container-wrapper format (based on the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/intro/GDFR-Classification-1_0_5.pdf">GDFR classification guidelines here</a>)? I’m going with existing practice to keep things consistent, but it’s a complicated question for a complicated format.</p>
