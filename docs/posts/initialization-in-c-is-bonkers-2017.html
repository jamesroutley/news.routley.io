<p>The answer is that <code>a.a</code> is <code>0</code> and <code>b.b</code> is indeterminate, so reading it is undefined behaviour. Why? Because initialization in C++ is bonkers.</p>

<h4 id="default--value--and-zero-initialization">Default-, value-, and zero-initialization</h4>

<p>Before we get into the details which cause this, I’ll introduce the concepts of default-, value- and zero-initialization. Feel free to skip this section if you’re already familiar with these.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>T</span> <span>global</span><span>;</span>       <span>//zero-initialization, then default-initialization</span>

<span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>T</span><span>{};</span>     <span>//value-initialization (C++11)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span> <span>T</span> <span>t</span><span>;</span> <span>A</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>t</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span> <span>};</span> <span>//t is value-initialized</span>

<p>The rules for these different initialization forms are fairly complex, so I’ll give a simplified outline of the C++11 rules (C++14 even changed some of them, so those value-initialization forms can be aggregate initialization). If you want to understand all the details of these forms, check out the relevant cppreference.com articles<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, or see the standards quotes at the bottom of the article.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>default-initialization</strong> – If <code>T</code> is a class, the default constructor is called; if it’s an array, each element is default-initialized; otherwise, no initialization is done, resulting in indeterminate values.</li>
  <li><strong>value-initialization</strong> – If <code>T</code> is a class, the object is default-initialized (after being zero-initialized if <code>T</code>’s default constructor is not user-provided/deleted); if it’s an array, each element is value-initialized; otherwise, the object is zero-initialized.</li>
  <li><strong>zero-initialization</strong> – Applied to static and thread-local variables before any other initialization. If <code>T</code> is scalar (arithmetic, pointer, enum), it is initialized from <code>0</code>; if it’s a class type, all base classes and data members are zero-initialized; if it’s an array, each element is zero-initialized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking the simple example of <code>int</code> as <code>T</code>, <code>global</code> and all of the value-initialized variables will have the value <code>0</code>, and all other variables will have an indeterminate value. Reading these indeterminate values results in undefined behaviour.</p>

<hr/>

<h4 id="back-to-our-original-example">Back to our original example</h4>

<p>Now we have the necessary knowledge to understand what’s going on in my original example. Essentially, the behaviours of <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are changed by the different location of <code>=default</code> on their constructors. Again, the relevant standards passages are down at the bottom of the page if you want them, but the jist is this:</p>

<p>Since the constructor for <code>foo</code> is defaulted on its first declaration, it is not technically <em>user-provided</em> – I’ll explain what this term means shortly, just accept this standardese for now. The constructor for <code>bar</code>, conversely, is only defaulted at its definition, so it <em>is</em> user-provided. Put another way, if you don’t want your constructor to be user-provided, be sure to write <code>=default</code> when you declare it rather than define it like that elsewhere. This rule makes sense when you think about it: without having access to the definition of a constructor, a translation unit can’t know if it is going to be a simple compiler-generated one, or if it’s going to send a telegram to the Moon to retrieve some data and block until it gets a response.</p>

<p>The default constructor being user-provided has a few consequences for the class type. For example, you can’t default-initialize a const-qualified object if it lacks a user-provided constructor, the notion being that if the object should only be set once, it better be initialised with something reasonable:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>my_int</span><span>;</span>            <span>//ill-formed, no user-provided constructor</span>
<span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>my_string</span><span>;</span> <span>//well-formed, has a user-provided constructor</span>

<span>const</span> <span>foo</span> <span>my_foo</span><span>;</span> <span>//ill-formed, no user-provided constructor</span>
<span>const</span> <span>bar</span> <span>my_bar</span><span>;</span> <span>//well-formed, has a user-provided constructor</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, in order to be <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/TrivialType">trivial</a> (and therefore <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/PODType">POD</a>) or an <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization">aggregate</a>, a class must have no user-provided constructors. Don’t worry if you don’t know those terms, it suffices to know that whether your constructors are user-provided or not modifies some of the restrictions of what you can do with that class and how it acts.</p>

<p>For our first example, however, we’re interested in how user-provided constructors interact with initialization rules. The language mandates that both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are value-initialized, but only <code>a</code> is additionally zero-initialized. Zero-initialization for <code>a</code> gives <code>a.a</code> the value <code>0</code>, whereas <code>b.b</code> is not initialized at all, giving us undefined behaviour if we attempt to read it. This is a very subtle distinction which has inadvertently changed our program from executing safely to summoning nasal demons/eating your cat/ordering pizza/your favourite undefined behaviour metaphor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s a simple solution. At the risk of repeating advice which has been given many times before, <strong>initialize your variables.</strong></p>

<p><b>Seriously.</b></p>

<p><b>Do it.</b></p>

<p><b>INITIALIZE YOUR GORRAM VARIABLES.</b></p>

<p>If the designer of <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> decides that they should be default constructible, they should initialize their contents with some sensible values. If they decide that they should <em>not</em> be default constructible, they should delete the constructors to avoid issues.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>a</span><span>{</span><span>0</span><span>}</span> <span>{}</span> <span>//initialize to 0 explicitly</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>bar</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> <span>delete</span><span>;</span> <span>//delete constructor</span>
    <span>//insert non-default constructor which does something sensible here</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Internalising this way of thinking about initialization is key to writing unsurprising code. If you’ve profiled your code and found a bottleneck caused by unnecessary initialization, then sure, optimise it, but you best be certain that the extra performance is worth the possible headaches and money spent to keep the code safe.</p>

<p>If you still aren’t convinced that C++ initialization rules are crazy-complex, take a minute to think of all the forms of initialization you can think of. My answers after the line.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Done? How many did you come up with? In perusal of the standard, I counted <em>eighteen</em> different forms of initialization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Here they are with a short example/description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>default: <code>int i;</code></li>
  <li>value: <code>int i{};</code></li>
  <li>zero: <code>static int i;</code></li>
  <li>constant: <code>static int i = some_constexpr_function();</code></li>
  <li>static: zero- or constant-initialization</li>
  <li>dynamic: not static initialization</li>
  <li>unordered: dynamic initialization of class template static data members which are not explicitly specialized</li>
  <li>ordered: dynamic initialization of other non-local variables with static storage duration</li>
  <li>non-trivial: when a class or aggregate is initialized by a non-trivial constructor</li>
  <li>direct: <code>int i{42}; int j(42);</code></li>
  <li>copy: <code>int i = 42;</code></li>
  <li>copy-list: <code>int i = {42};</code></li>
  <li>direct-list: <code>int i{42};</code></li>
  <li>list: either copy-list or direct-list</li>
  <li>aggregate: <code>int is[3] = {0,1,2};</code></li>
  <li>reference: <code>const int&amp; i = 42; auto&amp;&amp; j = 42;</code></li>
  <li>implicit: default or value</li>
  <li>explicit: direct, copy, or list</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t try to memorise all of these rules; therein lies madness. Just be careful, and keep in mind that C++’s initialization rules are there to pounce on you when you least expect it. Explicitly initialize your variables, and if you ever fall in to the trap of thinking C++ is a sane language, remember this:</p>

<p><strong>In C++, you can give your program undefined behaviour by changing the point at which you tell the compiler to generate something it was probably going to generate for you anyway.</strong></p>
