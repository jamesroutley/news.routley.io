<p>Ricardo Prada Vásquez, a Venezuelan man whose family says <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/venezuela-immigrant-disappear-deport-ice.html?ref=404media.co"><u>he was “disappeared”</u></a> and who wasn’t included on a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuelans-deported-el-salvador-names/?ref=404media.co"><u>previously leaked government list of people</u></a> sent to a notorious mega prison in El Salvador, was included on a private airline’s flight manifest to the country, according to hacked airline data obtained and analyzed by 404 Media. </p><p>That means a private charter flight company might have more accurate information on where people are being deported than the government, experts say, and raises questions about the process being used to deport people. </p><p>While the government initially declined to say where Prada had been sent before <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1914776912150380560?ref=404media.co"><u>eventually admitting he was sent to El Salvador</u></a>, the man was on a manifest for a March 15 flight held by GlobalX, one of ICE’s primary charter companies. The news also raises questions about whether other people whose families are unaware of their whereabouts may be in El Salvador too. </p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know the name of anyone else who has been deported but their whereabouts are unknown?

One is they clearly did not take enough care in this to even make sure they had the right lists of who they were removing, and who they were not sending to a prison that is a black hole in El Salvador,” Michelle Brané, executive director of Together and Free, a group that has been working with families of deported people, including Prada’s, told 404 Media. “They weren&#39;t even keeping accurate records of who they were sending there. What that says about how much due process or how much accuracy there is in the rest of the assessments of whether these people should be on those planes at all follows very closely behind that.”</p>
