    <h1>Ball: A ball that lives in your dock</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nate-parrott/ball/blob/main/Recording.gif"><img src="https://github.com/nate-parrott/ball/raw/main/Recording.gif" alt="Screen recording of a ball bouncing" data-animated-image=""/></a></p>

<p dir="auto">It&#39;s a little ball that lives in your dock. You can drag it and it&#39;ll bounce around the screen. You can also swipe on it with two fingers. It comes in red. You can flick it, bounce it, try to make it hit the corner, see how many times it can bounce, count how many times it hits the wall, and more. It&#39;s a ball. It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s a ball.</p>

<p dir="auto">It&#39;s inspired by <a href="https://heagy.com/" rel="nofollow">Nate Heagy&#39;s</a> widget for the OS X Dashboard, which I remember fondly because someone put it on our class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMac" rel="nofollow">eMac</a> in fifth grade. It was a lot bouncier and come in more colors, but it didn&#39;t go in the dock!</p>
<p dir="auto">Credit also goes to Wessley Roche, who made this <a href="https://gist.github.com/wonderbit/c8896ff429a858021a7623f312dcdbf9">little Gist</a> explaining how to get the position of the dock. I&#39;ve <a href="https://github.com/nate-parrott/ball/blob/main/Ball/DockUtils.swift#L65">extended this</a> to try to estimate the position of the app&#39;s dock icon when it&#39;s clicked, so the ball can animate out of it.</p>

<p dir="auto">I hope you enjoy this little ball.</p>
