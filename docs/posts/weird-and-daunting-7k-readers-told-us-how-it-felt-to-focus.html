    <h1>&#39;Weird and Daunting&#39;: 7k Readers Told Us How It Felt to Focus</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div><div><p>Last week we asked readers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/20/upshot/attention-experiment.html" title="">spend 10 minutes with a painting</a>. No distractions, no notifications — just a full 10 minutes of attention.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people tried the experiment. Here’s a look at how many people started and when they dropped off. (We included only people who started the timer, not those who quit before.)</p></div></div><div><p>You might think of this chart as the shape of attention. After clicking to start, thousands rapidly exited, some immediately, some after a minute or two. But if you could make it past three minutes, you were more likely to finish than to give up. And once you hit five minutes, your odds of completing the exercise were very high. A quarter who started made it to the 10-minute mark.</p></div><div><div><p>We also asked readers to tell us how they felt. More than 7,000 responded. Many told us they found the first few seconds or minutes pointless and even excruciating, and the last few minutes delightful, or serene.</p><blockquote><p>“I definitely felt uncomfortable at first and wanted to quit between two and three minutes. But some time after that, I felt safe and focused, as if my only worry in the world was to stare at that painting; that was the only thing in that moment I was made for.”</p></blockquote><p>Some were unexpectedly moved by the experience. A few spoke of illness or death, long past or quite recent.</p><blockquote><p>“My husband of 64 years, who died in the fall, was legally blind. Every Sunday I would read Sebastian Smee’s deconstruction of an art work from The Washington Post to him. I would begin by describing the work. This is a fantastic system of seeing rather than looking. It’s spatial. There are relationships. There is light. There is the internal mood and the viewer’s mood; it produces reflection. (I could write an entire essay.) When I found myself reporting now and then on some aspect that Mr. Smee analyzed in the same way, there was an electric human connection. What I saw was truly there to see. I now look at all art in the same way: as if I were describing to someone who could not see it for themselves.”</p></blockquote><p>Many found deeper meaning the longer they lingered:</p><blockquote><p>“My 10 minutes felt revelatory and shaming at the same time. The longer I looked, the more I saw, and the questions that came were tantalizing rather than frustrating or perfunctory. The shame came from realizing how many beautiful works I have merely glanced at and dismissed the depth and thoughtfulness of the creator.”</p></blockquote><p>Not all finished, or felt they succeeded.</p><blockquote><p>“Honestly, I did lose focus and give up … but the article made me think about the value of these little moments that we so strongly avoid. What is it about being with our thoughts that scares us so much?”</p></blockquote><p>If you need a little guidance, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/d541eddd5e7e2b4a/72c55bb9-full.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here’s the three-hour original assignment</a> from <a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2013/10/the-power-of-patience" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jennifer Roberts</a> at Harvard, who helped us with this experiment.</p><p>A few readers thanked us for the “permission” to just look. But as Professor Roberts said, you can do this on your own with a tree or a rock, or other art — whenever you want.</p><hr/><p>Here’s a selection of several dozen comments from the responses that readers left. (If you sent one, thank you.)</p></div></div><div><section data-testid="inline-interactive" id="responses-block" data-id="100000009590792" data-source-id="100000009590792"><div data-sourceid="100000009590792" id="embed-id-100000009590792">

					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“At first I didn’t think I could do it. Around the three-minute mark I began to lose interest and my mind wanted to wander. I had to intentionally think of questions relating to the painting to keep my interest.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Magical. My absorption with the painting would have gone on longer but was interrupted by the Times alert that Biden has dropped out.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I began to imagine the people who lived within the scene, or around the waterway. What they were doing during this evening: Preparing for sleep? Venturing out? Tending to ill children? Making love? Preparing supper?”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Like being in the woods, hunting. Details come into focus as you scan.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“It felt a little like practicing walking meditation. I spent most of the time I devoted to this exercise imagining myself on the banks of the river in the painting.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I am Head of Education at the Yale Center for British Art and well aware of the difficulty some visitors may have spending time on one object. It is an exercise I have been using with medical students since 2002 to enhance their looking skills generally but specifically when working with patients.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Seeing myself really seeing the piece, I was reminded of Cameron staring at the Seurat in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” ... the emotion this exercise has the potential to untap.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“When the timer flashed up and said it had been three minutes, I couldn’t believe it. I felt a bit panicky. ‘What am I going to do for seven more minutes?!’ I started to ask myself how the painting made me feel, then I started to look for things I hadn’t noticed – changes in color, buildings. That’s when I noticed the ghostly shapes reversed at the bottom of the painting. I spent a long time trying to figure them out and just like that, 10 minutes had passed.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Might start every day this way”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Near the end, I entered a delicious state of revelation of the landscape, where the background became suddenly detailed, alive, three-dimensional, shifting from a Venice-like city to a seaside colliery.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I had the sense the light was changing, getting a touch lighter like a sunrise. I’m 65, and my vision isn’t great. Eye strain was about to kick in. Funny that while I did this exercise news alerts started to come in about President Biden exiting the race. Luckily I saw the first one before we started or I would have been distracted.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I was intrigued by the painting and acutely aware of my desire to have an answer as to what it was depicting.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“One way of ‘passing the time’ looking at it is to consciously reflect on how your reaction to it changes over time, from ‘horror’ to curiosity to analytical decomposition (pondering a detail), speculation to association; how it triggers memories of things seen and experienced, places been and the moods with it.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I’m a 71-year-old white man living on our farm in Alabama. I found this simple and delightful. Now I am resolved to repeat this exercise outside. (But in the morning, when it’s not dreadfully hot!)”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I was mesmerized by the use of whitish blue over red in both the sky and water. It reminded me of majolica pottery, tinted whitish colors over terra cotta clay. I also enjoyed looking at his brushstrokes going horizontally in the sky and water and vertically in the buildings.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I did once when at university (in 1968) spend a full three hours with “Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” at the request of my professor, Alan Kaprow, for a paper I was writing. That time to focus and deeply observe every detail of the painting) earned a reading aloud of my paper by Professor Kaprow to the entire lecture class.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I did it late at night; it was quiet, and I darkened the room. I went from top to bottom, as I’m sure others did, but when I came to the bottom third of the painting, I stayed with that, trying to figure out if I saw water plants or fishes swimming.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“This is a skill I knew I once possessed in my 20s but have long since lost. I am now in my late 50s, and have recently moved to Paris for my partner’s work. Overwhelmed with the experience of packing up one’s life to live in a foreign country, I found this exercise incredibly useful and oddly nostalgic. With this meditative exercise, you have helped me unlock the secret to slowing down, living in the moment and truly noticing the world around you.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“The first minute was the longest one. Then I started to take in the details and figuring out, correctly, that there was an industrial plant by a river. The lights flickered and the water was moving slowly.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I felt almost sad to stop looking at it. Like we had a connection, of sorts.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“The whole painting brightened a little by the end of my short time looking. By taking time, it changed for me. Or, I changed for it?”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“When I was about 5 or so — I’m in my late 60s now — we had one of those cast plaster plaques hung on my bedroom wall in Ireland. It had a mill, a stream, a horse-drawn cart, a winding road and a person leading the horse along. The plaster circle was about 20 centimeters in diameter, but to me it was a whole other world. ... It’s long, long gone but in my mind’s eye I can still see that road that took me to wonderful places. Stop and wonder, I’d highly recommend it.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“When I go to a museum and spend 10 or 15 minutes looking at one painting, it tends to make the museum guards nervous; I’ve been chased away from works of art at more than one museum here in Connecticut.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“11 minutes and 33 seconds is nothing. I’ve stood in front of certain artworks in Florence for much longer — Masaccio’s frescoes in the Carmine, for example, or del Sarto’s paintings in the Pitti Palace. I’ve stood in front of certain poems by Rilke, Housman, and Frost et al. for years on end.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“It felt good to stop and contemplate something, rather than the usual mindless scrolling.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I found it easier to spend time looking at the painting on my phone where I could zoom and scroll than if it were on a wall.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Settling my own disorganized thoughts was a challenge.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“At first there was some restlessness and thoughts of, ‘This will be boring.’ The longer I focused on this painting, the more I savored small details — even the edges of the canvas became interesting. Qualities of subtle color and shape emerged that were very satisfying.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I focused my attention on the buildings, which appeared to me to be ancient, like a pyramid. But then the posts looked industrial, so I was trying to reconcile those differences.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Had to push at the beginning. Be hardheaded. But the more I persisted the more I was to contemplate. And see the details. I’ve always liked the lights that reflect in the water at dusk. That helped. Also to fantasize that the buildings could be palaces or dismal abandoned industrial dwellings.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I enjoyed trying to puzzle out the subject matter of Whistler’s painting. An industrial site in England, or temples and ziggurats on the Ganges, or in Egypt? By the time 10 minutes had passed, I was still not sure what I was seeing.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Perhaps this is almost contrary to the exercise, in a way: I was constantly intrigued by what I would find in the next zoomed-in frame that I was perhaps feeding my brain’s need for change and stimulation.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“By the end of the 10 minutes, I was starting to see windows and doors in the original building. Was it my imagination or were they really there? So I was thrilled to see my imagination take off, and probably accomplish exactly what the artist wanted.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“This felt like an undoing as compared to doing.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I found the experiment a bit weird and daunting at first. But after a while, my breathing became calmer, and yes, my focus became everything, noticing little details in the painting and finding my mind quiet with questions.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Weird but then settling in felt very good ... unfortunately, I just got notified President Biden just dropped out of the race which made me drop the painting for live news. Frenetically returning to our country’s fraught future. Don’t think quiet contemplation is my future for a while, if ever again.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Long, then short, then long, then short. I was surprised that I began to FEEL the water moving, seeing the different shades of blue/gray.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I felt physically lightened — as if pressures inside my chest and brain were somehow equalized with the environment around me.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“After the first three minutes, I thought I would not be able to continue. I gave myself permission to spend the time doing this. At first I felt challenged, then relaxed and focused.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“While I still wouldn’t say I especially enjoyed Whistler’s work, spending more time with it did elicit familiar feelings of anticipation and unease associated with twilight that I would not have found it I had interacted with it naturally in a gallery; I likely would have passed it by.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I am a high school art history teacher, and would be interested in trying a modified version of this assignment with my students. With their Tik-Tok level attention spans, I think the act of close looking (even for a short period of time, like three minutes!) would benefit their focus-building skills.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I awoke at 1:12 after a very long day of battling Covid, a fever, stifling congestion and a cutting sore throat ...  I felt the artist had invited me to join him in seeking the deep treasures of passing time quietly and peacefully after a fitful day of illness.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“At first, ‘Oh, God.’ Then it became a kind of meditation, and I started settling into the details of painting to explore.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“As with meditation, I found my mind wandering. But was able to use the painting as an anchor to return my focus. Then I allowed my mind to actually wander for a bit and allowed myself to sit with emotions that came up. Would I like to go to this place and visit? Reminds me of West Virginia. Who would I go with? Do I want to share this painting with someone else?”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“It may be a reproduction, but I still enjoyed reflecting on the ambience, the ‘story,’ and the enigmas in this reproduction of the painting.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“A few months ago in the Musée d’Orsay, I found myself mesmerized by Van Gogh’s “Starry Night Over the Rhône.” Delighted with little details, my attention was fully captured, and it wasn’t until my husband put his arm around me that I realized I was back in the middle of a crowded museum and not standing on the banks in the French countryside on a quiet evening.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“It seemed like it would be painful to my adult ADHD brain. Actually, the time ended before I wished it to end.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Frenetic doesn’t cut it — we need to think. I was a professor, and my students always responded to my query of “I wonder...” with “We can Google it.” One day, I heard them tell a new student: “Don’t say Google it... wonder to her does not mean you need an answer!””
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Relaxing, peaceful, also little bursts of joy when I discovered something I hadn’t noticed in the first few minutes.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“Caught between the pages of a William Gass phantasmagoria.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I am 73 and grappling with how I spend the diminishing remainder of my time in this life. For me, this exercise was a reminder — but not really an epiphany — of the preciousness of my time. I take the stoic’s approach to seeking out and enjoying life. Certainly, slowing down, paying attention, and thinking about how I feel about Whistler’s painting was a familiar ‘habit’ I fall into whenever I’m hiking, or watching my grandkids play, or watering the rhododendrons.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I was surprised that the time went quickly. Spending 10 minutes, I saw things that I never would have noticed. I had to put my cat down yesterday, and this exercise helped!”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I lasted the 10 minutes and noticed that the picture became brighter as I watched, with more definition. It was as if the sun was slowly rising and illuminating the landscape.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I use this technique with my medical students to learn to pay attention to what they see and to actually see rather than just look at lab values and radiographs.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I knew an excellent instructor, Joanna Ziegler at the College of the Holy Cross, who had her students do a semester-long version of this exercise back in the early 2000s. The results were astounding! Students built a thoughtful real relationship to the painting based on their experiences.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“At first, irritation and anger at what was being asked. Then, identifying as a lover of art, determination to rise to the challenge. Finally, sheer delight upon noticing the second mirrored reflection.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I witnessed the speed with which my mind is operating these days.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“For some reason, it reminded me of my childhood and just whiling away a summer day examining a dandelion.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“After finding all the things of note, I started to feel sleepy. But right before I almost dozed off, I suddenly noticed the second (reversed!) reflection and jolted awake.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“The painting, while beautiful and complex, afforded me a 10-minute reprieve from mourning. A beloved member of my family was killed this evening. The shock and horror has allowed no diversion, until I began looking at this painting, and took a breath and then another.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“My mother went back to college in the early 70s as an Art History major at Vassar and would ‘drag’ my brothers and me to museums. To calm three unruly boys under the age of 12, she would have us look at a painting for a minute, turn our backs, and then try to describe the painting in as much detail as possible.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“It reminded me of an exercise, which my daughter gave to me some weeks ago, when she said: ‘Go to this park at your neighborhood, sit down at the tree which is close to the little brook and watch. Just sit and watch.’ I did it, and it was wonderful.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I would always say, ‘I could never devote that much time staring at a painting.’ But after doing this exercise, I now have the confidence that I can. ”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“At first, I thought it might be a riverside scene in Thailand, though I had no evidence that Whistler had ever been there.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I did the exercise for 10 minutes and 7 seconds. Afterwards, I sat and sipped my coffee without turning to my phone, thinking about what the future will bring.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“It was like getting into a too-hot tub. At first I resisted, but then I settled in and it felt nice.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“I felt this connection to the artist through his brushstrokes, a personal encounter made across centuries.”
					</p></div> </div><div><div><p>“The longer one looks at anything, the greater the possibility that the unexpected comes to you.”
					</p></div> </div> </div></div> </div>  </figure>
