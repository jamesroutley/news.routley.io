    <h1>How AI Killed Tailwind&#39;s Business - And How To Avoid a Similar Fate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>Tailwind CSS is a popular styling library. Its creator just cited AI as a major factor destroying their business and risking the future of the project.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what happened, how AI is killing their business, and what we can learn to avoid AIs undercutting our own businesses.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-tailwind">What is Tailwind?</h2>
<p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> is a popular styling library, getting <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss">~26M weekly downloads on npm</a>.</p>
<p>AIs are particularly good at using it because the styling happens inline / close to the underlying markup. This allows AIs to tweak these without needing to understand the whole app&#39;s styling / hierarchy into memory which would waste space in its context window that could be used for other things.</p>
<p>As such Tailwind is more popular than ever - which makes it so odd that it&#39;s now facing an existential crisis.</p>

<p>Adam Wathan, creator of Tailwind, <a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388#issuecomment-3717222957">denied a PR</a> saying they don&#39;t have the engineering capacity for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Views to docs down 40% from early 2023</li>
<li>Revenue is down 80%</li>
<li>Laid off 75% of engineers (from 4 to 1)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-did-ai-kill-tailwinds-business">How did AI kill Tailwind&#39;s business?</h2>
<p>From the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less people go to docs</li>
<li>Less people see the ads for Tailwind Plus (a UI templating package they sell)</li>
<li>Less people buy Tailwind Plus</li>
</ul>
<p>The leading hypotheses for this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AIs are good enough at Tailwind to not need the docs - So less people look it up, see the ads, and buy plus</li>
<li>AIs are good enough at UI to not need templates - AIs don&#39;t make the best UIs but they&#39;re usually pretty good looking and you can continue prompting it to get the look you want. So even those people that are seeing the template ads may not need them - they&#39;ll just prompt the AI to do it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-tailwind">What does this mean for Tailwind?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Development is slowing down - focused on ways to save the business / keep the project alive vs improving it</li>
<li>The library will likely stick around - It&#39;s one of the most popular styling libraries so even if the project loses support, the code itself will be available and it&#39;s probable another team will pick up to support it though probably in a less active role</li>
<li>Tailwind will need to find a new revenue source - Some companies are choosing to sponsor the library which may fill the gap somewhat</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-we-avoid-ai-killing-our-own-businesses">How can we avoid AI killing our own businesses?</h2>
<p>We first need to realize that AI is rapidly changing the ecosystem. People can now vibe code whole apps, papers, plans. So businesses need to provide value that AI cannot to stay alive.</p>
<p>Information based businesses must provide higher quality, more specialized information than AI can provide. AI is great at finding patterns so if the info you have can be gained by simply parsing several dozen projects then AI already knows about it. Your information must be better packaged, easier to understand, and/or provide information AI cannot if you want to be competitive.</p>
<p>Who this affcts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information content creators</strong> - whether it&#39;s Writers / course creators / YouTubers etc AI is starting to commoditize this - your content now needs to be better than the leading AI&#39;s generation.</li>
<li><strong>Boilerplate / template sellers</strong> - As with Tailwind Plus, templates must provide value an AI can&#39;t be prompted to provide. If someone can prompt it in an hour or two, why pay for your template?</li>
<li><strong>Small / simple software SaaS</strong> - If someone can prompt it in an hour or two, why pay for your SaaS?</li>
<li><strong>Manual computer work</strong> - assistants scheduling things, doing research, etc - AIs are getting increasingly good at this</li>
<li><strong>Coding vs engineering</strong> - AIs can code so if that&#39;s the only value you&#39;re providing, they&#39;ll just use AI</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>I&#39;m particularly interested in this area as I blog, YouTube, and build side projects (including <a href="https://cloudseed.xyz/">boilerplates</a> and <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-01_blogging-a-book-a-year">potentially books</a>) on the side. So seeing one of the biggest libraries get chopped up makes it more real that AI is rapidly changing the potential market of these things.</p>
<p>Not sure how to get around it but a pivot is probably in order - focusing on more software tools / domain expertise than shallow info products.</p>
