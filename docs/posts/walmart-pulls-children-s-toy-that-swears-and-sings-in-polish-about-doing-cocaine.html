            <p>TORONTO -- 
	An Ontario grandmother who bought an educational toy for her 15-month-old granddaughter was shocked when the dancing cactus started swearing and singing about doing cocaine.</p>
<p>
	&#34;This toy uses swear words and talking about cocaine use,&#34; Ania Tanner told CTV News Toronto. &#34;This is not what I ordered for my granddaughter.&#34;</p>
<p>
	The cactus was sold on Walmart’s website as an educational toy for about $26 and sings songs in English, Spanish and Polish.</p>
<p>
	But Tanner, who is Polish, said when she listened to the Polish lyrics, the cactus was singing about doing cocaine, drug abuse, suicide, depression and used profanities. </p>
<p>
	&#34;It just so happens that I am Polish and when I started to listen to the songs and I heard the words,&#34; she said. &#34;I was in shock. I thought what is this some kind of joke?&#34;</p>
<p>
	The song is by Polish Rapper Cypis, who is reportedly unaware his song was used by the Chinese manufacturer of the children&#39;s toy. </p>

<p>
	&#34;It&#39;s about taking five grams of cocaine and being alone … It&#39;s a very depressing song,&#34; Tanner said</p>
<p>
	This singing cactus toy was also sold in Europe through Amazon and in July 2021 other families also noticed and complained about the lyrics that many felt were inappropriate for a children’s toy.</p>
<p>
	The Polish artist said he planned to take legal action against the Chinese company for using his song without permission. </p>
<p>
	CTV News Toronto was unable to contact Cypis or the manufacturer for comment.</p>
<p>
	Tanner said she feels Walmart should not be selling the toy and wants a refund. </p>
<p>
	Walmart told CTV News Toronto they take this customer complaint concern seriously.</p>
<p>
	&#34;These items are sold by a third-party seller on our marketplace website. We are removing the items while we look into this complaint further,&#34; a Walmart spokesperson told CTV News Toronto.</p>
<p>
	That was a relief for Tanner who said “I just don&#39;t want anybody before Christmas to think this is a great toy and go online and have the same thing happen, that happened to me.&#34;</p>
<p>
	Some families may already have the dancing cactus toy and if they don’t speak Polish, they wouldn’t know what it was saying.</p>
<p>
	Complaints with the toy go back almost five months so it’s not clear why the toy is still being sold. </p>
