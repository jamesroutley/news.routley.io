            The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader in Gaza <a href="https://cnn.com/2023/12/07/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-profile-intl/index.html">Yahya Sinwar </a>and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, the court’s prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clweth82w00043b6jvhw6vk66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Khan said the ICC’s prosecution team is also seeking warrants for <a href="https://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/israel-gaza-yoav-gallant-intl-latam/index.html">Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant</a>, as well as two other top Hamas leaders — Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades who is better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ political leader.

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clweth82w00053b6jpaob34wt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The warrants against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. The decision puts Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant over Moscow’s war on Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011.

            By applying for the arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders in the same action, Khan’s office risks attracting criticism that it places a terror organization and an elected government on an equivalent footing.

            Khan said the charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri include “extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention.”

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwetwoxg00003b6j9ayamk0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “The world was shocked on the 7th of October when people were ripped from their bedrooms, from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel,” Khan told Amanpour, adding that “people have suffered enormously.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwey7vg400003b6jrmgkx1ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people across several locations in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. Many of the hostages are still being held in Gaza – Khan told Amanpour this meant crimes continued to be committed against “so many innocent Israelis … that are held hostage by Hamas and families that are waiting for their return.”
    </p>

            Khan told Amanpour his team has a “variety of evidence” to support the application for arrest warrants against Sinwar, Haniyeh and al-Masri, including authenticated video footage and photographs from the attacks as well as evidence from eyewitnesses and survivors.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clweyhezu00023b6jxoa1refp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">

            Responding to the announcement by Khan, Hamas said in a statement that it “strongly condemns the attempts of the ICC Prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.”
    </p>

            “Hamas calls on the ICC Prosecutor to issue arrest warrants against all war criminals among the occupation leaders, officers, and soldiers who participated in crimes against the Palestinian people, and demands the cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against Palestinian resistance leaders,” the group added.

            Other Israeli officials echoed his sentiments. Benny Gantz, a member Israel’s war cabinet, criticized Khan’s decision immediately after it was announced, saying that Israel was fighting “with one of the strictest moral codes in history, while complying with international law and boasting a robust independent judiciary.”

            “Drawing parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,” he said, adding that the decision by the prosecutors “is in itself a crime of historic proportion to be remembered for generation.”

            When reports surfaced last month that the ICC chief prosecutor was considering this course of action, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/05/middleeast/netanyahu-icc-warrants-israel-intl-latam/index.html">Netanyahu said that</a> any ICC arrest warrants against senior Israeli government and military officials “would be an outrage of historic proportions,” and that Israel “has an independent legal system that rigorously investigates all violations of the law.”

            Israel and the United States are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015.
