    <h1>Tell HN: Regrets. Think carefully about how you spend your time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I&#39;m writing this 38 hours before I go into a surgery on Monday that I may not survive, and while I am told I have a better than 50/50 chance of making it to this time next year, I still feel, though I am too young (early 50s) to deal with these things, that I have wasted too much time. I&#39;d like to impart some lessons.</p><p>1. A small number of accomplishments really mean something, but you often won&#39;t know which ones. I started three companies and two were successes, and even though they comprised more than two decades of my life, I feel like I remember a grand total of six important hours between them. Meanwhile, I still remember the shed I built for my father in the first summer after college. Whatever seems unimportant, you will care about the most.</p><p>2. The thing you do today, you will probably do tomorrow. I&#39;ve wasted a lot of time, but most people I know have wasted lots of time, and it&#39;s because of the tendency to make an exception of the present day, which either excuses laziness or pathological busyness, which is a form of the same thing. &#34;I&#39;ll do it tomorrow.&#34; But tomorrow it will be today. It&#39;s always today.</p><p>3. Ethics matter. I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any life after this one, but I find myself ruminating on what I&#39;ve done. In 2015, I had a lot of interaction with a startup incubator you know well, and ended up sitting in the discussions and planning around banning and erasing a young programmer we considered a threat to our financial interests, due to his concerns about authoritarianism in technology. In retrospect, he was harmless, but an example had to be made. The decision was made to ban him here, try to get him fired though I don&#39;t know if we succeeded, and attack him with sockpuppets on Reddit, and it seems to have worked because you don&#39;t hear his name much.</p><p>Ten years later, I&#39;m still stuck thinking about this. Am I the kind of person who does shitty things? I was. Am I still? How would I even know?</p><p>I don&#39;t believe that faith is an out, or that you can apologize or donate your way out of past behaviors. You will always be the person who has done what you have done.</p><p>4. Be kind to animals. There are few joys like having a dog. I always refused when my ex-wife wanted one, and she got one after we separated. For her, it was probably an upgrade.</p><p>5. I developed a knack for founding companies, but I never learned how to build communities. They aren&#39;t the same thing. You might have three hundred people at your company and you truly feel like they are your village, but they&#39;re not. Circumstances will change, and people will move, and in five years, most of them will not remember your name.</p><p>That&#39;s probably enough for now. My mind goes between periods of racing and long spells of languid acceptance. All humans end up in the place where I am, and I hope you reach it with fewer regrets than I have.</p></div></td></div></div>
