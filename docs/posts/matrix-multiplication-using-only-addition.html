            <span>Abstract:</span>  Matrix multiplication consumes a large fraction of the time taken in many
machine-learning algorithms. Thus, accelerator chips that perform matrix
multiplication faster than conventional processors or even GPU&#39;s are of
increasing interest. In this paper, we demonstrate a method of performing
matrix multiplication without a scalar multiplier circuit. In many cases of
practical interest, only a single addition and a single on-chip copy operation
are needed to replace a multiplication. It thus becomes possible to design a
matrix-multiplier chip that, because it does not need time, space- and
energy-consuming multiplier circuits, can hold many more processors, and thus
provide a net speedup.
