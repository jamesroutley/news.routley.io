									<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://self-issued.info/images/ietf-logo.png" alt="IETF logo"/></span>Ten years ago this week, in May 2015, the JSON Web Token (JWT) became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">RFC 7519</a>.  This was the culmination of a <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1387">4.5 year journey</a> to create a simple JSON-based security token format and underlying JSON-based cryptographic standards.  The full set of RFCs published together was:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">RFC 7515</a>:  JSON Web Signature (JWS)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html">RFC 7516</a>:  JSON Web Encryption (JWE)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517.html">RFC 7517</a>:  JSON Web Key (JWK)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html">RFC 7518</a>:  JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">RFC 7519</a>:  JSON Web Token (JWT)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7520.html">RFC 7520</a>:  Examples of Protecting Content Using JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7521.html">RFC 7521</a>:  Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7522.html">RFC 7522</a>:  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html">RFC 7523</a>:  JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s certainly the case that we co-designed JWT and its underpinnings with <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a>, while also attempting to create general-purpose, widely useful standards.  Given the adoption that’s ensued, it seems that we succeeded.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my post <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2045">JWTs helping combat fraudulent and unwanted telephone calls</a>, “<i><b>It’s often said that one sign of a standard having succeeded is that it’s used for things that the inventors never imagined.</b></i>”  I’m gratified that this applies to JWT and the related specifications.  As was written in the post <a href="https://blog.duendesoftware.com/posts/20250520-essential-moments-in-the-oauth-and-openid-connect-timeline/">Essential Moments in the OAuth and OpenID Connect Timeline</a>, it’s now hard to imagine an online security world without these standards.</p>
<p>That said, there’s work underway to keep JWTs and the use of them secure for the next decade.  Five years ago, the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html">JSON Web Token Best Current Practices</a> specification was created.  As <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2052">I wrote then</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This Best Current Practices specification contains a compendium of lessons learned from real JWT deployments and implementations over that period. It describes pitfalls and how to avoid them as well as new recommended practices that enable proactively avoiding problems that could otherwise arise.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaronf/">Yaron Sheffer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dickhardt/">Dick Hardt</a> and I are now updating the JWT BCP to describe additional threats and mitigations that have become known in the last five years.  See the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-sheffer-oauth-rfc8725bis-01.html">updated JSON Web Token Best Current Practices</a> specification.</p>
<p>Similarly, my coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcampbell/">Brian Campbell</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmort/">Chuck Mortimore</a> of the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html">JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</a> are updating it and related specifications to address vulnerabilities caused by <a href="https://openid.net/notice-of-a-security-vulnerability/">ambiguities in the audience values</a> of tokens sent to the authorization server.  See the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-rfc7523bis-01.html">RFC7523bis</a> specification.</p>
<p>I’m truly grateful that my coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ve7jtb/">John Bradley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsakimura/">Nat Sakimura</a> and I created something useful and widely used ten years ago, of course with substantial contributions from the OAuth, JOSE, and OpenID Connect working groups.  I look forward to what the next decade will bring!</p>
