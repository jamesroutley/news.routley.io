<p><a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2021/11/29/0">#</a> (<a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2021/11/29/0#comments">0</a>)  <a name="2021-11-29-0"><b>29 Nov 2021, 12:05PM</b></a>: <span><b>A Cool Thing That Could Exist</b></span>: 
   <span>Recently I read Tim Cahill&#39;s entertaining <em>Road Fever</em>, a memoir from 1987. Cahill briefly mentions the news of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)">Black Monday</a> intersecting with his road trip, which reminded me that Black Monday plays a much larger role in Michael Lewis&#39;s autobiographical <em>Liar&#39;s Poker</em>.

</span></p><p>Thus -- I am not going to make this, but some enterprising digital humanities person with access to, like, the Google Books and Amazon ebook datasets could theoretically do it:

</p><p>An interactive way to explore all the memoirs/autobiographies/diaries/letters ever published for references to things happening on particular dates. So you could see a sampling of different things people around the world noted down on or regarding a particular day -- like, wouldn&#39;t it be interesting to read, side-by-side, what Jawaharlal Nehru, Johnny Cash, Jane Jacobs, and Junichiro Koizumi had to say about August 6, 1945?

</p><p>If this already exists, lemme know.  </p>
