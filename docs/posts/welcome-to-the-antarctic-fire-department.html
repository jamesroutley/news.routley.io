    <p>The Antarctic Fire Department is proudly supporting the advancement of world science
    through	fire/rescue support services on the highest, driest, windiest, coldest, and
    ultimately harshest continent on the planet - Antarctica.</p>
	<p>Based on Ross Island, the AFD provides the United States Antarctic Program 
	with professional emergency services at McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott Station,
	and the United States	Air Force airfields.</p>
	<p>Antarctic Fire operations are performed where the most extreme environmental 
	conditions on earth exist - south of 60Â° lattitude.</p>
    <p>With the extreme temperatures and working conditions, 
	it takes a special person to work in the Antarctic environment 
	as a firefighter. As such, the AFD prides itself on having the most diverse, dedicated, 
	and resilient personnel of any fire department in the world.</p>

	<p>The department offers the unique opportunity to
	go where few people have gone before, or ever will go. Antarctica is one of the few 
	places on earth that remain unscathed from permanent human population/presence
	and wields a serene beauty that is beyond words.</p>
	<p>Working in Antarctica is challenging,
	but ultimately rewarding as well. While deployed, firefighters learn vital skills 
	that educate and protect them from the Antarctic environment and also help them 
	understand and preserve the pristine eco-system they work around. </p>  
	<p>Employment opportunities include short and long-term 
	positions ranging from Firefighter/EMT to Firefighter/Medic, line Lieutenant, Shift Captain, 
	and Emergency Dispatcher.</p>  
	<p>We welcome and invite	you to look around and 
	learn more about Antarctica, the department, life on &#34;the ice,&#34; and the opportunity 
	of a lifetime that awaits you.</p>
