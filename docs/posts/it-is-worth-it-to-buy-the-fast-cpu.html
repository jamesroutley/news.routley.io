    <h1>It is worth it to buy the fast CPU</h1>

  <div><p>In the past few years, CPUs have gotten really fast. Shockingly fast!
Yet most people are stuck on previous generation mobile chips (whether by choice, or by their companies choice), at a huge detriment to their productivity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AI coding subscriptions like Cursor are all the rage these days.
I&#39;ll skip the debate on exactly how useful these tools are, and focus on the pricing.
Cursor is $480/year for the team plan (the cheapest corporate plan), and other providers are around the same, setting a clear price point: engineering productivity is worth at least $500/year.</p>
<p>This makes sense, as given the typical salary of a senior (US-based) software engineer, you don&#39;t even need to be 1% more efficient for that investment to pay off.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>the</em> top end CPU, AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, is only $500. Practically speaking it will last longer, but I believe typically corporations amortize the cost of development machines over 3 years putting it at only $170/year - a bargain compared to AI!.</p>
<p><strong>Buy the fast CPU!</strong> It is well worth it.</p>
<p>Below shows some benchmarks for 3 machines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fastest laptop my former employee would give me in 2024 (i7-1165G7, released in 2020; my employer clearly didn&#39;t follow my advice to give engineers top end CPUs!).</li>
<li>The fastest ThinkPad I could buy in 2024 (AMD Ryzen 7840U).</li>
<li>The fastest desktop CPU I could buy in 2025 (AMD Ryzen 9950x).</li>
</ul>

<p>The gap is incredible -- over a 10x difference in many cases!
The difference between waiting 3s for a build vs 30s is game-changing, as is the difference between 3s and 300ms.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb I have seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop CPUs are about 3x faster than laptop CPUs</li>
<li>Top end CPUs are about 3x faster than the comparable top end models 3 years ago</li>
<li>This applies to cloud VMs as well; each new generations are 2-3x faster for many workloads and usually the same price!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can justify an AI coding subscription, you can justify buying the best tool for the job.</p>
