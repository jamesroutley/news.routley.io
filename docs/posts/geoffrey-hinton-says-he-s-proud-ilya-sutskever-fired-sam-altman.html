    <h1>Geoffrey Hinton says he&#39;s proud Ilya Sutskever &#39;fired Sam Altman&#39;</h1>

<p id="speakable-summary">Geoffrey Hinton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/08/geoff-hinton-and-john-hopfield-win-nobel-prize-in-physics-for-their-work-in-foundational-ai/">accepted a Nobel Prize</a> this week, recognizing the foundational work on artificial neural networks that earned him the nickname “godfather of AI.” <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/H7DgMFqrON0">In a speech Tuesday</a>, Professor Hinton praised one student – alluding to OpenAI’s former Chief Scientist, Ilya Sutskever – for revolting against OpenAI’s CEO.</p>

<p>“I was particularly fortunate to have many very clever students – much cleverer than me – who actually made things work,” said Hinton. “They’ve gone on to do great things. I’m particularly proud of the fact that one of my students fired Sam Altman.”</p>







<p>Of course, Hinton is referring to OpenAI’s board <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/a-timeline-of-sam-altmans-firing-from-openai-and-the-fallout/">voting to fire Altman in November 2023</a>. Sutskever delivered the news to Altman via video call, but later said he regretted it. Hinton seems to have celebrated the firing of OpenAI’s CEO as a win for AI safety, which he often advocates for. However, the win was short-lived, as Altman now has more control over OpenAI than before, and he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/sam-altman-reportedly-poised-to-get-equity-in-openai-for-the-first-time/">could soon get equity.</a></p>
