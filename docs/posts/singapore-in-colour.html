</p>
        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Not just in its aesthetic alleyways, or its gorgeous gardens, but also in its heartland and MRT stations.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

</p>
        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When put together, these colours paint a vivid picture of the island — a mosaic of neighbourhoods each with their own character and charm.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The city as a whole has its own palette featuring surprising pops of colour, and we’ve highlighted some of our favourites.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We took <strong>2,000 photos</strong> from around the city, like this one from Downtown Core.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->From each photo, we extracted the most prominent <strong>five colours</strong>...<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->… and visualised each neighbourhood as pixels of colour. This is Downtown Core.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In <strong>10,000 colours</strong>, here is all of Singapore.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
      </section><section>

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->You can find every colour of the rainbow, if you look.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
      </section><section>

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There’s a fair bit of grey from buildings, streets and shadows.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
      </section><section>

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But also lush greens, sky blues, and bright pops of colour in everyday spaces from hawker centres to HDBs.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

        <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ultimately, every neighbourhood has a unique palette.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some neighbourhoods were more colourful than the others. Joo Chiat’s pastel Peranakan houses brought personality to Geylang. In the heartlands, we found lots of red in Bishan.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
</p>
        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some were expected. For example, the Central Water Catchment area — home to the MacRitchie Reservoir — was very green. Places near the coast like Bedok were more blue.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
</p>
        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Our team took photos mostly on clear days. That’s why you may notice more blues or greys in neighbourhoods based on the weather when shots were taken.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
</p>
        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And subject matter is subjective. Each area was assigned to a photographer with a simple brief: look for colour.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
</p>
        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some may have leaned towards streets and HDBs while others may have fancied the flowers and neighbourhood cats to be found.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
</p>
        </div><div data-type="paragraph"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->So, go out with a camera, and you’ll likely capture a different picture of Singapore’s colours. But you’ll find colour nonetheless.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
