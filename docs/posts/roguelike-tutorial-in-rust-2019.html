<p>Every year, the fine fellows over at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/new/">r/roguelikedev</a> run a <em>Tutorial Tuesday</em> series - encouraging new programmers to join the ranks of roguelike developers. Most languages end up being represented, and this year (2019) I decided that I&#39;d use it as an excuse to learn Rust. I didn&#39;t really want to use <code>libtcod</code>, the default engine - so I created my own, <a href="https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib">RLTK</a>. My initial entry into the series isn&#39;t very good, but I learned a lot from it - you can find it <a href="https://github.com/thebracket/rustyroguelike">here</a>, if you are curious.</p>
<p>The series always points people towards an excellent series of tutorials, using Python and <code>libtcod</code>. You can find it <a href="http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/">here</a>. Section 1 of this tutorial mirrors the structure of this tutorial - and tries to take you from zero (<em>how do I open a console to say Hello Rust</em>) to hero (<em>equipping items to fight foes in a multi-level dungeon</em>). I&#39;m hoping to continue to extend the series.</p>
<p>I also <em>really</em> wanted to use an Entity Component System. Rust has an excellent one called Specs, so I went with it. I&#39;ve used ECS-based setups in previous games, so it felt natural to me to use it. It&#39;s also a cause of continual confusion on the subreddit, so hopefully this tutorial can shine some light on its benefits and why you might want to use one.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a <strong>blast</strong> writing this - and hope to continue writing. Please feel free to contact me (I&#39;m <code>@herberticus</code> on Twitter) if you have any questions, ideas for improvements, or things you&#39;d like me to add. Also, sorry about all the Patreon spam - hopefully someone will find this sufficiently useful to feel like throwing a coffee or two my way. :-)</p>
