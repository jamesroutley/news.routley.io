    <h1>Experts have it easy (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Something that’s painfully understudied is how experts are more efficient
than novices while achieving better results. I say understudied and not
unstudied, because it’s common knowledge that charging people for their time
results in experts being paid less since they work faster, which is why experts
charge more for their time.</p>
<p>This effect is understudied in the impact it has on novices entering a field. A
Novice will start out being woefully inefficient, putting in incredible amounts
of effort and running through all number of mental hoops in order to maintain
the growing pile of unmaintainable abstractions they’ve developed. An expert
doesn’t have to jump through these hoops. They can more clearly see the actual
problem at hand and will more efficiently put their time and effort towards
making progress against the problem. In contrast, novices will spend more time
battling problems they created for themselves. Let’s explore this idea by
looking at two characters entrapped in a maze, and how they go about escaping.</p>
<h3 id="stuck-in-a-maze-expert-vs-novice">Stuck in a maze: Expert vs Novice<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#stuck-in-a-maze-expert-vs-novice"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world-class navigator being set in a maze. They come well prepared
with compass and paper, and have previously escaped some of the most
dastardly mazes designed by man. Also, imagine yourself. You’re the Novice in
this scenario. You didn’t realise you were being thrown into a maze. You
don’t even know if the goal is to get out or to find the centre.</p>
<p>As you go deeper and deeper into the maze, you realise that you’re helplessly
lost. Through a miracle of literary convenience, your expert friend calls you
up and offers advice: “As soon as you start, keep track of where you’ve been
using your ball of twine. It’ll help you keep track of the decisions you make”.</p>
<p>You didn’t realise the criticality of feline playthings, and so didn’t bring
a ball of twine. You also don’t remember where you started. You ask your
expert friend for advice on what to do, to which they respond “Oh I’ve got no
idea. I never go anywhere without my ball of twine. You just shouldn’t have
gotten yourself into this mess in the first place.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the trickiest tangles I’ve tackled haven’t been because the core
problem is difficult, but rather because I was helping someone with less
experience, and they spent several hours getting themselves more and more tied
up. Before asking for help, they made a wrong decision, which maybe solved
their short term problems but shot them in the foot in the long term. This bad
decision made other bad decisions more likely until they were helplessly stuck
in a trap of their own making.</p>
<p>Often this trap is far trickier than anything an expert would let themselves
get into. Novices, on the other hand, can easily make a sequence of bad
decisions that result in an ever increasing cost of solving the problem at
hand. Not only are you lost in the maze without your twine, but you also went
in a mysterious cave that looked kinda interesting at first and now you’re lost
in the dark. Meanwhile, the world-class expert is happily skipping through the
warm sunny parts of the maze, because they knew that the cave would eventually
lead to a dead end.</p>
<p>I’d like to stress at this point that this is in no way the Novice’s fault.
They followed the same policy as any expert: “take best action available to you
at the time”. Telling a Novice to “just be better” is not constructive
feedback. This feedback does not lead to them improving over time, since from
the only perspective that matters in this scenario (the Novice’s), they were
taking the best action available to them. And if you’re giving feedback that
doesn’t lead to improvement, what’s the point of the feedback?</p>
<h3 id="the-novice-has-a-genius-idea">The Novice has a genius idea<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#the-novice-has-a-genius-idea"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Still lost in the maze, you keep walking. Your friend mentioned the ball of
twine, and after thinking for a bit you realise your woollen jumper, if
carefully dismantled, could be a good replacement. Dutifully and with a
concrete objective, you sit down and begin to unravel your jumper. After an
hour or so, you’ve got your ball of yarn. After some failed attempts at
unspooling the yarn behind you, you realise one strand of yarn is hopelessly
weak. You decide to braid the yarn, and sit down for another hour to do so.
It’s pretty boring, but you assume that this is just what solving mazes is
all about.</p>
<p>A bit later, your expert friend calls you up and lambastes you for wasting
time with this yarn business. “It was clearly never going to work” he says.
He instructs you to use broken branches from the hedge that makes up
the maze as a way of marking your path. You hadn’t realised the maze was made
of hedge until this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Novices often spend energy fixing things that are orthogonal to the actual
problem they want to solve, whereas experts are able to better direct their
energy towards the problems they want to solve. This leads to novices having an
extremely distorted view of a field, because the problems they end up solving
are both more difficult and less interesting than those being tackled by
experts. Nobody wants to put more effort into figuring out a more boring
problem.</p>
<h3 id="the-novices-search-strategy">The Novice’s search strategy<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#the-novices-search-strategy"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, with a means of marking the paths you’ve taken, you set out to
traverse the maze. Or maybe to escape it, you’re still not sure. You stride
along, breaking and placing branches as you go. You’re not really sure which
paths are the best, so you mostly just pick at random.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a Novice, the vast majority of decisions have to be made essentially
randomly, with very little information going into the choice. If all decisions
were sequential and did not depend on any other decision, a dedicated Novice
could come up with a solution better than random chance after thinking hard
about the decision. But the world we live in is fractal and complexly
dependent; many decisions depend on other decisions in ways that a Novice has
no idea about. Even a dedicated Novice will be confronted with situations in
which they must make several inter-dependent decisions before they can get
feedback on the efficacy of those decisions. The Novice is (at first) forced to
make completely arbitrary choices and face the consequences. Hopefully they can
learn which consequences were due to which decisions, but this isn’t always
feasible.</p>
<p>From the perspective of an expert, the decisions taken while solving a problem
are often second nature, and yet are carefully crafted so as to avoid
unnecessary trouble down the road. A Novice looking upon an expert’s work would
be hard-pressed to distinguish these few important decisions (based on years of
hard work and study) from the myriad of far less important decisions (based
largely on personal taste).</p>
<h3 id="novices-dont-even-see-the-decision">Novices don’t even see the decision<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#novices-dont-even-see-the-decision"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re breezing through a particularly long and straight bit of the maze when
your expert friend calls you up once again. “Why didn’t you take that right a
few meters back?”, they ask. There was none, you assert, and glancing behind
you confirms this fact.</p>
<p>Just in case, you retrace your steps, and sure enough there’s a sliver of a
gap in the hedges which you suppose could be a path to take. It’s terribly
cramped and overgrown compared to the wide clean paths you’ve been taking so
far, but it <em>is</em> a path. Looking around carefully now, you realise the hedges
are actually packed with cracks and gaps and thin spots. Who knows how many
paths you’ve missed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the Novice doesn’t even know that there’s a decision to make. When
the decision is pointed out by the friendly expert, the Novice can often either
make the correct decision or appreciate the correct solution when it’s shown to
them. But the Novice <em>didn’t even know there was a decision in the first
place</em>. This makes it incredibly difficult for the ambitious Novice to make
progress without outside help. They cannot just “check their work for
mistakes”, because for any substantial body of work the Novice likely wouldn’t
be able to point out half their decisions.</p>
<h3 id="experts-cant-explain-their-decisions">Experts can’t explain their decisions<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#experts-cant-explain-their-decisions"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You squeeze through this gap in the hedge recommended by your expert friend.
Before long, you come to a fork in the maze: one path leads left, the other
right. The left path looks a bit wider and a bit brighter, but having learnt
from your mistakes you decide to call up your expert friend to get their
advice and learn from their wisdom. “The right path is better.”, your friend
declares. You ask for an explanation, but they are unable to give anything
more specific than “The right path is a stronger option, it’s clearly got the
right look about it. There’s no chance it’ll let you down.”</p>
<p>Frustrated at the lack of intelligible wisdom, you take the right path. And
sure enough, it looks like it was the correct decision. The path clears up
and starts to head towards the exit, as far as you can tell. But you still
don’t understand what your expert friend saw, and it seems like they don’t
understand what they saw either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expert’s intuition is often formidable, but rarely comprehensible. This
inability to clearly explain their decisions is what makes it so useful for
novices to spend time with experts. Often there’s an underlying pattern that
the novice can pick up through careful observation, even if neither the expert
nor the novice can properly articulate this pattern.</p>
<h3 id="the-experts-ensemble">The Expert’s ensemble<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#the-experts-ensemble"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Your expert friend is chastising you for missing the obvious gap in the
hedge, and for not realising you could climb over hedges, and for not
bringing a hedge trimmer, and for a myriad of other choices that you made
without even realising you had the option to do differently. As your eyes
glaze over, you hear someone call to your friend through the phone. Turns
out, your expert friend has expert friends of their own, and they’re all
helping each other! “I thought I was meant to figure it out on my own” you
cry, but your friend asks whatever gave you that idea.</p>
<p>You ask how you too can get a network of peers who can help you through the
maze. Your friend says to join some online chat rooms. Unfortunately for you,
they’re all speaking incomprehensible jargon or debating optimal twine
spooling techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experts often have either a network of people, or (more frequently nowadays)
know the online network of websites and usernames which can guide their
thoughts. They can quickly distinguish useful insight from helplessly generic
summaries, and don’t have to spend much time looking for the information
they’re after. But a Novice has <em>no clue</em> about how to distinguish the two, nor
how to find communities who can help them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="escape">Escape<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#escape"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, you finish the maze. Not wanting to repeat the experience of
being a complete Novice, you dedicate yourself to learning more and to not
falling ill to the traps of being a Novice. But how, exactly, should you do
that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Novice, you <em>need</em> to find a sympathetic expert on your side to help you
out and to whom you can ask all questions, regardless of how trivial the
questions might be. A replacement for this is finding a lot of experts so you
can spread the load amongst them. You can go very far online nowadays, and even
more so with AI tools. But many of the above trappings that novice’s succumb to
do not magically disintegrate because you have access to the internet or to a
chatbot. You still don’t know how to recognise subtle decisions. You still
don’t know how to distinguish good ideas from bad. You still don’t know how to
avoid long-term cascades due to bad choices. The internet helps, for sure, but
having someone by your side is monumentally better.</p>
<p>One thing that can be tricky to convey to your friendly expert, is that
sometimes you just need to be able to show them what you’re doing without any
specific question in mind. I’ve often found that I can feel uneasy about what
I’m doing, and then talking with an expert friend will quickly surface that
I’ve made some error that will cause pain later. Having someone who’s happy to
spend time “just talking”, without any specific goal to solve, will go a long
way.</p>
<p>In the workplace, this style of “just talking” interactions between novices and
experts is critical for knowledge transfer and training. But novices rarely
have a voice with key decision makers, and so promoting these interactions is
often neglected. It is not sufficient to instruct senior employees to answer
the newcomer’s questions, since the vast majority of learning comes from a
novice watching how the expert plies their skills, and not from direct
questions and answers. What makes this scenario even trickier is that the
expert will likely think “just talking” interactions are basically worthless,
but answering concrete questions <em>feel</em> much more useful. The novice, on the
other hand, could likely discover answers to concrete questions on their own,
given enough time. But developing the intuitions that come through while an
expert is “just talking” with a novice is incredibly valuable to the novice.
This explains the difficulty of training new employees when all your experts
are working remotely, as remote work practically eliminates any sort of casual
unguided “water-cooler” interaction.</p>
<p>Something you can do independently (and possibly it’s best done without expert
supervision), is exploration of the field. You know nothing, and have no biases
about what may or may not be useful. <em>Any</em> time you come across something that
feels like it has some depth to it, such as a well-written essay series or a
deep technical dive, you need to invest heavily into it. As a novice, your one
advantage is that <em>everything</em> is new and nobody expects you to be fast.
Because of this, you can afford to spend the time to learn as much as possible.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t think it’s possible to overdo this. Spending a week exploring
some specific arcana of your field is probably going to pay dividends, because
all of a sudden you’re expert-level in this (<em>tiny</em>) aspect of the field. You
can go head-to-head with an expert, since they last read about that weird
subdomain 5 years ago. Don’t study the “common” things, but go all-in on the
niche pockets. The common things are common enough that you’ll learn them
through osmosis regardless of what your main activity is. But the niche things
require active study, and ignoring the niches is how you remain a novice.</p>
<p>Amongst all of this, the novice needs courage (to make decisions without
knowing the consequences) and confidence (so that they whole-heartedly commit
to their decisions and grant them the greatest chance of success). These traits
are not trivial, and confidence can easily be crushed by a snide comment from
an expert. I don’t want to imagine how many promising novices have been spurned
by unimpressive experts. In this way, advice from a sour-hearted expert is
worse than no expert advice at all due to the risk of destroying the novice’s
confidence.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts<a role="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-no-popover="true" href="#closing-thoughts"><svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>The lack of consistent empathy between experts and novices would suggest that,
despite feeling easy, it is in fact difficult. I’ve written more about this
<a href="https://boydkane.com/hard" data-slug="hard">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the extreme case, this lack of empathy leads to experts deriding the work of
novices as not having the prestige/class/taste/status expressed so deftly by
the work of the experts.</p>
<p>This is self-fulfilling: novices will either conform to the expert’s sense of
aesthetics, dismiss the field of study as “not for them”, or (in rare cases)
work incredibly hard to prove the experts wrong after all. In this last case,
the Novice becomes an expert anyway. Experts tend to have an aesthetic
preference towards technically challenging work rather than
simple-but-interesting work, and I’ve written more about this phenomenon here:
