    <h1>More predictable benchmarking with testing.B.Loop</h1>

      <p>Go developers who have written benchmarks using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>testing</code></a> package might have encountered some of
its various pitfalls. Go 1.24 introduces a new way to write benchmarks that&rsquo;s just
as easy to use, but at the same time far more robust:
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#B.Loop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>testing.B.Loop</code></a>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Go benchmarks are written using a loop from 0 to <code>b.N</code>:</p>
<pre><code>func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  for range b.N {
    ... code to measure ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>b.Loop</code> instead is a trivial change:</p>
<pre><code>func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  for b.Loop() {
    ... code to measure ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>testing.B.Loop</code> has many benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It prevents unwanted compiler optimizations within the benchmark loop.</li>
<li>It automatically excludes setup and cleanup code from benchmark timing.</li>
<li>Code can&rsquo;t accidentally depend on the total number of iterations or the current
iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were all easy mistakes to make with <code>b.N</code>-style benchmarks that would
silently result in bogus benchmark results. As an added bonus, <code>b.Loop</code>-style
benchmarks even complete in less time!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore the advantages of <code>testing.B.Loop</code> and how to effectively utilize it.</p>
<h2 id="old-benchmark-loop-problems">Old benchmark loop problems</h2>
<p>Before Go 1.24, while the basic structure of a benchmark was simple, more sophisticated
benchmarks required more care:</p>
<pre><code>func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  ... setup ...
  b.ResetTimer() // if setup may be expensive
  for range b.N {
    ... code to measure ...
    ... use sinks or accumulation to prevent dead-code elimination ...
  }
  b.StopTimer() // if cleanup or reporting may be expensive
  ... cleanup ...
  ... report ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>If setup or cleanup are non-trivial, the developer needs to surround the benchmark loop
with <code>ResetTimer</code> and/or <code>StopTimer</code> calls. These are easy to forget, and even if the
developer remembers they may be necessary, it can be difficult to judge whether setup or
cleanup are &ldquo;expensive enough&rdquo; to require them.</p>
<p>Without these, the <code>testing</code> package can only time the entire benchmark function. If a
benchmark function omits them, the setup and cleanup code will be included in the overall
time measurement, silently skewing the final benchmark result.</p>
<p>There is another, more subtle pitfall that requires deeper understanding:
(<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/common-pitfalls-in-go-benchmarking/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Example source</a>)</p>
<pre><code>func isCond(b byte) bool {
  if b%3 == 1 &amp;&amp; b%7 == 2 &amp;&amp; b%17 == 11 &amp;&amp; b%31 == 9 {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

func BenchmarkIsCondWrong(b *testing.B) {
  for range b.N {
    isCond(201)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the user might observe <code>isCond</code> executing in sub-nanosecond
time. CPUs are fast, but not that fast! This seemingly anomalous result stems
from the fact that <code>isCond</code> is inlined, and since its result is never used, the
compiler eliminates it as dead code. As a result, this benchmark doesn&rsquo;t measure <code>isCond</code>
at all; it measures how long it takes to do nothing. In this case, the sub-nanosecond
result is a clear red flag, but in more complex benchmarks, partial dead-code elimination
can lead to results that look reasonable but still aren&rsquo;t measuring what was intended.</p>
<h2 id="how-testingbloop-helps">How <code>testing.B.Loop</code> helps</h2>
<p>Unlike a <code>b.N</code>-style benchmark, <code>testing.B.Loop</code> is able to track when it is first called
in a benchmark when the final iteration ends. The <code>b.ResetTimer</code> at the loop&rsquo;s start
and <code>b.StopTimer</code> at its end are integrated into <code>testing.B.Loop</code>, eliminating the need
to manually manage the benchmark timer for setup and cleanup code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Go compiler now detects loops where the condition is just a call to
<code>testing.B.Loop</code> and prevents dead code elimination within the loop. In Go 1.24, this is
implemented by disallowing inlining into the body of such a loop, but we plan to
<a href="/issue/73137">improve</a> this in the future.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of <code>testing.B.Loop</code> is its one-shot ramp-up approach. With a <code>b.N</code>-style
benchmark, the testing package must call the benchmark function several times with different
values of <code>b.N</code>, ramping up until the measured time reached a threshold. In contrast, <code>b.Loop</code>
can simply run the benchmark loop until it reaches the time threshold, and only needs to call
the benchmark function once. Internally, <code>b.Loop</code> still uses a ramp-up process to amortize
measurement overhead, but this is hidden from the caller and can be more efficient.</p>
<p>Certain constraints of the <code>b.N</code>-style loop still apply to the <code>b.Loop</code>-style
loop. It remains the user&rsquo;s responsibility to manage the timer within the benchmark loop,
when necessary:
(<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/common-pitfalls-in-go-benchmarking/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Example source</a>)</p>
<pre><code>func BenchmarkSortInts(b *testing.B) {
  ints := make([]int, N)
  for b.Loop() {
    b.StopTimer()
    fillRandomInts(ints)
    b.StartTimer()
    slices.Sort(ints)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, to benchmark the in-place sorting performance of <code>slices.Sort</code>,a
randomly initialized array is required for each iteration. The user must still
manually manage the timer in such cases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there still needs to be exactly one such loop in the benchmark function body
(a <code>b.N</code>-style loop cannot coexist with a <code>b.Loop</code>-style loop), and every iteration of the
loop should do the same thing.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">When to use</h2>
<p>The <code>testing.B.Loop</code> method is now the preferred way to write benchmarks:</p>
<pre><code>func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  ... setup ...
  for b.Loop() {
    // optional timer control for in-loop setup/cleanup
    ... code to measure ...
  }
  ... cleanup ...
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>testing.B.Loop</code> offers faster, more accurate, and
more intuitive benchmarking.</p>
