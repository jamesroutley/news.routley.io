According to Gallup, </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/357983/great-leaders-behaviors-common.aspx" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the biggest difference between an average and exceptional leader is that the latter is great at developing people, leading change and holding themselves accountable</a><span>. </span></p><p>So, how do you become an exceptional leader? Servant leadership may be the key. Prepare to be inspired as we explore real-world examples packed with tips and books to help you break from the ordinary.</p><p>Servant leadership is a leadership style that empowers employees based on the premise that if employees are satisfied and cared for, they will be more motivated to give their best.</p><p>The term was coined in the 1970s by Robert K. Greenleaf, the founder of modern servant leadership and popularized by famous thought leaders like Simon Sinek and Brené Brown.</p><p><span>You may use this leadership style without knowing it.

Sometimes, staff may have responsibilities beyond their capability, which can be contra-productive and lead to discontent.</span></p><p><span>Warren Bennis states </span><a href="https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=mine_engr" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">this approach could take a leader’s authority away</a><span>. He argues that true leadership requires a clear vision and decisiveness.</span></p><p>Let’s illustrate this with a couple of real-life examples:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong><span> – Oprah is a great example of a leader who empowers and lights up everyone around them. The secret to her success is being motivated by a greater vision. She said: “The reason I’ve been able to be so financially successful is my focus has never been money.” You’ve guessed it – her focus was on people and purpose.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mahatma Gandhi </strong><span>– Gandhi was a prime illustration of leading by example by demonstrating the power of peaceful protest and dedicating his life to serving others. He showed that the best way to earn respect and trust isn’t through setting rules but through living what you’re preaching.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Satya Nadella</strong><span> – Satya Nadella is known for turning around Microsoft’s company culture by putting people and their needs first. He started by listening to employees from all levels: “Listening was the most important thing I accomplished each day because it would build the foundation of leadership for years to come.”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mary Barra</strong><span> – Marry Barra, the CEO of General Motors, explained her leadership style, saying, “It’s important to surround yourself with people who will challenge you and tell you when and why you’re wrong.” He is a true example that a leader can stay humble despite their success.</span></p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png" width="544" height="386.7032967032967" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1035,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:544,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab74d31a-330b-4e0d-ac1a-a16c6f83bd0c_1600x1137.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><h6><span>Source: </span><a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/people-standing-together-shape-arrow_1311194.htm#query=leader&amp;position=15&amp;from_view=search&amp;track=sph" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Freepik.com</a></h6><p>Here are the traits that make servant leaders stand out from the rest:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Empathy:</strong><span> Real empathy is much more than showing compassion in conversation. Howard Shultz is an excellent example of turning words into actions when it comes to empathy. When he was the CEO of Starbucks, he introduced a comprehensive package of benefits to their employees, with a special focus on healthcare coverage, showing them that the company truly cares about their well-being. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Self-awareness:</strong><span> Howard Behar, the former president of Starbucks International, has shown great self-awareness by openly talking about his mistakes. He admitted that he was skeptical about Starbucks entering the Japanese market, but seeing that he was wrong made him more receptive to his colleagues’ feedback and judgment.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Active listening: </strong><span>Anne Mulcahy was Xerox’s CEO when the company faced significant financial challenges. Her objective was to turn the company around and she started doing so by embarking on a “listening tour” during which she visited different locations and branches and had employees of all levels share their biggest challenges with her.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Trust: </strong><span>Regarding trust, we can learn a lot from Tony Hsieh, the former CEO of Zappos, who eliminated traditional job titles and introduced Holacracy – a unique management structure distributing authority and decision-making through all the team members.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Transparency: </strong><span>Servant leaders advocate for transparent communication and allow the whole team to participate in the decision-making process instead of presenting the final decision. Paul Polman, the former CEO of Unilever, is known for introducing a culture of open communication with stakeholders and employees.</span></p></li></ol><p>Here are some suggestions if you want to dig deeper into this concept and learn how to implement it at your workplace.</p><p><em>“The true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own.”</em></p><p>Simon Sinek delves into the essence of great leadership, supporting his claims with history, biology and plenty of real-world examples. The book emphasizes leaders’ role in creating a supportive environment for their teams to grow and develop.</p><p><em>“Who is the greatest leader? The one who has served the most.”</em></p><p>This fiction book talks about leadership through the journey of John Daily, a businessman who struggles to find balance and tries to regain control of his organization. It&#39;s ideal if you’re looking for something light to read that’s also packed with actionable tips.</p><p><em>“Everywhere, there is much complaining about too few leaders. We have too few because most institutions are structured so that only a few, only one at a time, can emerge.”</em></p><p>This book is a great way to familiarize yourself with the philosophy of servant leadership directly from the author who coined that term and popularized the concept.</p><p>The book showcases real-world examples of leaders embodying servant leadership and it’s full of motivational stories and actionable insights that you can implement in your organization.</p><p><em>“George Washington Carver said we should be kind to others: “How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and strong. Because someday in life, you will have been all of these.”</em></p><p>James C. Hunte breaks down the traits necessary for starting with servant leadership, focusing on the impact this approach has not only on organizations but on society as a whole.</p><p><em>“When you are tempted to tell someone what to do, instead ask the question: What do you think you should do now?”</em></p><p>James A. Autry explores the qualities that can transform every individual into an effective servant leader, such as authenticity, empathy and humility.</p><p><em>“The leader turns the pyramid onto its head in order to serve others.”</em></p><p>This book can help you foster collaboration and build more meaningful relationships at your workplace, which leads to achieving your goals more effectively. </p><p>To sum it up, servant leadership is about genuinely caring for your team, listening to their needs and involving them in decision-making. By shifting the spotlight from the leader to the team, you can spark trust, creativity and innovation.</p><p>Servant leadership offers a roadmap for leaders who want to make a genuine difference in their organizations and the world.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
