<p><SPAN face="Arial">Nothing nowadays can replace the time when the first home
microcomputers hit the streets. I am a keen collector of the home computer era. Follow
<a href="http://searle.x10host.com/my_machines/machines.html">this link</a> to see my
current collection. In those days you HAD to make your programs fit the hardware and
memory available. This added to the enjoyment of programming to see something you had
written to fit in a few K spring to life. The later ZX81 is very similar to the ZX80
except a lot of the ICs in the 80 has been merged into one chip. As a result, you can
learn a lot about the workings of the ZX81 by referring to the ZX80 circuit. I have
several computers from the start of the 80&#39;s but have always liked the Sinclair ZX80 for
the following reasons: </SPAN> </p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">1. It was the bare minimum required to produce a workable 
computer with a TV display.</SPAN> </p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">It is because of the second reason this page has come into existence. Here I show you
how to build your own piece of history. Virtually all parts for the ZX80 are 
available from most of the larger electronic companies. The remaining parts (the 
Z80 processor and RAM, normally) can be picked up cheaply from eBay.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">I must point out this is <b>not</b> a job for the absolute beginner. You will need to
blow your own EPROM image and it will probably be a distinct advantage to have access to
an oscilloscope in case it doesn&#39;t work. I can assure you the circuit supplied here 
as well as the PCB layouts DO
work without any modification. </SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">I made the following modifications for my stripboard version:

is correct, apart from the following errors on the <u>original</u> schematic:</SPAN></p>

  on the edge connector.</SPAN></li>
  <li><SPAN face="Arial">The component list shows IC9 as being 74LS166. This should be 74LS165, as 
  shown on the actual circuit.</SPAN></li>
  <li><SPAN face="Arial">One input on IC13 is marked as 1 but should be 11 (on the gate that has 
  pin 10 as output).</SPAN></li>
  <li><SPAN face="Arial">Parts list shows IC 11 to be 74LS500. This has been corrected to say

<p><SPAN face="Arial">These are exact (as far as is possible) replica track and 
silk layouts of the original issue 2 
board. Nearly all tracks and component placements on the board are within 0.5mm 
of the original. The majority of the tracks were laid out by taking high 
resolution scans of my original board.
I had removed the modulator, heatsink and the ICs which were in sockets to 
ensure that I could see the hidden tracks. Tracks that were underneath the 
soldered-in ICs were visible if I viewed closely from the side of the chip, and 
again, I used a continuity tester to confirm. The  layout of these &#34;hidden&#34; 
tracks was then updated to match a picture I obtained from a magazine article. 
Recently, I was provided a picture of a ZX80 with the keyboard layer removed 
(thanks Rich). With this, I was able to reproduce an accurate representation of 
the contact spirals underneath the keys.</SPAN></p>

USING ALTERNATIVE COMPONENTS</SPAN></b></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Please note that my original board uses 2 x 2114 SRAM chips and a 2532 EPROM 
(which is slightly different pin-out to a 2732). So, if you cannot 
obtain them then you could either make an adapter board to plug into the 
original sockets, modify the PCB layout as appropriate or it may be possible to 
leave the RAM area of the PCB empty and build an add-on board to plug 
into the expansion bus instead.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The pin-outs for the 2732, the mask programmed ROM and 2532 chips here:</SPAN></p>

<p><b><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/ROMPinouts.gif" width="711" height="245"/></SPAN></b></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">* - &#34;/CS2&#34; connection is the second chip select on the ROM version (normally connected to A12 so that 
the ROM is only enabled in the lower-4K of the 8K map).  </SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">My original ZX80 has a 
2532 which does not have this second chip select so this pin on the 2532 EPROM 
is actually 
snipped and connected directly to Vcc, as shown here:</SPAN></p>

<p><img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/eprom2532.jpg" width="400" height="218"/></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The 2732 EPROM does, however, have 2 chip 
selects (/G and /E) so both can be used with a small wiring change.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Here is how I did the modification to use a 2732 EPROM in 
my re-build machine. The A11 and /E pins are bent out and connected via short 
lengths of wire-wrap cable to the PCB that supplies the two signals...</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">A crystal can be used instead of a ceramic resonator, and 
it fits very nicely on the board (shown resting on top of R27 to the right of 
IC20):</SPAN></p>

<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="5"><a name="ConstructionPCB"></a>CONSTRUCTION 
(ETCHED PCB VERSION)</SPAN></b></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Cut the board to the exact size required, in this case, 204mm by 155.5 mm</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Print the track images onto acetate sheets. If using a laser printer, then 
normally two copies, stacked, are sufficiently dark enough to block the UV light 
in the exposure box. These should be reverse-printed images, ideally, if using acetates 
as this will allow the ink-side to be in direct contact with the board and will 
ensure a sharp image being transferred.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/acetates.jpg" width="400" height="273"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Lay ALL of the acetates on top of one another to make sure 
they are line up. My laser printer slips a little bit, so I had to print a few 
extra until I managed to get a set where all were aligned with each other. The 
corner index markings allow perfect alignment.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Check the sizing by overlaying the acetate on the cut 
PCB...</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/acetateOnPCB.jpg" width="400" height="311"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">This was exposed in my home-made UV exposure unit, with 
two 8W UV tubes.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">This artwork contains index marks at all corners - you 
will need to accurately align the board to these to ensure the top and bottom 
holes are on top of each other. The tracks are quite tight so accuracy is 
essential.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Once exposed and developed, the board will look as follows. The parts to be 
etched will be bare copper, and the resist remains where the tracks are to be...</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/developed.jpg" width="400" height="250"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Etching of the board took approx 25 mins with a fresh 
warm solution of ferric chloride. Parts of the board were etched quite some time 
before this, but the centre of the more exposed areas always seem to take much 
longer. The board was removed and rinsed as soon as the areas were clear. Any 
longer would cause the thinner of the tracks to be eaten into.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Once etched, it will look like this...</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/etched.jpg" width="400" height="300"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">With careful etching, very fine-detail results can be achieved, as shown here 
with the Sinclair lettering (the &#34;s&#34; is only 3.25 mm wide and the dots above the 
&#34;i&#34;s are only 0.4mm)...</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/closeUpLogo.jpg" width="400" height="98"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The complete board was then drilled.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Check the board very carefully with a magnifying glass to 
see if there are any bridges between tracks or pads. These are removed at this 
stage using a sharp knife. Spending some time at this stage will result in a 
machine that should work first-time.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">As this is to be left open, I chemically-tinned the complete board. The 
chemicals are not very cheap, but you don&#39;t need to mix the whole quantity at 
once, and the unmixed crystals have a very long shelf-life. The tinning was well 
worth it, as it gives a professional tinned finish to the board that will keep 
it looking bright. It also ensures the keypads won&#39;t corrode and give poor 
contact.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/tinned.jpg" width="400" height="300"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Sockets need to be soldered. This was definitely the most 
difficult and time-consuming part.</SPAN></p>

<p><i><SPAN face="Arial" size="2">Alternate ways of soldering sockets onto a 
home-made double-sided board:</SPAN></i></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Also, all vias that are underneath the chips are soldered 
before the socket is attached, as these can&#39;t be accessed later.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/sockets.jpg" width="400" height="304"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Then the remainder of the components were then soldered 
into place. Some only need soldering to the bottom tracks. Where a track is also 
present at the top, the component is soldered to this as well, as shown here...</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/solderLegTop.jpg" width="400" height="96"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Some components (the capacitors) need to be a couple of mm off the board to 
allow this.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Once all components are fitted, all remaining holes that 
have tracks attached to them both above and below the board must be joined. In 
this picture a temporary heatsink is fitted to the regulator until I got some 
aluminium.</SPAN></p>

<p><img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/components.jpg" width="400" height="302"/></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">I wanted the keyboard to lay flat. If the holes were 
through-hole plated then this would not be a problem. I, however, needed to 
solder the top layer through to the track underneath while still ensuring a flat 
keyboard could be used. To do this, I used a strand of wire-wrap then squeezed 
it flat using a pair of pliers. This flattend wire could then be soldered using 
a minimal amount of solder and some very fine soldering. The excess was then 
removed using desoldering wick. The result is shown here. If you look carefully 
then you can just see the flat wire soldered to the edge of the centre hole in 
the picture.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/kbThroughHole.jpg" width="400" height="196"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The keyboard was printed onto photo paper then laminated 
to make it durable. It was then trimmed and the contacts stuck on the back. Once 
the contacts were attached, a spacer sheet of acetate was attached with holes to 
allow the foil to make contact with the PCB contacts when pressed. Everything is 
fixed using double-sided tape.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">
<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/kbContacts.jpg" width="400" height="213"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Once all components are soldered and without any ICs inserted into the sockets, connect
a continuity tester between the power supply pins.  If
all is well connect a power supply (7.5V to 12V, current regulated to 500mA if possible). Check the +5V
and 0V connections on each IC socket (normally top-right and bottom-left 
respectively, except for IC21). Turn off the supply and insert the ICs. Turn on the
power supply and connect to a television on Channel 36 (approx) if using the 
normal modulator. If the circuit is working then expect a power
consumption of around 350mA. </SPAN> </p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">If using a TV then adjust the tuning to get a picture 
(note: the display of black text on white <b>will require the brightness control 
of the TV to be turned up</b>). A working circuit should show an inverse &#34;K&#34; in 
the bottom left of the screen.</SPAN></p>

<p><img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/build/kDisplay.jpg" width="400" height="29"/></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Here is my completed (fully working) rebuild next to the 
original...</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN size="5" face="Arial"><b>
<a name="Construction"></a>CONSTRUCTION (STRIPBOARD VERSION)</b> </SPAN> </p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The complete computer is built on a large piece of perforated stripboard. All digital
connections are made using wire-wrap wire as this is a lot thinner than conventional
hook-up wire so the data and address bundles can be tied to form a neat layout. The
positioning of the ICs in relation to each other matches the positioning in the original
ZX80. </SPAN> </p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">I recommend printing the <a href="#Circuit">circuit</a> out on an A3 sheet if 
possible. The pin numbers are easier to read on my re-drawn schematic than on 
the original scan, and my version has corrected the errors found on the original 
version.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Begin construction by positioning the IC sockets (see my pictures below for 
guidance), ensuring there is sufficient space between then to make all of the 
connections, and position the remaining components.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">I would recommend that you adopt a layout similar to Sinclair&#39;s (that is what 
I did).</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Here is my re-drawn version of the layout found in the ZX80 assembly manual:</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">The pale-green components are not actually used in the circuit, but there are 
spaces for them on the PCB.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial"><i>As you can see, the component placement is in a similar manner to the 
original. The two original RAM chips replaced with a single larger one instead.</i></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Next I recommend wiring the data and address buses for the 
top half of the circuit. As each wire is soldered it, mark it off on the circuit 
diagram. This helps avoid any errors resulting from missing connections. Wire in 
the logic ICs, resistors, capacitors and diodes. As virtually all pins on every 
IC are to be connected, any errors made will become obvious as more connections 
are made. For initial testing, there is no need to wire the keyboard into the 
circuit. </SPAN> </p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Once all components are soldered and without any ICs inserted into the sockets, connect
a continuity tester between the power supply pins. If a short exists then check the
underside of the board for any missing track breaks or flakes of copper between tracks. If
all is well connect a power supply (current regulated to 500mA if possible). Check the +5V
and 0V connections on each IC socket. Turn off the supply and insert the ICs. Turn on the
power supply and the television or monitor. If the circuit is working then expect a power
consumption of around 310mA. If using a TV then adjust the tuning to get a picture (note:
the display of black text on white will require the brightness control of the TV to be
turned up). A working circuit should show an inverse &#34;K&#34; in the bottom left of
the screen. If all is well then wire in the keyboard if not already done. </SPAN> </p>

fitting</SPAN></b></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">Â The 27128 is a 28 pin device, but the board only 
allows for a 24 pin ROM, so a piggy-back board is required to allow a larger 
device to be fitted.</SPAN></p>

<img src="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/upgrade16K_EPROM.jpg" width="400" height="217"/></SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN face="Arial">There is a jumper on the board to allow the top address 
line (A13) to be switched between 0V and Vcc. This way, both the ZX80 and ZX81 
images can be on the same EPROM (I recomment ZX80 ROM occupying 0K-4K, ZX81 ROM 
occupying 8K-16K), and the jumper allows selection between the 
two. If you are building the <a href="http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/zx80nmi.html">ZX81 NMI generator (ZX80 to 
ZX81 upgrade)</a>, then this A13 address line can be connected to the NMI GEN 
ENABLE input so that the NMI generator is automatically enabled if the ZX81 ROM 
is enabled. Below is a view of the top and bottom of the adapter board. Many pins are 
in the same positions as the original ROM. The others are wired to the correct 
pins on the EPROM.</SPAN></p>
