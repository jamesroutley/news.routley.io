    <h1>Shell closes all of its hydrogen refuelling stations for cars in California</h1>

This was due to a number of market factors.”</p> <p>Shell previously told <i>Hydrogen Insight</i> in December that it would prioritise hydrogen for heavy-duty mobility, while investing in EV charging to decarbonise light-duty vehicles.</p> <p>This decision could also reflect a lack of demand. While California was one of the few markets for hydrogen-powered vehicles to grow this year, only 3,143 were registered in 2023 — less than 1% of battery-electric cars in the same period, according to the most recent figures from the California Energy Commission.</p> <p>The oil major had in 2022 closed down all three of its hydrogen filling stations in the UK, with the company and its partner Motive citing a similar focus on serving heavy-duty trucks, which the sites would not be able to accommodate.</p> <p>While Shell has not given any further reasons for its decision to close down its California sites, the oil major had also used filling station equipment supplied by Norway’s Nel — currently at the centre of a <a href="https://www.hydrogeninsight.com/transport/fraud-false-promises-concealment-iwatani-files-lawsuit-against-nel-over-faulty-hydrogen-refuelling-stations/2-1-1595967" target="_blank">lawsuit by industrial gas company Iwatani</a>, which alleges major defects in its H2Station range.</p> <p><i>This article was updated on 9 February to add a new quote from Shell.</i></p></div></div></div>
