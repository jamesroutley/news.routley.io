    <h1>White Hat Hackers Expose Iridium Satellite Security Flaws</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="White Hat Hackers Expose Iridium Satellite Security Flaws"><div><p><span>In a recent demonstration, German white hat <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hackers">hackers</a> showed how to intercept text messages sent via the U.S. satellite communication system <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/iridium">Iridium</a> and locate users with an accuracy of about 4 kilometers.</span></p><p>The two<strong></strong>hackers, known publicly only under the nicknames Sec and Schneider, made the revelations during a presentation at the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/infos/index.html" target="_blank">Chaos Communication Congress</a> in late December in Hamburg, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/germany">Germany</a>. During the talk, they highlighted severe vulnerabilities in services that tens of thousands of users from the U.S. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-defense">Department of Defense</a> rely on.</p><p>Although the DoD uses a secure gateway to route and encrypt its traffic, the hackers were able to see which devices were connecting via the DoD pathway. That allowed the duo to identify and locate DoD users with an accuracy of about 4 km using a home-assembled eavesdropping kit consisting of a commercially available Iridium antenna, a <a data-linked-post="2658479890" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/passive-radar-with-sdr" target="_blank">software-defined radio</a> receiver and a basic computer, such as the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> N100 mobile <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cpu">CPU</a> or the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> mini-computer. </p><p>“We see devices that register with the DoD service center and then we can find their positions from these registrations,” Sec said during the talk. “You don’t have to see the communication from the actual phone to the network, you just see the network’s answer with the position, and you then can map where all the registered devices are.”</p><h2>Iridium’s Legacy Components Still Cause Problems</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.iridium.com/network/" target="_blank">Iridium constellation</a>, first deployed in the late 1990s, is made up of 66 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellites">satellites</a> disbursed across six orbital planes roughly 870 km above Earth. The constellation, the first to have provided global commercial <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellite-communications">satellite communications</a> services, supports satellite <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telephony">telephony</a> and connects pagers, emergency beacons, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things">Internet of Things</a> devices all over the world. Out of Iridium’s 2.3 million subscribers, 145,000 are U.S. government customers. Iridium receivers are also frequently used by vessels at sea and by aircraft pilots exchanging information with other airplanes and with ground control.</p><p>“Back then <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/encryption">encryption</a> was not something on everyone’s mind,” Sec said during the presentation. “All the [first generation] Iridium data is unencrypted.” (Iridium didn’t respond to a request to comment.)</p><p>Iridium replaced its first-generation fleet with more secure satellites (the second-generation <a href="https://www.iridium.com/blog/iridium-next-review/" target="_blank">NEXT constellation</a>) between 2017 and 2019. But according to satellite and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telecommunications-industry">telecommunications industry</a> analyst Christian von der Ropp, many Iridium devices in use today, including civilian <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellite-phones">satellite phones</a>, still rely on the first-generation Iridium radio protocol that has no <a data-linked-post="2666125398" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fully-homomorphic-encryption" target="_blank">encryption</a>.</p><p>“The regular satellite phones that they sell still operate under the old legacy protocol,” says von der Ropp. “If you buy a brand-new civilian Iridium phone, it still operates using the 30-year-old radio protocol, and it is subject to the same vulnerability. So, you can intercept everything. You can listen to the voice calls, you can read <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/sms">SMS</a>, absolutely everything. Out of the box it’s a totally unsecure service.”</p><p>Von der Ropp estimates that tens or even hundreds of thousands of Iridium devices in use today rely on the old, unsecured radio protocol. </p><h2>Hackers Reveal Vulnerabilities in Iridium’s Systems</h2><p>While the DoD uses an extra layer of encryption to protect the content of its exchanges, other nations’ agencies appear to be less aware of the vulnerabilities. In perhaps the most jaw-dropping moment of the hacking demonstration, Sec revealed a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/text-message">text message</a> exchanged between two employees of the German Foreign Office that he and Schneider were able to intercept.</p><p>“I need a good doctor in [Tel Aviv] who can also look at gunshot wounds. Can you send me a number ASAP,” read the message sent by a worker at the Crisis Response Center of the German Foreign Office’s mission in Tel Aviv. The hackers did not reveal when the exchange had taken place. </p><p>Using software he and Schneider had created, Sec also showed a map of devices visible in a single moment to their eavesdropping gear located in Munich. Iridium devices as far as London, central <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/norway">Norway</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/syria">Syria</a> (more than 3,000 km away) could be seen.</p><p>“With US $400 worth of equipment and freely available software, you can start right away intercepting Iridium communications in an area with a diameter of hundreds, sometimes even thousands of kilometers,” said von der Ropp, who was present at the demonstration. “The Iridium signal is divided into spot beams that are about 400 km wide. In principle, one should only be able to listen to the spot beam overhead. But the signal is so strong that you can also detect many of the surrounding spot beams, sometimes up to 2,000 km away.”</p><p>The DoD, von der Ropp said, is looking for alternatives to Iridium, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/starlink">Starlink</a>. Still, last year Iridium won a $94 million contract to provide communication services to the U.S. Space Force. </p><p>Von der Ropp noted that few Iridium users seemed to be active in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, suggesting the local forces are potentially aware of Iridium’s shortcomings. The vulnerability of satellite systems and services to disruption and interference by bad actors has become a hot topic since Russia’s invasion of the country three years ago. The widespread cyberattack on the ground infrastructure of satellite communication provider Viasat crippled the Ukrainian forces’ access to satcom services on the eve of the invasion. The incident, which  according to analysts was planned by Russian state-backed hackers for months, revealed the weakness of Viasat’s cyber defenses. </p><p>Since then, the number of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cyberattacks">cyberattacks</a> on satcom providers has increased exponentially. Global navigation and positioning satellite systems such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/GPS">GPS</a> have also been put to the test. <a data-linked-post="2659993248" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-jamming" target="_blank">Signal jamming</a> is now a regular occurrence even outside conflict zones and instances of sophisticated <a data-linked-post="2670499105" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/gps-spoofing-2670499105" target="_blank">spoofing attacks</a>, designed to confuse users and send them to wrong locations, are becoming increasingly common.</p></div></div></div>
