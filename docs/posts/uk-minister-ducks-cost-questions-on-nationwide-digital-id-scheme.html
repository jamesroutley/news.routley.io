    <h1>UK minister ducks cost questions on nationwide digital ID scheme</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A UK tech minister has declined to put a figure on the cost of the government&#39;s digital ID plans as MPs question the contributions expected from central departments.</p>
<p>Speaking to a House of Commons select committee this week, minister for digital government and data Ian Murray defended the government&#39;s decision not to publish budgeted costs of its plans to build digital IDs for every citizen.</p>

<p>In September, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/26/uk_digital_id_confirmed/">the government announced</a> plans to issue all legal residents a digital identity by August 2029, which in the first instance is set to be used to prove eligibility to work. Prime minister Keir Starmer said digital IDs were &#34;an enormous opportunity for the UK.&#34; As well as making it tougher to work illegally, they would also &#34;offer ordinary citizens countless benefits, like being able to prove your identity to access key services swiftly,&#34; he said.</p>
<p>The plan is to use smartphones to store digital IDs and build on existing work to introduce a government digital wallet including driving licenses.</p>
<p>Appearing before the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee this week, Murray said budgets for the project had yet to be determined, although the technical delivery will be managed by the Government Digital Service (GDS), within the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).</p>

    

<p>&#34;In terms of the cost [it is to] be determined by what the system looks like, and that can only really be measured after the consultation has been closed and analyzed,&#34; he said.</p>

        


        

<p>Murray said those initial costs would come from the DSIT settlement in the spending review period, although other departments will be expected to contribute as use cases are produced.</p>
<p>&#34;The cost of the entire system will depend on what the system looks like,&#34; he said. &#34;Digital inclusion, all the bits that are attached to digital ID, and also the use cases from other government departments in terms of both the cost of having the system, the cost of running the system, and the savings that are subsequently made from having a much more efficient system.&#34;</p>

        

<p>Kit Malthouse, Conservative MP and committee member, questioned whether departments expected to contribute would be able to protect that funding.</p>

</ul>
<p>&#34;We may be in a position then where the home secretary says, &#39;Right, you&#39;re asking for £500 million for this thing that may yield savings. But you know what? That&#39;s £500 million. I&#39;d have to take from policing or border security, so I don&#39;t want your service. Thanks very much. Go and look elsewhere.&#39; The delivery of it will be down effectively to negotiation with departments,&#34; he said.</p>
<p>Murray responded that the digital ID scheme was &#34;the prime ministerial priority, and therefore GDS, in terms of digital ID, will build the system under the monitoring and policy development of the Cabinet Office.&#34;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the minister said his department had decided not to appoint another chief digital officer (CDO) to replace the outgoing Joanna Davinson, who was interim CDO from December 2024 to September 2025, a post she had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/11/uk_chief_digital_officer_departs/">previously held</a> on a permanent basis. The responsibilities would now become part of the role of the permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant in the department.</p>
<p>&#34;Keeping these issues at permanent secretary level is the way to get a cross-government approach to it,&#34; he said.</p>

        

<p>However, committee chair Chi Onwurah questioned whether the permanent secretary would necessarily have the experience of digital transformation needed for the CDO role.</p>
<p>Murray also explained that the government&#39;s &#34;AI roadmap&#34; had been delayed owing to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/08/uk_cabinet_reshuffle_tech/">the change in the technology minister in September</a>. ®</p>
