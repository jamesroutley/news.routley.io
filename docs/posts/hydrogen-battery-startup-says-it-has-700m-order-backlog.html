    <h1>Hydrogen battery startup says it has $700M order backlog</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div data-io-article-url="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/hydrogen-battery-start-up-says-it-has-700m-order-backlog-for-utility-scale-renewables-projects/2-1-1266148"><p>An Australian start-up that has invented a $20,000 hydrogen battery for the home says it has lined up more than A$1bn ($692m) of orders for a utility-scale version of the system that is still in development.</p>  <p><b><a href="https://lavo.com.au/" target="_blank">Lavo</a></b>’s hydrogen energy storage system has been designed to store rooftop solar energy by converting electricity to hydrogen via an electrolyser and storing that H<sub>2</sub> in a patented solid metal hydride. The hydrogen is later converted back to electricity using a fuel cell inside its 1.7- by 1.2-metre box, which also contains a lithium-ion battery and a water purifier that enables the system to run on tap water.</p> <p>It is said to be able to store enough energy to run the average Australian house for two days without recharging.</p> <p>The company’s chief operating officer, Jacques Markgraaf, told local politicians at a “technical briefing” in New South Wales on Friday that Lavo had taken deposits on A$65m of orders for its 40kWh domestic unit from customers in 40 countries.</p> <p>But, according to local newspaper group <b><a href="https://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/story/7832245/orders-top-1b-for-hunter-made-hydrogen-battery/">ACM</a></b>, he explained: “We&#39;re also developing a much larger utility-scale unit called EOS for a solar farm or wind farm.</p> <p>“It gives an owner of a solar or wind farm the opportunity to effectively increase your rate of return on that asset.”</p> <p>But despite the fact that EOS is not even mentioned on the company website, Markgraaf added: “In the utility space, we have over a billion dollars of orders sitting there.</p> <p>“For us this is clearly a massive priority to get this out on to solar farms.</p> <p>“We&#39;ve got commercial commitments to do that.”</p> <p>To date, only prototypes of the Lavo domestic system have been built, and the company has not yet decided where to build a factory.</p> <p>But Lavo technical director Darren Jones suggested that the production of the utility-scale units might be outsourced, saying that firms such as the manufacturer Varley — which built the prototypes in the Hunter region of New South Wales — were “very well placed” to build them.</p> <p>Lavo, which was launched in October 2020, received A$5m from the New South Wales state government in January to expand its prototyping, testing and pilot manufacturing at Varley.</p> <p>Lavo is named after the renowned 18th-century French chemist <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier" target="_blank">Antoine Lavoisier</a></b>, who gave hydrogen its name — “water-former” in Greek — and was executed in the French Revolution before being posthumously exonerated.</p></div></div></div>
