    <h1>Feedback on feed stuff and those pesky blue screens</h1>
    
    
<p>
Wow, okay, things are cooking today.  I posted last night with the 
results of the feed readers which were still actively pinging the test 
feed.  I&#39;ve heard from several feed reader authors, and they&#39;re cranking 
away at stuff!  They obviously care a lot about doing the right thing.
</p>
<p>
One of them even put up a post already, and so I feel obliged to share 
it:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://inessential.com/2024/08/03/netnewswire_and_conditional_get_issues.html">NetNewsWire and Conditional GET Issues</a>
</p>
<p>
That post actually has a link to the report page, so if you want to see 
what a real batch of data looks like, there you go.
</p>
<p>
There are some non-feed-reader bits of feedback I&#39;d like to address, 
too.

One reader asked for my take on the whole CrowdStrike thing.  This is 
where they shipped some update to a bunch of Windows machines and nuked 
them.  I get the impression that this was something that ran rather low 
in the stack and had the ability to pretty much take control of the 
whole machine... or kill it entirely, as it turned out.
</p>
<p>
When stuff like this happens, I fall back to pointing out something that 
we tried to make into a &#34;thing&#34; at FB in the fall of 2014.  There had 
been *far* too many outages in a really short period of time.  It had 
started with 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/03/05/outage/">&#34;Call the Cops&#34; </a>
(10 years ago now - August 1st!), and a month later we were getting 
tired of outages every Friday at 3 PM - I started calling it &#34;SEV 
O&#39;Clock&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The notion we tried to get known far and wide was &#34;nothing goes 
everywhere at once&#34;.  This means that code pushes, config changes, and 
even flag flips should happen piecemeal.  Don&#39;t go from 0 to 100% in a 
single step.  Take a bit and space it out.  If you can&#39;t space it out, 
ask yourself why, then see if you can make it happen.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen some amazing things almost happen.  One company was in the 
quiet period prior to their IPO when the execs know when it&#39;ll happen 
but the rest of us are in the dark.  Basically, it could happen *any 
day*, and the bigwigs are out schmoozing with the press.  It&#39;s the last 
time you want to tank the site, service, or whatever.
</p>
<p>
Once, I overheard some people saying they were going to convert the 
entire site&#39;s user database from goofy not-SQL db flavor A to goofy 
not-SQL db flavor B in one fell swoop on Sunday night.  It was 
Thursday.  I asked if they had a way to back out.  Nope, it was a 
one-way trip.  I asked if they could do it in stages.  Nope, it was all 
or nothing.
</p>
<p>
&#34;So you want to do something that will affect everyone at once, with no 
way back, on a weekend... during the IPO road show?&#34;
</p>
<p>
They reconsidered.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, I have no idea if the CrowdStrike thing rolled out as fast 
as possible or if it had stages.  It seems like if it had a phased 
rollout, then it might&#39;ve nuked a few machines in a few places, but then 
the alarms would have gone off and they would have hit the big red STOP 
button... right?  All of those hosts disappearing right after getting 
our update means something, doesn&#39;t it?

Well, look at that. &#34;Breach hull--all die.&#34; Even had it underlined.
