    <h1>Ask HN: How do you find part time work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have a project that I&#39;m working on turning into a small business. I&#39;ve done some part-time work (retainers and project-based) over the past year and it&#39;s gone well. It&#39;s relatively high pay for part-time work, leaving me time and flexibility to work on my own project.</p><p>The thing, I haven&#39;t really put much work into finding this kind of work. I&#39;ve had a few opportunities land in my lap pretty nicely. Now, I need to seek out more work like this. I have ideas, but I&#39;m curious to see how others are finding part-time work. Ideally, I would get 10-15/hr a week retainers, but project-based work is ok too. The key is that I can keep getting the work with consistency.</p><p>My corporate career was a cross between engineering and product management. I truly believe my best utility is the cross-over of the two. I&#39;d be happy to do part-time leadership for small teams, take on independent projects, do things like build and maintain small apps/integrations, etc.</p><p>So:</p><p>1) How are you finding part-time work?</p><p>2) How do you sell yourself if you&#39;re more of a generalist like me?</p></div></div></div>
