    <h1>Prusa CORE One: Our new fully-enclosed CoreXY 3D printer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>I‚Äôm really excited that I can finally unveil the new Prusa CORE One! Not just here, with text and a 10-minute video deep dive, but also <strong>live at FormNext in Frankfurt.</strong> So if you‚Äôre visiting, stop by our booth at Hall 12.1 / stand G39. We‚Äôd love to see you and show you our new flagship machine!</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here, so let‚Äôs dive right in!</p>

<p>The CORE One is <strong>a fully enclosed CoreXY 3D printer with active temperature control.</strong> It‚Äôs a machine focused on quality and speed, and it‚Äôs extremely rugged. You can find the complete list of technical specifications <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the product page</a>, but let me give you a detailed insight first.</p>
<p>With the CORE One, you won‚Äôt need one printer for fast prototypes, another for demanding materials, and yet another for great dimensional accuracy ‚Äì it‚Äôs a versatile, all-in-one machine. It has a compact footprint but <strong>a large print volume (250√ó220√ó270 mm)</strong>, and there are plenty of clever design choices, e.g. <strong>an exoskeleton design</strong> for maximum firmness and robustness. One of the standout things is that it allows you to <strong>print PLA and PETG with closed doors</strong> ‚Äì which is not as common as you might think. We poured all our knowledge from developing the XL, AFS, and even HT90 into it and I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôll be as excited as we are! üôÇ <strong>Shipping starts in January 2025!</strong></p>


<p>Now, the important thing here is that <strong>the CORE One is designed to live alongside the MK4S,</strong> it‚Äôs not supposed to be its successor and <strong>we will continue manufacturing and supporting the MK4S</strong> with firmware updates and even additional accessories, such as a USB-C camera for print monitoring. If you mainly print with PLA and PETG, an open-frame printer is an excellent choice (I‚Äôll get to the how and why in a minute). The CORE One is the first of a new product line, hence the different name. I know we released the MK4S quite recently, but with Black Friday deals and Xmas coming, we wanted to announce our new machine ahead of these events, so there are no sudden surprises coming a few days after you unpack your MK4S you got for the holidays. Unveiling it at Formnext was the best possible opportunity.</p>

<p>The CORE One‚Äôs development is now wrapped, and we‚Äôre finishing the last stages of testing, with <strong>full production starting in January 2025.</strong> We‚Äôre showing off several units in Frankfurt right now and we already use <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CORE One</a> printers in our internal print farm.</p>
<h3>A fully enclosed 3D printer ‚Äì with a twist!</h3>
<p>We know CoreXY machines through and through ‚Äì after all, we have the Original Prusa XL and the Prusa Pro AFS. While CoreXY is seen by many as the ‚Äúnext step in 3D printing‚Äù, it‚Äôs not necessarily true ‚Äì there are some drawbacks. The MK4S still offers outstanding printing quality, high speeds, and easy access to all components. And speaking of AFS: we couldn‚Äôt simply take the printer from it and turn it into a mass-produced machine because it wasn‚Äôt designed to be individually enclosed.</p>
<p>However, we put a lot into the research of heated chambers and cooling with the Prusa Pro HT90 and we wanted these technologies to trickle down into other products. An enclosed CoreXY 3D printer is nothing new these days, so <strong>we had to make sure we‚Äôd bring something new and useful to the table.</strong></p>

<p>We focused on three main areas when engineering the new machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clever exoskeleton design</strong> with high-quality materials</li>
<li><strong>Super-compact chamber capable of reaching 55 ¬∞C</strong> with active temperature control so it can print anything from PLA with the door closed to PA11 Nylon in top quality</li>
<li><strong>A new platform for the future,</strong> that‚Äôs not a welded or glued box which is impossible to repair</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I don‚Äôt need to mention that we wanted to keep our signature qualities ‚Äì like outstanding print quality, long-term reliability, premium materials, low maintenance, and the ‚Äúmade to last‚Äù approach. Those are the things you probably expect from us by default. üôÇ</p>
<p>The new design is based on <strong>an exoskeleton structure,</strong> often seen in nature (crustaceans, insects), where the outside skin serves as structural support for the body. In our case, it leads to both <strong>improved printer robustness and great efficiency of manufacturing:</strong> the same parts serve as the printer frame and also provide the final design. So unlike other printers, this isn‚Äôt a welded cube with an enclosure around it or an open-frame printer in a box.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prusa3d-content-prod-14e8-wordpress-blog-prod/2024/11/585d1569-exoskeleton-4-1-ezgif.com-optimize.gif" alt="" width="540" height="304"/></p>
<p>Thanks to the space-efficient body with recesses on both sides, <strong>the super-compact chamber can warm up faster and reach up to 55 ¬∞C.</strong> This is perfect for advanced materials (ASA, ABS, PC, Nylon) which require stable, elevated temperatures. But we wanted to take the heated chamber one step further.</p>
<p>The back of the printer hosts dual fans for <strong>active chamber temperature control.</strong> When you print with PLA or PETG, the fans ensure the temperature inside is as low as possible for maximum print quality.</p>
<p>And this is really important: <strong>about 90 percent of all prints are made with PLA or PETG.</strong> These materials perform rather poorly in elevated temperatures. This is why it‚Äôs a common practice for manufacturers (yes, even us ‚Äì check the MK4S Enclosure instructions!) to ask you to remove the top enclosure panel and/or keep the printer‚Äôs door open. And honestly, the door panel then sticks out like a sore thumb, and many users are not even aware they should do this. To put it simply: Keeping the doors open goes completely against the idea and benefits of an enclosed printer.</p>

<p>However, <strong>the Prusa CORE One prints PLA and PETG beautifully even with the door closed,</strong> all nice and tidy. üôÇ The only thing you need to do is to open a tiny vent on top of the printer, so the fans can draw colder air from the room.</p>

<p>And one more thing regarding the door (as well as all other transparent panels). They are made from a high-end polymer, so they are <strong>virtually indestructible</strong> ‚Äì perfect for any kind of workplace and also super safe for transport. We didn‚Äôt want to use glass because it‚Äôs simply way too fragile.</p>
<p>We made the body of the printer <strong>as compact as possible</strong> and implemented various smart design choices. For instance, the spool is not in a hard-to-reach space (i.e., on the back). Instead, it sits nicely on the side in a recess, so it‚Äôs perfectly flush with the side of the printer, keeping a small footprint. The other recess can be easily used for all sorts of holders, organizers, and other things you design. The overall space (w√ód√óh) you need for the CORE One is <strong>30% smaller compared to the MK4S</strong> and a whole <strong>50% smaller compared to the MK4S in the Enclosure</strong> while offering a <strong>30% increase in print volume!</strong></p>

<h3>Focused on Outstanding Print Quality</h3>
<p>The CORE One is equipped with our Nextruder ‚Äì and all 3D printers that used it so far <strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/original-prusa-mk4s-3d-printer-review#section-original-prusa-mk4s-print-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received top scores</a> in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/original-prusa-xl-review#section-original-prusa-xl-print-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">print quality benchmarks</a>.</strong> It features the upgraded 360¬∞ cooling from the MK4S for outstanding print quality and <a href="https://all3dp.com/1/overhang-shootout-original-prusa-mk4s-vs-bambu-lab-x1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great overhang performance</a> ‚Äì this means you can use fewer supports with your prints (or no supports at all), saving both material and print time.</p>

<p>The Nextruder has all the proven features for effortless, high-quality printing ‚Äì this includes <strong>the extremely precise Loadcell sensor for an always-perfect first layer.</strong> The Loadcell sensor does not rely on visual data. It cannot be thrown off by reflective or textured surfaces, doesn‚Äôt need to be recalibrated every time you swap the nozzle or hotend, and it‚Äôs so good it can pretty much create a beautiful first layer even on a piece of wood. You also get easy access to quick-swap hotends, a high-flow nozzle as a standard and more.</p>

<p>And while the MK4S was already pretty damn fast, and it could beat some of the fastest printers on the market, the CORE One goes further, reducing the print time by another 15-20% depending on the type of the project. However, there‚Äôs a massive advantage: you don‚Äôt have to limit your projects by a narrow selection of special ‚Äúhigh-speed‚Äù filaments. <strong>The CORE One is simply fast with any filament on the market,</strong> you won‚Äôt find any fine print or asterisks next to our numbers. It‚Äôs high speed without a catch.</p>

<p>The CORE One performs incredibly well with a huge range of materials thanks to the chamber that heats up to 55 ¬∞C. <strong>From PLA and PETG to ASA, ABS, and PC, all the way to demanding materials like Polyamides (Nylon).</strong> This way, the CORE One covers pretty much every field: from effortless and hassle-free printing at home to the production of fast prototypes, durable functional parts, and even final products ready to be sent to customers.</p>

<h3>CoreXY ‚Äì Prusa Style</h3>
<p>We have always designed our machines as 3D printing workhorses, because <strong>we rely on them in our manufacturing, too.</strong> We run a 3D print farm with over 600 printers and the compact design of the CORE One will allow us to fit even more machines in the same space. And we have done more things to make the CORE One <strong>the ultimate print farm machine:</strong> compact footprint is one thing, but there‚Äôs more. Thanks to the fans in the back, you can connect the printer to the air extraction system, the door opens to 180¬∞ so they don‚Äôt stick out and won‚Äôt block a more narrow space/corridor. You can even flip the hinges and the door to the other side. And the entire machine was made with <strong>low maintenance and a long lifespan</strong> in mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/prusa3d-content-prod-14e8-wordpress-blog-prod/2024/11/b99dd73a-flip-door-2-5-ezgif.com-optimize-1.gif" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1035574366" data-slb-group="105477"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/prusa3d-content-prod-14e8-wordpress-blog-prod/2024/11/b99dd73a-flip-door-2-5-ezgif.com-optimize-1.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338"/></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm always saying there will never be a part on our machines just for design. Everything has its purpose. The majority of materials used are easily recyclable indefinitely and <strong>they will last a lifetime.</strong> For the frame, we‚Äôre using laser-cut steel profiles, which is a really efficient, but also incredibly precise manufacturing method (with &lt;0.1 mm tolerances). The same applies to the CoreXY gantry, which is a rectangle made from a single piece of solid steel ‚Äì this makes it <strong>incredibly sturdy and always perpendicular.</strong> So it‚Äôs impossible to assemble the XY axes wrong (trust me ‚Äì we‚Äôve tried).</p>

<p>Plastic parts are made from tough polycarbonate filled with carbon fiber. Nothing is welded, everything is connected by regular screws, so <strong>you can literally take the entire printer apart with a simple screwdriver.</strong> We definitely didn‚Äôt want to reduce the repairability: in fact, we improved it spectacularly ‚Äì for example, the CoreXY functional assembly can be replaced in under 20 minutes. And if an idler wears out after thousands and thousands of hours of printing? You simply remove a few screws and replace it ‚Äì also because we have spare parts available for years. There is also another great advantage of the design, it is easily scalable ‚Äì allowing us to be incredibly nimble in future projects. It is designed to be a forever workhorse, easy to work on, easy to upgrade, performant, and truly the next chapter in our industrial design.</p>

<p>Still, the Core ONE is <strong>a true plug-and-print machine.</strong> Simply unpack it, plug it in, run a quick one-time calibration, and you‚Äôre all set ‚Äì under 10 minutes. If you have one of our printers, you‚Äôll feel right at home. And if you‚Äôre completely new to 3D printing, you‚Äôll find the CORE One to be an incredibly easy first step into this world. It‚Äôs the kind of ‚Äústart and forget‚Äù type of machine, where you simply start the print and the rest happens fully automatically without any user input. Plus, as always, we have plenty of <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusa-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prusa Academy courses</a> available, tutorials, guides, and more.</p>
<h3>Make it your own!</h3>
<p>Since we‚Äôre using proper metal almost everywhere, you can easily design all sorts of holders, organizers and shelves, and <strong>attach them using magnets</strong> to the side of the printer ‚Äì the empty recess on the left side is the ideal space for such projects. This also opens a huge field for all sorts of <strong>customizations, mods, and tweaks.</strong> I can already see these printers disguised as a Claptrap from Borderlands or maybe reskinned with Star Wars themes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôll see some really creative ideas!</p>

<p>You‚Äôre more than welcome to modify the printed components, attach new parts using magnets or screws, and generally play around with the CORE One as much as you like. Of course, <strong>our software and firmware are open-source,</strong> giving you even more things to play with. And this is where we felt there was room for improvement.</p>
<p>Historically, in order to flash custom firmware to all our printers equipped with the Buddy board you had to break a special seal and that meant losing your warranty. Not anymore: <strong>we‚Äôre making a huge positive change</strong> with the aim to make the printer even more community-friendly and motivate developers to dig into the code and come up with all sorts of tweaks and customizations. From now on, breaking the seal <strong>won‚Äôt void your warranty,</strong> so you are free to flash custom firmware. However, since there is no way for us to verify or test every single custom firmware on the internet, we disclaim liability for any kind of damage or harm a printer with a broken seal may cause. This applies to MK4/S, XL, MINI, and also to the new CORE One. So, please, don‚Äôt mindlessly flash suspicious files. üôÇ</p>

<h3>Expand it with add-ons!</h3>
<p>The <strong>GPIO hackerboard</strong> and accelerometer are fully compatible right from the start. The GPIO module is an excellent tool for modders, hackers, and tinkerers who love adding new features to their 3D printers. It connects to the I2C port on the xBuddy board, enabling you to control and receive input from external devices. You can create a trigger for your camera and slider to capture precise timelapse photos, control external LED lighting, control servos, and much more‚Äîyou name it! You can set all the commands directly in PrusaSlicer.</p>
<p>The accelerometer is not needed for our factory-tuned machines, but it will come in handy for all printer developers and modders. With it, you can easily measure the resonance frequency of a <strong>custom print head</strong> and recalibrate your Input Shaper to the optimal values.</p>

<p>And more accessories are coming: we‚Äôre finishing the development of <strong>two types of filtration</strong> (HEPA filter and advanced filtration system) <strong>and a drybox.</strong> We‚Äôll send out a newsletter once these accessories become available.</p>

<p>Plus, you can count on full support for the most efficient single-nozzle multi-color solution, <strong>the MMU3.</strong> The unit is fully compatible with the Prusa CORE One and it will allow you to print beautiful, colorful objects with up to five filaments at the same time. Unlike other multi-filament printers, which can produce a surprising amount of waste (sometimes nearly matching the weight of your printed object) our printer uses an innovative compact wipe tower to manage filament changes. This not only reduces the wasted filament but also minimizes waste to a single, tidy block.</p>

<h3>Introducing Buddy3D Camera</h3>
<p>With the Prusa CORE One, we‚Äôre also introducing <strong>a new optional camera</strong> that will be published under our new Buddy3D brand. Buddy3D will encompass all sorts of 3D printer accessories made by external vendors, but fully under our supervision and control. This is the same case with the camera. It will be available as a small module to be placed inside the chamber of the CORE One and connected via a USB-C cable to the mainboard. The firmware for the camera was made under our strict supervision, so <strong>we can guarantee 100% security.</strong></p>

<p>The camera is scheduled to be ready in the same timeframe as the Prusa CORE One, so stay tuned ‚Äì we will give you the option to edit your order and add the camera in case you order the printer before the camera becomes available. The same camera, although in a different body, <strong>will also be available for the MK4S and XL. </strong>Please note that the camera requires an active Wi-Fi connection and it is fully integrated with <a href="https://connect.prusa3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prusa Connect</a> and Prusa App.</p>
<h3>Seamless workflow, 100% security</h3>
<p>Years ago, when we launched the Original Prusa MK2, it was a pretty big deal to distribute a custom-made slicer and factory-tested print profiles with it. Then we added <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusament/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prusament</a>. And <a href="https://connect.prusa3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prusa Connect</a>. And <a href="https://www.printables.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Printables</a>, Prusa App, <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusa-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academy</a>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Now, with the Prusa CORE One, you‚Äôll get a ticket into the entire ‚ÄúPrusaverse‚Äù :-). <strong>Everything you need is under one roof.</strong> You can download hundreds of thousands of free 3D models from Printables.com ‚Äì in fact, you can send them directly into PrusaSlicer with a single click, slice them, and send them over the network for instant printing. You can take advantage of our <strong>remote print management system,</strong> Prusa Connect, or the native iOS/Android Prusa App if you want to monitor your prints remotely ‚Äì but it‚Äôs completely optional. If you prefer, you can still use a standard USB drive to transfer files.</p>

<p>All the high-quality filaments we manufacture in-house have their own profiles in PrusaSlicer, but we also prepare profiles for a ton of third-party filaments (200+ in total) so you‚Äôll always get the best performance, no matter which material you choose. You don‚Äôt have to be a pro to get pro-level results.</p>
<p><strong>And we always put security first.</strong> We will never force you to connect your printer to the network ‚Äì not for the initial configuration, not for firmware updates, not for slicing. Never. And you will still get the full experience. You can even disconnect the Wi-Fi module for the highest security workplaces. It‚Äôs completely up to you whether you want to attach a USB-C camera for print monitoring, add your printer to Prusa Connect, or monitor your prints with the Prusa App. Our code is open source, so <strong>you can always make an independent audit</strong> and check that we aren‚Äôt cheating or stealing your files, even when you‚Äôre not connected to the internet. You can sleep soundly, knowing that the product you work on won‚Äôt show up on Temu all of a sudden. üòâ</p>
<h3>One more thing‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>One thing I have not mentioned yet: upgrade kits. With our machines, there has always been an upgrade path, you could always upgrade your existing model to the latest version. Now, when you look at the new Prusa CORE One, you can see that it‚Äôs a vastly different machine compared to the MK4S. Fully enclosed with CoreXY kinematics, a much larger print volume, and so on. And yet, <strong>we made it possible to convert your current MK4S to the CORE One</strong> using a Conversion Kit. So you‚Äôre in fact turning one product line into another.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/product/mk4s-to-prusa-core-one-conversion-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prusa CORE One Conversion Kit</a></strong> is cheaper than the MK3S-&gt;MK4 upgrade kit, and it will allow you to transform your MK4S fully into the CORE One without a single compromise. We are aiming for a release date in <strong>March 2025 </strong>with the projected price of<strong> 449 USD (VAT excl.) / 489 EUR (VAT incl.).</strong></p>
<p>The conversion can be done only using the MK4S parts, not the MK4 because all components in the MK4S upgrade kit are also used for the conversion. So if you buy the MK4S in the upcoming special Black Friday deal, you‚Äôll get it right away, and you can convert to the CORE One later.</p>
<p>This also means that <strong>the CORE One offers outstanding backward compatibility.</strong> You probably know what it‚Äôs like when a new gadget, like a phone, comes out ‚Äì it‚Äôs cool but also a little inconvenient because you need to buy a new cover, maybe the charging port is different so you need a new cable, and so on. The CORE One uses the same print sheets as the MK3/MK4, and also hotends, nozzles, and other proven parts from the MK4S. This is extremely convenient if you use, e.g., dozens of our printers in your print farm as it lowers the entry costs significantly! We know many of our customers purchased extra print sheets and nozzles, and we wanted to make sure they all still fit.</p>
<p>And yes, even though the printer may look like a solid monolith, <strong>there will also be a <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prusa CORE One assembly kit!</a></strong> Assembling your own printer is still an insanely popular choice because it gives you a complete insight into how a 3D printer works. And it‚Äôs not meant just for hobbyists. Many companies purchase assembly kits alongside assembled printers so employees can learn all the ins and outs. And the CORE One is even easier to assemble the MK4S.</p>

<p>I know you‚Äôre curious to hear when the kits will become available because it may affect your business plans or purchasing decisions for the near future. So we did what we could to provide the best possible estimates. Still, please keep in mind that these are indeed estimates and they can change. For example, the shipping date of the assembly kits is heavily affected by the demand for the assembled version (since they both consume the same parts). With all of that said, our current estimation for assembly kits is <strong>April 2025, and the projected price is 949 USD (VAT excl.) / 1049 EUR (VAT incl.).</strong> We‚Äôll keep you updated!</p>
<p>And finally, the <strong><a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prusa CORE One assembled</a>:</strong> shipping starts in <strong>January 2025</strong> with the introductory price of <strong>1199 USD (VAT excl.) and 1349 EUR (VAT incl.).</strong> Visit our e-shop to learn more and see detailed technical parameters. We will share more details regarding the accessories via our newsletters.</p>
<p>So, that‚Äôs the CORE One. A fully enclosed, high-speed CoreXY 3D printer focused on quality and designed to print PLA and PETG with the door closed. We spent a lot of time making the design future-proof and modular, so we can use it as a base for upgrades for years to come, like my i3 design.</p>
<p>Happy printing!</p>
