    <h1>Meta accessed women&#39;s health data from Flo app without consent, says court</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>A jury has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/jury-rules-meta-violated-california-privacy-laws-by-collecting-menstrual-health-data-from-flo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ruled</a> that Meta accessed sensitive information from a woman’s reproductive health tracking app without consent.</p>



<p>The app in question is called Flo Health. Developed in 2015 in Belarus to track menstrual cycles, it has evolved over the years as a tracking app for highly detailed, intimate aspects of women’s reproductive health.</p>



<p>Flo Health user Erica Frasco bought a class action lawsuit against the company in 2021, following a damning <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> about its privacy infractions by the Wall Street Journal in 2019.</p>



<p>Since she downloaded the app in 2017, Frasco, like its other users, regularly answered highly intimate questions. These ranged from the timing and comfort level of menstrual cycles, through to mood swings and preferred birth control methods, and their level of satisfaction with their sex life and romantic relationships. The app even asked when users had engaged in sexual activity and whether they were trying to get pregnant.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Flo-Health-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, Flo Health promised not to share this data with third parties unless it was necessary for the provision of its services. Even then, it would not only share information relevant to web hosting and app development, it promised. It would not include “information regarding your marked cycles, pregnancy, symptoms, notes and other information entered by [users]”, reported the original complaint.</p>



<p>Yet between 2016 and 2019 Flo Health shared that intimate data with companies including Facebook and Google, along with mobile marketing firm AppsFlyer, and Yahoo!-owned mobile analytics platform Flurry. Whenever someone opened the app, it would be logged. Every interaction inside the app was also logged, and this data was shared.</p>



<p>Flo Health didn’t impose rules on how these third parties could use the data. “In fact, the terms of service governing Flo Health’s agreement with these third parties allowed them to use the data for their own purposes, completely unrelated to services provided in connection with the App,” the complaint went on.</p>



<p>By December 2020, 150 million people were using the app, according to court documents. Flo had promised them that they could trust it.</p>



<p>Users were “trusting us with intimate personal information,” it said in its privacy policy. “We are committed to keeping that trust, which is why our policy as a company is to take every step to ensure that individual user’s data and privacy rights are protected.”</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission investigated these allegations and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/192-3133-flo-health-inc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">settled</a> with Flo Health in 2021, imposing an independent review of its privacy policy and mandating that it not misrepresent its app.</p>



<p>The class action lawsuit claims common law invasion of privacy, breach of contract and implied contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of the Stored Communications Act and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. It seeks damages for plaintiffs, along with some of the company’s profit.</p>



<p>Google and Flo Health have both settled with plaintiffs already, but Meta has not. The jury ruled that Meta intentionally “eavesdropped on and/or recorded their conversations by using an electronic device,” and that it did so without consent.</p>



<p>This case is important on so many levels. Aside from general privacy concerns, women’s menstrual health is an area of particular contention after the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2022/07/roe-v-wade-how-the-cops-can-use-your-data-lock-and-code-s03e15">removed the constitutional right to abortion</a> in June 2022. That year, Meta came under scrutiny for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/this-is-the-data-facebook-gave-police-to-prosecute-a-teenager-for-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">providing police with private message data</a> between a mother and her daughter planning medication to abort a pregnancy.</p>



<p>We could simply say “Don’t use Flo Health”, but the app was trusted until it was found out. How many others are sharing data in similarly irresponsible ways? Increasingly, we lean toward simply not using apps to track sensitive data of this kind at all.</p>



<p>However, then there are the websites to worry about. A report by Propublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/websites-selling-abortion-pills-share-sensitive-data-with-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found</a> that online pharmacies selling abortion pills were sharing sensitive data with Google and others. This could give law enforcement evidence in cases against women, it said. Technology promised us convenience, but its misuse also brings serious dangers to users.</p>
