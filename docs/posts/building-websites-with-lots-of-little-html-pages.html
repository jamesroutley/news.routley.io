    <h1>Building Websites with Lots of Little HTML Pages</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>And by LLMS I mean: (L)ots of (L)ittle ht(M)l page(S).</p><p>I recently shipped some updates to my blog. Through the design/development process, I had some insights which made me question my knee-jerk reaction to building pieces of a page as JS-powered interactions on top of the existing document.</p><p>With cross-document view transitions getting broader and broader support, I’m realizing that building in-page, progressively-enhanced interactions is <em>more</em> work than simply building two HTML pages and linking them.</p><p>I’m calling this approach “lots of little HTML pages” in my head. As I find myself trying to build progressively-enhanced features with JavaScript — like a fly-out navigation menu, or an on-page search, or filtering content — I stop and ask myself: “Can I build this as a separate HTML page triggered by a link, rather than JavaScript-injected content built from a button?”</p><p>I kinda love the results. I build separate, small HTML pages for each “interaction” I want, then I let CSS transitions take over and I get something that feels better than its JS counterpart for way less work.</p><p>Allow me two quick examples.</p><h2 id="example-1-filtering">Example 1: Filtering</h2><p>Working on my homepage, I found myself wanting a list of posts filtered by some kind of criteria, like:</p><ul><li>The most recent posts</li><li>The ones being trafficked the most</li><li>The ones that’ve had lots of Hacker News traffic in the past</li></ul><p>My first impulse was to have a list of posts you can filter with JavaScript.</p><p>But the more I built it, the more complicated it got. Each “list” of posts needed a slightly different set of data. And each one had a different sort order. What I thought was going to be “stick a bunch of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s in the DOM, and show hide some based on the current filter” turned into lots of <code>data-x</code> attributes, per-list sorting logic, etc. I realized quickly this wasn’t a trivial, progressively-enhanced feature. I didn’t want to write a bunch of client-side JavaScript for what would take me seconds to write on “the server” (my static site generator).</p><p>Then I thought: Why don’t I just do this with my static site generator? Each filter can be its own, separate HTML page, and with CSS view transitions I’ll get a nice transition effect for free!</p><p>Minutes later I had it all working — mostly, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/aspect-ratio-in-css-view-transitions/">I had to learn a few small things about aspect ratio in transitions</a> — plus I had fancy transitions between “tabs” for free!</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/lots-of-small-html-filter-transitions.gif" width="480" height="462" alt="Animated gif showing a link that goes to a new document and the list re-shuffles and re-sorts its contents in an animated fashion."/></p><p>This really feels like a game-changer for simple sites. If you can keep your site simple, it’s easier to build traditional, JavaScript-powered on-page interactions as small, linked HTML pages.</p><h2 id="example-2-navigation">Example 2: Navigation</h2><p>This got me thinking: maybe I should do the same thing for my navigation?</p><p>Usually I think “Ok, so I’ll have a hamburger icon with a bunch of navigational elements in it, and when it’s clicked you gotta reveal it, etc.&#34; And I thought, “What if it’s just a new HTML page?”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>Because I’m using a static site generator, it’s really easy to create a new HTML page. A few minutes later and I had it. No client-side JS required. You navigate to the “Menu” and you get a page of options, with an “x” to simulate closing the menu and going back to where you were.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/lots-of-small-html-menu.gif" width="480" height="375" alt="Anitmated gif of a menu opening on a website (but it’s an entirely new HTML page)."/></p><p>I liked it so much for my navigation, I did the same thing with search. Clicking the icon doesn’t use JavaScript to inject new markup and animate things on screen. Nope. It’s just a link to a new page with CSS supporting a cross-document view transition.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2025/lots-of-small-html-search.gif" width="480" height="249" alt=""/></p><p>Granted, there are some trade-offs to this approach. But on the whole, I really like it. It was so easy to build and I know it’s going to be incredibly easy to maintain!</p><p>I think this is a good example of leveraging the grain of the web. It’s <em>really</em> easy to build a simple website when you can shift your perspective to viewing on-page interactivity as simple HTML page navigations powered by cross document CSS transitions (rather than doing all of that as client-side JS).</p></div></div>
