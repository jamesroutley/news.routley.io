<h2 id="progress-update">Progress update</h2>
<p>This week, I launched my practice test taking interface! I’ve
finished uploading and Q/C’ing ~15 years worth of the USNCO local exams;
it took me overall about 3-4 hours to do, so it’ll be relatively easy to
finish uploading the rest of the USNCO local and national exams this
week.</p>
<p>Alongside the test-taking interface, I launched a <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/usnco_guide/">guide to
studying for the USNCO</a> as a content marketing exercise. I ran a few
Perplexity/Google searches and found a few incomplete and uninformed
takes on this topic, so I expect my page to rank highly for any
USNCO-related queries.</p>

<p>This week, I started consulting for one of my friends to help build
AI features into his educational app. In addition to generating some
basic cashflow, this has been a great exercise for my consultant
muscles, as well as a great test of Claude for exploring wholly new
codebases.</p>
<p>This company’s codebase is a relatively old Django installation,
started perhaps 10-15 years ago, and relatively crufty. Luckily, it
looks pretty familiar, as I used Django around 10-15 years ago to build
a college Go Tournament website. But Claude was still essential to
getting up and running. Here are some of the ways that Claude has been
useful, just in the first two days.</p>
<ul>
<li>The nginx server was giving me a 502 error; I asked Claude to use
<code>docker</code> commands to inspect the logs and figure out what was
going on. It knew the right docker invocations to list containers, tail
logs, and was able to pinpoint that my React dev server was not up and
running.</li>
<li>I couldn’t get the <code>django makemigration</code> command
working. Claude was able to whip up a working migration file from
scratch.</li>
<li>Then, I couldn’t figure out how to apply the migration. Claude was
able to inpsect all the relevant dockerfiles and tell me that a
secondary worker container had an environment flag, which triggered
migrations to be executed upon startup - so restarting that secondary
worker container, rather than the main server container, was the key to
getting migrations to run.</li>
<li>After implementing some HTTP endpoints, I couldn’t figure out a CURL
command to test my own endpoint. I asked Claude to debug it, and after
perusing through the <code>urls.py</code> and <code>views.py</code>
files, it confirmed all the details of the HTTP method, form encoding,
headers, and pinpointed the error to a missing path component.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I am really tempted to just invoke all one-off
commands through Claude, to take advantage of its built-in debugging
abilities.</p>
<p>It used to be that “can a new hire merge a pull request on their
first day?” was a litmus test for how well-organized your codebase and
READMEs were. Today, despite some very stale documentation, all I really
needed was a general indication of “never mind all this legacy cruft;
this is how we develop these days” in order to get Claude on the right
trail.</p>
