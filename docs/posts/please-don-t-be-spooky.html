<div><p>A piece of advice I wish I could give my manager is <a href="https://therealadam.com/2021/11/01/dont-be-spooky/" target="_blank"><strong>don&#39;t be spooky</strong></a>.</p>
<p>My manager regularly messages me things like <em>Hey, can you talk?</em> or <em>Got a minute now?</em> Occasionally there&#39;s enough context for it not to be scary, like when we&#39;re discussing something and it&#39;s easier to just hop on a call and discuss. But often these come with no prior context, which can be very nerve-wracking, even for someone not prone to anxiety like me. Messages like these scare me and always put me on edge at the beginning of a meeting. Of course, it&#39;s usually nothing bad, but messages like this create a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety that could easily be avoided with a quick sentence or two about context.</p>
<p>Repeated pings fall under the same category. If I&#39;m available, I would have replied to you already. It&#39;s not reasonable to expect coworkers to be at their computer for every minute from 8AM to 5PM. It&#39;s normal (even beneficial) to take breaks or do things around the house. Please don&#39;t message me multiple times in quick succession if I don&#39;t respond to you immediately. <em>Everybody has their own life.</em></p>
<p>A corollary to this piece of advice I wish I could give to some other coworkers is <a href="https://nohello.net/en/" target="_blank"><strong>don&#39;t just say hello in chat</strong></a>. Look, I&#39;m all for sounding polite and nice too. But you don&#39;t have to send a naked &#34;hello&#34; on its own while you draft your request and make me wonder what&#39;s going on in the meantime. Respect other people&#39;s time by drafting your whole message (niceties and all) and sending it all in one go.</p>
