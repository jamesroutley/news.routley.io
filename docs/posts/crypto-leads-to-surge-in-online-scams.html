    <h1>Crypto leads to surge in online scams</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bogus cryptocurrency investments led to an unprecedented increase in online scams last year, according to new data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Cryptocurrency is an easy target because while it&#39;s surging in popularity, there&#39;s still a lot of confusion about how it works.</p><ul><li>This is especially true among younger people who are digitally savvy but less financially literate. </li><li>People ages 18-to-39 were more than twice as likely to report losing money to social media scams as older adults last year. </li></ul><p><strong>By the numbers:</strong> Investment-related scams on social media represented 37% of all reported losses, followed by romance scams and online shopping scams. </p><ul><li><strong>&#34;</strong>People send money, often cryptocurrency, on promises of huge returns, but end up empty handed,&#34; the FTC writes. </li><li>Even if an investment scam didn&#39;t occur happen on social media, more than half of the people who reported losses said the scam started on social media.</li><li>The FTC says one type of crypto scam reported to the agency involves someone bragging about their own success to drive people to bogus investment sites.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>While investment scams are by far the most costly for consumers, they aren&#39;t the most common. The greatest volume of complaints filed to the FCC came from rackets related to online shopping.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Fraud cases from social media now account for roughly 25% of all fraud cases in the U.S., up 18x from 2017.</p><ul><li>Last year, more than 95,000 people reported losing around $770 million to fraud schemes on social media.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>The FTC highlighted the role Facebook and Instagram play in social media fraud, noting that more than a third of people who reported losing money to an <a data-vars-link-text="online romance scam" data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/online-dating-scam-pandemic-2ce95362-3f8a-435e-ad32-db5800438b6c.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.axios.com/online-dating-scam-pandemic-2ce95362-3f8a-435e-ad32-db5800438b6c.html" target="_self">online romance scam</a> said it began on one of those platforms.</p><ul><li><strong>Nearly 9 out of 10 named</strong> Facebook or Instagram as the platform in which online shopping scams related to undelivered goods originated, the agency said.</li><li><strong>&#34;We put significant resources</strong> towards tackling this kind of fraud and abuse,&#34; said a spokesperson for parent company Meta. </li><li><strong>&#34;We also go beyond suspending</strong> and deleting accounts, Pages, and ads. We take legal action against those responsible when we can and always encourage people to report this behavior when they see it.‚Äù</li></ul><p><strong>What to watch: </strong>The FTC, which regulates advertising, noted in its report that cheap, targeted ads on social media make it easier for fraudsters to hyper-target victims using information like their interests or past purchases.</p><ul><li>Tech platforms like Google and Facebook restricted crypto-related ads in 2018.
