<h2>Dwarf Fortress</h2>

<h3>Preramble</h3>
<p>
I played Dwarf Fortress more back in 2006 when it still was 2D but still check it out every now and then...  mostly just fooling around. The threshold to get into it now is even steeper, with the 3D and all. I don&#39;t use any utilities or mods, but I do modify the palette, and sometimes use custom curses, and enable TTF text.
</p>

<h3>Ideas</h3>

<p>There has been some discussion about how DF could be made more accessible. These are my Top-4 ideas for vanilla DF, with no utils or mods... some of those actually just add friction to getting started.</p>
<ol>
<li> More effective glyphs as used in the olden days, i.e. figurative drawings in 1-bit. An editor so they can be added ingame. More on this later.
</li><li> UI restructuring, and mouse control. See mockup below. 
</li><li> Sound is a big part of a game. It can be used for atmospheric purposes, or as a way to inform or provide feedback. I think just having sounds for alerts and notable activities (sightings, finished artifact, dying, lever pull) could be a big improvement (global and not local to viewport). Given how busy the game can get, I don&#39;t think e.g. idle camel noises are necessary or even feasible to implement.
</li><li> UI stuff.
</li><li> Perhaps a quickstart world would help (separate download or random seed?). A tiny world with a tiny fort (perhaps a template stamp-down) consisting of a functional farm and a few rooms, a tavern to liven things up. Some people can&#39;t get started because they don&#39;t know what to build. It might be easier to continue expanding or just fool around, learning that way. Z-levels are confusing so it&#39;d have to be pretty flat (going into a cliff wall). The tiny fort could feature carefully made mascot characters (an interesting rag-tag group, 5 dwarves and some friendly monsters). Even seasoned players might get something out of a starting scenario I think.

<h3>UI thoughts</h3>

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>Sluggish when selecting items on a map. Immidiate when selecting items in consecutive menus (assuming familiarity). Not possible to do hover over tool tips, unless there&#39;s an arrow key item highlight/selection system.</p>

<h4>Mouse</h4>
<p>Sluggish when selecting menu items in consecutive menus. Immidate when selecting items on a map. It&#39;s possible to do hover-over tool tips and info. It might be possible to address the menu problem by using denser menu item placement and contextual menus close around cursor. 
</p>

<h4>Preference</h4>
<p>
I think mouse wins for me, but mostly because I&#39;m terrible at remembering keys and I mind sluggish menu item selection less than sluggish map navigation. Hover-over info on the map would be very useful but the keyboard cursor is too slow for it. 
Having done combined keyboard-mouse interfaces in the past, there&#39;s a little bit of conflict when the arrow keys have selected one thing and the mouse another, but perhaps the keyboard could modify the mouse cursor position when needed.
</p>
<p>
As for window and menu system restructuring, I&#39;d have to map it all out to see what what optimizations could be made.
</p>
<p>
I guess I would clearly separate viewing and editing into monitor and action panels/windows. There&#39;s a theory that the player is the god Armok and the Dwarves are the slaves at its whim, so perhaps the monitor panels are the two &#34;eyes&#34; and the action panel is the &#34;hand&#34;. Maybe Armok lost the other hand to a ghost.
The monitor panels are used to keep an eye on things. For example, one could have a list of dwarves up during simulation. I think that might promote intimacy... the dwarves do feel kind of distant currently.  The action (hand) panel is used to influnce, edit and place things. Not much info in this panel.
</p><p>
 Dropdown hierarchy lists are useful, though maybe too text heavy and information&#39;y (have to be careful with spreadsheet omniscience). Only allowing one unfolded item at a time would help to limit text masses. Unfolded items tend to displace/push stuff around (jarring if not smoothed), though it does work to minimize mouse movement because relevant items are nearer.
</p><p>
Digging (pattern editor?), designating, placing workshops, etc. is done from the action panel, but I think it&#39;s best to still use the main map to plop things down. The mouse cursor could change to plop mode.
 </p><p>
The keyboard could still be used to quickly select things from build menus, change panel tabs, and obviously for entering text.

<h3>Clone thoughts</h3>
<p>
I started on a clone in 2006 but only got a few weeks of work done on it. I think I fell into the OOP trap which introduced too much engineering friction. One thing I&#39;d consider now is... DF is a game about stories, so how are those communicated? The player has to be informed about (or able to inspect) important/relevant states, and not be bogged down managing details which aren&#39;t contributing. What kind of story generators are interesting? In a talk Toady mentioned that it&#39;s the ones which tie into a mechanic that the player engages with. The randomly generated Forgotten Beasts worked well because their description is strategically relevant. Things like Dwarf mannerisms were more superficial and also hard to depict in illustrated let&#39;s-plays (unlike e.g. injuries).
