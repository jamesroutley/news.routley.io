<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: GitHub Actions provides a policy mechanism for limiting the kinds of
actions and reusable workflows that can be used within a repository,
organization, or entire enterprise. Unfortunately, this mechanism is <strong>trivial
to bypass</strong>. GitHub has told me that they don’t consider
this a security issue (I disagree), so I’m publishing this post as-is.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/oops-all-uses.jpg" alt="" height="400px"/></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>GitHub Actions is GitHub’s CI/CD offering. I’m a big fan of it, despite its
<a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/github-actions-security-guide">spotty</a>
<a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2025/04/27/grafana-security-update-no-customer-impact-from-github-workflow-vulnerability/">security</a>
<a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-12-11-ultralytics-attack-analysis/">track</a>
<a href="https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/12/21/cacheract-the-monster-in-your-build-cache/">record</a>.</p>

<p>Because a CI/CD offering is essentially <strong>arbitrary code execution as
a service</strong>, users are <em>expected</em> to be careful about what they allow
to run in their workflows, <em>especially</em> privileged workflows that have access
to secrets and/or can modify the repository itself. That, in effect, means
that users need to be careful about what <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/avoiding-duplication">actions</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows">reusable workflows</a>
they trust.</p>

<p>Like with other open source ecosystems, downstream consumers (i.e., users
of GitHub Actions) retrieve their components (i.e., action definitions)
from an essentially open index (the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">“Actions Marketplace”</a>​<sup id="fnref:open"><a href="#fn:open" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>To establish trust in those components, downstream users perform all of the
normal fuzzy heuristics: they look at the number of stars, the number
of other user, recency of activity, whether the user/organization
is a “good” one, and so forth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this isn’t good enough along two dimensions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Even actions that satisfy these heuristics can be compromised.
They’re heuristics after all, not verifiable assertions of quality
or trustworthiness.</p>

    <p>The recent <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-actions-supply-chain-attack/">tj-actions attack</a> typifies this: even popular, widely-used
actions are themselves software components, with their own supply chains
(and CI/CD setups).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This kind of acceptance scheme <em>just doesn’t scale</em>, both in terms of
human effort and system complexity: complex CI/CD setups can have dozens
(or hundreds) of workflows, each of which can contain dozens (or hundreds)
of jobs that in turn employ actions and reusable workflows.</p>

    <p>These sorts of large setups don’t necessarily have a single owner
(or even a single team) responsible for gating admission and preventing a
the introduction of unvetted actions and reusable workflows.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="github-actions-policies">GitHub Actions policies</h2>

<p>The problem (as stated above) is best solved by <strong>eliminating the failure
mode</strong> itself: rather than giving the system’s committers the ability to
introduce new actions and reusable workflows without sufficient review,
the system should <strong>prevent them from doing so in the first place</strong>.</p>

<p>To their credit, GitHub understands this! They have a feature called
“Actions policies<sup id="fnref:name"><a href="#fn:name" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>” that does exactly this. From the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#managing-github-actions-permissions-for-your-repository">Manage GitHub Actions settings</a> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can restrict workflows to use actions and reusable workflows in specific
organizations and repositories. Specified actions cannot be set to more than
1000. (sic)</p>

  <p>To restrict access to specific tags or commit SHAs of an action or reusable
workflow, use the same syntax used in the workflow to select the action or
reusable workflow.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>For an action, the syntax is <code>OWNER/REPOSITORY@TAG-OR-SHA</code>. For example, use
<code>actions/javascript-action@v1.0.1</code> to select a tag or
<code>actions/javascript-action@a824008085750b8e136effc585c3cd6082bd575f</code> to
select a SHA. For more information, see Using pre-written building blocks
in your workflow.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For a reusable workflow, the syntax is
<code>OWNER/REPOSITORY/PATH/FILENAME@TAG-OR-SHA</code>. For example,
<code>octo-org/another-repo/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@v1</code>. For more
information, see Reusing workflows.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can use the <code>*</code> wildcard character to match patterns. For example, to allow
all actions and reusable workflows in organizations that start with <code>space-org</code>,
you can specify <code>space-org*/*</code>. To allow all actions and reusable workflows in
repositories that start with <code>octocat</code>, you can use <code>*/octocat**@*</code>. For more
information about using the <code>*</code> wildcard, see Workflow syntax for GitHub
Actions.</p>

  <p>Use <code>,</code> to separate patterns. For example, to allow <code>octocat</code> and <code>octokit</code>, you can
specify <code>octocat/*, octokit/*</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GitHub also provides special “preset” cases for this functionality, such as
allowing only actions and reusable workflows that belong to the same
organization namespace as the repository itself. Here’s what that looks
like on a dummy organization and repository of mine:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/actions-policy-1.png" alt="A screen capture of the &#34;Actions permissions&#34; section"/></p>

<p>…and here’s what happens when I try to violate that policy, e.g. by using
<code>actions/checkout@v4</code> in a workflow:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/actions-policy-2.png" alt="The error message from the resulting policy violation"/></p>

<p>This is fantastic, except that it’s trivial to bypass. Let’s see how.</p>

<h2 id="bypassing-policies">Bypassing policies</h2>

<p>To understand how we’re going to bypass this, we need to understand a few
of the building blocks underneath actions and reusable workflows.</p>

<p>In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Actions and reusable workflows share the same namespace as the rest of
GitHub, i.e. <code>owner/repo</code><sup id="fnref:slug"><a href="#fn:slug" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>;</li>
  <li>When a user writes something like <code>uses: actions/checkout@v4</code> in a workflow,
GitHub <em>resolves</em> that reference to mean “the <code>action.yml</code> file defined at
tag <code>v4</code> in the <code>actions/checkout</code> repository”;</li>
  <li><code>uses:</code> keywords can <strong>also</strong> refer to relative paths on the runner itself.
For example, <code>uses: ./</code> runs the step with the <code>action.yml</code> in the current
directory.</li>
  <li>Relative paths from the runner are <strong>not</strong> inherently part of the repository
state itself: the runner is can contain any state introduced by previous
steps within the same job.</li>
</ul>

<p>These four aspects of GitHub Actions compose together into the <strong>world’s
dumbest policy bypass</strong>: instead of doing <code>uses: actions/checkout@v4</code>,
the user can <code>git clone</code> (or otherwise fetch) the <code>actions/checkout</code>
repository into the runner’s filesystem, and then use <code>uses: ./path/to/checkout</code>
to run the very same action.</p>

<p>Here’s what that looks like in practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

    <span>runs-on</span><span>:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
          <span>mkdir -p ./tmp</span>
          <span>git clone https://github.com/actions/checkout.git ./tmp/checkout</span>

      <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> <span>./tmp/checkout</span>
        <span>with</span><span>:</span>
          <span>repository</span><span>:</span> <span>woodruffw/gha-hazmat</span>
          <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>gha-hazmat</span>

      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>ls &amp;&amp; pwd</span>

      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>ls tmp/checkout</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>(The actual <code>with:</code> block of the <code>uses: ./tmp/checkout</code> step is inconsequential
— I just used that repository for the demo, but anything would work.)</p>

<p>And naturally, it works just fine:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/actions-policy-3.png" alt="A screenshot of the bypass running successfully "/></p>

<h2 id="fixing-it">Fixing it?</h2>

<p>The fix for this bypass is simple, if potentially somewhat painful:
GitHub Actions could consider “local” <code>uses:</code> references to be another
category for the purpose of policies, and reject them whenever the policy
doesn’t permit them.</p>

<p>This would seal off the entire problem, since <code>uses: ./foo</code> would just stop
working. The downside is that it would potentially break existing users
of policies who also use local actions and reusable workflows, assuming
there are significant numbers of them<sup id="fnref:honest"><a href="#fn:honest" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The other option would be to leave it the way it is, but <strong>explicitly document</strong>
local <code>uses:</code> references as a limitation of this policy mechanism. I honestly
think this would be perfectly fine; what matters is that users<sup id="fnref:users"><a href="#fn:users" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
are <em>informed</em> of a feature’s limitations, not necessarily that the feature
<em>lacks</em> limitations.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-matter">Does this matter?</h2>

<p>First, I’ll couch this again: this is not exactly fancy stuff. It’s a very
dumb bypass, and I don’t think it’s critical by any means.</p>

<p>At the same time, I think this <strong>matters a great deal</strong>: ineffective
policy mechanisms are <strong>worse</strong> than missing policy mechanisms, because they provide
all of the <em>feeling</em> of security through compliance while actually
<strong>incentivizing malicious forms of compliance</strong>.</p>

<p>In this case, the maliciously complying party is almost certainly a developer
just trying to get their job done: like most other developers who encounter
an inscrutable policy restriction, they will try to hack around it such that
the policy is satisfied in name only.</p>

<p>For that reason alone I think GitHub should fix this bypass, either by
<em>actually</em> fixing it or at least documenting its limitations. Without either
of those, projects and organizations are likely to <strong>mistakenly believe</strong> that
these sorts of policies provide a <em>security boundary</em> where <strong>none in fact
exists</strong>.</p>
