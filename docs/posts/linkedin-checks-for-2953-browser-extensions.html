      <p>In my life as a programmer, I’ve always had a side project. Something
that interested me and kept me sharp. Conversely, I’ve had a harder time
practicing my security skills; the projects often felt weird and
artificial, and the practice was distinctly less fun. And I know I’m not
alone in this.</p>
<p>A lot of CTF practice games feel artificial. <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">Hack the Box</a> never spoke to me,
just like <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> never did: it’s
deliberate practice, but it feels more like Duolingo than going to a
foreign country for a while<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But, just as I attribute most of the skill that I have as a
programmer to my constantly changing and always obsessively followed
side projects, my security work also thrives off of practice. The
obvious conclusion is that I need to practice more like I do for
programming.</p>
<h2 id="security-practice-as-play">Security practice as play</h2>
<p>I approach my side projects playfully. Every once in a while, I slide
<a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/carp/">into something more
serious</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cyberwitchery/netbox.rs">scratch a real
itch</a>, but I usually just try to explore an idea or learn more about
a domain.</p>
<p>I had to learn that I can approach security projects similarly:
writing <a href="https://git.veitheller.de/degrowth/d">a minimal
debugger</a> helped me understand how to poke around in memory and
processes better. Similarly, making all CI pipelines over at <a href="https://github.com/cyberwitchery/">the GitHub presence</a> of <a href="https://cyberwitchery.com">cyberwitchery lab</a> include static
analysis, SBOM generation, and coverage (needed or not) helps me
understand compliance and quality gates and the involved tools.</p>
<p>This is not to say that all my side projects are artificial
exercises. Some of my explorations fill real gaps for me, such as <a href="https://github.com/cyberwitchery/sbom-diff"><code>sbom-diff</code></a>,
which allows me to scan deltas between SBOMs quickly, and <a href="https://github.com/cyberwitchery/unsafe-budget"><code>unsafe-budget</code></a>,
which lets me limit how much <code>unsafe</code> code I allow in my Go
and Rust projects (other analyzers to follow as I need them).</p>
<p>And this isn’t limited to application security and secure code,
either. I try fun things on the Hetzner and DigitalOcean boxes I
shepherd for private purposes, though this rarely leads to a GitHub
repository.</p>
<p>And while none of these projects are necessarily similar to the work
I do in the security space, where I might more often think of <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Simple_SSDLCs.html">SSDLCs</a> or how
to structure network policies between services in Kubernetes clusters,
they train my mindset and keep my knowledge of the tooling and ecosystem
fresh and up-to-date.</p>
<h2 id="giving-yourself-space">Giving yourself space</h2>
<p>I like to give myself many distinct spaces for exploration. I’ve made
the idiosyncratic choice of making distinct GitHub organizations for my
<a href="https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments">programming
language experiments</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hellerve-project-based-learning/">project-based
learning</a> efforts. If I were honest, most of my repositories would
have to go into my project-based learning bucket, but oh well.</p>
<p>Security is no different. I have a few virtual machines that are just
there to be banged up and stripped for parts for security projects. But
because I am the weirdo that I am, I like to make my own labs and build
them myself rather than using a third-party service. It just feels
materially different to have your own space to build and break in.</p>
<p>In these little worlds I control everything: what services run, what
kernel modules are installed, and how I move laterally or lock myself
out. I can be attacker and defender, and while playing chess against
yourself is often quite boring, it forces you to think more deeply on
every move if you want to get somewhere.</p>
<h2 id="play-is-inherently-useless">Play is inherently useless</h2>
<p>Many of my toy applications look great until you use them and realize
they’re just sketches. But that’s okay. Not everything needs to be an
application. Some artifacts are their own point and need no
product-market fit to have a right to exist.</p>
<p>I think most programmers intuitively know that. In my experience,
security folks often think differently, and their play is often paired
with a certain amount of utility. That’s great if you can make it work,
but it shouldn’t constrain your explorations. You might never find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ray">Sun Ray</a> workstation in
your engagements, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t learn how to break
its kernel<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>I like building things and breaking them equally. Breaking things,
while in my opinion inherently easier, is also a craft that can and
should be practiced if you take it seriously.</p>
<p>I hope that in this blog post I was able to give you some small ideas
for building a personal practice routine that works for you, and I made
clear that it doesn’t have to be useful or look like anyone else’s. It
needs to be fun, engaging, and keep you motivated to get better and try
more new things.</p>
<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>
<p><span id="1">1.</span> A notable exception is Alex Popov’s <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill">Kernel Hack
Drill</a>, which I found fun because of the kernel exploit angle, and
the self-managed route that I took. So I’m not saying it <em>can’t</em>
work, just that it doesn’t usually speak to me.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> Just to be clear: I have no idea how
<code>exec</code> OS worked or what it did. I did, however, once see a
SPARCStation in a data center rack. It couldn’t be turned off, because
it was still running the GIS service. Unfortunately, I didn’t ask any
follow-up questions.</p>
