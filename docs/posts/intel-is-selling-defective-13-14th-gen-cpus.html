    <h1>Intel is selling defective 13-14th Gen CPUs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>My team at Alderon Games, working on the multiplayer dinosaur survival game <a href="https://pathoftitans.com">Path of Titans</a>, has been encountering significant problems with Intel CPU stability. These issues, including crashes, instability, and memory corruption, are confined to the 13th and 14th generation processors. Despite all released microcode, BIOS, and firmware updates, the problem remains unresolved.</p>
<p>We have identified failures in five main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>End Customers:</strong> Thousands of crashes on Intel CPUs on 13th and 14th Gen CPUs in our crash reporting tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Official Dedicated Game Servers:</strong> Experiencing constant crashes, taking entire servers down.</li>
<li>
<strong>Development Team:</strong> Developers using these CPUs face frequent instability while building and working on the game. It can also cause SSD and memory corruption.</li>
<li>
<strong>Game Server Providers:</strong> Hosting community servers with persistent crashing issues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Benchmarking Tools:</strong> Decompression and memory tests unrelated to Path of Titans also fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last 3â€“4 months, we have observed that CPUs initially working well deteriorate over time, eventually failing. The failure rate we have observed from our own testing is nearly 100%, indicating it&#39;s only a matter of time before affected CPUs fail. This issue is gaining attention from news outlets and has been noted by Fortnite and RAD Game Tools, which powers decompression behind Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>Users are also receiving misleading error messages about running out of video driver memory, despite having sufficient memory.</p>
<h2>Actions We Are Taking</h2>
<p>To prevent further harm to our game, we are implementing the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Server Migration:</strong> We are swapping all our servers to AMD, which experience 100 times fewer crashes compared to Intel CPUs that were found to be defective.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hosting Recommendations:</strong> We advise anyone hosting Path of Titans servers or selling game servers to avoid purchasing or using 13th and 14th gen Intel CPUs.</li>
<li>
<strong>In-Game Notifications:</strong> We are adding a popup message in-game to inform users with these processors about the issue. Many users are currently unaware of why their game is crashing and what they can do about it.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>We look forward to more information becoming available about these problems.</p>
<p>For Intel&#39;s sake, we hope they recall these CPUs and refund consumers. This post isn&#39;t a endorsement of AMD CPUs or any other PC company. Keep in mind any product can have defects and issues, we just want to let you know where these crashes are coming from and what is going on.</p>
