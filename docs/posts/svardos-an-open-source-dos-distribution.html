    <p>for PCs of the 1980-2000 era</p>

    <p>SvarDOS is an open-source project that is meant to integrate the best out of the currently available DOS tools, drivers and games. DOS development has been abandoned by commercial players a long time ago, mostly during early nineties. Nowadays it survives solely through the efforts of hobbyists and retro-enthusiasts, but this is a highly sparse and unorganized ecosystem. SvarDOS aims to collect available DOS software and make it easy to find and install applications using a network-enabled package manager (like apt-get, but for DOS and able to run on a 8086 PC).</p>

    <h2>Minimalist and 8086-compatible</h2>

    <p>Once installed, SvarDOS is a minimalistic DOS system that offers only a DOS kernel, a command interpreter and the most basic tools for system administration. It is then up to the user to install additional packages. Care is taken so SvarDOS remains 8086-compatible, at least in its most basic (core) configuration.</p>

    <h2>Open-source</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS is published under the terms of the MIT license. This applies only to SvarDOS-specific files, though - the auxilliary packages supplied with SvarDOS may be subject to different licenses (GPL, BSD, Public Domain, Freeware...).</p>

    <h2>Multilingual</h2>

    <p>The system can be set up in a wide selection of languages: English, German, French, Polish, Russian, Italian and more.</p>

    <h2>No &#34;versions&#34;</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS is a rolling release, meaning that it does not adhere to the concept of &#34;versions&#34;. Once the system is installed, its packages can be kept up-to-date using the SvarDOS online update tools (pkg &amp; pkgnet).</p>

    <h2>Community and help</h2>

    <p>Need to get in touch? Wish to submit some packages, translate SvarDOS to your language, or otherwise contribute? Or maybe you&#39;d like some information about SvarDOS? Come visit the <a href="http://svardos.org/?p=forum">SvarDOS community forum</a>. You may also wish to take a look at the project&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/SvarDOS/bugz/issues">bug tracker</a>.</p>

    
    <h2>Downloads</h2>

    <p>SvarDOS is available in a variety of installation images for different sizes of floppy disks. The CD image presented below contains only a virtual floppy to install the bare-bone SvarDOS system. If you&#39;d like a CD image that contains lots of extra packages, you may want to look <a href="http://svardos.org/?p=repo">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Development 🔧</h2>

    <p>Wondering how SvarDOS is built? All the build-related files, scripts and sources of SvarDOS-specific tools are stored on the project&#39;s SVN server. To pull the sources using the standard subversion client use:</p>

    <p>If you only wish to take a quick peek, then we provide a read-only mirror of the SvarDOS subversion tree on github where you can easily <a href="https://github.com/SvarDOS/core">browse the development tree</a>.</p>

    <p>SvarDOS uses a fork of the Enhanced DR-DOS kernel, whose development is kept on the <a href="https://github.com/SvarDOS/edrdos">EDR github repository</a>.</p>
