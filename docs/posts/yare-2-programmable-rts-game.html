		</p></div><p id="index_expl_text"><span>Yare is a traditional RTS, but the game’s entire functionality and foundation is programmable. </span>This means that you can play the game by writing a real code controlling your unit’s actions, as well as creating your own game UI with HTML/CSS/JS. You can even create voice-control mechanics or anything else you can think of.</p></div>
