    <h1>Tell HN: Twilio support replies with hallucinated features</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was investigating some bug with our voice system and asked support where I can find some debugging information and event logs.</p><p>They told me where I should go in the interface to see that and reassured that they checked logs and this event exist.</p><p>It turned out these features and information doesn&#39;t exist anywhere in the interface and impossible to retrieve in any way. The support message with hallucinated features is mostly AI written.</p><p>CEOs tell us AGI is around the corner but in reality it just unreliable information and AI can&#39;t even restock the vending machine.</p></div></div></div>
