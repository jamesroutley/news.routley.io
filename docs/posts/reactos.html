						<p>Hello ReactOS followers! This report covers changes in the project during February-July 2021. And we definitely have some things to highlight!
amd64 build is getting more stable Timo Kreuzer (tkreuzer) worked hard on various parts of the kernel and HAL, fixing issues here and there. Structured Exception Handling (SEH) support for the amd64 architecture was finished, various bugs around the kernel are fixed. A major issue with interrupt handling in HAL was also fixed in May, which finally allowed a semi-stable boot in a virtual environment.</p>
