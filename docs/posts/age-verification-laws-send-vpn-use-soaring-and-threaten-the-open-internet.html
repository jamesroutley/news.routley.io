    <h1>Age Verification Laws Send VPN Use Soaring–and Threaten the Open Internet</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>After the United Kingdom’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-uks-controversial-online-safety-act-is-now-law/">Online Safety Act</a> went into effect on Friday, requiring porn platforms and other adult content sites to implement user age verification mechanisms, use of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-vpn/">virtual private networks (VPNs)</a> and other circumvention tools spiked in the UK over the weekend.</p><p>Experts had expected the surge, given that similar trends have been visible in other countries that have implemented age check laws. But as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-age-checked-internet-has-arrived/">new wave of age check regulations debuts</a>, open internet advocates warn that the uptick in use of circumvention tools in the UK is the latest example of how an escalating cat-and-mouse game can develop between people looking to anonymously access services online and governments seeking to enforce content restrictions.</p><p>The Online Safety Act requires that websites hosting porn, self-harm, suicide, and eating disorder content implement “highly effective” age checks for visitors from the UK. These checks can include uploading an ID document and selfie for validation and analysis. And along with increased demand for services like VPNs—which allow users to mask basic indicators of their physical location online—people have also been playing around with other creative workarounds. In some cases, reportedly, you can even use the video game <a data-offer-url="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/&#34;}" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Death Stranding</em>’s photo mode</a> to take a selfie of character Sam Porter Bridges and submit it to access age-gated forum content.</p><p>For proponents of the law, there is progress to point to as well. The UK’s communications regulator Ofcom says that more than 6,600 porn websites have introduced age checks so far. And major social platforms like Reddit, X, and Bluesky have also added age verification for content that is now restricted in the UK or are in the process of doing so. Microsoft has even started rolling out <a data-offer-url="https://www.theverge.com/news/714458/microsoft-xbox-age-verification-uk-social-features" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.theverge.com/news/714458/microsoft-xbox-age-verification-uk-social-features&#34;}" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714458/microsoft-xbox-age-verification-uk-social-features" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">voluntary age checks for Xbox</a> users in the UK. But even if this movement is satisfactory for now, digital rights advocates point out that normalizing such mechanisms creates the possibility that they will be enforced more aggressively in the future.</p><p>“I think people just want to show that we can make some progress on this without thinking about what the consequences of the progress will be,” says Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. “We do know that there are some things that you can do to help kids have a better relationship with digital tools. And that involves having an adequate social support network; it involves listening when kids run into problems and making sure that they have functioning emotional relationships with adults who can respond to them. But instead what we’re looking for is a quick technological fix, and those technological fixes have consequences.”</p><p>Seema Shah, VP of research and insights at the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, says five VPN apps have experienced particularly “explosive growth” and <a data-offer-url="https://app.sensortower.com/top-charts?category=0&amp;country=GB&amp;date=2025-07-28&amp;device=iphone&amp;os=ios" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://app.sensortower.com/top-charts?category=0&amp;country=GB&amp;date=2025-07-28&amp;device=iphone&amp;os=ios&#34;}" href="https://app.sensortower.com/top-charts?category=0&amp;country=GB&amp;date=2025-07-28&amp;device=iphone&amp;os=ios" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reached</a> the top 10 free apps on Apple’s UK App Store by Monday.</p><p>“According to Sensor Tower estimates, iOS devices have seen a greater spike in VPN downloads in the UK, as downloads across the selected VPN apps are up an average of 100 percent day-over-day over the past four days on iOS versus a 5 percent day-over-day increase for Android devices,” Shah says.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
