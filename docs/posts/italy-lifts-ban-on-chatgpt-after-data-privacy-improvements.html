    <h1>Italy lifts ban on ChatGPT after data privacy improvements</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/artificial-intelligence/t-42133476">The artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot,</a> ChatGPT, is once again available to users in Italy after its owners addressed data privacy concerns, an Italian regulator said on Friday.</p>

<p>Italy blocked the site at the end of March after <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-chatgpt-spurs-debate-about-ai-regulation/a-65330099">raising concerns about how ChatGPT processes and saves user data.</a></p>

<h2>What changes were made?</h2>

<p>Garante, Italy&#39;s data protection authority, said ChatGPT has been reinstated &#34;with enhanced transparency and rights for European users.&#34;</p>

<p>The move came after OpenAI, the US-based <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/chatgpt-sparks-ai-investment-bonanza/a-65368393">and Microsoft-backed company</a> that developed the chatbot, implemented changes to comply with several data privacy conditions.</p>

<p>The changes include increased transparency on OpenAI&#39;s website for how the chatbot processes user data.</p>

<p>The platform now also grants users certain opt-out rights, including being able to toggle off the option for conversations to be used <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/artificial-intelligence-4-ways-ai-will-reshape-society/a-65181735">for training ChatGPT&#39;s algorithms.</a></p>

<p>The site now also has checks to protect children under 13, with age verification in place for those accessing the site from Italy.</p>

<p>&#34;ChatGPT is available again for our users in Italy. We are delighted to welcome them back and remain committed to protecting their personal data,&#34; an OpenAI spokesperson said.</p>

<p>When viewing the platform from Germany, the new data protection options were also available.</p>

<p>The site also now has a notice making users aware that ChatGPT could produce inaccurate information about &#34;people, places or facts.&#34;</p>

<h2>Why was ChatGPT banned in Italy?</h2>

<p>Italy became the first Western country to take action against ChatGPT <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/chatgpt-italy-blocks-ai-chatbot-over-privacy-concerns/a-65200137">at the end of March.</a></p>

<p>The country&#39;s data protection watchdog said its developers did not have a legal basis <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/ai-chatgpt-forces-debate-over-rules/a-64801374">to justify the storage and collection of users&#39; personal data</a> in order to train the site&#39;s algorithms.</p>

<p>Authorities also criticized that inaccurate information produced by the platform was not being handled properly and that children were especially vulnerable to &#34;absolutely unsuitable answers.&#34;</p>

<p>ChatGPT has taken the world by storm since it was launched in 2022.</p>

<p>Based on questions or input from users, the chatbot can generate essays, poems, songs, computer code <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/india-ai-journalism-sparks-concern/a-65395188">and also news articles.</a></p>

<p>While its release has been heralded as a milestone in technological advancement, it has also sparked a debate about the possibilities of artificial intelligence and the consequences that could arise.</p>
