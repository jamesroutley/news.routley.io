<p>Rolls-Royce announced that it has completed compatibility testing of 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on all its civil aero engine types in production.</p>



<p>The company said the completion of testing fulfills a commitment it made in 2021 to show that engine technology is not a barrier to the use of 100 percent SAF. Rolls-Royce conducted a range of ground and flight tests designed to replicate operating conditions, and in each case they showed the use of 100 percent SAF does not affect the engines’ performance.</p>

</ul>



<p>A ground test of Rolls-Royce’s BR710 business jet engine at its facility in Canada marked the end of the test program. Other engines that underwent testing include the Trent 700, 800, 900, 1000,  XWB-84, XWB-97, 7000, BR725, and Pearl 700, 15 and  10X.</p>



<p>“Becoming the first jet engine manufacturer to publicly confirm all our in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets are compatible with 100 percent SAF is an important milestone for both Rolls-Royce and the wider aviation industry,” said Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO of Rolls-Royce. “It’s also further evidence of our commitment to becoming a net-zero company by 2050 and supporting our customers to do the same.”</p>

<p>Rolls-Royce said it has also ensured the sustainable operation of its new <a href="https://www.avweb.com/ownership/engines/rolls-royce-conducts-first-ultrafan-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UltraFan engine demonstrator</a>, which made its first test run earlier this year using 100 percent SAF. Later this month Virgin Atlantic plans to make the first transatlantic flight using 100 percent SAF, with a Boeing 787 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.</p>



<p>“The world’s journey to decarbonizing flight is powered by British innovation and backed by the U.K. government, meaning people can continue to travel how they want, in a way that’s fit for the future,” said U.K. Transport Secretary Mark Harper. “[This] news demonstrates that Rolls-Royce and the U.K. are global leaders in decarbonizing transport, taking us one step closer to Jet Zero.”</p>



<h2>Sustainable Aviation Fuel Gains Traction</h2>



<p>SAF shows great promise for driving aviation’s continued improvement in fuel efficiency and emissions reduction, in part because it can be used as a simple “drop-in” alternative to conventional jet fuel. Rolls-Royce estimates that a combination of the latest, most-efficient gas turbines operating on 100 percent SAF could contribute about 80 percent of  the “total solution” for reaching net-zero flying by 2050.</p>
