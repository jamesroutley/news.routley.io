    <h1>Lima: a nice way to run Linux VMs on Mac</h1>
    
    

<p>Hello! Here&rsquo;s a new entry in the &ldquo;cool software julia likes&rdquo; section.</p>

<p>A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest
frustrations with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software. For
example, the <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/09/24/new-tool--an-nginx-playground/">nginx playground</a> I
posted about the other day only works on Linux because it uses Linux namespaces (via <code>bubblewrap</code>)
to sandbox nginx. And I&rsquo;m working on another playground right now that uses bubblewrap too.</p>

<p>This post is very short, it&rsquo;s just to say that Lima seems nice and much simpler
to get started with than Vagrant.</p>

<h3 id="enter-lima">enter Lima!</h3>

<p>I was complaining about this to a friend, and they mentioned
<a href="https://lima-vm.io/">Lima</a>, which stands for <strong>Li</strong>nux on <strong>Ma</strong>c. I&rsquo;d heard
of <a href="https://github.com/abiosoft/colima">colima</a> (another way to run Linux
containers on Mac), but I hadn&rsquo;t realized that Lima also just lets you run VMs.</p>

<p>It was surprisingly simple to set up. I just had to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Lima (I did <code>nix-env -iA nixpkgs.lima</code> but you can also install it with <code>brew install lima</code>)</li>
<li>Run <code>limactl start default</code> to start the VM</li>
<li>Run <code>lima</code> to get a shell</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! By default it mounts your home directory as read-only inside the VM</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a config file in <code>~/.lima/default/lima.yaml</code>, but I haven&rsquo;t needed to change it yet.</p>

<h3 id="some-nice-things-about-lima">some nice things about Lima</h3>

<p>Some things I appreciate about Lima (as opposed to Vagrant which I&rsquo;ve used in the past and found kind of frustrating) are:</p>

<ol>
<li>it provides a default config</li>
<li>it mounts my entire home directory inside the VM, which I really like as a default choice (it feels very seamless)</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the paradigm of &ldquo;I have a single chaotic global Linux VM which I use
for all my projects&rdquo; might work better for me than super carefully configured
per-project VMs. Though I&rsquo;m sure that you can have carefully configured
per-project VMs with Lima too if you want, I&rsquo;m just only using the <code>default</code> VM.</p>

<h3 id="problem-i-don-t-know-how-to-mount-directories-read-write">problem: I don&rsquo;t know how to mount directories read-write</h3>

<p>I wanted to have my entire home directory mouunted read-only, but have some
subdirectories (like <code>~/work/nginx-playground</code>) mounted read-write. I did some
research and here&rsquo;s what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>a comment on <a href="https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/873">this github issue</a> says that you can use <a href="https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/docs/vmtype.md#vz">mountType: &ldquo;virtiofs&rdquo; and vmType: &ldquo;vz&rdquo;</a> to mount subdirectories of your home directory read-write</li>
<li>the Lima version packaged in nix 23.05 doesn&rsquo;t seem to support <code>vmType: vz</code> (though I could be wrong about this)</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll figure out how to mount directories read-write later, I&rsquo;m not too
bothered by working around it for now.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-use-containers">why not use containers?</h3>

<p>I wanted a VM and not a Linux container because:</p>

<ol>
<li>the playground runs on a VM in production, not in a container, and generally
it&rsquo;s easier to develop in a similar environment to production</li>
<li>all of my playgrounds use Linux namespaces, and I don&rsquo;t know how to create a
namespace inside a container. Probably you can but I don&rsquo;t feel like
figuring it out and it seems like an unnecessary distraction.</li>
<li>on Mac you need to run containers inside a Linux VM anyway, so I&rsquo;d rather
use a VM directly and not introduce another unnecessary layer</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>

<p>Some other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>It looks like Lima works on Linux too</li>
<li>a bunch of people on Mastodon also said <a href="https://github.com/abiosoft/colima">colima</a> (built on top of Lima) is a nice Docker alternative on Mac for running Linux containers</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s also an new alternative Linux container runtime for Mac called <a href="https://docs.orbstack.dev/">Orb Stack</a>, which I know nothing about</li>
</ul>
