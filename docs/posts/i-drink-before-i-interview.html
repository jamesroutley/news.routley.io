    <h1>I drink before I interview</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I know some of you can relate, when I have to interview I feel a terror come over me. It&#39;s immobilizing. A simple algorithm question becomes impossible because I don&#39;t have access to my prefrontal cortex, instead it&#39;s all fight or flight, sweaty hands, and panic.</p><p>I found with covid I can now do the onsite portion with a little wine in my mug and answer the questions with access to my whole brain, since it&#39;s all over zoom.</p><p>When I told this to a friend they said they use beta blockers.</p><p>Can anyone relate? There doesn&#39;t seem to be another way to get work in the tech industry. There is not much relief for those of us with anxiety.</p></div></div></div>
