    <h1>Tell HN: Interview take home assessments without feedback are frustrating</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m in the process of interviewing for senior and staff front end positions. I&#39;ve done several multi-hour take home projects now and a couple were rejected with generic rejection messages. It&#39;s pretty insulting to be frank. Spending 2-4 hours on likely valueless work is a substantial amount of time relative to the week day. If I&#39;ve spent the time making the project and they&#39;ve spent the time recruiting me and reviewing the project, the recruiter and reviewer could spend 5 minutes sending constructive feedback.</p><p>Anyone else share in this frustrating experience? Have you successfully asked for feedback before?</p></div></div></div>
