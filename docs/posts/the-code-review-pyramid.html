    <h1>The Code Review Pyramid</h1>

				<p>When it comes to code reviews,
it’s a common phenomenon that there is much focus and long-winded discussions around mundane aspects like code formatting and style,
whereas important aspects (does the code change do what it is supposed to do, is it performant, is it backwards-compatible for existing clients, and many others) tend to get less attention.</p>
<p>To raise awareness for the issue and providing some guidance on aspects to focus on,
I shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1501645187407388679">small visual</a> on Twitter the other day, which I called the &#34;Code Review Pyramid&#34;.
Its intention is to help putting focus on those parts which matter the most during a code review (in my opinion, anyways),
and also which parts could and should be automated.</p>
<p>As some folks asked for a permanent, referenceable location of that resource and others wanted to have a high-res printing version, I’m putting it here again:</p>

<p>You can also download the visual as an <a href="https://www.morling.dev/images/code_review_pyramid.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SVG file</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Why is it a pyramid?</em></p>
<p>The lower parts of the pyramid should be the foundation of a code review and take up the most part of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hey, that’s a triangle!</em></p>
<p>You might think so, but it’s a pyramid from the side.</p>

<p><em>Which tool did you use for creating the drawing?</em></p>
