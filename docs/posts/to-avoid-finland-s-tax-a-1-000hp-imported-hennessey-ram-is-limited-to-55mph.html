  	<p>Seeing a vehicle sold outside of its home market is always a treat. In the United States, we fetishize JDM cars like it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business—Nissan Skylines, Toyota Chasers, early Mitsubishi Evolutions. The same goes for U.S.-built vehicles in other countries, such as muscle cars, performance trucks, and including the <a href="https://www.nettiauto.com/en/dodge/ram/12738591" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2022 Hennessey RAM TRX Mammoth</a>.</p><p>Recently, one of these trucks popped up on a Finnish auto classified site. The 1,000-horsepower super-truck had made its way to Finland for the cool price of $272,000—about twice the cost if one was ordering directly from Hennessey, and nearly four times the cost of a base TRX.</p><p>But just because you&#39;re paying for the whole truck doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ll get to use all of it. In fact, it&#39;s quite the opposite. A workaround to have the truck imported without paying hefty taxes meant the installation of a speed limiter to cap the high-horsepower performance truck at a top speed of just 55 mph.</p>

  	<p>&#34;But Rob,&#34; I hear you asking. &#34;Why in the world would somebody neuter a truck with a quadruple-digit power output to just 55 mph?&#34;</p><p>The reasoning, my friends, comes down to a simple tax loophole.</p><p>Because the TRX is basically the anti-Prius, it produces a decent bit of pollutants when driven hard. In fact, it produces <a href="https://aecramtrucks.com/trx/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">506 g/km of CO2 emissions</a>, which would make it subject to a <a href="https://www.veronmaksajat.fi/Asunto-ja-auto/Autovero/#c34e2a86" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">44.8 percent Finnish import tax</a> should it be registered as a five-seater passenger vehicle. But it also has a gross weight of 3,539 kg, just a few kilos over the threshold of what can be considered a commercial vehicle in Finland. In the TRX&#39;s case, it&#39;s classed as an &#34;N2,&#34; which permits owners to import and register the TRX without paying that 44.8 percent tax if they so choose. There&#39;s a catch, though.</p><p>Because Finland is a member of the European Union, it must adhere to a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0085&amp;from=EN" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">particular directive</a> that requires speed limiting devices to be installed if the N2 vehicle is used on the road. As such, the 1,000-horsepower Hennessey TRX Mammoth is officially limited to just 90 km/h, or 55 mph (which is slightly less than the 93 km/h quoted in the ad).</p><p>From the factory, the TRX has a top speed of 118 mph <em>before</em> any Hennessey upgrades. And while the tuner doesn&#39;t actually reveal the Mammoth&#39;s top speed, at least we know it will take under the advertised 3.2 seconds to go from zero to The New Finnish Limit. Shame it won&#39;t be able to do that 11.4-second quarter mile with a limiter installed, either.</p>

  	<p>Finland has been home to some <a href="https://www.thirdgen.org/forums/members-camaros/773339-pickup-camaro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">weird tax loopholes before</a>, including one that permitted &#39;80s American muscle cars to be imported and chopped into pickup trucks and vans in order to circumvent certain costs. Both situations are admittedly hilarious, but there&#39;s something special about paying $272,000 for a 1,000-horsepower pickup and not even being able to break 60 mph.</p><p>Anyway, if you happen to be a wealthy Finn and this is the type of vehicle you&#39;re losing sleep over not owning, I <em>do</em> come bearing a bit of good news: you can buy this truck. The ad says that the vehicle will be available in April, and an individual from the dealership&#39;s Facebook page told me that they are &#34;enjoying&#34; it in Florida until it is exported next month... probably without that speed limiter, too, if I had to guess.</p><p><em>Got a tip or question for the author?
