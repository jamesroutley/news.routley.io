The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. </p><p>TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-privacy-cybersecurity-bytedance-china-2dce297f0aed056efe53309bbcd44a04" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has faced scrutiny in a number of countries</a></span> because of concerns that Beijing could use the app to harvest user data or advance its interests.
