    <h1>Radboud University selects Fairphone as standard smartphone for employees</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
    Do you require a (replacement) smartphone for your work at Radboud University? If so, there is a strong possibility that you will receive a Fairphone from 1 February 2026 onwards. Radboud University has decided to choose Fairphone as its standard company smartphone model for reasons of sustainability, cost efficiency and management support.
  </p><div>
            <p>The Fairphone is a sustainable smartphone with easily replaceable parts such as the battery and screen. This makes the device last longer. Fair and recycled materials, such as plastic and aluminium, are used as much as possible in the production of this smartphone. Fairphone also pays attention to good and safe working conditions in its factories.</p><p>Fairphones are issued to employees by the Information &amp; Library Services (ILS) division. In addition to new Fairphones, the university can also reissue used Samsung devices where possible. These are Samsung devices that have already been returned and still meet the technical and age requirements. As long as these devices are still available, not every employee will receive a Fairphone immediately. Employees who have an iPhone from Radboud University can continue to use it as long as the device is still functioning. However, returned iPhones will no longer be reissued.</p><p>Employees who prefer to use their private phone for work can request an RU SIM card for this purpose. The costs for using your own device will not be reimbursed. Naturally, smartphone models that have already been issued will continue to be supported by ILS colleagues, as will privately purchased smartphone models used for work.</p><h2>Cost-effective and easier management</h2><p>Due to its longer lifespan, the total cost of a Fairphone is lower than that of comparable devices. In addition, Radboud University only needs to purchase, manage and support one standard model. This results in smaller stock, easier management and faster support. Manuals and instructions also only need to be maintained for one device.</p><h2>Circularity strategy</h2><p>Fairphone offers a five-year warranty and long-term software support for up to eight years. This means that devices need to be replaced less quickly. This fits in with Radboud University&#39;s circularity strategy, which focuses on the longest possible use and reuse of ICT hardware.</p>
