    <h1>One Million Checkboxes and the fear of viral success</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>When Nolen Royalty’s <a href="https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/">One Million Checkboxes site</a> went viral, several people sent me links to it.</p>

<p>I loved everything about One Million Checkboxes. It was simple but strangely compelling. You land on the site, start using a single brain cell to check some boxes, and then minutes later you’re <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/one-million-checkboxes-sent-me-into-an-existential-meltdown/">in an existential crisis</a>. Seeing the project gave me the kind of professional jealousy that I imagine other people feel when a peer gets promoted.</p>
<p>Nolen wrote <a href="https://eieio.games/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/">a fantastic post</a> full of technical details about how he built and scaled the site. It was very generous of him to write it up. Knowing how to scale a web service feels like magic to someone without much experience at it (read: me) and this post stands as a great case-study.</p>
<p>But more than that, the post really challenged me as a creator on the web. In the past, I’ve been so afraid of this exact situation Nolen was in. You know, building a creative project with a backend component, having it go viral, watching the metered costs go through the roof, and either:</p>
<ol>
<li>leaving users with an unstable and broken experience</li>
<li>bankrupting myself</li>
<li>being forced to shut it down to avoid bankrupting myself</li>
<li>solving the problems perfectly on the fly, but still maybe bankrupting myself*</li>
</ol>

Neal Agarwal ran into something similar with the success of his game <a href="https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/" target="_blank">Infinite Craft</a>.

<p>I’ve had little tastes of these experiences and they were stressful. Making these decisions while it feels like everyone is watching and your reputation is on the line is a lot of pressure!</p>
<p>Frankly, this is one reason why I’ve spent so much of my creative energy on projects without a backend component (like <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/08/10/one-million-checkboxes-and-the-fear-of-viral-success/bryanbraun.github.io/after-dark-css/">After Dark in CSS</a>, <a href="https://sparkbox.github.io/bouncy-ball">Bouncy Ball</a> or <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/">Checkboxland</a>). Client-side code is easier to scale and I <em>already know how to do it</em>. It’s simply less risky.</p>
<p>But that comes at a cost. One Million Checkboxes simply could not have been built as a client-side-only app. If I had come up with the idea for One Million Checkboxes, would I have ruled it out because of it’s backend component? Would I have been too afraid to try it?</p>
<p>You can do a lot, artistically, with client-side only apps. I wanted to believe that client-side only was good enough. But projects like One Million Checkboxes give evidence to the contrary. What if the space of server-enhanced creative projects is significantly under-explored simply because of the additional risk? If I got good at navigating the scaling gauntlet, would I be able to uncover a lot of opportunities?</p>
<p>Scaling backend stuff isn’t magic—Nolen’s post showed that. I can figure out how to write Go, network instances, and rate-limit IPs. Maybe it’s time that I try.</p>
