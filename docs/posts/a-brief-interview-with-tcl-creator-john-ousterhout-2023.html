    <h1>A brief interview with Tcl creator John Ousterhout (2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>February 8, 2023 — </span><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php">Dr. John Ousterhout</a> is a computer science luminary who has made significant contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in the areas of operating systems and file systems. He is the creator of the <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/tcl.html">Tcl</a> scripting language, and has also worked on several major software projects, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_file_system">Log-Structured file system</a> and the <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/sprite-os.html">Sprite operating system</a>. John Ousterhout&#39;s creation of Tcl has had a lasting impact on the technology industry, transforming the way developers think about scripting and automation.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<div><h4>What is unique about Tcl?</h4>
<p><strong>Dr. Ousterhout:</strong> I would highlight 2 things:</p>
</div>
<p>The first thing is its embeddable nature: I designed Tcl so that the library could be embedded in applications, with Tcl providing generic scripting features and the application adding its own commands to the built-in command set. The boundary between Tcl and the application is extremely fluid, and applications can extend Tcl in very powerful ways, such as adding new control structures to the  language. I don&#39;t think any other scripting language has achieved embeddability to the degree that Tcl did.</p>
<p>The second thing is Tcl&#39;s &#34;everything is a string&#34; philosophy. This played a big role in Tcl&#39;s embeddability and made it easy to extend Tcl in a variety of ways. But, it also carried a performance penalty; even with a lot of work, Tcl has never become as efficient as other languages with more traditional types, such as <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/python.html">Python</a>. The string focus is also responsible for Tcl&#39;s unusual command syntax, which some people love and some people hate.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<p><h4>How different would Tcl be had you stayed on with the development team? :)</h4>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ousterhout:</strong> I don&#39;t think it would have been very different. Tcl was quite mature by the time I passed off development responsibility. Tcl had its heyday in the 1990&#39;s, due in large part to the power of the <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/tk.html">Tk toolkit</a> and the awfulness of the other X Window GUI toolkits; Tcl/Tk was the easiest and most powerful way to create GUI apps. Unfortunately, Tcl didn&#39;t make the jump to the Web, and most of the applications for which people would have used Tcl in the 1990s became Web applications.</p>
<p>Interesting footnote: the founding of Netscape occurred at the same time I was deciding where to go in industry when I left Berkeley in 1994. Jim Clarke and Marc Andreessen approached me about the possibility of my joining Netscape as a founder, but I eventually decided against it (they hadn&#39;t yet decided to do Web stuff when I talked with them). This is one of the biggest &#34;what if&#34; moments of my career. If I had gone to Netscape, I think there&#39;s a good chance that Tcl would have become the browser language instead of <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/javascript.html">JavaScript</a> and the world would be a different place! However, in retrospect I&#39;m not sure that Tcl would actually be a better language for the Web than JavaScript, so maybe the right thing happened.</p>
<p><span>*</span></p>
<p><h4>As a long time educator, what do you predict the next paradigm shift in programming languages will be?</h4>
</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ousterhout:</strong> I don&#39;t really know. It used to be that every 5-10 years a major new language came along, but it&#39;s been almost 20 or years since the last interesting new language I can think of (<a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/go.html">Go</a>). Maybe others would count <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/rust.html">Rust</a>, in which case maybe the 5-10 year interval is still holding.</p>
<p>One interesting note on this. Historically, I think the most widely used programming linkages have come not from the programming language research committee, but rather from people who build systems and wanted a language to help themselves. PL researchers tend to create languages that are useful for PL researchers: they have interesting theoretical and conceptual properties (e.g., <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/ml.html">ML</a>) but aren&#39;t usually useful for real systems. Systems people create languages that are useful for systems builders, so they get widely adopted. Examples are <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/c.html">C</a>, <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/cpp.html">C++</a> (I think?), <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/perl.html">Perl</a>, <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/java.html">Java</a>, and <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/go.html">Go</a>. I would put <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/tcl.html">Tcl</a> in this category as well, and perhaps <a href="https://pldb.io/concepts/python.html">Python</a> also?</p>
