    <h1>Forty years of GNU and the free software movement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>Computer hackers and users from across the world will celebrate GNU&#39;s
anniversary with special events. These include a specially convened
<a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">GNU Hackers Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</a> and a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for
hackers of any skill level at the FSF&#39;s headquarters in Boston, MA.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1983, a computer scientist named Richard Stallman
announced the plan to develop a free software Unix-like operating
system called <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU</a>, for &#34;GNU&#39;s not Unix.&#34; GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users&#39;
freedom, and has remained true to its founding ideals for forty
years. Since 1983, the GNU Project has provided a full, ethical
replacement for proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>When describing GNU&#39;s history and the background behind its initial
announcement, Stallman (often known simply as &#34;RMS&#34;) <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>,
&#34;with a free operating system, we could again have a community of
cooperating hackers -- and invite anyone to join. And anyone would be
able to use a computer without starting out by conspiring to deprive
his or her friends.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;When we look back at the history of the free software movement -- or
the idea that users should be in control of their own computing -- it
starts with GNU,&#34; said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF,
which sponsors GNU&#39;s development. &#34;The GNU System isn&#39;t just the most
widely used operating system that is based on free software. GNU is
also at the core of a philosophy that has guided the free software
movement for forty years.&#34;</p>
<p>Usually combined with the kernel Linux, GNU forms the backbone of the
Internet and powers millions of servers, desktops, and embedded
computing devices. Aside from its technical advancements, GNU
pioneered the concept of &#34;copyleft,&#34; the approach to software
licensing that requires the same rights to be preserved in derivative
works, and is best exemplified by the GNU General Public License
(GPL). As Stallman <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>, &#34;The goal of GNU was to give users
freedom, not just to be popular. So we needed to use distribution
terms that would prevent GNU software from being turned into
proprietary software. The method we use is called &#39;copyleft.&#39;&#34;</p>
<p>The free software community has held strong for forty years and
continues to grow, as exemplified by the FSF&#39;s annual <a href="https://libreplanet.org/conference">LibrePlanet</a>
conference on software freedom and digital ethics.</p>
<p>Kooyman continues, &#34;we hope that the fortieth anniversary will inspire
hackers, both old and new, to join GNU in its goal to create, improve,
and share free software around the world. Software is controlling our
world these days, and GNU is a critique and solution to the status quo
that we desperately need in order to not have our technology control
us.&#34;</p>
<h3>GNU Hacker&#39;s Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</h3>
<p>On September 27, GNUnet e.V. is celebrating GNU&#39;s fortieth anniversary
with a <a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">hacker meeting</a> in Switzerland, which will feature
presentations about various GNU packages, hacking, and making new
releases. Among the speakers are Richard Stallman, the founder of GNU;
Free Software Award winner Sébastien Blin of GNU Jami; the president
of the Free Software Foundation Europe, Matthias Kirschner; and
several GNU webmasters.</p>
<h3>Hackday at the FSF Headquarters</h3>
<p>In honor of GNU&#39;s fortieth anniversary, its organizational sponsor the
FSF is organizing a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for families, students, and anyone
interested in celebrating GNU&#39;s anniversary. It will be held at the
FSF&#39;s offices in Boston, MA on October 1.</p>
<h3>About the Free Software Foundation</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to
promoting computer users&#39; right to run, edit, share, contribute to,
and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development
and use of free (as in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU
operating system and its GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation
for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the
ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software, and
its Web sites, located at <a href="https://fsf.org">https://fsf.org</a> and <a href="https://gnu.org">https://gnu.org</a>, are
an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations to
support the FSF&#39;s work can be made at <a href="https://donate.fsf.org">https://donate.fsf.org</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the FSF, as well as important information for
journalists and publishers, is at <a href="https://www.fsf.org/press">https://www.fsf.org/press</a>.</p>
<h3>About the GNU Operating System and Linux</h3>
<p>Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a
free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users&#39;
freedom. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for
one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under
the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux
formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for
the first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination
is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see
