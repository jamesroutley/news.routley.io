    <h1>Ask HN: Azure has run out of compute – anyone else affected?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Last week we at n8n ran into problems getting a new database from Azure. After contacting support, it turns out that we can’t add instances to our k8s cluster either. Azure has told they&#39;ll have more capacity in April 2023(!) — but we’ll have to stop accepting new users in ~35 days if we don&#39;t get any more. These problems seem only in the German region, but setting up in a new region would be complicated for us.</p><p>We never thought our startup would be threatened by the unreliability of a company like Microsoft, or that they wouldn’t proactively inform us about this.</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing these problems?</p></div></div></div>
