    <h1>Archive Your Reddit Data Before It&#39;s Too Late</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><p><em>tl;dr: I <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/xavdid/reddit-user-to-sqlite/">wrote a tool</a> to make a searchable archive of your Reddit data. I&#39;d suggest downloading and running it before <strong>June 30th, 2023</strong>.</em></p><hr/><p>If you&#39;re an active Reddit user, you may have heard about impending <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/">changes to its public API</a>. This move will have widespread impact on Redditors, including <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/">the death of beloved</a> 3rd party clients and some subreddits even <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/141qwy8/programmer_humor_will_be_shutting_down/">going dark indefinitely</a>. These changes mark the beginning of the (apparently) <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys">inevitable enshittification</a> of Reddit as a platform. Realizing this bummed me out more than I expected the death of a website might.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><p>I&#39;ve been a fairly active Redditor for more than 11 years. Until now, it&#39;s been the website with the best mix of community, popularity, developer ecosystem, and web-search-ability.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> The non-monetary value Reddit as a knowledge store is literally priceless; it&#39;s a modern-day Library of Alexandria. So when I saw the writing on the wall, I became worried about the most valuable thing I&#39;d contributed to Reddit: my posts and comments.</p><p>I&#39;ve posted many stories, jokes, and (dare I say) insightful comments on Reddit over the years. When I heard the news, I realized I&#39;d be upset if I wasn&#39;t able to access my contributions anymore. I&#39;ll occasionally want to go back and find specific comments I made years ago, a task which the web UI doesn&#39;t make simple (there&#39;s a lot of clicking &#34;next page&#34; involved).</p><p>Reddit <em>does</em> have a feature to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request">export your data into a GDPR archive</a>, but it&#39;s pretty barebones - only the plaintext of the comment, the subreddit name, the timestamp, and weirdly, the number of awards. Unfortunately, the highest fidelity data comes from the API, which is exactly what&#39;s going to be changing/worsening soon. So it felt urgent to create an archive of my personal API data.</p><p>The venerable <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.sqlite.org/about.html">SQLite project</a> allows storing structured, searchable data in a single file. This leads us to my project, <code>reddit-user-to-sqlite</code>. It&#39;s a small Python tool which builds an archive of all of your posts and comments. You can read all about it here: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/xavdid/reddit-user-to-sqlite/">https://github.com/xavdid/reddit-user-to-sqlite/</a></p><p>Running it requires a bit of comfort with the command line, but being able to paste 3 commands into a terminal will get you what you need:</p><ol><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/">install pipx</a></li><li>run <code>pipx install reddit-user-to-sqlite</code></li><li>run <code>reddit-user-to-sqlite user YOUR_USERNAME_HERE</code></li></ol><p>After running, you&#39;ll get a database file that you can use with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Your content being in a database means it&#39;s easy to get insights about your usage. For instance, I can see the amount of karma I&#39;ve gotten from each subreddit, or where I comment the most.</p><p>The tool also supports reading data from a GDPR archive, which will continue working after the API is shut down (albeit with some data missing, like <code>score</code>). See <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/xavdid/reddit-user-to-sqlite/#archive">the docs</a> for more info.</p><p>Best of all, your content is yours again. Once it&#39;s archived, it&#39;s in a file that they can never take away from you. (No matter what stupid things they keep doing to the platform.) The <code>reddit-user-to-sqlite</code> will update an existing database with new data if you run it again, so feel free to run it periodically to keep your archive up-to-date.</p><p>I&#39;ve got no clue what will happen after the API terms have changed. If you&#39;re going to create an archive, make sure to do it <strong>before June 30th, 2023</strong>.</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions or come across any issues. I&#39;ll try to get them fixed before the deadline. Until then, happy archiving!</p></article></div>
