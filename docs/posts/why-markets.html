    <h1>why markets</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(foreword: this is based on a presentation I gave at the <a href="https://recurse.com/about" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> during my batch related to my event contracts market making project! If you&#39;d ever like to talk more about it, feel free to hit me up)</p>
<h2 id="two-reasons"><strong>Two reasons</strong></h2>
<p><em>1. They&#39;re the best mechanism we have to value things.</em></p>
<p><em>2. It&#39;s important to value things because that&#39;s how we know how to best allocate resources.</em></p>
<p>And in order to solve these two problems? We <em><strong>trade</strong></em>, on a <em><strong>market</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Austrian economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek (<em>1974 Nobel Prize in Economics</em>) in the 1940&#39;s had his thesis of price signals, where he argued that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;...knowledge in society was sufficiently diffuse to render central planning hopeless, and that markets were thus necessary to coordinate and economize the unique bits of information in every person’s possession.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And hence, point #1. Market prices give us a way to value things.</p>
<p>Similarly, experimental economist Vernon Smith (<em>2002 Nobel Prize shared with Daniel Kahneman</em>) in 2004 gave a speech before the Austrian parliament  echoing Hayek&#39;s sentiment by stating that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;...the problem of society is how to utilize human knowledge when it is not, and cannot ever, be given to anyone in its totality. How do you induce people to take the economically beneficial actions without anyone having to tell them what to do?&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus, point #2. Optimal allocation.</p>
<p>Elegantly put.</p>
<h2 id="so-where-do-we-go-from-here">So where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Yes, markets are imperfect in many many many ways. Speculation, inefficiencies (there&#39;s a reason whole companies exist to help make them more efficient), volatility, money being thrown around. Finance as a whole is such an absurd, crazy, fascinating world because of the many ways in which it serves as the plumbing for the world to go around, with all its hidden intricacies.</p>
<p>But, even with all these flaws and complexities, they&#39;re necessary! So so very much necessary.</p>
<p>In fact, Matt Levine  once quoted in his Money Stuff newsletter a wonderful writeup from Interfluidity on <a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html" target="_blank">why finance is so complex</a> – you can read the whole writeup yourself, but in essence it tells us how complexity in finance is a feature, not a bug:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finance has always been complex. More precisely it has always been opaque...Opacity is absolutely essential to modern finance...The core purpose of status quo finance is to coax people into accepting risks that they would not, if fully informed, consent to bear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Financial systems help us overcome a collective action problem. In a world of investment projects whose costs and risks are perfectly transparent, most individuals would be frightened. Real enterprise is very risky...[financial systems] ensure that we are, in general, in a high-investment dynamic rather than a low-investment stasis...[they] are sugar pills by which we collectively embolden ourselves to bear economic risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as media and your uncle-who-drank-a-bit-more-at-Thanksgiving-dinner-than-he-should-have might decry financial markets for swindling everyone out of their money and being the center of corruption and greed, it&#39;s what makes modern society function.</p>
<p>No markets, no progress.</p>
