    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone successfully recovered photos from a broken Android phone?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The topic of data recovery from broken phones seems to be a prime target from SEO optimised blogspam so I&#39;m posting here in hopes that someone had a similar issue in the past and may be able to help me out.</p><p>I am tasked with restoring some photos from a Huawei P30 that has a broken screen/touchpad. The photos were stored on the device directly, unfortunately not on an SD card or on a cloud provider. The phone does still turn on (it vibrates when plugged into a power outlet and shows up on Windows). However, it&#39;s only showing an installer for HiSuite (which did not help), not the file system. USB debugging is enabled.</p><p>Things I tried so far and didn&#39;t work:</p><p>- shining a flashlight at the screen to see if only the backlight is broken (it seems the whole screen is done for)
- eyeballing it and trying to blindly enter the passcode
- connecting phone to external monitor and keyboard via USB-C -&gt; HDMI (monitor stays black)</p><p>Is there anything that may still have a chance of working short of replacing the screen to unlock the phone? Thanks and happy holidays.</p></div></div></div>
