    <p>PostgreSQL 16 was
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-16-released-2715/">released</a>
last week.  This is the story of a feature.</p>

<p>One of the minor new features in PostgreSQL 16 that I am excited about
is the ability to group digits in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-CONSTANTS-NUMERIC">numeric
literals</a>
by separating them with underscores, like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SELECT 1_000_000;
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE id &gt; 10_000_000;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It also works with non-integer literals:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE id &lt; 3.1415_9265;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This syntax is pretty standard in contemporary programming languages.
(As an exception,
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/integer_constant">C</a> and
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal">C++</a> use
apostrophes, like <code>1&#39;000&#39;000</code>.)</p>

<p>I noticed the need for something like this a few years ago.  I (and
others) sometimes do simplistic benchmarks that involve generating or
iterating over like a few million rows and then seeing how long that
runs.  So it might start like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO tbl SELECT generate_series(1, 1000000);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As computers get ever faster, the number of rows you will need to get
any meaningful measurements gets ever bigger.  So before long you
might be trying</p>

<div><div><pre><code>INSERT INTO tbl SELECT generate_series(1, 100000000);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then it gets hard to read and edit, and you might make mistakes,
and the whole thing ends up wasting time and effort.</p>

<p>I happened to come across <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28493">a
proposal</a> in the Go
language, which discussed adding the same feature to that language.
That discussion thankfully already worked out various details and
subtleties, so I didn’t have to start the research from scratch.</p>

<p>So I began to think that I would like to bring this syntax to
PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>One approach would be to write a patch and propose it to the
PostgreSQL hackers list.  But that would have been risky, because the
hackers community is generally wary of extending core SQL syntax in
ways to might conflict with the future evolution of the SQL standard.
(I am myself often supportive of that wariness.)</p>

<p>So I planned the other approach: Get this into the SQL standard first.</p>

<p>At the time, I was a fairly new participant in the SQL standard
working group, and such a change might have been an ambitious first
project.  Fortunately, another participant was just starting to work
on the same issue for the GQL standard (which is managed by the same
working group), so I jumped right in and we collaborated and after a
few months of back and forth got this change accepted into both the
SQL and GQL drafts in August 2020.</p>

<p>A few months later, I started to implement this in PostgreSQL, but
immediately ran into a problem.  To my surprise, I found that at that
time, PostgreSQL allowed having numeric constants and identifiers
adjacent without separating whitespace.  For example, this was
accepted:</p>



<p>This would parse the same as</p>



<p>which in turn has the same meaning as</p>



<p>I don’t know the history of that.  But I know that the ability to omit
the <code>AS</code> was added later.  So maybe before that, this syntax was
accepted but later failed with a parse error for other reasons, and so
it was not a big deal.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with my project?  Well, an underscore is a
valid start of an identifier, and so</p>



<p>was already valid and would parse as</p>



<p>meaning</p>



<p>So this was going to be not quite straightforward, and I parked the
project for a bit.</p>

<p>In early 2021, the first CD ballot of ISO/IEC 9075 (SQL) finished,
which is sort of a “beta” of an upcoming standard, and there were no
comments submitted about “my” numeric grouping feature.  That was an
indication that the feature seemed pretty settled, and I started
another attempt at getting this into PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>The first step was to fix the weird existing parsing behavior.  We got
consensus that this behavior was undesirable, so we just turned this
into an error.  We got this committed in February 2022 and it shipped
with PostgreSQL 15.  My idea was to give a one-major-version
transition period before implementing the new feature.  (I have since
encountered one customer who used the old parsing behavior, but it
appeared to have been a mistake.)</p>

<p>Then we could attack the core feature for PostgreSQL 16.  The actual
parser change was pretty simple, but there was more.  The SQL standard
also requires that the same syntax be accepted in casts from character
strings to numeric types.  This means we also need to accept these in
the input functions of <code>int2</code>, <code>int4</code>, <code>int8</code>, and <code>numeric</code>.  These
functions, in particular the integer ones, are nowadays (since
PostgreSQL 12) carefully tuned for performance, since they affect for
example COPY FROM performance.  So there was quite a bit of thought,
discussion, and review needed to get this integrated in the best way.
(My thanks in particular to Dean Rasheed and David Rowley for helping
with all that.)  We finally go this in in February 2023, and now it’s
shipping in PostgreSQL 16.</p>

<p>(There was also a nontrivial side quest to get this feature into the
SQL/JSON path language, both in PostgreSQL and the SQL standard.
SQL/JSON is part of the SQL standard, but its syntax is based on the
JavaScript (ECMAScript) standard, which has slightly different rules
for numeric literals.  Also, the PostgreSQL implementation of SQL/JSON
had some corner-case bugs that were discovered during this project and
were fixed in PostgreSQL 15.  We got everything into PostgreSQL 16.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new SQL standard, SQL:2023, containing “my” feature,
also shipped this year, so everything is synchronized and up to date.</p>

<p>So that was the story of my 4-year journey that get that feature out
into the world.  I hope you find it useful, and maybe other SQL
implementations adopt it as well.</p>
