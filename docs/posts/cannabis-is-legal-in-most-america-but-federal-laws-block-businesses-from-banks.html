The lack of access to capital can make or break a business.</p><p><a href="https://rljcompanies.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|inline click|${u}">When I sold BET</a> and started my current business, The RLJ Companies, the portfolio of companies included both a private equity firm and a bank that enabled me to create economic growth opportunities for individuals and businesses. Today, the private equity company includes a hydroponic business that provides supplies needed for growers in the cannabis industry.</p><h2>Growing America&#39;s marijuana industry</h2><p>According to a research report conducted by New Frontier Data, <a href="https://newfrontierdata.com/cannabis-insights/new-state-markets-could-boost-u-s-legal-cannabis-sales-to-72b-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|inline click|${u}">the U.S. cannabis industry is projected to be a $72 billion market</a> by 2030. </p><p><strong>Our View:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/opinion/todaysdebate/2022/07/31/legalize-marijuana-federal-prohibition-more-harm-than-good/10100661002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:7|${u}">Federal ban on marijuana use causes more harm than good</a></p><p><strong>Our View:</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2022/09/08/working-cannabis-industry-shouldnt-so-hard-entrepreneurs/10281695002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:8|${u}">Cannabis startups should have the same opportunities as other businesses</a></p><p>Imagine that these billions of dollars are being exchanged in the marketplace but never deposited into a single financial or banking institution.
