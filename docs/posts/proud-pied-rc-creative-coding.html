<h2 id="whats-all-this-then">What’s all this then?</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=8238c6d9149cbd0865752e535795d509" target="_blank">RC</a>, there’s a weekly “Creative Coding” event.
At the start of the block, someone provides a prompt –
often a line from a poem, song, or book.
After a couple</p>
<p>The 2024-04-17 session quoted Shakespeare’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_98" target="_blank">Sonnet 98</a>,
with the prompt “proud-pied”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From you have I been absent in the spring,</p>
<p>Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell</p>
<p>Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,</p>
<p>Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
As with your shadow I with these did play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t know what “proud-pied” meant, but the
prompter glossed it as “gorgeously variegated”.</p>
<p><em>Variagated</em> is a term familiar <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/projects/cceckman/comet" target="_blank">to me</a>;
it was used around my house a lot <a href="https://edieeckman.com" target="_blank">growing up</a>.
So my take was to simulate variegated yarn… poorly, as it turns out, but pleasingly.</p>
<h3 id="multi-threaded-simulation">Multi-threaded simulation</h3>
<p>When the page loads (or the settings are changed),
the code simulates several <em>threads</em> of variegated yarn.
Each thread has a random starting hue, value, and saturation;
a random <em>speed</em> that determines how quickly it varies;
and a property to vary (either hue or value).</p>
<p>The rendering code draws column-by-column. It generates
a gradient for each thread, and alternates between
threads on a per-“stitch” basis.</p>
<h3 id="this-has-bugs">This has bugs…</h3>
<p>The code isn’t very fast; I haven’t done any work to make it efficient.</p>
<p>The gradients don’t quite work as intended, particularly the hue gradient.
I had meant for hues to smoothly cycle around the color wheel,
but I realized after implementing this that I hadn’t put in enough
control points to make that happen. I suspect the value gradient has a similar issue.</p>
<h3 id="and-thats-okay">…and that’s okay</h3>
<p>I’ve really enjoyed the creative coding sessions at RC.
It’s nice to not have to have a plan going in, and to have no committment to maintain
/ present / complete going out – code as a transient artifact.</p>
<p>This was my first experiment with HTML canvas, and I’m pretty pleased with the result.
Mistakes and all, I learned from making it.</p>
