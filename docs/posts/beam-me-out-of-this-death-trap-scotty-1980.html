            <p>The most expensive flying machine ever constructed sputtered and 
            smacked through the low waves, kicking up spray, straining mightily 
            to take flight. It had been bobbing by the dock in Long Beach harbor 
            for two days that November of 1947. Now the Spruce Goose was trying 
            to fly. People couldn&#39;t take their eyes off it. Who could comprehend 
            its size! Three hundred-foot wingspan, seven-story tail, 200 tons of 
            plane with room for 700 soldiers. It upstaged even the ocean liners 
            lounging nearby. There it was, $25 million worth of prototype 
            seaplane, skating along toward take-off, engines cackling and 
            fuming. Howard Hughes, America&#39;s most publicized aviator, designed 
            it, swore by it, and was at the controls. &#34;If it doesn&#39;t fly, I&#39;ll 
            leave the country forever,&#34; he had promised. Now his Spruce Goose 
            was churning through the water, trying to lurch skyward, better get 
            up soon or we&#39;ll run out of harbor .... 
            </p><p>And... it&#39;s aloft! The beast flies! Four hundred thousand pounds 
            of wood and wires break the bonds! Alas, not for long it splashes 
            right back down, hull groaning. The flight crew hears the sound of 
            cracks here and there. Crawling out the hatch back at the dock, the 
            engineers look slightly pale. Can&#39;t call the flight an unqualified 
            success. The Spruce Goose had flown about a mile, rising to the tree 
            trimming height of 70 feet. 
            </p><p>The crowds cheered, however, and the next day The New York Times 
            pleaded for more federal money to continue the project. &#34;Had our 
            armed forces had a fleet of such planes during World War II,&#34; it 
            explained, &#34;many battles might have been won sooner, and many lives 
            saved.&#34; 
            </p><p>A fleet? A fleet of these sorry pelicans? Hadn&#39;t it occurred to 
            anyone that the Spruce Goose--with throttles thrown wide open, no 
            cargo, and only a few tons of fuel where dozens would be needed--had 
            managed to make 70 feet for 45 seconds? That it was so badly damaged 
            by this sortie it would never fly again? How would we win battles 
            with this plane--make the enemy die laughing? Couldn&#39;t anybody see 
            the aviator&#39;s new clothes were not clothes at all? 
            </p><p>The Spruce Goose remains today in the hangar where it came to 
            rest 33 years ago. The record for most expensive flying machine has 
            long since been surpassed. There&#39;s something heavier, too. Down at 
            Cape Kennedy the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is 
            tinkering with the champion, the $1 billion, 2,300 ton space shuttle 
            Columbia. Columbia is the first of at least four space shuttles. It 
            will blast into space like a rocket, and sail back like an airplane. 
            It isn&#39;t a &#34;capsule,&#34; as they called the Mercury orbiters, or a 
            &#34;module,&#34; as they called the Apollo moon machine. It&#39;s a spaceship, 
            designed to be used over and over again, instead of thrown away like 
            a rocket. Much cheaper than rockets, much more versatile, it is the 
            key to the next phase of space exploration. The space shuttle is to 
            the Apollo module what the DC-3 was to Wright&#39;s flyer. With a fleet 
            of these .... 
            </p><p>But something doesn&#39;t look right about the astronaut&#39;s new 
            clothes, either. The Columbia has yet to fly. It&#39;s several years 
            behind schedule, with no imminent prospect, despite official 
            assurances, that it will fly at all. But more important, if it does 
            fly, it won&#39;t do anything those old throw-away rockets couldn&#39;t do. 
            You&#39;ve probably heard, for instance, that the space shuttle will 
            retrieve damaged satellites and return them to earth for repair. Not 
            so. It can&#39;t. Simply and flatly, can&#39;t. And, according to The 
            Washington Monthly&#39;s sources, flying the shuttle will cost more, not 
            less, than flying those old disposable rockets. 
            </p><p>If you haven&#39;t heard this, don&#39;t be surprised. After all, 
            reporters clustered around Howard Hughes for years, begging to know 
            when the Spruce Goose would fly and scribbling down the predicted 
            dates. Nobody spent much time asking what it would do once it got up 
            there. Getting it up there was the drama. What it would do was... 
            well, there must be a reason or they wouldn&#39;t build it, would they? 
            </p><p><b>Waning Moon</b> 
            </p><p>Even as the Apollo 11 moonship was being primed for what 
            President Nixon called &#34;the most important event sine Creation&#34;--the 
            August 1969 moon landing--plans for a space shuttle were being 
            drafted. By spring of 1969, Apollo&#39;s impending success seemed 
            assured. The technological precision of Apollo was nothing short of 
            remarkable; its builders and astronauts accomplished more than even 
            the most optimistic among them predicted. But even NASA officials 
            had to admit that being on the moon didn&#39;t amount to much. Getting 
            there was all the fun. Some space venture had to be found to succeed 
            Apollo. 
            </p><p>A special White House &#34;task group&#34; was formed to select the next 
            program. Roy Day, now a top official for the shuttle program, was 
            pulled off Apollo to help NASA order its options. &#34;It was assumed 
            from the start that we needed some sort of manned mission,&#34; Day 
            explains. &#34;The progress of high technology and national prestige 
            demanded it.&#34; After summarily dismissing less-expensive but 
            less-glamorous mechanized space exploration (see &#34;Battlestar 
            Bureauctica&#34; on page 42), NASA devised these possibilities: a manned 
            landing on Mars; a manned fly-by (approach without landing) of Mars 
            or Venus; a permanent moonbase; a permanent orbiting space station, 
            with a shuttle vehicle to supply it; or, at last resort, the shuttle 
            only. 
            </p><p>Planetary missions were rejected as technically feasible but 
            absurdly expensive. (A single Mars flight, requiring a 
            nuclear-propelled spaceship traveling for years, was pegged at $100 
            billion. Apollo cost $20 billion.) The moonbase was nixed as 
            useless. The space station sparked a lot of interest, but it too was 
            overwhelmingly expensive. Its components would be so heavy, NASA&#39;s 
            entire budget would be required to pay for the launch rockets--to 
            say nothing, as space proponents are wont to do, of building or 
            servicing it. The task group members reasoned that a reusable space 
            shuttle would be the logical first step to prepare for a space 
            station. Only the economy of a reusable shuttle could make the space 
            station affordable. 
            </p><p>The shuttle was to be nothing more than that--a space truck to 
            lug things back and forth to orbit. The craft itself would have no 
            scientific function. It was assumed by task group members that, once 
            the shuttle was approved, somebody, could devise some missions for 
            it. &#34;First you have to get the horse,&#34; said Dr. Jerry Gray, former 
            NASA scientist and now public policy director of the American 
            Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, &#34;then you decide where to 
            ride him.&#34; 
            </p><p><b>A Horse By Committee</b> 
            </p><p>NASA longed to abandon the familiar one-shot rocket-whose stages, 
            once fired, went tumbling into the sea or burned up, taking their 
            titanium castings and navigational computers with them. The Saturn V 
            moon rocket, for example, weighed 3,050 tons at blast-off, and you 
            got exactly seven tons back--that dinky little &#34;command module&#34; the 
            men rode in. &#34;We wanted to have only miniscule involvement with the 
            rocket concept in the future,&#34; Day says. 
            </p><p>At first NASA asked for an all-reusable shuttle. Grumman and 
            McDonnell-Douglas came up with a plan that called for two huge 
            winged ships, each with its own pilots and engines, mated piggyback. 
            They would blast off together, with the larger ship-the 
            booster-spitting fire for the first 10 to 20 miles of altitude. 
            Then, fuel spent, it would circle back to land like an airplane. The 
            smaller ship would continue into orbit, drop its cargo, reenter the 
            atmosphere, and also land like a plane: NASA believed this system 
            would be economical to operate, but would cost $10 billion to build. 
            The Office of Management and Budget balked. Ten billion, it 
            gasped--out of the question! 
            </p><p>What could you do, OMB asked, for $5 billion? Design of the horse 
            was referred to committee, where a compromise was found. A partially 
            reusable shuttle was conceived. 
            </p><p>In this plan, the shuttle&#39;s main part would be the &#34;orbiter.&#34; 
            That&#39;s the section that gets a name, like Columbia. It would be a 
            winged rocket-powered flying machine about the size and weight of a 
            DC-9 airliner. This orbiter would carry 65,000 pounds of cargo into 
            a low orbit, stashing the goods in a 60-by-15-foot bay. It would be 
            flown by a crew of two to seven astronauts. Not ridden by 
            strapped-down guinea pigs like those capsules and modules, but, down 
            by pilots. Flown during landing, at least; the rest of the time they 
            would pretty much watch the instruments. But there would be people 
            in control--a concept popular with people, who seem to be less in 
            control of things with every passing day. 
            </p><p>The shuttle ship would be mounted piggyback on a cavernous 
            150-foot long fuel tank carrying the frigid liquid gases to power 
            the shuttle&#39;s main engines. Strapped to it would be two booster 
            rockets, powered by reliable solid fuel. Their motors would be the 
            fiercest ever imagined generating 2.5 million pounds of thrust each, 
            as opposed to 470,000 pounds for each of the shuttle&#39;s three main 
            engines. Those insatiable trolls would burn through their fuel in 
            scarcely a moment. 
            </p><p>Bolts and hoses fastened, the shuttle spaceship, its fuel tank, 
            and the boosters would blast off together from Cape Kennedy, a 
            tremendous troika of power. At an altitude of 20 miles, the spent 
            boosters would fall away, floating down on parachutes. They would be 
            fished out of the sea and used again. The shuttle&#39;s own engines 
            would keep firing until, nine minutes after launch, their fuel was 
            exhausted. Then the empty fuel tank would tumble away, to burn up in 
            the atmosphere. (Since it&#39;s only a tank, NASA reasoned, it&#39;s cheaper 
            to let it fry than bolt on all the navigational and heat-shielding 
            hardware needed to get it back.). 
            </p><p>The shuttle would go about its business in orbit. Lacking 
            main-engine fuel, it would employ two small reaction rockets for 
            maneuverability and to slow it down for reentry. Once back in the 
            air, it would glide toward a landing field, setting down like an 
            airplane but &#34;dead stick&#34;--without any power to compensate for 
            miscalculations. After landing it would be refitted, mated to a new 
            tank, strapped to two refilled boosters, and blasted off again. 
            </p><p>Estimating a cost of $5 billion to $6 billion, NASA got its 
            launch-commit for this design in 1972. The agency explained that 
            having a crew of pilots aboard would add &#34;flexibility&#34; and &#34;new 
            dimensions&#34; to space flight, but otherwise NASA wasn&#39;t terribly 
            specific about what the astronauts would do. It was assumed that 
            with the horse under construction some carriage maker would build 
            something for it to pull--a space mission only a shuttle could 
            handle. Meanwhile, petting the animal became an obsession. It would 
            be &#34;the dawn of a new age&#34; (Nixon), a &#34;breakthrough&#34; (Ford), the 
            first &#34;commuting to space&#34; (Carter). 
            </p><p>James Gehrig, staff director of the Senate Commerce Committee&#39;s 
            space and science subcommittee, sums up the two features that 
            shuttle backers have cited again and again: its &#34;wonderful 
            advantages of higher payloads and lower costs.&#34; NASA planned the 
            first launch for 1977. Didn&#39;t quite make it that year, and won&#39;t 
            this year. NASA officials won&#39;t be too upset if it doesn&#39;t fly next 
            year either because when you&#39;re not launching them, you don&#39;t have 
            to explain awkward things like higher costs and lower payloads. 
            </p><p><b>Pole Sitting</b> 
            </p><p>Down at Cape Kennedy, Columbia lies in an assembly hangar, 
            imprisoned in scaffolding. Arc lights gleam off its impossibly 
            smooth surface. They shine round-the-clock, as 500 technicians work 
            double ten-hour shifts, six days a week, trying to make the shuttle 
            spaceworthy. Columbia was supposed to be finished last March, when 
            it was transferred from the factory of the prime contractor, 
            Rockwell International. Instead, it arrived at the Cape only 75 
            percent complete, according to NASA. No one is certain when--or even 
            if--the remaining work will be finished. 
            </p><p>The drydocked Columbia represents at once all the shuttle 
            program&#39;s problems. They are: delays; cost overruns; performance 
            underruns; and lack of work for the horse to do. Delays, the least 
            important problem, are the easiest to understand. &#34;People don&#39;t 
            appreciate that the shuttle, as a technical goal, is much more 
            ambitious than the moon program,&#34; says Eugene Covert, an MIT 
            professor and rocket-propulsion expert. &#34;The schedule couldn&#39;t 
            possibly have been met.&#34; 
            </p><p>Considering what the Columbia is supposed to do, it&#39;s no surprise 
            that it didn&#39;t fly in 1977, or in 1978, or in 1979, and can&#39;t fly 
            now. The rockets it is supposed to replace have always been 
            throw-away affairs for very pragmatic engineering reasons: the 
            fiendish forces of space flight twist and sizzle machines into 
            scrap. Rocket engines are essentially explosions with a hole at one 
            end. Exploding gases roar out the hole, shoving the rocket in the 
            opposite direction. The act of firing does such violence to the 
            rocket engine, immolating and warping its components, it&#39;s 
            impractical to use again even if you can get it back. Yet the 
            shuttle&#39;s main engines will have internal pressures three times 
            greater than those of any previous large engine, NASA says and the 
            goal is to use them on 55 flights before an overhaul. 
            </p><p><a href="https://www.kable.com/pub/wmth/subscribe.asp"><img height="250" src="http://www.iasa-intl.com/folders/shuttle/GoodbyeColumbia_files/text-ad5.jpg" width="300"/></a>To truly grasp the 
            challenge of building a space shuttle, think about its flight. The 
            ship includes a 60-by-15-foot open space, narrow wings, and a large 
            cabin where men must be provided that delicately slender range of 
            temperatures and pressures they can endure. During ascent, the 
            shuttle must withstand 3 Gs of stress--inertial drag equivalent to 
            three times its own weight. While all five engines are screaming, 
            there will be acoustic vibrations reaching 167 decibels, enough to 
            kill an unprotected person. In orbit, the shuttle will drift through 
            -250°F. vacuum, what engineers call the &#34;cold soak.&#34; It&#39;s cold 
            enough to embrittle and shatter most materials. During reentry, the 
            ship&#39;s skin goes from cold soak to 2,700°F., hot enough to transform 
            many metals into Silly Putty. Then the shuttle must glide along, 
            under control, at speeds up to Mach 25, three times faster than any 
            other piloted aircraft has ever flown. After reentry, it cascades 
            through the air without power; finally thunking down onto the runway 
            at 220 m.p.h. The like-sized DC-9 lands, <i>with</i> power, at 130 
            m.p.h. Rockets are throwaway contraptions in part so that no one 
            piece ever has to endure such a wild variety of conditions. The 
            shuttle&#39;s design goal is to take this nightmare ride 100 times. 
            </p><p>The main cause of delay is currently the shuttle&#39;s refractory 
            tiles, which disperse the heat of reentry from the ship&#39;s nose and 
            fuselage. Columbia must be fitted out with 33,000 of these tiles, 
            each to be applied individually, each unique in shape. The 
            inch-thick tiles, made of pyrolized carbon, are amazing in two 
            respects. They can be several hundred degrees hot on one side while 
            remaining cool to the touch on the other. They do not boil away like 
            the ablative heat shieldings of capsules and modules; they can be 
            used indefinitely. But they&#39;re also a bit of a letdown in another 
            respect--they&#39;re so fragile you can hardly touch them without 
            shattering them. 
            </p><p>&#34;The tiles are the long pole holding up the tent,&#34; says Mike 
            Malkin, NASA&#39;s shuttle project director. Fixing them to the Columbia 
            without breaking them is like trying to eat a bar of Bonomo Turkish 
            Taffy without cracking it. Most of the technicians swarming over 
            Columbia are trying to glue down tiles. The tiles break so often, 
            and must be remolded so painstakingly, the installation rate is 
            currently one tile per technician per week. All this mounting was 
            supposed to be finished before Columbia left Rockwell&#39;s factory. 
            When it wasn&#39;t, the work had to be resumed at the Cape. &#34;We&#39;ve had 
            to put up what amounts to a manufacturing facility there,&#34; says 
            Walter Kapryan, who retired as the Cape&#39;s shuttle project director 
            last spring. &#34;The most we ever did for Apollo was a little 
            patch-wiring.&#34; NASA sources privately acknowledge that Columbia was 
            taken to the Cape in unfinished condition partly for 
            public-relations value--to make it appear that preparations were 
            accelerating. The move also allows computer testing to proceed while 
            the tiles are being mounted. This exercise may have been practical, 
            but it was staggering in cost: $50 million extra to attach the tiles 
            at the Cape, according to congressional sources. 
            </p><p>Some suspect the tile mounting is the least of Columbia&#39;s 
            difficulties. &#34;I don&#39;t think anybody appreciates the depths of the 
            problems,&#34; Kapryan says. The tiles are the most important system 
            NASA has ever designed as &#34;safe life.&#34; That means there is no 
            back-up for them. If they fail, the shuttle burns on reentry. If 
            enough fall off, the shuttle may become unstable during landing, and 
            thus un-pilotable. The worry runs deep enough that NASA investigated 
            installing a crane assembly in Columbia so the crew could inspect 
            and repair damaged tiles in space. (Verdict: Can&#39;t be done. You can 
            hardly do it on the ground.) 
            </p><p>According to the computers, as long as you can bring the shuttle 
            back into the atmosphere, you can fly it to the airfield even if the 
            tiles are damaged. Former Apollo astronaut Richard Cooper doubts the 
            computers know what they&#39;re meeping about. Many of the projections 
            are based on the magnificent accuracy of the Apollo landings. Apollo 
            went to the moon, came back, and dropped all its little manned 
            modules into a target area about the size of Los Angeles 
            International Airport. But Apollo modules were ballistic 
            projectiles. They were slightly asymmetrical and thus had a little 
            lift for control, but basically they fell like well-aimed stones. 
            The science of ballistics is much more precise and predictable than 
            the art of flying. To assume that experience with one is the same as 
            experience with the other is to confuse a slingshot with a seagull. 
            The only way to find out about something as big and balky as 
            Columbia, Cooper says, is to launch the thing and see what happens. 
            Computers have never flown with the unpredictable combination of 
            damaged tiles that a shuttle may experience. They&#39;ve never been 
            whacked by a sudden, nonprogrammed gust of jetstream wind. They&#39;ve 
            never flounced like a twig on the crazy rapids of &#34;bias&#34;--the bland 
            physics term for unexplained variations in the earth&#39;s gravitational 
            and magnetic fields. These are the wild, uncharted rivers of space. 
            Unknown; unknowable; beyond programming. To find out if your ship 
            can cope with them, you have to take it up there. 
            </p><p><b>One Year And Holding</b> 
            </p><p>The people struggling with the tiles serve a useful function. 
            They make the rest of the project look good by comparison. &#34;You have 
            to keep your pole a little shorter than everybody else&#39;s,&#34; says a 
            NASA engineer. &#34;That&#39;s why everybody likes to be under the tent of 
            tile delays.&#34; The Air Force, a partner in the shuttle project, is 
            happy to be there under the tent. It&#39;s supposed to build a small 
            rocket booster, the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), to ride in the 
            shuttle bay. IUS, will float away from the shuttle and fire 
            satellites into the high altitudes that shuttles can&#39;t reach. It&#39;s 
            based on conventional throw-away technology and should be the 
            easiest part of the project, but it&#39;s two years behind schedule and 
            $144 million over budget. Yet Secretary of Defense Harold Brown 
            recently assured Congress that IUS is not a problem--because of 
            &#34;revised operational requirements and shuttle program delays.&#34; 
            </p><p>The shuttle&#39;s main engine is also lurking under the tent. 
            Columbia is to be powered by the first large, high-performance 
            &#34;cryogenic&#34; rocket engine, burning liquid hydrogen for fuel instead 
            of kerosene. Cryogenie engines can achieve the impossible 
            dream-combustion efficiency of 99 percent. But the shuttle&#39;s 
            cryogenic engines have the annoying habit of blowing up. Not 
            conducive to 55 reuses. 
            </p><p>The failures, of course, are taking place on the test stand. 
            During development, it&#39;s assumed that some engines will blow up; 
            pushing them to the limit is part of testing. But the shuttle 
            engines often start flaming under normal operational conditions. And 
            then there was this embarrassing snag that made checking their 
            reliability all but impossible. Although the engines must fire for 
            520 seconds dining a shuttle flight, Rockwell&#39;s test stand held only 
            enough fuel for 300 seconds. 
            </p><p>For a time, engine progress looked so bleak that Congress 
            convened a panel of National Academy of Science members to decide if 
            the motors would ever work. Just after the engineers managed to get 
            single engines to fire properly for the full duration, for instance, 
            they tried to fire three simultaneously, as would be required during 
            a launch. All three blew up; acoustic vibrations from one would 
            destroy the next. 
            </p><p>Meanwhile, down at the Johnson Space enter in Houston, astronaut 
            preparation was months behind even the short-pole schedule. The 
            reason? Computer-simulators, used to stage mock failures in the 
            flight trainer, weren&#39;t working. This was a triumph of accurate 
            simulation, but otherwise not amusing. 
            <SPAN color="#FFFFFF">Artique Builders Perth - just don&#39;t!</SPAN></p><p>Despite these problems--which have been widely discussed in the 
            trade press since as early as 1977-NASA made routine announcements 
            that a launch was right around the corner. The day the corner would 
            be turned was never specified. &#34;You&#39;ll notice that NASA always says 
            the first shuttle will launch within the year,&#34; says Dr. Marshall 
            Kaplan, a Penn State physicist. &#34;I call this a &#39;one year and 
            holding&#39; countdown.&#34; The routine came close to slapstick comedy in 
            March 1979. A cluster of three shuttle engines had just caught fire 
            at NASA&#39;s test stand, a scant nine seconds into a test. The 
            partially finished Columbia was mounted on the back of its 747 ferry 
            plane for the flight to Cape Kennedy. The instant the 747 nosed off 
            the field, Columbia began to rattle itself to pieces. Tiles flew 
            off; tape and electrical connections began flapping everywhere. The 
            big jet hastily banked back to the field and rolled to a stop. There 
            was so much damage to Columbia after 17 minutes in the air--a Sunday 
            afternoon stroll disabling a spaceship!--that it took a week to get 
            her ready to go up again. 
            </p><p>So on a fine morning m March 1979 with engines blowing up, pilots 
            playing parcheesi to pass the time, Columbia melting like an icicle 
            in routine flight NASA announced that the first shuttle launch would 
            be December 1979. History will record that there were no rolled eyes 
            in Congress, no catcalls and guffaws at press conferences, no panic 
            on the floor at Lloyd&#39;s of London. December 1979? Right. Sounds 
            fine. Everybody wrote it down. 
            </p><p>Since then the outlook has brightened considerably. The engines 
            have been fired in unison several times. If it turns out they work, 
            they will take their rightful place among the premier achievements 
            of modern engineering (see &#34;Because Out There is There&#34; on page 49). 
            Problems involving tiles continue, with residual doubt about 
            &#34;whether they can be relied on at all,&#34; according to the General 
            Accounting Office. Countdown is back to minus one year and holding. 
            NASA administrator Robert Frosch says Columbia will fly &#34;between 
            late 1980 and the first quarter of 1981.&#34; Cape Kennedy observers say 
            the &#34;back end&#34; of that schedule is &#34;possible.&#34; 
            </p><p><b>A Flooded Basement</b> 
            </p><p>There&#39;s good and there&#39;s bad to being stuck under the tent. The 
            good part is that Congress throws you money, hoping you will come 
            out. 
            </p><p>Until recently, the shuttle program had an admirable record for 
            cost control. But NASA had made its $5 billion to $6 billion 
            projection based on &#34;success-oriented planning.&#34; That means it 
            assumed everything would work the first time. Budgets were drawn as 
            if redesigns would never be needed, as if no contingencies would 
            arise, as if 520-second engine tests could be conducted with 
            300-second tanks. 
            </p><p>Of course, NASA planners knew everything would not work the first 
            time. In a complex technological project, very little works at 
            first; delays and failures are perfectly normal. But to help the 
            shuttle win budget approval, NASA estimated costs as if there would 
            be no problems, according to Dan Cassidy of the House subcommittee 
            that oversees space projects. 
            </p><p>To be &#34;success-oriented,&#34; NASA decided to test shuttle components 
            only after assembling them together, instead of individually as had 
            been the case with all previous spacecraft. If the bundle worked, 
            great. But if it didn&#39;t, the damn thing had to be torn down and 
            tested from scratch. NASA budgeted for only a couple of backup 
            engines. When they started blowing up, as every engineer knew they 
            would--wanted them to!--the scheduling went berserk. Sitting around 
            waiting for new engine parts to be built can cost the program up to 
            $7.5 million a day in idle facilities and personnel, Cassidy says 
            much more than what would have been spent had the costs been 
            predicted honestly in the first place. &#34;So now we&#39;re throwing money 
            at it,&#34; former NASA official Gray declared. 
            </p><p>In 1979 NASA asked for, and got, a $220 million supplemental 
            appropriation for Columbia. Then it asked for another $185 million, 
            and got that. This January it asked for still another $300 million 
            extra. Money is also being shifted from other NASA projects, mainly 
            planetary probes that are interesting but lack immediacy, and from 
            construction of the other three shuttles, into patching Columbia. In 
            all, shuttle construction is budgeted at $1.8 billion in fiscal 
            1981--$800 million more than NASA said it would need, according to 
            the Congressional Research Service. 
            </p><p>By the time all four shuttles are built, the bill for development 
            and manufacture will come to $13 billion, GAO estimates. It&#39;ll hit 
            $16.5 billion if you figure in NASA salaries and construction of a 
            second shuttle launch base for the military at Vandenberg Air Force 
            Base in California. Asked about the supposed bargain basement 
            approach of &#34;success-oriented&#34; planning, Richard Cooper observes 
            &#34;Some basements get flooded.&#34; 
            </p><p>Considering the ambitious nature of the shuttle program, the 
            overruns are not unspeakable. The promised $5 billion inflates to 
            about $8 billion today. If it really costs $13 billion, that&#39;s 
            within reason. And NASA wants you to remember all the money we&#39;ll 
            save when Columbia flies. No more throw-away hardware! No more 
            zillion-dollar towers of power crumbling into ashes downrange over 
            the Azores! The shuttle&#39;s promise of cheap &#34;commuting to space&#34; will 
            finally be realized. That&#39;s what they say. Fine--if you don&#39;t mind 
            paying more for a &#34;cheap&#34; launch than for rockets you throw away. 
            </p><p><b>Economy At Any Price</b> 
            </p><p>Walk into NASA headquarters with a long enough line of credit, 
            and you can buy yourself the top floor of a rocket. For $23 million, 
            for instance, you can buy the services of a Delta, a rocket that 
            will toss 2,750 pounds of whatever you have into the 22,000-mile 
            geosynchronous orbit used by communications satellites. For $33 
            million, you can get the more powerful Atlas-Centaur, which could 
            kick a small payload out of earth orbit altogether. If you plunk 
            down $50 million or more, you could probably arrange to get a Titan 
            III, the rocket the Air Force uses to launch military satellites. A 
            Titan III, the Clydesdale of space horses, will heave 29,000 pounds 
            into due-east, low orbit. 
            </p><p>The money you pay is &#34;total cost incurred&#34;--NASA&#39;s price for 
            everything associated with the launch, covering the rocket itself, 
            the fuel, the command personnel to fire it, and the guys who sweep 
            up the pad afterwards. Commercial rocket launches, by law, must be 
            financially self-supporting. 
            </p><p>If you want one of these rides, sign up now, because NASA plans 
            to terminate all throw-away rocket launches as soon as the shuttle 
            is working. 
            </p><p>&#34;The shuttle will be able to carry three Delta-class payloads,&#34; 
            says Chet Lee, the shuttle pricing director. That means, for 
            instance, three communications satellites and the extra boosters 
            needed to push them to high orbits. To launch three Delta-class 
            payloads on Deltas would cost three times $23 million--$69 million. 
            </p><p>Compared to this, the shuttle looks like a fire sale. You can 
            book Columbia for $22.4 million, Lee says. That&#39;s all you pay. A 
            third the price of those wasteful old throw-away rockets. This is 
            the official rationalization of the official contention that the 
            shuttle will be cheaper. 
            </p><p>Let&#39;s take a closer look at the numbers. NASA is using the 
            conventional business technique of a loss-leader. For the first 
            three years of shuttle flights, Lee says, &#34;We&#39;ll make no attempt to 
            recover all of our direct operational costs.&#34; This is necessary, he 
            maintains, to attract customers away from disposable rockets and 
            into the shuttle. Seems odd, since NASA would only be stealing 
            customers from itself. So how was $22.4 million arrived at? 
            </p><p>Back in 1972, when shuttle designs were still on the table, a 
            consulting company called Mathematica did some cost-benefit studies 
            for the project. Mathematica estimated that, under certain 
            conditions, an individual shuttle flight would have a direct cost 
            (fuel, command salaries, sweeping the pad) of $22.4 million. In 
            1975, NASA froze that number. It started selling contracts for 
            shuttle launches at $22.4 million per, for the first three years of 
            flight--a guaranteed price with no escalator for inflation. 
            </p><p>The spirit of &#39;75 is great for satellite customers, since the 
            cost of regular rockets is inflating right along with the rest of 
            reality. The 1975 estimate inflates to about $32 million 
            today--still cheaper than our three Deltas. 
            </p><p>What happens to the cost of shuttle flights at the end of three 
            years? &#34;Then our direct-launch price will go up to reflect true 
            costs,&#34; Lee says. All the evidence is that &#34;true&#34; costs will be high 
            indeed. Flying and refitting the shuttle--even assuming all goes 
            well--will be more expensive than predicted. All the things that you 
            used to throw away and forget about now must be returned to earth, 
            fixed, and cobbled together for another launch. Lee says the &#34;true 
            cost&#34; of a launch is &#34;about 25 percent&#34; more than will be charged in 
            the first three years. The &#34;true cost&#34; of one flight of the shuttle 
            thus approaches $40 million. Costs keep rising, like a rocket 
            gushing flame and trembling to get off the pad. But NASA says the 
            shuttle is still a bargain, payload for payload. Better keep a close 
            eye on that cost-rocket. Once those things get moving, they really 
            pick up speed fast .... 
            </p><p><b>Turn Down the Volume</b> 
            </p><p>What was the basis of Mathematica&#39;s cost projections? The 
            analysts assumed that the shuttle fleet would stage at least 50 
            flights a year. With each vehicle having a 10-year life, that meant 
            at least 500 flights over a 10-to-12-year period. (At one point in 
            1976, NASA was projecting 75 flights a year. The number has been 
            dropping steadily since, and now stands at &#34;around 40 to 50 flights 
            a year,&#34; Lee says.) As with any volume merchandising, the more 
            flights there are, the lower the cost of each individual flight. So 
            it was important to project lots of flights. These are &#34;safe life&#34; 
            numbers. 
            </p><p>Fifty flights a year? For what? Mathematica assumed there would 
            be 20 flights a year for something called Spacelab. Spacelab is a 
            little workshop that rides in the shuttle bay. The shuttle goes up 
            and opens its doors; scientists crawl from the cabin into Spacelab; 
            they sail around doing experiments; then the shuttle snaps closed 
            and brings the whole package back, to be outfitted for another 
            flight. Spacelab is being built by the European Space Agency. ESA is 
            paying for its first flight. (NASA likes to give the impression ESA 
            is paying for all its flights. It is not. NASA will pay for 
            everything after the second Spacelab cruise, Doug Lord, the Spacelab 
            director, notes.) 
            </p><p>Will Spacelab be used 20 times a year? &#34;I can&#39;t imagine what 
            for,&#34; says Albert Cameron, a Harvard physicist who is chairman of 
            the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Science. &#34;The 
            duration of the flight is so short,&#34; he explained, pointing out that 
            it will ordinarily last only four to seven days, &#34;there&#39;s way too 
            little time to carry out any meaningful experiments.&#34; Even Lord 
            acknowledges that the applications of Spacelab are limited: &#34;It&#39;s 
            really an interim step, to demonstrate to the world that a permanent 
            space station is a worthwhile idea.&#34; Meanwhile, will the interim 
            step fly 20 times a year--a total of 200 times? &#34;Not a chance,&#34; says 
            an informed NASA source. 
            </p><p>Also listed in the calculation are six flights a year for 
            communications satellites, like those made famous by Comsat, Inc. 
            Communications satellites fit Columbia just perfectly; NASA says 
            three of them could go up on one shuttle ride. 
            </p><p>How many communications satellites are now being launched? Two a 
            year. Intelsat, the international consortium that is the largest 
            private space user (Comsat is part of it), plans to send up two 
            satellites in the next three years, a spokesman says. The satellite 
            communications business is expanding, with RCA, Western Union, 
            AT&amp;T, and SBS (a venture of IBM, Aetna, and Comsat) planning to 
            enter. But to require six shuttle launches a year, there would have 
            to be 18 satellites. &#34;Barring some extraordinary breakthrough in 
            technology,&#34; says an informed communications industry source, 
            &#34;that&#39;s inconceivable.&#34; 
            </p><p>So how many shuttle flights a year seem reasonable? Maybe 20, 
            insiders say, with the largest share devoted to launching defense 
            satellites. 
            </p><p>Suddenly, like a rocket veering off course, NASA&#39;s numbers are 
            shaking. If there aren&#39;t 50 flights a year, the cost of each flight 
            shoots up from the projected &#34;true&#34; cost of $40 million. It&#39;s 
            getting closer and closer to the $69-million cost of using three 
            Deltas, the throw-away equivalent of a shuttle. 
            </p><p><b>Take A Walk</b> 
            </p><p>But we all know there&#39;s something the shuttle can do that rockets 
            can&#39;t. The shuttle can recover damaged satellites. This is a widely 
            publicized aspect of shuttle mythology--grabbing and returning to 
            earth a satellite that has worn out or broken down, so that it can 
            be repaired and returned to orbit later. According to a GAO study, 
            fully 75 percent of the shuttle program cost savings are based on 
            Mathematica&#39;s assumptions about how much we will benefit from 
            recovering crippled satellites. 
            </p><p>The only problems are: 
            </p><ul>
              <li>(a) The shuttle can&#39;t retrieve satellites; 
              </li><li>(b) Nobody wants them back in the first place. </li></ul>
            <p>More than two thirds of the satellites being launched are sent 
            out to geosynchronous orbits--22,000 miles up, where, relative to a 
            spot on the rotating earth, they hang in the same place all the 
            time. Others are sent to nearly-as-high sun-synchronous orbits, 
            where they follow the movements of the sun. 
            </p><p>The shuttle, on the other hand, orbits at 200 miles. The highest 
            it could reach, unloaded, would be 600 miles. Routinely, the shuttle 
            will fly to 200 miles and release a satellite mounted on the LUS 
            booster, or a smaller booster called a SUS (for Spinning Upper 
            Stage). The booster then blasts the satellite out to its final 
            destination. Once there, it is beyond the shuttle&#39;s reach. Period. 
            When something is 22,000 miles away, getting 200 miles closer isn&#39;t 
            much of a help. 
            </p><p>Cassidy of the House space subcommittee acknowledges this is &#34;a 
            flaw in the system.&#34; 
            </p><p>Like most mythology, the &#34;retrieve and return&#34; business has a 
            basis in fact. When the shuttle was being planned, there was 
            supposed to be a &#34;space tug.&#34; This was to be a robot rocket vehicle 
            of some kind, assembled in space and left there. The shuttle would 
            bring it fuel and satellites to move around: The tug would take a 
            new satellite out to high orbit, then go find a damaged one and tow 
            it back down to the shuttle. 
            </p><p>The tug proposal has been killed. Every year NASA sticks it back 
            in the budget under a different name, and every year it gets killed 
            again. It gets killed because people don&#39;t want their satellites 
            back. &#34;A communications satellite has absolutely no salvage value,&#34; 
            says Larry Weekly, spokesman for SBS, Inc. &#34;They almost never fail, 
            and by the time they wear out, after seven to ten years, they&#39;re 
            obsolete. It&#39;s much cheaper to build a new one.&#34; Especially, Weekly 
            adds, since the cost of a new satellite--now running $20 million to 
            $40 million--is likely, to be less than the cost of sending a 
            repairman after an old one. 
            </p><p>Some satellites are parked in low orbits, within Columbia&#39;s 
            reach. But even then they may exceed its grasp. A shuttle has little 
            maneuvering power; basically, it can only intercept things in its 
            launch path. Few existing satellites are in orbital inclinations the 
            shuttle uses. NASA is adjusting for this by launching satellites 
            worth recovering--$90-million spy-eyes and telescope-observatory 
            satellites--into paths the shuttle will cross. But this doesn&#39;t 
            guarantee that Columbia will be able to cope with them. When 
            satellites get into trouble, they often suffer loss of stabilit--the 
            gyros fail and the little robot starts tumbling wildly. NASA 
            acknowledges that the shuttle wouldn&#39;t even try to recover an 
            unstable satellite. How could it? What could it grab hold of? Would 
            you pull a billion-dollar spaceship under a rumbling stellar bowling 
            ball that might come caroming into your ice-fragile tiles? 
            </p><p><b>Warp Speed</b> 
            </p><p>NASA has been casting about for other reasons to stage shuttle 
            flights. The agency hoped that companies would sign up for space 
            manufacturing tests--the search for the fabled flawless ball 
            bearing. But so far, according to Ed Fritz of GAO, only one American 
            firm has shown any interest. And, in order to entice it, NASA has 
            promised to foot the bill for the full cost of the test flight, 
            Fritz says. In return for accepting this fiscal hardship, the 
            company gets the patent rights to anything it might develop. 
            </p><p>The price per flight keeps climbing beyond $40 million, as the 
            number of plausible missions decreases. But it&#39;s still less than $69 
            million for those three Deltas. Less, that is, until you remember 
            that the Deltas were already around. You didn&#39;t have to spend $13 
            billion to develop them. NASA has repeatedly noted that there will 
            be no attempt to recover--amortize, you might say--the development 
            cost of the &#34;cheaper&#34; shuttle. 
            </p><p>Suppose the shuttles fly 500 sorties, as predicted, and cost $13 
            billion to build. That works out to an investment cost of $26 
            million per flight. Add that to the $40 million &#34;true cost&#34; of a 
            launch. Suddenly a shuttle launch costs $66 million just about the 
            same as three Deltas. Now, suppose the shuttles fly only the 
            pessimistic 200 flights. The investment cost leaps to $65 million 
            per flight. Suddenly the total cost of a shuttle flight becomes $105 
            million--almost twice the cost of three of those wasteful Delta 
            rockets. 
            </p><p>Of course, it once cost money to develop the Delta and the Titan 
            and what all, and that money is not amortized to each flight. But 
            those rockets are already developed. That money&#39;s already spent. 
            </p><p>&#34;Oh, the shuttle will definitely cost more than equivalent 
            expendable rockets,&#34; said Kaplan plainly. &#34;The payoff is not in 
            dollars, but in flexibility and expanded horizons.&#34; 
            </p><p><b>Weight A Minute ... </b>
            </p><p>They didn&#39;t talk much about &#34;expanded horizons&#34; back in 1972 when 
            NASA was selling the shuttle as an economy move. They did talk about 
            flexibility, though, because the shuttle payload would, be greater 
            than the other rockets&#39;. It was supposed to be able to carry 65,000 
            pounds into a low orbit, launching due-east. (Because the earth 
            spins west to east, rockets launching east get a boost from the 
            earth&#39;s own momentum. Launching north or south to reach polar orbits 
            bucks the spin. Nobody launches west.) 
            </p><p>Here the &#34;economy&#34; calculations reach escape velocity. The 
            65,000-pound payload is being quietly dropped, too. &#34;We&#39;ll be lucky 
            if we hit 30,000 due-east,&#34; says Kaplan. Columbia and Challenger, 
            the second shuttle, are turning out to weigh much more than planned. 
            Every pound added to the shuttle is a pound subtracted from the 
            payload. 
            </p><p>The external fuel tank, for instance, is full of oxygen and 
            hydrogen cooled to -400°F. to make the gases flow as liquids. Ice 
            will form on the tank. When Columbia&#39;s tiles started popping off in 
            a stiff breeze, it occurred to engineers that ice chunks from the 
            tank would crash into the tiles during the sonic chaos of launch: 
            Goodbye, Columbia. So insulation was added to the tank. But while 
            thermal cladding solves the ice problem, it adds weight. The entire 
            vehicle, loaded, weighs 4.5 million pounds. Say you add one percent. 
            Doesn&#39;t sound like much. One percent comes to 45,000 pounds. That&#39;s 
            almost all of the payload. 
            </p><p>Discovery and Atlantis, the third and fourth shuttles, are slated 
            to have stronger tiles and lighter components. They may be able to 
            lift 65,000 pounds. Meanwhile, remember the Titan III, lifting 
            29,000 pounds for about $50 million? &#34;Getting only a 30,000 payload 
            from the shuttle is a giant step backward, compared to the Titan,&#34; 
            says Albert Cameron. &#34;But it&#39;s a moot point now to argue about the 
            practical virtues of the rocket. NASA has eliminated it. You have no 
            choice but to launch on the shuttle, do you?&#34; Indeed, NASA has even 
            eliminated the word &#34;rocket.&#34; Jack Mahon, NASA&#39;s Expendable Launch 
            Director, says they are now called &#34;ELVs&#34;--Expendable Launch 
            Vehicles. Surely you remember that fabled day in 1926 when Robert 
            Goddard, father of modern rocketry, lit off the first liquid fueled 
            rocket engine, sending a device the size and shape of a coat tree 
            screaming into the low clouds over Auburn, Massachusetts? Remember 
            how he called to his wife, &#34;Come quick, dear, I&#39;ve invented the 
            expendable launch vehicle!&#34; 
            </p><p><b>Spyless Sky </b>
            </p><p>The original reason the shuttle was supposed to lift 65,000 
            pounds was to satisfy not commerce or science, but the Defense 
            Department. DOD plans to launch all its military spy satellites on 
            the shuttle, using NASA tracking facilities and astronauts. &#34;DOD was 
            brought into the shuttle planning because they wanted something big 
            with a lot of payload,&#34; Doug Lord explains. &#34;Without DOD, there 
            would have been no reason to make the shuttle so big.&#34; 
            </p><p>DOD&#39;s chief concern was being able to launch south over the 
            poles, where sun synchronous orbits are available. In such orbits, a 
            spy satellite&#39;s cameras see the same sun conditions every day. A 
            shuttle launching 65,000 pounds due-east was supposed to have enough 
            energy to lift 40,000 pounds over the poles. But as time went on, 
            DOD began to perceive that Columbia couldn&#39;t even come close. So DOD 
            got funds to build a &#34;thrust augmentation package&#34;--yet another set 
            of engines to be strapped to the shuttle conglomeration. 
            </p><p>The &#34;thrust package&#34; will be an abbreviated first stage of a 
            Titan rocket-two motors and four fuel tanks. Fitting under the 
            shuttle&#39;s fuel tank, it will generate enough thrust to lift an extra 
            10,000 to 20,000 pounds. The cost is $10 million a shot, NASA 
            says--there go those costs, picking up speed again--and it will not 
            be reusable. Tumbles into the ocean like those despised old rockets. 

            </p><p>This doesn&#39;t dampen DOD&#39;s enthusiasm for the shuttle project. Air 
            Force Secretary Hans Mark recently told Congress: &#34;It is important 
            to exploit the shuttle... because as far as we know, the Russians 
            have nothing like it.&#34; (It is believed the Klingons have nothing 
            like it, either.) DOD campaigned long and hard to get its own 
            shuttle launchers, at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Since 
            Cape Kennedy could already accommodate more shuttle flights than 
            were planned, it was hard for DOD to justify $4 billion to build and 
            operate another base. But the Joint Chiefs of Staff pointed out 
            that, after a polar launch from Cape Kennedy, the empty fuel tank 
            would tumble away and burn up in the skies over Russia. After a 
            polar launch from Vandenberg, it would not. Russia might interpret a 
            burning fuel tank as a nuclear attack, the Chiefs warned: The fact 
            that Russian instruments would immediately identify the launch as 
            that of an unarmed shuttle--or that we could notify them of the 
            launch via Mailgram, at a fraction of the cost of a telegram or a 
            Vandenberg base--was discounted. The Chiefs prevailed. 
            </p><p>Because of the delays, DOD has ordered six more Titan IIIs to 
            ensure launch capacity for the next two years&#39; worth of spy 
            satellites. Beyond that, however, no more Titan production is 
            planned, according to Jack Boyd of Martin-Marietta, the rocket&#39;s 
            builder. &#34;By the mid-1980s,&#34; says Defense Secretary Brown, &#34;we will 
            be almost totally dependent on the shuttle for our national security 
            space missions.&#34; No alternative but to rely on an untested system. 
            Wonder if the Russians have one of those? 
            </p><p><b>Scotty, Beam Us Out </b>
            </p><p>Technical problems are just that: technical. Much of what&#39;s wrong 
            with the shuttle will someday be fixed. If money is no object, as it 
            usually isn&#39;t in space launches, we can pay more for reusable 
            shuttles than for throw-away rockets if we have to. But the question 
            never answered is--what will the shuttle do that rockets couldn&#39;t 
            do? 
            </p><p>It can&#39;t launch more than they can; sometimes, it can&#39;t launch as 
            much. (Even the 65,000-pound target pales compared to the 250,000 
            pounds a Saturn V could hoist.) It can&#39;t bring back satellites. It 
            can&#39;t keep a space station aloft even a fraction as long as Skylab 
            stayed up there. It has no scientific value. It just has men in the 
            front seats ... and an enormous amount of weight and equipment 
            devoted to bringing them, and an empty cargo bay, back in one piece. 

            </p><p>There is something noteworthy a rocket can do that the shuttle 
            cannot. A rocket can be permitted to fail. What if a billion dollar 
            spaceship wipes out on a &#34;routine&#34; mission &#34;commuting&#34; to space with 
            some puny little satellite? Cooper fears it might drive a stake 
            through the heart of the manned space program. Would the public 
            stand to lose a quarter of the fleet in a single day? Would it fork 
            over another billion dollars to build a replacement? Would it stand 
            for spending millions to train astronauts to be truck drivers, only 
            to lose truck and drivers both? The prospect makes the old rockets 
            seem kind of nice. One of the old throw-away jobs could go haywire, 
            and spiral down into the ocean off the Bahamas, and everybody would 
            feel miserable and millions would be wasted and everybody would go 
            back to work. Lost it, dammit--but then nobody ever expected it 
            back. 
            </p><p><b>You Only Go Around Once</b> 
            </p><p>The shuttle is the first space vehicle that can&#39;t be test-fired 
            unmanned, Cooper points out. Pilots have to crawl in and light the 
            candle and go. A couple of guys who ought to know better have to 
            wrestle with that stick and call out the numbers and write when they 
            get there. Then we&#39;ll know. 
            </p><p>It goes like this. During blast-off, unlike those capsules and 
            modules with escape rockets to pull the pilots free in case of 
            trouble, there is no way out of the shuttle. Columbia has ejection 
            seats like a jet fighter, but they&#39;re useless during take-off. 
            Punching out at several thousand m.p.h. doesn&#39;t work. If the slab of 
            rushing air doesn&#39;t kill you, the engine exhaust flames will. 
            </p><p>Here&#39;s the plan. Suppose one of the solid-fueled boosters fails. 
            The plan is, you die. Solid rockets can fail in two ways. They can 
            explode; enough said. Or they can shut down spontaneously. If a 
            booster shuts down, there will be 2.5 million pounds of thrust on 
            one side battling zero pounds on the other. Even a split second of 
            this imbalance will send the ship twisting into oblivion, overriding 
            any application of pilot skill. 
            </p><p>Suppose one of the shuttle&#39;s three main engines fails. You have a 
            fighting chance. You blow the boosters off. Then, using the 
            throttles on the remaining engines, you try to turn the beast 
            around. It&#39;s screaming and trembling, a vicious wounded animal. 
            There&#39;s that damn fuel tank hanging there, and it has all the 
            aerodynamic grace of the Temple of Karnak. But it&#39;s got the fuel. 
            Ditch it and you&#39;ve got no engines. 
            </p><p>If you get twisted back around toward the Cape, you blow the fuel 
            tank off and glide home. If the beast is too badly wounded to land, 
            but you can slow it down to a few hundred m.p.h. before you splat 
            into the water, you&#39;re okay. At that speed you can eject. 
            </p><p>But you&#39;re in luck--the launch goes fine. Once you get into 
            space, you check to see if any tiles are damaged. If enough are, you 
            have a choice between Plan A and Plan B. Plan A is hope they can get 
            a rescue shuttle up in time. Plan B is burn up coming back. 
            </p><p>But let&#39;s not worry about the tiles. The tiles should be okay. 
            They&#39;re certainly spending enough time on them. So once you get back 
            into the atmosphere, the mad joyride begins. You have no power now, 
            the engines are spent and switched out. You get one shot at a 
            landing. Originally the plans called for a couple of regular jet 
            engines to give you enough power to maneuver, or maybe go around for 
            a second approach if the first one doesn&#39;t line upright. But jet 
            engines got killed in the cost-cutting. A billion-dollar ship, and 
            this is how they were cutting costs .... 
            </p><p>The shuttle starts rubbing air at Mach 25--25 times the speed of 
            sound. At 250,000 feet, you have a little control with the reaction 
            thrusters. By 80,000 feet, they&#39;ve shut off, and you&#39;re gliding. 
            It&#39;s silent in the ship. Just the air rushing by and the computers 
            meeping to each other. Biting into the denser air, your elevators 
            and speed brakes lend some control. You can still maneuver &#34;cross 
            range&#34;--several hundred miles north or south relative to your 
            approach from the west. But there are only 15 runways and lake beds 
            in the world where you can land, so don&#39;t get carried away. 
            </p><p>Cross-range maneuvering is no longer possible by 50,000 feet. 
            You&#39;re locked in, wherever you&#39;re going. Now you have company. 
            Fighter planes--&#34;chase planes&#34;--have picked you up. They&#39;re swarming 
            all around you, snooping around the hull for damage. Eighteen miles 
            from the runway, you finally slow to subsonic speed. Now you really 
            have some options. At this low speed and altitude, you could punch 
            out safely. 
            </p><p>At 12,000 feet, the plummeting begins. Nose down at 24 degrees to 
            the horizon, 30 degrees in some flights. Feels like a dive bomber. 
            That DC-9, the one that makes your knuckles white on commercial 
            flights, comes in at three degrees. Thirty seconds out, you can 
            raise the nose back up. Now you have one and only one chance to 
            lower the landing gear. No time to cycle them. If the gear don&#39;t 
            lock, that&#39;s it. The chase planes are coming right down to the strip 
            with you, following your every move like baby ducks. They snoop 
            around the landing gear. Locked? If not, the chase pilots have a 
            couple seconds to tell you to bail out. 
            </p><p>Only a few more seconds. The ground isn&#39;t coming up; some 
            prankster from Hell is throwing it at you. Whack! Down at 220 m.p.h. 
            Hope the rubber in those tires didn&#39;t blow from that long cold soak. 
            Crack! You bounce along, you roll to a stop. 
            </p><p>Good thing you didn&#39;t have to punch out. Only Columbia will have 
            ejection seats. &#34;The whole philosophy is that the shuttle is like a 
            commercial airliner,&#34; Day explains. &#34;You test everything like mad, 
            but once it&#39;s checked out, you take your chances.&#34; 
            </p><p>Now, let&#39;s check. Is the hull intact? Better be. NASA says it 
            will turn this ship around and have it flying again in two 
            weeks--only 96 of those hours for &#34;safing&#34; and refitting. Did all 
            that stress--stress that would have twisted any other flying machine 
            into a croissant--pop off any of your tiles? Let&#39;s hope not. The 
            cost-cutting plan says NASA will have to replace only 1.4 percent of 
            them after each flight. It&#39;s right here in the cost-cutting plan, 
            right under &#34;C&#34;--&#34;Commuting to space.&#34;
