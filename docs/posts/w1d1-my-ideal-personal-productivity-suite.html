    <h1>W1D1 - My ideal personal productivity suite</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_2069490">
    
      <div><p>My belief is you’re most motivated to solve problems you personally face. There are a few problems I’d like to give a good whack at in 2024.</p><p><b>1. Photo curation</b></p>
<p>I’ll take multiple photos of the same thing and manually choose the best, except more often than not I don’t get around to the latter. What if I have a way to easily:</p><ul>
<li>Find photos that are most similar to others to choose from</li>
<li>Retain the one I choose and move the rest to S3 / Google Drive</li>
<li>Eventually build a recommender, so I end up confirming the recommender’s choice instead of having to make the choice myself?</li>
</ul><p><b>2. Text transcription</b><br/></p>
<p>I started journaling my thoughts and find I do this best on paper, or in a pinch, through a recording. What if I have a way to easily convert my handwritten notes and voice recordings to text?<br/></p>
<p><b>3. Personal finance</b><br/></p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to look into IRAs and 529s. What if there’s a way for me to easily figure out which ones I should set up, how much and when?<br/></p>
<p><b>4. Twitter bookmarks</b></p><p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/EzzeriEsa/status/1741504691798966465">bookmark</a> on Twitter a lot, but find it hard to search through them. What if I have a way to easily store and query the bookmarks (in fact this was the <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w1d2-the-aspiring-polyglot-full-stack-developer">project</a> I started with the first time at RC)?</p>
<p><b>5. ChatGPT conversations</b><br/></p>
<p>I use ChatGPT a lot, but find it hard to search through them. What if I have a way to easily store and query the conversations?<br/></p>
<p>The last item is perhaps a give-away to what I think will make solving these easier this time around - ChatGPT.<br/></p>
<p>If these are problems you share, I’d love to hear from you!<br/></p></div>
