Now, only a handful are left. Among them are those in Denmark and Iceland - but they are due to shut by the end of 2023 and during 2024, respectively. <!-- --></p><p>The BBC still broadcasts Radio 4 on long wave as well as on digital radio, FM, and online. However, separate scheduling of BBC radio programmes on long wave will end in March next year - for example Test Match Special will not be available on long wave. The long-term future of the BBC&#39;s long wave output is far from certain. <!-- --></p><p>The only other remaining broadcasters in the world using the long wave band are those in Romania, Poland, Algeria, Morocco and Mongolia.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;The band is basically almost dead,&#34; says Mr Gouveia, who enjoys listening to radio stations from his home in Oxford. &#34;It all feels a bit sad, really.&#34; He adds that, when a long wave station shuts, he makes an effort to record its last moments.<!-- --></p><p>Among those who have urged the BBC to continue supporting long wave are Blur&#39;s drummer Dave Rowntree, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/radio/blur-drummer-dave-rowntree-long-wave-radio-changed-my-life-bbc-switch-off-2183463">who also recalls listening to long wave<!-- --></a> radio as a child.<!-- --></p><p>The BBC has not yet confirmed when, exactly, it will cease long wave broadcasts.<!-- --></p><p>A private firm, Arqiva, owns and operates the Droitwich transmitter in Worcestershire as well as two additional transmitters in Scotland. All three broadcast Radio 4 long wave on the 198 kilohertz frequency.<!-- --></p><p>In a statement, Arqiva says, &#34;The current long wave network assets have been operational for 36 years and are energy intensive.&#34; They add that &#34;significant further re-investment&#34; is required to continue long wave broadcasting. <!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/BB50/production/_130925974_hi001215502.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Changing the Feeder Switch at Droitwich Transmitting Station, October 1935."/></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Long wave transmissions from Droitwich started in 1934<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>Some reports have suggested that the long wave service has become too expensive to maintain, especially now that energy prices are so high following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine.

Just under one million such meters are still in use in the UK.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;Customers should contact their electricity supplier at the earliest opportunity to arrange for their RTS equipment to be upgraded to a smart electricity meter,&#34; a spokesman for Energy UK says. He adds that Energy UK and other bodies are seeking to extend RTS provision until December 2025.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/153A8/production/_130925968_johnmccullagh2-credit-johnmccullagh.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="John McCullagh John McCullagh, president of the Radio Society of Great Britain."/><span>John McCullagh</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Interference can give long wave broadcasts character says John McCullagh<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>The death of long wave, when it comes, will be mourned by many radio fans, says John McCullagh, president of the Radio Society of Great Britain.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It has a particular resonance that people like to listen to,&#34; he says, describing the noisy sound of the long wave band, which can be affected by lightning and interference from electrical devices, such as LED lights.

The signal <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx8wxnwn5ygo">was strong enough<!-- --></a> to reach up to 94% of the population at the time.<!-- --></p><p>Among the long wave services that have come and gone over the years was Atlantic 252. It used a transmitter in Co Meath, Ireland that went on to carry Irish radio station RTÉ Radio 1 on the same frequency. RTÉ Radio 1 ceased its long wave broadcasts in April this year and the transmitter was demolished in July.<!-- --></p><p>Many ex-pats still use long wave signals to connect with their home country, says Jessica Foley, a lecturer at the Institute of Art, Design and Technology in Co Dublin.<!-- --></p><p>This was the case for many Irish people living in Great Britain, until RTÉ Radio 1 shut its long wave service. The station continues to be available on other frequencies and platforms.<!-- --></p><p>It is worth investing in long wave transmitters, even if they only serve a relatively small number of people, suggests Dr Foley: &#34;It is a question of culture and how willing we are to tolerate the minority.&#34;<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Presentational grey line"/></p></div></figure><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Presentational grey line"/></p></div></figure><p>Long wave also provides a connection to things &#34;as vast as the cosmos&#34;, she adds. A phenomenon called the skywave effect enables some radio signals to travel further at night. This is because a layer in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere called the ionosphere cool down, making it more reflective. Electromagnetic signals can, as a result, bounce back towards the ground and cover greater distances.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Gouveia says, proudly, that he has been able to listen to radio broadcasts from Mongolia, in part thanks to this effect.<!-- --></p><p>However, the equipment required to hear long wave broadcasts is arguably now obscure.
