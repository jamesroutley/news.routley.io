					<h3>What is Cow Clicker?</h3>
					<div>
					<p><img src="http://cowclicker.com/images/cows/7073dd235745a7feae28e0ef24b317e8.png" id="cowr" width="169"/><i>Cow Clicker</i> is a Facebook game about Facebook games by the author and game designer <a href="http://bogost.com">Ian Bogost</a>. It was first released in July 2010 as both satire and playable theory of social games circa that era.</p>

					<p>You get a cow. You can click on it. In six hours, you can click it again. Clicking earns you clicks. You can buy custom premium cows and timer overrides through micropayments. <i>Cow Clicker</i> is Facebook games distilled to their essence.</p> 
					</div>

					<h3>Wait, what? That&#39;s ridiculous.</h3>
					<div>
					<p>Oh, come on. Back in 2010 it was a little startling, maybe. Now computers  <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">click on cookies absent human players</a>, and people <a href="http://makeitraintheloveofmoney.com">endlessly swipe dollar bills</a> on their iPhones. In fact, so many years hence, <i>Cow Clicker</i> probably seems so normal as to be ordinary, even boring by today&#39;s standards.</p>
				
					<p>Of course people would click a cow every six hours. Why wouldn&#39;t they? All we do anymore is click on things.</p>

					<h3>Didn&#39;t I read about this in Wired?</h3>
					<p><a href="http://archive.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_cowclicker/all/"><img src="http://cowclicker.com/images/wired.jpg"/></a>Yes, in the January 2012 issue, <i>Wired</i> published a feature on <i>Cow Clicker</i> written by Jason Tanz, <a href="http://archive.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_cowclicker/all/">The Curse of <i>Cow Clicker</i>: How a Cheeky Satire Became a Videogame Hit&#34;</a>. The original online version of the article featured a playable cow-clicking game, but it didn&#39;t survive a Wired.com redesign. Just like the cows themselves, which were raptured during the Cowpocalypse in September, 2011.

					<h3>Can I still play Cow Clicker?</h3>
					<div>
					<p><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/cowclicker"><img src="http://bogost.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/cowclicker11.jpg"/></a><i>Cow Clicker</i> is still <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/cowclicker">playable on Facebook</a>.</p> 
					
					<p>You can also still download the iOS edition, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cow-clicker/id415187489?mt=8"><i>Cow Clicker</i> Moobile</a>, and the kid-friendly, no calf left behind mobile version, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-first-cow-clicker/id419804323?mt=8">My First <i>Cow Clicker</i></a>.</p>
				
					<p>One thing: all the cows are gone, having been raptured. Not to worry, though. You can still click on the spot where a cow used to be.</p>

					<h3>Wait, do people really do that? Click on the spot where a cow used to be?</h3>
					<p>
					Yes.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>How stupid. I&#39;d never click on the spot where I used to click a cow.</h3>

					You might want to read <a href="http://bogost.com/writing/blog/cow_clicker_1/">the original essay explaining <i>Cow Clicker</i></a>, written upon its release. You can also watch a talk <i>Cow Clicker</i> creator Ian Bogost gave at the Game Developers Conference in Austin, in fall 2010, <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1013828/Making-a-Mockery-Ruminations-on">Making a Mockery: Ruminations on <i>Cow Clicker</i></a>. The game enthusiast magazine <i>Edge</i> published a story on the game by David Thomas in spring 2011, <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/features/poking-cow-clicker/">Poking at <i>Cow Clicker</i></a>. In October 2011, Leigh Alexander wrote about <i>Cow Clicker</i> and Bogost&#39;s other 2010 game, the award-winning Atari game poem chapbook <a href="http://bogost.com/games/aslowyear/">A Slow Year</a> in <a href="http://kotaku.com/5846080/the-life-changing-20-rightward-facing-cow">The Life-Changing $20 Rightward-Facing Cow</a>. In November of that year, NPR&#39;s On The Media ran a story on the game, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/11/18/142518949/cow-clicker-founder-if-you-cant-ruin-it-destroy-it">If You Can&#39;t Ruin It, Destroy It</a>. You might also enjoy <a href="http://bogost.com/writing/shit_crayons/">Shit Crayons</a>, Bogost&#39;s &#34;rant&#34; at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. And in July 2014, on <i>Cow Clicker</i>&#39;s 4th anniversary, Brian Crecente wrote <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/25/5937009/cow-clicker-2-sequel">How cows predicted the seedy underbelly of social gaming</a>. There&#39;s more, I&#39;m sure you can <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=cow+clicker">find it</a>.

					<h3>One last question: When I went to click the cow at the top of this page (duh), I noticed a big &#34;2&#34; appear in its place. Does that mean you&#39;re making a sequel?! It must mean that, right?</h3>
					<div>
					<p>I suppose it could. I mean, I can see how you&#39;d reach that conclusion.</p>
					
					<p>But, it also might just be a big &#34;2&#34; with an udder, signifying nothing.</p>
