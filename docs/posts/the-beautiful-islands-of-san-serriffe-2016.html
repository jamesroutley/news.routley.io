      <h2>A Morning Like Any Other</h2>
<p>The morning of April 1st, 1977 started as a typical day in the United Kingdom. <em>The Guardian</em> newspaper was delivered to thousands of homes across the nation and people woke up to a quintessential early-spring weather forecast of “Outbreaks of rain, with some bright intervals.”</p>
<p>The front page of the paper gave the news of the day including the collapse of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States as well as the fact that “Pubs ‘charge too much’” if you order soft drinks instead of a lager. There was even an editorial cartoon debating if the EuroVision song contest should go ahead <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Eurovision-contest-so-bad" title="Why is Eurovision contest so bad?">some things never change, it seems.</a></p>

<p>Inside, the newspaper elaborated on topics of international and local interest and most readers would not have noticed anything unusual about a special travel feature starting on page 17 of the paper.</p>
<p>The seven-page  like any travel feature that newspapers were printing at the time. It featured a map of the islands, pictures of palm trees, an image of the leader, and a short “Guide to the Republic” which gave many facts and figures about the island nation.</p>

<h2>Printer’s Puns and Jokes</h2>
<p>Many of the articles and advertisements were based upon “inside jokes” that only printers and aficionados of typography would have understood. From the shape of the islands to the names of cities, typographical terms and typeface names were used liberally to give names to geographical places and demographic facts.</p>

<h2>A Strange Land Indeed</h2>
<p>On the surface, many of the articles appeared normal if you quickly flipped through the newspaper. There were articles about the political history of San Serriffe, the influx of tourism to the small islands, and potential economic opportunities for businesses looking for new territories.</p>
<p>This scientific article about how the ocean tides effect the islands seems completely plausible — until you read the details and see the scientific diagram which supposedly explains how the islands will eventually collide with Sri Lanka in 2011.</p>
<figure>

<blockquote>
<p>“… the islands will accelerate at first gently and then more rapidly as they approach Sri Lanka. Simple calculations suggest that the island group will hit the coast of Sri Lanka at a velocity of 940 km an hour on January 3, 2011.”</p>

<h2>The Advertisements</h2>
<p>What made the islands of San Serriffe seem most plausible were the advertisements placed throughout the feature from large brands such as Kodak, Texaco, Costain, and Guinness. These ads, with complete approval from the companies, became critical in making it more believable — until you read the fine print.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Experts put it down to the novice farm helpers who spent their holiday in San Serriffe that year. Knowing little about crops, they sowed the barley seeds upside down.”</p>

<h2>How did one of Britain’s Largest Papers Get Away with Such an Elaborate Prank?</h2>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/30/extract.martinwainwright">The Guardian Book of April Fool’s Day</a></em> published in 2007, the idea for San Serriffe come about as a joke in itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The Financial Times</em> was always doing special reports on little countries I’d never heard of … I was thinking about April Fool’s Day 1977 and I thought, why don’t we just make a country up?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Special reports editor Stuart St. Clair Legge suggested the title that was to become a legend: San Serriffe, part typographic pun, part credible name for a tropical isle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feature was originally envisioned as an one-page story but the editors kept coming up with ideas and expanded it into the largest travel supplement in Guardian history. At this point, the newspaper was still printed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_metal_typesetting">hot-metal typesetting</a> and the production of a single page required an enormous amount of time and resources — let alone setting seven full pages just for a joke.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The People Behind the Joke</h2>
<p>The people behind the story were all regular employees or contributors to The Guardian.</p>
<ul>
<li>Philip Davies was an advertising representative who came up with the idea for a fake island.</li>
<li>Geoffrey Taylor was the foreign editor who created editorial content and designed the fake islands.</li>
<li>Stuart St. Clair Legge, a special reports editor, suggested the name San Serriffe.</li>
<li>Mark Arnold-Forster &amp; Tim Radford wrote various articles</li>
<li>J Walter Thompson Ad Agency sold advertising space for the supplement (which is likely the only way the feature was approved).</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>Public Reaction</h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/01/uk.comment">an article written by David McKie in 2006</a>, the public reaction to the San Serriffe feature was dramatic and almost instantaneous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The office all day was bedlam as people pestered the switchboard with requests for more information. Veterans of that time say there’s never been a day like it in terms of reader response.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Both travel agencies and airlines made official complaints to the editor, Peter Preston, about the disruption as customers simply refused to believe that the islands did not exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Guardian</em> sold “I’ve Been to San Serriffe” bumper stickers as well as a reported 12,000 t-shirts (although I can’t find an image to confirm this). There was also a letter to the editor written by the fictitious “San Serriffe Liberation Front” stating how furious they were with the pro-government slant of the <em>Guardian</em> piece.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The Legacy of San Serriffe</h2>
<p><em>The Guardian</em> printed follow-up articles about San Serriffe on April Fool’s Day in 1978 and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/01/features11.g24">1999</a>, but neither of these articles had the impact or originality of the 1977 feature. In the years since, many people have co-opted San Serriffe for their own jokes.</p>

<p>In 2006, WikiTravel <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/San_Serriffe">published a joke article</a> with additional information about San Serriffe including travel tips, cultural history, and economic forecasts. They even created a ficticious national flag featuring an asterisk.</p>
<p>Henry Morris of The Bird &amp; Bull Press in Pennsylvania printed several fictional fine-press books about the islands of San Serriffe and also printed official paper and coin currency in 1988. The 500 limited-edition coins were made with 1 troy ounce of (real) .999 silver and today are quite collectible.</p>
