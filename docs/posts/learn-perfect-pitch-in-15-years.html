<p>I learned perfect pitch as an adult.</p>
<p>It was not easy or quick, and there were so many qualifiers that, for
over a decade, I didn’t really think I “deserved” the label. But as I
got older, those qualifiers started dropping off one by one, and today
I’m convinced that I have perfect pitch. I describe my musical journey
and thoughts on what perfect pitch “is”.</p>
<h2 id="popular-perception-of-perfect-pitch">Popular perception of
perfect pitch</h2>
<p>Just so we’re on the same page: popular pitch is described as one or
more of the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>ability to name the pitch of ambient amusical tones (alarms,
honking, pure sine waves etc.)</li>
<li>ability to name the pitch of musical tones</li>
<li>ability to name individual notes within a chord</li>
<li>ability to hum or sing a named note</li>
<li>ability to identify if a song is not in its original key.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last variant has the lowest bar, but it is most accommodating to
those without formal music training.</p>
<h2 id="my-formal-musical-history-age-5-18">My formal musical history
(age 5-18)</h2>
<p>I started taking piano lessons at 5, and while I enjoyed it, I don’t
remember it being an unbalanced part of my childhood. Our family moved
two hours away when I was 9, and after a month of schlepping two hours
each way to see my old piano teacher on weekends (God bless my mother!)
she gave up and we switched to another more local piano teacher. I
didn’t get along with this teacher, and ended up quitting piano a year
or so later. Instead, I played clarinet through middle and high school,
and the piano lessons resumed when I was 15, when my mother learned of
another piano teacher from a friend of hers.</p>
<p>Sometime when I was ~12 years old, I remember surprising my clarinet
teacher by correctly repeating some random notes that he played. He told
me I had perfect pitch, but I didn’t think so, because I couldn’t name
notes for any instrument other than the clarinet.</p>
<p>The clarinet’s physical layout is the result of many, many tradeoffs
in the location of its boreholes and keys. As a result, each note is
characteristically flat or sharp by up to 10 cents, and has a
characteristic timbre, due to variations in the overtone series
generated. I still cringe when I think about the stuffy nose sound
quality of the B♭4’s default fingering. I used the A4 + trill modifier
fingering almost exclusively as a result. I’m fairly certain that my
clarinet “perfect pitch” was just my ability to recognize these
microvariations in timbre.</p>
<p>My piano lessons, on the other hand, never hinted at perfect pitch.
To be fair, I also never really liked piano the same way I did when I
was younger. That all changed in my senior year of high school. We’d
just finished recording a CD, to send in with my college application
materials. (It was, in retrospect, an absolute waste of everyone’s time
both to record and to listen to). My teacher then told me, “You’re done!
You can quit lessons now if you want, or if you want to continue we can
play other fun stuff.” I still remember that moment with shock - I
couldn’t believe that somebody who taught music for a living could be
that crass about why anyone should want to learn music.</p>
<p>“I… want to keep playing”, I managed to say, and to their credit, my
teacher did a pretty good job over the next 6 months of letting me learn
music for music’s sake, reviving my love for the piano. Then, I went to
college, and that was it for my formal piano lessons.</p>
<h2 id="learning-perfect-pitch-18-30s">Learning perfect pitch
(18-30s)</h2>
<p>At MIT, I found myself tremendously bored my freshman year due to the
combination of my advisor not letting me sign up for interesting
classes, plus the freshman credit limit. Instead, I found myself
figuring out how to access the suite of music practice rooms, and I
spent well over 20-30 hours a week finding new classical music,
listening to recordings, and sightreading the scores. The clarinet got
the short end of the stick - I tried playing in the wind ensemble for a
semester, but found that I just didn’t love clarinet the same way I
loved the piano.</p>
<p>By the end of freshman year, I had significantly expanded my musical
tastes and unambiguously had perfect pitch… for piano only. I find it
highly unlikely that this was due to identifying microtuning
differences; the piano, under the cover, is a sequence of cables of
continuously varying weight, length, and tension, very unlike a
clarinet’s body with its idiosyncratically drilled holes. But I still
could not hear other instruments or textures; when listening to piano
concertos, I would latch onto the piano’s sounds, follow along with my
relative pitch, but inevitably lose track of the notes whenever the
orchestra took over.</p>
<p>After that first freshman year, my workload was nowhere near as easy,
so I could only play piano ~10 hours a week. But my musical tastes and
breadth kept evolving; I took music theory classes, got a music minor,
started singing in the concert choir, and learned to appreciate
operatic, orchestral, and chamber music. I practiced identifying notes
in these new contexts, but ironically enough, my clarinet perfect pitch
came back to haunt me with vengeance, as if to mock me for abandoning
the instrument. The clarinet is a Bb instrument, meaning that the “C” as
I knew it on the clarinet was actually a Bb. My mental train of thought
would immediately slip sideways by a whole step as soon as I heard any
mildly prominent clarinet sounds. That was quite frustrating!</p>
<p>One day, maybe when I was 25 or so, I realized that I could identify
pitches from a variety of orchestral and string instrument textures. I
had also continued to sing with the MIT choir as an alumnus, and I could
feel perfect pitch approaching for voices as well; let’s say I picked up
perfect pitch for vocal textures around 28. Later on, maybe around 32, I
realized that I could identify atonal textures (alarms, train horns,
etc.), and along with this milestone came the ability to quantify how
out of tune something was.</p>
<p>There are days when my sense of pitch feels weaker. Sometimes I’m
listening to an ambient noise soundtrack during work, or don’t get a
chance to listen to tonal music for some time. When I haven’t actively
listened to tonal music in over 2 weeks, the time it takes me to
recognize a note goes from sub-second to a few seconds, although it
comes back quickly. It feels like putting on your skis or ice skates for
the first time each winter and remembering how to ski/skate.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Perfect pitch, for me, was an incredibly smooth and long learning
curve. For each new instrument or texture I learned, I went from only
hearing relative intervals, to being able to say, “this piece is
probably in D major”, to being able to trace along the exact notes of
the melody and bass lines, to being able to instantly lock onto notes
when I wanted to. These weren’t discrete transitions either; I would
have good days and bad days for recognizing pitches, and over time I
would have more and more good days.</p>
<p>Most studies I’ve seen on the internet study perfect pitch as a
snapshot in time; a set of subjects drawn from populations of varying
musical training, is tested on a single day, or perhaps over a month.
These studies have no statistical power to talk about perfect pitch in
gradations; they can only say that some fraction of people “have it” or
“don’t have it”. I imagine that I would have failed some of their tests
and passed others at differing points in time.</p>
<p>The caveat with anecdata is, of course, the highly individual
circumstances that come with each data point. Does it matter that I
spent my first few years of life living in, essentially, a Korean
enclave in NYC? Is it relevant that I am highly sensitive to fine
details in all five of my senses, not just in sound? Does it matter that
I have a generally strong memory for details? Am I somebody who should
have developed perfect pitch normally if not for my patchy formal music
schooling? Or was it my choice of non-C musical instrument that delayed
the onset of perfect pitch? Or maybe the blame lies with my home piano,
which was never tuned and drifted from flat to flatter by about 30 cents
over a decade.</p>
<p>To me, the most surprising thing about perfect pitch is that we don’t
<em>all</em> have it. The vast majority of us can tell apart our colors,
even if half of us refuse to use words like “chartreuse”. Your ears
contain millions of tiny fine hairs of varying lengths which each
vibrate in response to some set of frequencies, making them essentially
analog Fourier Transform devices. And then, your brain then does
something stupidly complicated to this set of clean inputs, so that you
can instantly tell whose voice is whose in a multi-speaker environment,
and so that you can detect the slightest tremor in somebody’s voice that
might clue you in on their mental state as they say those words. We
undergo decades of musical training so that we can train our brains to
unwind all of this complicated processing and extract pure tones from
this jumble of sound.</p>
<p>In my understanding, “perfect pitch” is what you get when your brain
has finally annealed its mental representation of music into twelve
neurons, one per tone class (assuming western 12-tone scales). In my own
mind, these twelve neurons just… exist; I don’t have any synesthetic
associations with colors, names, or any visual artifacts like a piano.
Just the pure <em>qualia</em> of hearing that pitch. At this logical
endpoint, note recognition is instantaneous and universal. You can
imagine intermediate stages, where neurons are calibrated to certain
timbres of sound, or perhaps you have a neuron for the opening note of a
specific song that’s burned into your memory, and can place pitches with
reference to that opening note.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-learn-perfect-pitch">How to learn perfect pitch</h2>
<p>Now that I have a tiny human of my own creation, here’s what I think
are probably optimal conditions for developing perfect pitch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn to play some instrument, in a setting where you have to play
in tune. (e.g. if you’re learning guitar, don’t just match your strings
to each other; use an actual tuner.)</li>
<li>Don’t learn a non-C instrument</li>
<li>Eliminate sources of out-of-tune sounds in your environment.</li>
<li>Learn how to read sheet music, and listen actively to music while
following the sheet music/score.</li>
<li>Learn some music theory; nobody learns the 12 tones in isolation,
but rather the ways in which they come together to form melody and
harmony.</li>
<li>Listening is a skill and takes the proverbial 10,000 hours to
master.</li>
<li>Stretch your harmonic recognition by listening to music on the
border between tonal and atonal - in the classical world, Ravel,
Poulenc, Prokofiev, Shostakovich are pretty good in this regard.</li>
<li>Enjoy the music! It’s okay if you don’t like a piece or a composer;
sometimes it takes the right performer or piece to open your
vistas.</li>
</ul>
