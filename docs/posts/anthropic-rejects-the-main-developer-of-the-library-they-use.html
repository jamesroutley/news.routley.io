                    <p><time datetime="2025-07-03">2025-07-03</time></p>
                    <p>In October 2024, Anthropic released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODaHJzOyVCQ">&#34;Claude
                            Computer Use&#34;</a>. It allows an AI to control a computer and for example copy data from a
                        browser to a spreadsheet. It&#39;s a really cool feature and since I am the maintainer of a library
                        that allows controlling a computer, I was curious to find out how they do it and learn from
                        them. I didn&#39;t have time to look into it until this spring. Anthropic is one of the leaders in
                        AI and was <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation">valued
                            at a cool 60+ billion dollars</a> in March 2025, so I was surprised to learn that
                        Anthropic is actually using my library <a href="https://crates.io/crates/enigo">enigo</a> for
                        it.</p>

                    <figure>

                    </figure>

                    <p>You can confirm that enigo is used in Claude Desktop for macOS by running the following two
                        commands:</p>

                    <pre><code><span>$ 7z x Claude.dmg</span>
<span>$ perl -nle &#39;print $&amp; while /.{0,67}enigo.{0,30}/g&#39; Claude/Claude.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/claude-native/claude-native-binding.node</span>
<span>/Users/runner/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/enigo-0.2.1/src/macos/macos_impl.rs</span>
<span>/Users/runner/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/enigo-0.2.1/src/macos/macos_impl.rs</span></code></pre>

                    <p>It is also used in Claude Desktop for Windows. You can confirm it by running:</p>

                    <pre><code><span>$ 7z x Claude-Setup-x64.exe</span>
<span>$ 7z x AnthropicClaude-0.11.6-full.nupkg</span>
<span>$ perl -nle &#39;print $&amp; while /.{0,75}enigo.{0,26}/g&#39; Claude-Setup-x64/AnthropicClaude-0.11.6-full/lib/net45/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/claude-native/claude-native-binding.node</span>
<span>C:\Users\runneradmin\.cargo\registry\src\index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f\enigo-0.2.1\src\win\win_impl.rs</span></code></pre>


                    <p>In the output, you can see that on both platforms <a href="https://crates.io/crates/enigo/0.2.1">enigo version
                            0.2.1</a> is used (you might have to scroll right to see it).</p>

                    <p>I am very proud that enigo matured enough for a company with a seemingly infinite development
                        budget to choose it for their commercial project. Input simulation is surprisingly difficult due
                        to little documentation
                        and a lot of OS-specific quirks and warrants its own blog post. In my (admittedly not
                        completely
                        objective) opinion enigo is a great
                        choice for the job. As far as I know, it is the only library that works on Windows, macOS,
                        *BSD and Linux (Wayland, X11 and libei) without root. It is written in Rust and thus is mostly
                        memory safe
                        while being very fast. It is the most popular choice on crates.io
                        with almost 300,000 downloads and 1,200+ stars on Github. And yet it makes me a little nervous
                        knowing that my hobby project is used by Claude Desktop and deployed to thousands of devices.
                    </p>


                    <p>If you&#39;re not familiar with open-source software, you might wonder how much money I made from
                        them — and how many Ferraris I’m going to buy. If you <em>are</em>
                        familiar with
                        open-source software, it will come as no surprise to you that I am not earning any money from
                        it.
                        enigo is published under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT
                            license</a>. That means everyone can use it free of charge. The only thing I
                        get in return is more stars on GitHub and higher download counts on crates.io (the nerd
                        equivalent of street creds).</p>

                    <p>Interestingly, although Claude Desktop is an Electron app, it&#39;s only available on
                        macOS and Windows. The benefit of Electron applications is that they work on all platforms.
                        Other people found ways to run Claude Desktop on Linux as well (<a href="https://github.com/k3d3/claude-desktop-linux-flake">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian">2</a>, <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-bin">3</a>). They had to replace the
                        code that uses enigo with stubs. This is very curious, because enigo is also cross-platform.</p>

                    <p>Through a friend of a friend, I found out that Anthropic had an open position in the team
                        implementing the secret, unreleased feature of Claude Desktop using enigo. I wrote a cover
                        letter and sent out my application. An automatic reply informed me that they might take some
                        time to respond and that they only notify applicants if they made it to the next round. After a
                        few weeks without an answer, I had assumed they chose other applicants. I already forgot about
                        the
                        application when I received an e-mail from Anthropic. I excitedly opened it. Unfortunately they
                        thanked me for my application but said the team doesn&#39;t have the capacity to review additional
                        applications.</p>

                    <p>I would have loved working at Anthropic, implementing a feature similar to Computer Use and
                        bringing Claude Desktop to Linux. I thought I had a pretty good shot to get the position,
                        considering some of my code is already
                        part of their software. Through the years I accumulated a lot of knowledge in the niche that is
                        input simulation that I would have brought to the table. Working full-time on enigo for a few
                        months could lift the project to a whole different level of polish and professionalism and would
                        have helped Anthropic to be able to focus on their AI models and not input quirks.
                    </p>

                    <p>Overall I am overjoyed enigo is used in Claude Desktop and I tell everyone who listens to me
                        about it :P.
                        It&#39;s so cool to think that I metaphorically created the arms and legs for Claude AI, but I can&#39;t
                        help but wonder if the rejection letter was written by a human or Claude AI. Did the very AI I
                        helped equip with new capabilities just reject my application? On the bright side, I should now
                        be
                        safe
