    <h1>The Motorola PowerStack</h1>

<p>
The PowerStack was one of the Motorola Computer Group&#39;s entries into the
personal computer (PC) market around the time the Microsoft
Windows/Intel x86 juggernaut was stumbling with their mass market
Windows
3.11 replacement.
It&#39;s a compact, modular, efficient platform featuring IBM/Motorola&#39;s
PowerPC CPUs as well as best-in-class contemporary interfaces like PCI
and SCSI.
A compute element could be stacked with other modular I/O and storage
cases to expand its capabilities without having to rehome the computer
in a larger chassis.

<p>
Unfortunately I only have the one compute chassis and it houses a slow
PowerPC 603 processor.
The biggest problem with the 603 was that its caches were too small to
keep the CPU pipelines full.
The 603e replacement was a considerably faster design.
</p>

<p>
PowerStacks also proved to be quite expensive, utilizing a number of
more expensive laptop parts to keep it small, ECC RAM, and high-end
buses like SCSI instead of the less efficient, budget-minded IDE
interface popular on home computers.
</p>

<p>
I fully populated the RAM slots with the largest SIMMs I could find for
it.
The original fans on the PSU were extremely noisy.
I managed to replace them with much quieter 80mm case fans.
Cooling the 67 MHz PowerPC 603 wasn&#39;t an issue as it ran vastly cooler
than contemporary Intel products â€” it needed neither fan nor heatsink.
Installing Linux via the PowerPC Reference Platform (PReP) firmware was
a snap thanks to community support for the PReP platform.
I never connected a monitor or keyboard to it since Linux and the boot
firmware provided full access to the essentials via the first serial
port, just like a professional computer system.
