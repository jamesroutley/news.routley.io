He reiterated that the ruling party has not had any organizational relationship with the controversial Unification Church.</p><p>The group, founded in South Korea in 1954 by the late Sun Myung Moon and labeled a cult by critics, has become a social problem for its mass weddings and &#34;spiritual sales,&#34; in which people are talked into buying jars and other items for exorbitant prices.</p><p>Abe&#39;s attacker, Tetsuya Yamagami, has told investigators that he harbored a grudge against the religious group and targeted the former premier. He has reportedly said his mother&#39;s substantial donations to the organization ruined his family&#39;s finances.</p><p>In a parliament session earlier in the day, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who now heads the LDP, emphasized the Unification Church has not influenced the policymaking process of his ruling party.</p><p>As the issue has led to a drop in the support rating for his Cabinet, Kishida said the LDP will make efforts to &#34;restore the public trust,&#34; calling on its local assembly members to sever ties with the religious group entirely.</p><p>Kishida, meanwhile, told reporters later in the day that it is difficult to scrutinize Abe&#39;s past relations with the religious group as he is no longer alive.</p><p>The prime minister also pledged to implement measures to strengthen internal surveillance on ties between his ruling party and the Unification Church, which has been criticized for being engaged in antisocial activities.</p></div></div></div></div>
