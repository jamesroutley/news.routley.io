    <p>The International Code of Signals is a system of signals and codes designed to communicate important safety and navigational messages when speaking is difficult (because of language barriers, distance, etc). A standardized alphabet was created (see below image), along with a spoken word form for each one, designed to set apart similar-sounding letters like B, V and D. Each letter/numeral was assigned a flag:</p>

    <p>Phonetic Alphabet. Alfa : Al fah, Bravo : Brah voh, Charlie : Char Lee, Delta : Dell tah, Echo : Eck oh, Foxtrot : Foks trot, Golf, Hotel : Hoh tel, India : In dee ah, Juliet : Jee lee ett, Kilo : Key loh, Lima : Lee mah, Mike, November : Novem ber, Oscar : Oss cah, Papa: Pah pah, Quebec : Keh Beck, Romeo : Row me oh, Sierra : See air rah, Tango : Tan go, Uniform : Oo nee form, Victor : Vik tah, Whiskey : Wiss key, X-ray : Ecks ray, Yankee : Yang kee, Zulu : Zoo loo, 1st substitute, 2nd substitute, 3rd substitute, Answering penant or decimal point, 1 : Unaone : Oo nah wun, 2 : Bissotwo : Bee soh too, 3 : Terratree : Tay rah tree, 4 : Kartefour : Kar tay fower, 5 : Pantafive : Pan tah five, 6 : Soxisix : Sok see six, 7 : Setteseven : Say tay seven, 8 : Oktoeight : Ok toh ait, 9 : Novenine : No vay niner, 0 : Nadazero : Nah dah zay roh</p>

    <p>To save time when signaling, each flag has an assigned meaning to communicate very urgent or common messages. When used alone, the Oscar flag means &#34;man overboard.&#34; When paired in twos, flags take on more specific meanings. For example, the Uniform and Whiskey flags used together in that order mean &#34;I wish you a pleasant voyage.&#34; Numerals appended to two flags permit for more detailed messages, for example: The Quebec flag paired with the Romeo flags and the 1 number flag means &#34;Can I come alongside?&#34; Three letter signals that begin with Mike are reserved to communicate medical emergencies, for example: Mike followed by Alpha and then by a 2nd substitute flag is code for &#34;I request urgent medical advice.&#34;</p>

    <p>The title reads: Substitutes. To avoid having to carry multiple flags of the same signal, the ICS(international code of signals) uses 3 substitute flags. A substitute flag repeats the one at the indicated position. A drawing shows 3 flags for the 3 substitute flags. An example shows how to signal DD, which is to fly the flag signal Delta followed by the 1st substitute flag. DD means: &#34;boats are not allowed to come alongside.&#34;</p>

  <p><img src="https://rabbitwaves.ca/media/content/2024_dayshapes_intro.jpg"/></p><p>When in distress, signal using the N and C flags. Another visual way to communicate distress, say one is lacking signal flags, is to have a square flag above/below a ball shape (anything resembling a ball). This is known as a day shape.</p>

    <p>Single letter flags, like Kilo, are used to spell out words. An example shows how to spell the boat named Pino, using the following flags: Papa, India, November and Oscar. A title reads &#34;Spelling&#34;, followed by: To begin spelling, hoist the Yankee and Zulu flags, which means, &#34;The words which follow are in plain language.&#34; An example spells out the name Nastya using the following flags: November, Alpha, Sierra, Tango, Yankee and the 2nd substitute flag.</p>

  <p><img src="https://rabbitwaves.ca/media/content/2024_otherlanguages_ics.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="an example on how the ICS signals are used to communicate with others who do not speak the same language as you"/></p><p>One practical use of the International Code of Signals(ICS) is that all of the messages are standardized and come in 9 languages: English, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Spanish, Norwegian, Russian and Greek. The signal flag Victor was assigned &#34;I require assistance&#34; as a coded meaning. Under this, is illustration featuring a conversation betweeo a spectacled guillemot and a herring gull. The spectacled guillemot speaks Japanese, while the herring gull speaks Russian. The guillemot is yelling &#34;Tasukete!&#34; but the herring gull does not understand. The guillemot then yells out the coded meaning for Victor, &#34;ビクター! ビクター(Bikutaa! Bikutaa!)&#34; The herring gull understood this, and says Я понимаю (Ya ponimayu, to mean &#34;I understand&#34;).</p>

    <p>The title reads, How to communicate with another vessel using flags. One: A murrelet raises a Kilo flag to mean &#34;I wish to communicate with you.&#34; Two: The herring gull raises an answering pennant to mean that the signal was understood. Three: The murrelet raises a Romeo flag followed by a Foxtrot flag, to mean &#34;Will you lead me to a safe anchorage?&#34; Four: The herring gull raises an answering pennant to mean that the signal was understood. Five: The herring gull raises a Charlie flag to mean &#34;Affirmative.&#34; Six: The murrelet raises  an answering pennant to mean that the signalling is now over. Seven: The herring gull raises an answering pennant to mean that the signal was understood.</p>

    <p>If the message is not understood, keep the answering pennant up. A drawing shows two birds on separate boats, the herring gull did not understand the murrelet&#39;s message and has kept the answering pennant up. Another way to signal that the message was not understood is to fly the Zulu and Lima flags, to mean &#34;your signal has been received but not understood.&#34;</p>
