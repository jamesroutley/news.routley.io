    <h1>How hucksters are manipulating Google to promote shady Chrome extensions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <p>The people overseeing the security of Google’s Chrome browser <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/spam-and-abuse">explicitly forbid</a> third-party extension developers from trying to manipulate how the browser extensions they submit are presented in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions">Chrome Web Store</a>. The policy specifically calls out search-manipulating techniques such as listing multiple extensions that provide the same experience or plastering extension descriptions with loosely related or unrelated keywords.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, security and privacy researcher Wladimir Palant revealed that developers are flagrantly violating those terms in hundreds of extensions currently available for download from Google. As a result, searches for a particular term or terms can return extensions that are unrelated, inferior knockoffs, or carry out abusive tasks such as surreptitiously monetizing web searches, something Google expressly forbids.</p>
<h2>Not looking? Don’t care? Both?</h2>
<p>A search Wednesday morning in California for Norton Password Manager, for example, returned not only the official extension but three others, all of which are unrelated at best and potentially abusive at worst. The results may look different for searches at other times or from different locations.</p>

<p>It’s unclear why someone who uses a password manager would be interested in spoofing their time zone or boosting the audio volume. Yes, they’re all extensions for tweaking or otherwise extending the Chrome browsing experience, but isn’t every extension? The Chrome Web Store doesn’t want extension users to get pigeonholed or to see the list of offerings as limited, so it doesn’t just return the title searched for. Instead, it draws inferences from descriptions of other extensions in an attempt to promote ones that may also be of interest.</p>
<p>In many cases, developers are exploiting Google’s eagerness to promote potentially related extensions in campaigns that foist offerings that are irrelevant or abusive. But wait, Chrome security people have put developers on notice that they’re not permitted to engage in keyword spam and other search-manipulating techniques. So, how is this happening?</p>
