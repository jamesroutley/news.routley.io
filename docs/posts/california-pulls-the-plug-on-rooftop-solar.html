    <h1>California pulls the plug on rooftop solar</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Public Utilities Commission approved Net Energy Metering 3.0, slashing payments for sending rooftop solar production to the grid.

This is set to be the largest cut of export rates in U.S. history, in a market that represents roughly 50% of the nation’s residential solar market.</span></p><figure id="attachment_85949"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/NEM-600x279-1.png" alt="" width="632" height="294"/><figcaption><i> Image: Save California Solar </i></figcaption></figure><p>Payments were cut as a result of a reported <a href="https://calssa.org/blog/2021/6/5/debunking-the-cost-shift-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost shift</a> where non-solar owners cross-subsidize solar owners for maintaining the grid.

High costs, supply chain constraints, inflation and permitting and interconnection delays and challenges means it could take years for storage to catch up to solar, said CALSSA.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Currently roughly 1.5 million consumers in California </span><a href="https://calssa.org/press-releases/2022/12/14/calssa-statement-on-cpucs-final-proposed-decision-on-solar-net-metering"><span data-contrast="none">use net metering</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, including thousands of churches, farms, and affordable housing units.

The company was stuck with a $7.5 billion bill as it was found at fault for negligence in maintaining vegetation around its centralized transmission wires. These costs incurred by the utilities are harmful to all Californians, as the financial fallout from these disasters is picked up by ratepayers in the form of a higher bill.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">CALSSA called the new decision a “loser” for California. “For the solar industry, it will result in business closures and the loss of green jobs. For middle class and working class neighborhoods where solar is growing fastest, it puts clean energy further out of reach. For our grid reliability needs, it fails to promise robust growth in battery storage. And for California’s race to clean energy, it puts us behind our goals and out of step with the national pro-solar agenda,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director, CALSSA.</span></p><p>This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.
