    <h1>Optimizing my sleep around Claude usage limits</h1>

    <main itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>For the past 4 weeks I have been managing my sleep schedule around maximizing the usage of my Claude Pro subscription. Every <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8324991-about-claude-s-pro-plan-usage#h_06c9f90d9e">five hours</a> your Claude session usage is reset. When I first began using Claude Code daily, this limit would often come at inconvenient times. I would be in flow, vibing with Claude on my B2B SaaS side project. Unfortunately, just as I was stepping into Claude&#39;s mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonauts#Characters">like I&#39;m Raz</a>, the dreaded usage warning would appear. Your limit will reset at 7am. But I was just getting this React component to hydrate correctly...</p>
<p>Frustrated, I did what any cracked coder would do and ultrathought a thorough implementation plan to my wetware README.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been learning to sail, having recently rediscovered a love of being both near and on the water. Sailing is fun and an addicting mental challenge - it requires being in tune with the wind (micro) and weather (macro). Having been irresponsibly inspired by <a href="https://100r.co">Hundred Rabbits</a> and also lacking a partner to sail long distances with, I&#39;ve been studying the techniques of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-handed_sailing">single-handed</a> sailors.</p>
<p>It turns out, when solo sailing, you don&#39;t sleep. Or rather, you sleep in short intervals, frequently less than 30 mins (especially near shore and in busy lanes). Setting aside the potential ramifications of missing out on REM sleep for weeks at a time, I had an idea.</p>
<p>What if I sleep like a sailor in order to maximize my Claude usage limit?</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>And so far, it&#39;s worked. Depending on how I use Claude (or how Claude uses me?) I run out of tokens on the Pro plan in 1 - 3 hours. This typically gives me time for a nap that&#39;s about 2 or 3 hours, which is enough to even get a little bit of REM sleep.</p>
<p>My velocity has increased 10x and I&#39;m shipping features like a cracked ninja now, which is great because my B2B SaaS is still in stealth mode.</p>
<p>Inevitably, Anthropic will increase their subscription costs or further restrict usage limits. It feels like they&#39;re giving compute away for free at this point. So when the investor bux start to run dry, I will be ready. Maybe I&#39;ll even take inspiration from <a href="https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/automatic-identification-system-overview">AIS</a> and set up an alarm on my computer to alert me if I sleep past the expiry of my usage limit.</p>
