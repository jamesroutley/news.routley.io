                        <p>Sam Bankman-Fried instructed his FTX cofounder Gary Wang to create a &#34;secret&#34; backdoor to enable his trading firm Alameda to borrow $65 billion of clients&#39; money from the exchange without their permission, the Delaware bankruptcy court was told Wednesday.</p><p>Wang was told to create a &#34;backdoor, a secret way for Alameda to borrow from customers on the exchange without permission,&#34; said FTX lawyer Andrew Dietderich.</p><p>&#34;Mr. Wang created this back door by inserting a single number into millions of lines of code for the exchange, creating a line of credit from FTX to Alameda, to which customers did not consent,&#34; he added. &#34;And we know the size of that line of credit. It was $65 billion.&#34;</p><p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) made similar allegations when it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-gary-wang-ftx-alameda-cftc-2022-12" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">brought charges against Wang in December.</a> But the value of that line of credit hasn&#39;t been discussed before now. The CFTC then described it as &#34;virtually unlimited.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>And in November, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/exclusive-least-1-billion-client-funds-missing-failed-crypto-firm-ftx-sources-2022-11-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">Reuters </a>cited unnamed sources as saying that Bankman-Fried had moved $10 billion between the two companies, with a further $2 billion still unaccounted for. </p><p>Dietderich told the court that with the $65 billion back door, Alameda &#34;bought planes, houses, threw parties, made political donations.&#34;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-donated-millions-democrats-report-2022-11" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Bankman-Fried is the second-highest donor</a> to Democratic causes, but says he <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-says-hes-the-republicans-third-biggest-donor-2022-11" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">donated just as much to Republicans using &#34;dark&#34; money</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-owned-256-million-bahamas-real-estate-government-wants-back-2022-12" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">$256.3 million of Bahamian real estate</a> was also registered in FTX&#39;s name – including 15 condos in the same building. Other court filings say <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-spent-7-million-on-meals-entertainment-luxury-hotels-bahamas-2023-1" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">FTX spent $6.9 million on &#34;meals and entertainment&#34; in just nine months.</a></p>
                        
                        <p>Dietderich said the rest of the money went towards personal loans, sponsorships, and investments.</p><p>&#34;We know that all this has left a shortfall, in value to repay customers and creditors,&#34; he added. That amount &#34;will depend on the size of the claims pool and our recovery efforts.&#34;</p><p>The court heard that FTX had so far <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ftx-crypto-recovers-5-billion-assets-creditors-exchange-bankruptcy-sbf-2023-1" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">recovered $5 billion</a> of cash, crypto, and securities, with &#34;plans to monetize over 300 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-117-parties-trying-to-buy-businesses-despite-doj-objection-2023-1" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">other non-strategic investments&#34;</a> worth $4.6 billion. </p><p>Bankman-Fried&#39;s attorney did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment, sent outside normal working hours.</p>
