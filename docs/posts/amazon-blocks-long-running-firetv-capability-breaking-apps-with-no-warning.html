The most recent Fire TV software update has blocked a Fire TV capability that has been present since the original model’s release in 2014. This is a basic Android capability that, to my knowledge, no other Android-based device manufacturer has ever had issues with, let alone blocked. This change has rendered popular Fire TV apps, which have been in Amazon’s own Appstore for years, useless. Worse yet, Amazon seems to have been careless in implementing this change without even a courtesy email to the affected app developers, all under the, seemingly false, guise of enhanced security. <span id="more-42518"></span></p><p><a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/amazons-change-to-fire-tv-adb-that-blocks-local-connections/" rel="attachment wp-att-42520"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=646%2C363&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="646" height="363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?w=800&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=100%2C56&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=200%2C113&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=450%2C253&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=600%2C338&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a>Code excerpt of Amazon’s change to Fire TV’s ADB connection that denies local connections. Sent to me by an affected app developer.</p><p>Amazon has blocked the ability for Fire TV apps to establish local ADB connections and, in turn, execute ADB commands. While it’s not a capability used by many Fire TV apps, without it, Fire TV apps can no longer perform certain advanced tasks, such as freeing up internal storage space by clearing the cache of all installed apps. This change has been verified to be present in Fire TV update 7.6.6.9 for Fire OS 7 devices, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C1W5N87/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fire TV Stick</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BZZ3MM7/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fire TV Cube</a>, and update 8.1.0.3 for Fire OS 8 devices, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP9MDCQZ/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP9SNVH9/?tag=aftvn-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>. It is unknown if older Fire TV models running Fire OS 6 or Fire OS 5 will also be receiving this change, but it seems likely. This update does not change the ability of external devices, like computers or phones, to establish an ADB connection with a Fire TV, which remains possible.</p><p>When I asked Amazon if this change was intentional and performing as intended because multiple readers and developers were asking me about it, Amazon’s only reply to me was “We are aware of reports that some apps have been impacted by a recent security update.” Since then, the <a href="https://github.com/cgutman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer</a> of the immensely popular app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgutman.androidremotedebugger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Remote ADB Shell</a>, which has over half a million downloads and has been heavily crippled by Amazon’s update, has reached out to me with evidence that the change by Amazon is certainly deliberate.</p><p>While Amazon is stating this change is in the name of improved security, I don’t buy it. While ADB commands can be very powerful and, therefore, should only be allowed to run with care, all Android-based devices, including Fire TVs, have several precautions in place to keep users safe from apps or devices trying to execute nefarious ADB commands.</p><p><a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-grant-allow-all-the-time-full-file-storage-access-permission-for-any-app-in-fire-os-8-on-the-2nd-gen-fire-tv-stick-4k-4k-max/allow-usb-debugging-prompt-on-fire-tv/" rel="attachment wp-att-41842"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=646%2C363&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="646" height="363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=100%2C56&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=450%2C253&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=900%2C506&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?w=1292&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a>ADB connection request on Fire TVs</p><p>Before any ADB command can be executed on a Fire TV, an ADB connection to the device must be made. This starts by selecting the Fire TV’s model name in its “About” menu seven times to <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-find-show-unhide-reveal-developer-options-on-an-amazon-fire-tv-stick-fire-tv-cube-or-fire-tv-smart-tv/">reveal a hidden developer menu</a>. Then, an “ADB debugging” option must be enabled from said hidden menu. Finally, every unique ADB connection request from a device or app, be it a local or external connection, results in a full-screen prompt that must be allowed before the ADB connection is made.</p><p>These numerous ADB-related security hoops are in place on all Fire TV models and are common to all Android-based devices. No manufacturer apart from Amazon has felt the need to enhance device security by blocking local ADB connections, despite most non-Amazon Android devices being phones, which hold far more private and critical user data than a Fire TV streaming media player.</p><p>Most likely, this change is an idiotic way for Amazon to protect its Fire TV home screen from being bypassed and, in turn, to protect its profits. Apps commonly used by the Fire TV modding community will often use local ADB connections to detect remote button presses. That detection allows the use of alternate home screens, which aren’t inundated with things like <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/fire-tvs-now-autoplay-full-screen-video-ads-when-waking-up-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/">auto-playing fullscreen video ads</a> like Amazon’s own home screen.</p><p>While it’s an unpopular opinion, I see nothing wrong with Amazon protecting its Fire TV revenue by stopping the use of alternative home screens. It’s crucial to the business model Amazon has chosen to use for the Fire TV and if customers don’t like it, they don’t have to buy one. However, blocking a core OS capability and breaking popular apps in a futile effort to protect the Fire TV home screen is shortsighted and foolish. It’s the equivalent of a town mayor demolishing a bridge used by everyone because their political opponent lives on the other side.</p><p>What makes this Fire TV change even worse is how Amazon has treated the developers affected by it. Two popular Fire TV apps affected by this change are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYLK899N/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TDUK APP Killer</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2L67V4R/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TDUK APP Cache Cleaner</a>, which use local ADB commands to force quit and clear the cache of all apps with a single button press. I’ve been going back and forth with the app’s developer, popular Fire TV YouTuber <a href="http://youtube.com/@TechDoctorUK" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechDoctorUK</a>, all week trying to get to the bottom of why his apps were suddenly and unexplainably marked as incompatible with all Fire TV models, despite not receiving any notice from Amazon and his apps appearing “Live” with “No issues found” in his Amazon developer portal.</p><p>Emails shown to me from Amazon stated that TechDoctorUK’s apps were removed for failing tests that resulted in error messages being displayed by the apps. However, the Amazon testing that resulted in those errors was done on non-Amazon devices (i.e., Android phones), despite the apps only being listed by TechDoctorUK as compatible with Fire TV devices. After being given the runaround for a couple of days, only after I reached out to Amazon about this issue did TechDoctorUK receive an email that stated: “Because your app overrides the native user experience (e.g., with a lockscreen, or widget), it has not been published on Amazon devices.” Given that force-stopping apps and clearing app cache are both native capabilities of Fire TVs, just not with a single click, I interpret the email as Amazon’s canned way of saying we don’t want your app on Amazon devices.</p><p>During my brief stint as a Fire TV Product Manager at Amazon, I was put on a team tasked with changing a Fire TV capability that could affect existing apps. We created and executed a plan that involved contacting affected app developers ahead of the change, helping them update their app if needed, and addressing customer issues that might arise, among other things. What we certainly didn’t do is carelessly push out the change, ghost ban affected apps, give developers the runaround, and reply to concerns with irrelevant canned replies.</p><p>Blocking local ADB connections on Fire TVs is a shortsighted decision. If the goal was to further protect the Fire TV home screen, it should have been achieved in any number of other ways that didn’t require breaking legitimate apps.</p></div></div>
