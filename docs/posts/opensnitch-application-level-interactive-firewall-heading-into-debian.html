    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Opensnitch, the application level interactive firewall, heading into the Debian archive</p><div><p>While reading a
<a href="https://sneak.berlin/20230115/macos-scans-your-local-files-now/">blog
post claiming MacOS X recently started scanning local files and
reporting information about them to Apple</a>, even on a machine where
all such callback features had been disabled, I came across a
description of the Little Snitch application for MacOS X.  It seemed
like a very nice tool to have in the tool box, and I decided to see if
something similar was available for Linux.</p>

<p>It did not took long to find
<a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch">the OpenSnitch
package</a>, which has been in development since 2017, and now is in
version 1.5.0.  It has had a
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/909567">request for Debian
packaging</a> since 2018, but no-one completed the job so far.  Just
for fun, I decided to see if I could help, and I was very happy to
discover that
<a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch/issues/304">upstream
want a Debian package too</a>.</p>

<p>After struggling a bit with getting the program to run, figuring
out building Go programs (and a little failed detour to look at eBPF
builds too - help needed), I am very happy to report that I am
sponsoring upstream to maintain the package in Debian, and it has
since this morning been waiting in NEW for the ftpmasters to have a
look.  Perhaps it can get into the archive in time for the Bookworm
release?</p>
