<p><strong>Do “outline speedrunning”:</strong> <strong>Recursively <span>outline</span> an MVP, <span>speedrun</span> filling it in</strong>,<strong> and <span>only then</span> go back and perfect.</strong></p>







<p>This is a ~10x speed up over the ‘loading-bar’ style (more on that below)</p>







<p>Don’t just read this article and move on. Go out and do this for the very next thing you make so you can get in the habit of doing it.</p>







<p><em>(btw, here, speedrunning just means doing something as fast as possible)</em></p>







<h5>Outline speedrunning algorithm:</h5>



<p>1. Make an outline of the project</p>







<p>2. For each item in the outline, make an outline. Do this recursively until the items are small</p>







<p>3. Fill in each item as fast as possible</p>



<ul>
<li>You’ll get more momentum by speedrunning it, which feels great, and will make you even more productive</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT PERFECT AS YOU GO</strong>. This is a huge and common mistake.</li>
</ul>



<p>4. Finally, once completely done, go back and perfect</p>



<ul>
<li>Color the title text, figure out if buttons should have 5% or 6% border radius, etc</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Since you’re done, you’ll be less stressed, have a much clearer mind, and design your project better</li>



<li><em>And hey, you’ll enjoy the whole process more, and end up making more things over the long run, causing you to learn/grow more</em></li>
</ul>







<h6>CRITICAL requirements for outline speedrunning:</h6>



<ul>
<li>outline recursively</li>



<li>speedrun</li>



<li><strong><span>DO NOT PERFECT ANYTHING UNTIL DONE</span></strong></li>
</ul>



<h5>Outlining is a fundamental of building</h5>



<p>Outline speedrunning may seem basic. That’s because it is. <em>Planning</em> is a fundamental of <em>doing</em>, and <em>outlining</em> is a fundamental of <em>planning</em>.</p>







<p><strong>Much of becoming really efficient is about getting extremely cracked at the fundamentals (many of which you probably mistakenly dismiss).</strong></p>







<p><em>This is recursive btw, because fundamentals typically have fundamentals.</em></p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://learnhowtolearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/output-onlinegiftools.webm" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><em>its conceptual building blocks all the way </em>down</figcaption></figure>



<p>I knew about outlining since I was little but didn’t do it until I was 20. After I started it took time to get cracked at outlining and refine it into outline speedrunning.</p>







<p><strong>There is immense amounts of wisdom/utility/alpha in reevaluating any fundamentals that your mind dismisses as unimportant. Much improvement in any performance-based field comes from fixing these misevaluations.</strong></p>







<p>You may already do outline speedrunning. If you’re not, it’s a 10x speedup over the classic ‘loading bar’ style.</p>







<p><em>Generally, the best speedups come from<em> improving your algorithm</em>s, rather than ramming your head into the task harder</em>.</p>







<h4>Examples</h4>



<h5>Write large docs faster</h5>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://learnhowtolearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/output-1.webm" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><em>My attempt at speedrunning each method for a minute or so. left: loading-bar. right: outline speedrunning</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<h6><strong>Loading-bar writing:</strong></h6>



<p>Common mistake: ‘loading bar writing’ – starting at the beginning of the document and writing sentence by sentence, like a loading bar going through the document.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://learnhowtolearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/loadingbar.webm" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>I wrote like this until I was ~20. It made me hate writing.</p>







<p>Now writing is easy and quick. My writing (and at the time, grades) improved substantially because I could allocate more time towards quality with a clearer, less stressed mind.</p>







<h6><strong>Outline speedrunning writing:</strong></h6>



<p>1 Get topic to write about</p>



<ul>
<li>(optional) brainstorm the general plot of the paper</li>
</ul>



<p>2 quickly write the outline (sections)</p>



<p>3 repeat 2 for each section recursively, until the lowest-level sections are small enough to not need outlines</p>



<p>4 speedrun (without caring about quality AT ALL) filling in each outline (starting at the lowest level) until the whole doc is filled out</p>



<p>5 Enjoy the feeling of being 90% done while you go back and perfect the doc, color the title text, add pictures, etc (the fun part!)</p>







<p>Do this to effortlessly improve both speed and quality of writing.</p>











<h4>Program faster</h4>



<p>Going from loading-bar to outline speedrunning significantly speeds up programming</p>







<h5><strong>Outline speedrunning</strong> for<strong> programming:</strong></h5>



<p>1 Figure out what the main purpose/function of your program is.</p>



<p>2 Break the program into parts grouped by functionality.</p>



<p>3 repeat steps 1-2 for each part, unless it is very small.</p>



<p>4 implement the components starting with the lowest-level</p>







<p><span>Example (simplified version of a data pipeline I built):</span></p>



<p>Idea: Data pipeline application</p>



<p>1 Main purpose: collect tons of data and analyze/store it</p>



<p>2 Breaking it down into components:</p>



<ul>
<li>data collecting component</li>



<li>data cleaning/formatting component</li>



<li>data analysis component</li>



<li>data storage component</li>
</ul>

<p>3 repeat step 2 for each part. Breaking down the data collecting component into subcomponents:</p>



<ul>
<li>Component: list of data collection methods (web scraping, simulation data, tool measurement data, etc)</li>



<li>Component to get user input for choice of data collection method</li>



<li>Component to execute chosen data collection methods</li>



<li>Component to send collected data to storage</li>
</ul>

<p>3 repeat step 2 for each other component and subcomponent, unless they are small</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="755" height="430" src="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png 755w, https://7vaf67.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px"/></figure>







<p>This can be done on a whiteboard, drawn on paper, in your head (can be subpar) or outlined like an essay. The most efficient medium depends on your project. You’ll get a feel for what works best by just practicing this.</p>
