<p>I am home. My dog is happy to see me. The world is a good place and I am behind on work because American Airlines doesn&#39;t have proper power points in International first class like, er, all the other airlines I&#39;ve flown on in the last few years. (They offered to sell me an adapter for $150 to plug in the battery-dead computer, and I probably should have said yes to keep working, but was so outraged, and had decided not to fly American in future, so it would never have been used again, and said no.)</p><p>My assistant Lorraine popped in to check on me. She had decided to start an eat-right-and-exercise diet, and is shedding the pounds. I was impressed. (Ten days of restaurant meals and hotel food and I have only got tighter jeans to show for it.)</p><p>...</p><p>The SPIN HousingWorks Benefit Concert, with Amanda Palmer and me, is already Sold Out. They will be auctioning off the front row tickets, however, so keep an eye on <a href="http://www.housingworks.org/events/detail/spin-presents-liner-notes-with-amanda-palmer-and-neil-gaiman/">http://www.housingworks.org/events/detail/spin-presents-liner-notes-with-amanda-palmer-and-neil-gaiman/</a> if you had hoped to go but do not have tickets.</p></div></div>
