    <h1>Ask HN: How to onboard yourself to a new product/industry in a new job?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>E.g. I&#39;ve never been strong at finance (always at the bottom of the class) but I&#39;ve joined a startup 2 months back that makes a b2b saas fintech product, to lead marketing (first mktg hire in in a total 12 member team). I&#39;ve worked with the founder before and I like the company. The founder has mentioned that it&#39;ll take time to learn the nuances of the product/industry but since I&#39;m a somewhat senior person (9 years exp.), I wanted to see if there are any best practices out there to increase the speed of knowledge transfer/onboarding so that I can connect the dots faster, so to speak.</p><p>We do have a set of required reading material that I&#39;ve gone through, along with product demos, and even 2 VC books that have been recommended on the subject. But unfortunately, I still feel left behind. I need repetition to understand something deeply. Kind of like rote.</p><p>The lack of knowledge is obviously going to affect my growth somewhere down the line as well as in identifying opportunities for the company&#39;s growth.</p><p>I&#39;m looking for advice on what can I do more from folks who joined a company/product/industry that they knew nothing about and how long it took you to get comfortable with it?</p></div></div></div>
