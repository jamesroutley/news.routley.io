    <p>I’ve been building a git implementation in Ruby called <strong><a href="(https://github.com/Garrett-Bodley/Jit)">Jit</a></strong> as part of a <strong><a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a></strong> study group that’s reading <strong><a href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/">Building Git</a></strong> by James Coglin.</p>

<!-- Part of the fun (and challenge) of the book is that you use your own implementation to version control itself. The early stages of your implementation cannot handle nested subdirectories, so all your files must be kept in a flat directory. This limitation is frustrating, but makes the victory of successful adding subdirectory support all the more significant!. Similarly, early versions of -->

<p>I finished building a feature and was ready to commit. I staged the modified files via <code>jit add</code> and ran <code>jit status</code> when I encountered this output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="txt">% jit status
fatal: Checksum does not match value stored on disk</code></pre></figure>

<p>Uh oh, had I corrupted my index file somehow?</p>

<h2 id="inspecting-the-index-on-disk">Inspecting the Index on disk</h2>

<p>The checksum refers to the final 20 bytes stored in <code>.git/index</code> which is a <code>sha1sum</code> of the everything in the index that precedes those final 20 bytes.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s compute the checksum via the command line and inspected the last 20 bytes of my <code>.git/index</code> file</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="zsh">% <span>wc</span> <span>-c</span> .git/index

<p>What the heck? The hashes match!</p>

<p>Let’s throw a breakpoint in my code and inspect what’s going on:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="pry"><span>% jit status

    88:     reader.verify_checksum

<p>Well, that’s definitely a different checksum. So what’s happening here?</p>

<h2 id="a-higher-level-perspective">A Higher Level Perspective</h2>

<p>It might help to explain what the status command is doing.</p>

<p>The first thing the <code>status</code> command command does is read <code>.git/index</code> into memory before using that in-memory representation to determine if any files in your workspace have changed and if anything in your index differs from your previous commit. The checksum error I’m getting happens in that very first step, reading the index into memory.</p>

<h2 id="examining-the-code">Examining the Code</h2>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span># lib/index.rb</span>

<span>def</span> <span>load</span>
  <span>clear</span>
  <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>open_index_file</span>

<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first 12 bytes of <code>.git/index</code> constitute a header that specifies (amongst other things) how many entries are stored in the index. That’s the return value of <code>read_header</code> which we store in <code>count</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at the <code>read_entries</code> method shows this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span># lib/index.rb</span>

<span>def</span> <span>read_entries</span><span>(</span><span>reader</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>)</span>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Each index entry is null terminated, so <code>read_entries</code> reads from the index until it finds a null byte. It then stores that entry in memory, repeating that process <code>count</code> times.</p>

<p>What’s that reader object doing?</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span># lib/index/checksum.rb</span>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>reader</code> object reads a specified number of bytes from a file, updates the <code>sha1sum</code> of everything it’s read, and returns the read chunk of data. <code>verify_checksum</code> reads 20 bytes from the file and compares that the current digest value, throwing an error if they don’t match.</p>

<h2 id="a-hypothesis">A Hypothesis</h2>

<p>After looking at my code, it seems that we’re blindly trusting the value of <code>count</code> that’s returned from reading the index header. If that <code>count</code> value is wrong then <code>verify_checksum</code> will return the wrong 20 bytes and everything will break. It’s possible that we’re reading <code>count</code> incorrectly, or the value in the header is incorrect, and both are pretty easy to check.</p>



<p>First let’s see what code is saying the value of <code>count</code> is:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="irb"><span>From: jit/lib/index.rb:87 Index#load:
</span><span>
</span><span>    80: def load
    81:   clear
    82:   file = open_index_file
    83:   if file
    84:     reader = Checksum.new(file)
    85:     count = read_header(reader)
    86:     read_entries(reader, count)
 =&gt; 87:     binding.pry
    88:     reader.verify_checksum
    89:   end
    90: ensure
    91:   file&amp;.close
    92: end
</span><span>
</span><span>[1] pry(#&lt;Index&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>count</span>
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>38</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>According to the documentation, the index header contains a 4-byte signature “DIRC”, followed by a 4-byte version number, and 32-bit number of index entries.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="hexdump">% cat .git/index | head -c 12 | hexdump -C

00000000  44 49 52 43 00 00 00 02  00 00 00 26              |DIRC.......&amp;|
0000000c</code></pre></figure>

<p><code>0x26</code> is 38 in decimal, so it seems my code and the index header agree on the number of entries to expect.</p>

<h2 id="manually-count-the-index-entries">Manually Count the Index Entries</h2>

<p>Each index entry contains the pathname of the entry in uncompressed ascii format, making it relatively easy to count the number of entries by hand via hexdump.</p>

<p>I hexdumped the whole index and started counting the entries. After the 38th entry I found something weird:</p>

<p>Here’s the last 400 bytes of my <code>.git/index</code> file:</p>

<p><code>index_test.rb</code> is the 38th entry, so I should expect to find the checksum immediately after it.</p>

<p>What the heck? There’s the word <code>TREE</code> followed by a bunch of binary data. That’s some extra data, but it’s definitely not the format of a valid index entry.</p>

<p>It almost looks like I’ve written the content of a <code>TREE</code> database object directly into my index. But I’ve been making commits and staging files in this project for a while. If I was writing arbitrary data into the index I surely would have encountered an issue sooner.</p>

<p>Also, looking closer at the hexdump we see that mixed amongst the binary are the strings <code>bin</code>, <code>diff</code>, <code>command</code>, <code>database</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>command</code>, and <code>.ruby-lsp</code>. These correspond to all the subdirectories in my workspace, but interestingly there’s no reference to any actual files in this rogue <code>TREE</code> object. The trees stored in the database contain references to both files and directories, so there’s no way that I’ve written a database tree’s content into my index.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-to-the-rescue">Documentation to the Rescue</h2>

<p>I had pulled up the index format documentation for git while debugging. There are a lot of references to trees in that page, but <strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/index-format#_cache_tree">one in particular stands out</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cache tree</p>

  <p>Since the index does not record entries for directories, the cache
entries cannot describe tree objects that already exist in the object
database for regions of the index that are unchanged from an existing
commit. The cache tree extension stores a recursive tree structure that
describes the trees that already exist and completely match sections of
the cache entries. This speeds up tree object generation from the index
for a new commit by only computing the trees that are “new” to that
commit. It also assists when comparing the index to another tree, such
as <code>HEAD^{tree}</code>, since sections of the index can be skipped when a tree
comparison demonstrates equality.</p>

  <p>The recursive tree structure uses nodes that store a number of cache
entries, a list of subnodes, and an object ID (OID). The OID references
the existing tree for that node, if it is known to exist. The subnodes
correspond to subdirectories that themselves have cache tree nodes. The
number of cache entries corresponds to the number of cache entries in
the index that describe paths within that tree’s directory.</p>

  <p>The extension tracks the full directory structure in the cache tree
extension, but this is generally smaller than the full cache entry list.
When a path is updated in index, Git invalidates all nodes of the
recursive cache tree corresponding to the parent directories of that
path. We store these tree nodes as being “invalid” by using “-1” as the
number of cache entries. Invalid nodes still store a span of index
entries, allowing Git to focus its efforts when reconstructing a full
cache tree.</p>

  <p>The signature for this extension is { ‘T’, ‘R’, ‘E’, ‘E’ }.</p>

  <p>A series of entries fill the entire extension; each of which
consists of:</p>

  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That must be it! In fact, if I run <code>git status</code> it seems <code>git</code> has no issue reading my index file. That would make sense seeing as this is an “index extension” and therefore unsupported by my own implementation.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h2>

<p>Digging around my <code>.git</code> folder I found the following in <code>.git/logs/HEAD</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>09bda1a2eabf18826997349410032f3d61229345 5704864b6c45d0991a1671fb196a51aa581b4398 Garrett-Bodley &lt;garrett.bodley@gmail.com&gt; 1710967835 -0400	commit: Stub out the Myer&#39;s Diff algorithm.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s my most recent commit! But my code doesn’t have any logic pertaining to <code>.git/logs/HEAD</code>.</p>

<p>I must have been on autopilot and used <code>git commit</code> instead of my own <code>jit commit</code> command. Git then mutated my index and added on the “Cache Tree” extension when making the commit. My own implementation has no concept of a “Cache Tree” so that addition caused everything to break.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the problem</h2>

<p>Thankfully the solution to all this is straightforward: delete the index file.</p>

<p>Running <code>jit add .</code> will generate a new index file that is tracking the entire workspace. After deleting and recreating the index, <code>jit status</code> works entirely as expected.</p>

<h2 id="post-mortem">Post Mortem</h2>

<p>I learned that while <code>git</code> works in <code>jit</code> repositories, the reverse is not true. Git is a complicated tool, and the pared down version that I’ve implemented doesn’t cover all the edge cases that exist in the main tool.</p>

<p>It’s rather unclear to me when a Cache-Tree gets generated. Clearly one is made when making a commit, but not when calling <code>git status</code>. I did a quick google search and haven’t been able to find any posts on the subject. It seems like it exists to speed up the status command for large repositories. I tried searching the <em>Building Git</em> book for any references, but it doesn’t seem to mention cache trees at all. Julia Evans, who has been digging deep into git lately, doesn’t have any blog posts about cache trees either.</p>

<p>I also learned about <code>.git/logs</code>, which provided me concrete evidence of what had gone wrong. Logging is super useful, and I’m glad the main <code>git</code> tool keeps internal records for moments like these.</p>

<p>I’m tempted to try to add support for Cache Trees in my own implementation, or at least learn to skip past it to find the real checksum if one is present. But trying to match all of Git’s functionality 1 to 1 feels like it could lead to an endless series of yak shaves.</p>

<p>All in all I’m left with greater respect for the amount of engineering that goes into a system like Git. There are so many edge cases, and small details that have been built up over the year, and trying to build my own version has given me perspective on just how much work has gone into this ubiquitous tool (though I’ll try to remember to avoid <code>git</code> commands in my Jit repo)</p>
