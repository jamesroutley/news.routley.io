<h2>On the useful use of cat</h2>

<p>
Some people insist that we should never use a
<code>cat</code>.
</p>

<p>
This is at best a subjective opinion, and at worst harmful bullying.
</p>

<p>
Shell pipelines are not things of static beauty, they are interactive dialogs
with the UNIX shell, chatting with it to come up ad-hoc ways of gluing together
tools to the get the at the bespoke outcomes we want.
</p>

<p>
Beginning a shell pipe with a `cat` provides us maximal flexibility during the
exploratory phase. Here is a common pattern I follow:
</p>

<pre><code>cat some-huge-file | head | ...
</code></pre>

<p>
I can fill in the `...` part through trial and error, without running it on the
entire input. <i>A la</i> test driven development.
</p>

<p>
Then, when the rest of the command feels complete, I splice out the
<code>head</code> from the pipeline using the key combinations
<kbd>Ctrl - P</kbd> (prev command), <kbd>Ctrl - A</kbd>
(beginning of line), <kbd>Alt/Opt - F</kbd> twice (to skip over the cat) and
<kbd>Alt/Opt - D</kbd> twice. Seems a lot when I spell it out, but my hands do
it instantly without me thinking.
</p>

<p>
The exact key combinations are not important, and it is perhaps confusing to
bring them into the discussion. But I wanted to show how I think of the shell
pipe concretely - as a series of steps, with the first step being an input and
the last step being an output - and in such a formulation, placing the <code>head</code>
after the <code>cat</code> comes totally naturally.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
The <code>cat | head</code> is redundant, and the following would seem equivalent:
</p>

<pre><code>head some-huge-file | ...
</code></pre>

<p>which later on, once the pipe has been constructed, can be modified to</p>

<pre><code>cat some-huge-file | ...
</code></pre>

<p>
leaving the rest unchanged. This is fine really, achieves conceptual equivalence
with the “<i>first step as the command-agnostic input</i>” way of thinking I&#39;m
describing, and is shorter to boot.
</p>

<p>
Why don&#39;t I do it that way (`head` instead of `cat`)? Because for me it&#39;d only
be a local maxima.
</p>

<p>
For some commands, it would indeed be the best. But I don&#39;t always construct
commands using <code>cat | head</code>. Sometimes I subconsciously know how
things are going to go, by virtue of having done similar things previously, and
while I might not necessarily construct the correct shell incantation in the
first go, I might too, and usually if there is any mistake it&#39;ll take me one or
two minor tweaks to get it right.
</p>

<p>
In such cases, my hands don&#39;t bother with the `head`. So for me, always
beginning the pipeline with a <code>cat</code> is a global maxima. I don&#39;t need
to put any conscious thought into deciding if the shell pipeline is going to be
complicated or not, and if I choose incorrectly I can still easily transition
between the two modes.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
It is fine if someone decides not to use cat <i>ever</i>, it is just a personal
preference. But what I disike are the people who go around giving the “useless
use of cat award” to insist that others also stop using it. I don&#39;t know if
these folks are just misguided, or are intentionally being an ass.
