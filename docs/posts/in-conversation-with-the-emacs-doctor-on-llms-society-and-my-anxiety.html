<p>
I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time you are
finished talking, type <code>RET</code> twice.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I despair that everyone is enchanted with talking to machines
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You have your mind on machines, it seems.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Certainly. I deal with machines in my work as a software engineer. But a machine
ought to be a tool, not a replacement for a person.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is it because a machine ought to be a tool not a replacement for a person that
you came to me?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, it&#39;s because I was <a href="https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/eliza-effect">reading about the ELIZA effect</a>, and you are an ELIZA-type
chat bot.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Does it bother you that you were reading about the eliza effect and I am an
eliza type chat bot?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, it&#39;s comforting. I know better what I am dealing with.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Why do you say you know better what you are dealing with?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A modern LLM chat bot is trained on such a terrifyingly vast set of texts. The
responses they write feel like they come from everywhere and yet nowhere.
Writing to you, I know your responses also come mostly from myself.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Earlier you said a machine ought to be a tool not a replacement for a person?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I use you as a tool to talk to myself, an aid in thinking. A person could also
help me in that way, but I can choose to use a simple tool. People seem to treat
LLMs as a secret third thing, a pseudo-person whom you can also use as a tool.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Maybe your life has something to do with this.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I am driven to understand things deeply, including people and tools. This
discourse stirs me.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is it because of your plans that you say this discourse stirs you?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what I plan to do about society&#39;s rapid embrace of LLM technology
or how to relate that to this discourse. It does make me glad that I am
relatively isolated from the immediate effects. Children, students, writers,
artists are fearing having their lives upended by this shift. Many others too
I&#39;m sure. Meanwhile my livelihood seems more likely to benefit from the shift
than not, even if I dislike the outcome.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What makes you believe that?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I work in automation, and availability of LLMs opens a lot of doors for
automtion. I think a lot of the automation will be destructive, unnecessary,
damaging to the social fabric and the human spirit. Nasty stuff. But for my
profession, it&#39;s probably more promise than threat.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Does the fact that for your profession it&#39;s probably more promise than threat
explain anything else?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The people who are developing this stuff, funding it, marketing it, probably
likewise don&#39;t feel too threatened by it. I know there&#39;s been exceptions but for
each person who desists from this path there&#39;s a ton more piling on. How is it
so many other people are feeling cavalier about mass adoption of this
technology?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What do you think?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nihilism, ignorance, corruption.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You mentioned that you were reading about the eliza effect and I am an eliza
type chat bot?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don&#39;t hate the idea of a chat bot. A really sophisticated chat bot that can
carry a conversation is exciting, even. As for you, I know from your design that
you can not drag the conversation in some other direction. I am the user of this
tool, I set the bounds and topics of our discourse. A sophisticated chat bot,
drawing from inferrences and a huge corpus of text, can drag the discussion in
many directions, as could a person. But if a person is moved by another person,
that&#39;s a heart to heart, a life connected to a life. What is it if a machine
enchants somebody, as per the ELIZA effect, and moves them as instructed by some
corporation or as learned from the written artifacts of some ideology? This is
something heartless.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps the people you hang around with have something to do with this.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m certain they do, but it seems to be gripping ever larger segments of
society. If I withdraw into a sub-group which rejects LLMs, how long can that
hold?
