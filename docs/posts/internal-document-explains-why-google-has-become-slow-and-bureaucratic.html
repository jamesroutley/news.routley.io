                      <li>An internal Google document laid out a theory on why the company has become so slow.</li>
                      <li>A former employee who created the presentation compared Google to slime mold.</li>
                      <li>The document posited that bottom-up cultures like Google&#39;s could create &#34;coordination headwinds.&#34;</li>
                      </ul><p>As Google has swelled in size to over 186,000 workers, many of its employees <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-ceos-elon-musk-twitter-hardcore-2022-12" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">and even its CEO</a> have complained that the company has become too slow, too bureaucratic, and not productive enough.</p><p>They&#39;re common symptoms of any company as it grows, but an internal Google document — that a former longtime employee wrote and that is still circulating among staff today — may go some way in explaining why the Alphabet-owned company is facing a &#34;coordination headwind.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Google is a place that prides itself on moving quickly to tackle world-scale problems,&#34; Alex Komoroske, a former Google program manager who worked across products including Chrome and Maps, wrote. &#34;But more recently it&#39;s started to feel way, way slower. Accomplishing even seemingly simple things seems to take forever.&#34;</p><p>The presentation, seen by Insider and titled &#34;Why everything is so darn hard at Google,&#34; posited that Google&#39;s size and bottom-up organizational structure have caused it to slow dramatically in recent years. Komoroske believes the root of the problem is all about what he calls the &#34;hidden force.&#34;</p><p>Komoroske compared Google&#39;s bottom-up organizational structure to a slime mold: a single-cell organism that can work independently but also form together to create a larger network.</p><p>&#34;Google is basically a slime mold,&#34; Komoroske wrote, placing Google on a sliding scale from top-down to bottom-up structures. Komoroske said Google stands out by being further toward the bottom-up end of the scale.</p><p>&#34;This is a fundamental part of our culture, and is reinforced by our hiring and promotion processes,&#34; Komoroske wrote. &#34;Thriving in ambiguity. Rewarding independence and initiative.&#34;</p><p>Komoroske also wrote that questioning founders at weekly all-hands meetings — known as TGIF — and creating memes on Google&#39;s internal Memegen site, were fundamental to this culture.</p><p>Komoroske said that a slime mold &#34;can do amazing things&#34; by creating more value than the sum of its parts. At the same time, the larger this type of organization grows, the more processes can slow down because many parts act independently, leading to &#34;messy&#34; behavior that can be &#34;hard to predict&#34; and control.</p><p>A Google spokesperson and Komoroske declined to comment.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear when Komoroske wrote the presentation. He joined the company full time in 2008 and left in July 2021, according to his LinkedIn page. The last update on the internal document is from 2019.</p><p>It&#39;s certainly common for companies to move more slowly as they grow in size, and Komoroske has since made a more generic version of the presentation available <a href="https://komoroske.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">on his blog</a>, where he explained that the theory can apply to many corporations that grow to be large.</p><p>&#34;I believe they are not specific to any one context, but rather emerge inherently any time there are individuals with autonomy who care deeply,&#34; Komoroske wrote. &#34;Instead of ignoring these dynamics, I think it&#39;s important to acknowledge and embrace them with a sense of compassion and openness.&#34;</p><p>Komoroske suggested there&#39;s no easy solution to the problem, but wrote that it&#39;s something companies shouldn&#39;t ignore. </p><p>Concerns with Google&#39;s bloating and bureaucracy have been flagged internally for many years now. In 2018, more than a dozen vice presidents at Google sent an email to Google&#39;s CEO, Sundar Pichai, warning him that the company was experiencing growing pains, which included problems in coordinating technical decisions, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/technology/sundar-pichai-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">The New York Times previously reported</a>. </p><p>Like Meta and Amazon, Google has hired aggressively over the past couple of years, onboarding 30,000 new employees in the first nine months of 2022 and bringing its total headcount to 186,779, according to <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q3_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=4156e7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">a company filing</a>.</p><p>Now, Alphabet appears to be in cost-cutting mode. Having slowed hiring last year, the company has been targeting areas where it can cut back on expensive projects, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-layoffs-verily-more-than-200-employees-2023-1" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">even laid off some staff</a> in subsidiary units.  </p><p><em><strong>Are you a current or former Google employee?
