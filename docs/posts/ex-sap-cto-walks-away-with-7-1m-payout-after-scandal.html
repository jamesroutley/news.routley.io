    <h1>Ex-SAP CTO walks away with €7.1M payout after scandal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>SAP paid former CTO Jürgen Müller €7.1 million ($7.5 million) after he left the German software company by mutual agreement in September last year.</p>
<p>Müller <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/03/sap_cto_departs/">departed</a> following an &#34;incident&#34; at a company event earlier in the year. At the time, SAP said its supervisory board had reached a &#34;mutual agreement&#34; with Müller for him to leave the company&#39;s executive board at the end of September.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement at the time, Müller said his behavior had been inappropriate. &#34;I regret being inconsiderate and sincerely apologize to everyone affected. I recognize my behavior at that moment did not reflect our values at SAP.&#34;</p>

    

<p>Later, authorities <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/17/sap_cto_investigation/">confirmed</a> that the investigation related to allegations of sexual harassment.</p>

        


        

<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/ex-sap-cto-settles-probe-over-inappropriate-conduct-claims">Reports</a> from January suggest that Müller had reached a settlement and that the investigation had ended. <em>The Register</em> has asked public prosecutor Staatsanwaltschaft Heidelberg to comment.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sap.com/docs/download/investors/2024/sap-2024-annual-report-form-20f.pdf">filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, SAP documented its executive compensation. In addition to CEO Christian Klein receiving €19 million ($20 million) and Thomas Saueressig, board member for customer services and delivery, receiving €8.2 million ($8.6 million), the regulatory releases reveal total compensation to Müller of €7.14 million.</p>
