      <p>What problems can human beings <em>only</em> solve over a very long period of time? And how can we build institutions that solve those problems?</p>
      <p>Below is a list of marvellous projects which human beings have undertaken over an exceptionally long time. Many examples contributed by people on <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1224902391331319809">Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>The focus is on goal-directed projects (e.g., a scientific experiment or a building), less on more decentralized or unplanned changes (e.g., languages, domestication of livestock, cities, religions). Of course, those are also fascinating, but they have less of a sense of a long-term goal. Jericho is incredible, but the founders probably weren&#39;t thinking &#34;I hope this is still here in 9,000 years&#34;.</p>
      <p>This page is a <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/fast">riff on Patrick Collison&#39;s list of /fast projects</a>. There are surprisingly many commonalities with those projects.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>The proof of Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem involved an incredible amount of mathematics developed over decades and centuries: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">wikipedia</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Many Cathedrals were built over more than a century. An example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris">Notre Dame</a>, over 1163-1345. There are many more.</p></li>
      <li><p>An ongoing example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Familia</a>, begun in 1882, and continuing today.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://research.csiro.au/acc/capabilities/cape-grim-air-archive/">Cape Grim Air Archive</a>, which has been archiving air since 1978, so later researchers can conduct longitudinal studies.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study">Framingham Heart Study</a>, a longitudinal study of the heart which began in 1948.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_England_temperature">Central England Temperature series</a>, from 1659 to the present.</p></li>
      <li><p>The early designs for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">LIGO gravitational wave detector</a> were developed in 1967; the instrument itself was developed over many decades, and first saw gravitational waves in 2016<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment">E. coli long-term evolution experiment</a>, from 1988 to the present.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment">pitch drop experiment</a> from 1927 to the present<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now">Clock of the Long Now</a>, which aspires to last 10,000 years.</p></li>
      <li><p>I suspect many key open source systems (Linux, Wikipedia) will still be around in 100 years. I won&#39;t be surprised if certain standards still show up in a thousand years, perhaps in a modified form. ASCII gives rise to Unicode gives rise to [???] Will Unix Time or TCP/IP ever be replaced? Modified: sure. But there&#39;s at least some chance they&#39;ll be with us for millenia.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway">2nd Ave Subway in Manhattan</a>, with preparatory construction beginning in 1942. First phase opened in 2017.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies">list of oldest companies in the world</a> is food for thought. Sad to report the 2006 demise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi">Kongo Gumi</a>, which began in 578. It was in the construction business, originally of Shinto Shrines (I believe). Such Shrines undergo a continuous process of renewal; an example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo-taisha">Izumo-taisha</a>, which may date to BCE.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_of_Mathematically_Precocious_Youth">Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth</a>, begun in 1971, and continuing as of 2025 (contributed by Tom McCarthy)</p></li>
      <li><p>Wikipedia lists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_experiment">many other long-term exeriments</a>.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>A fun question: of these projects, which <em>required</em> a long time, and which could have been greatly accelerated?</p>
