    <h1>PHP in 2024</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

                    
        
        
                                                        
        <p>It&#39;s 2024, and I&#39;m excited about PHP. Will some people think I&#39;m weird because of that? Sure. Do I have good reasons to be excited about a programming language that&#39;s been around for more than 25 years, which generally has a reputation of being the underdog compared to other languages?</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> very good reasons to be excited about PHP these days. Today, I want to share some of the things I&#39;m most excited about this year for PHP.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-evolution"><a href="#continuous-evolution">#</a> Continuous evolution</h2>
<p>When Nikita left over two years ago — Nikita being <em>the</em> main contributor and driver for PHP, he went to work on LLVM — I&#39;ll admit I was <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/php-in-2022">scared for PHP&#39;s future</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m a little worried now that Nikita has stepped down. He&#39;s definitely not the only person capable of working on PHP&#39;s core, but he <em>did</em> a tremendous amount of work these past years with PHP 8.0 and 8.1.
I don&#39;t think 2022 will be the most mind blowing year for PHP, but rather a year of adding stability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back, I think that fear wasn&#39;t needed. The <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">PHP Foundation</a> has grown into a well-established community, with now 10 developers being paid to work on PHP core. Two major features being worked on at the moment come to mind: <a href="https://rfc.stitcher.io/rfc/property-hooks">property hooks</a> — which I&#39;m hopeful for will pass once it comes to voting; and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWsGDUCxbT0">rework of Pecl</a> — PHP&#39;s extension manager.</p>
<p>Of course, I still got a sliver of hope when it comes to generics, which the Foundation is/was also looking into. I do think that the only viable way forward is <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/we-dont-need-runtime-type-checks">runtime-ignored generics</a> though, time will tell whether the Foundation will be able to cultivate a new mindset or not.</p>

<h2 id="frankenphp"><a href="#frankenphp">#</a> FrankenPHP</h2>
<p>One of the cool things happening in PHP land today is a project called <a href="https://frankenphp.dev/">FrankenPHP</a>. It&#39;s been in the works for a year or two — if I remember correctly, and it&#39;s getting some real traction these days.</p>
<p>FrankenPHP is an app server for PHP, written in Go, that gives existing PHP apps a major performance boost, and it&#39;s super easy to get started with. It also supports compiling PHP projects as standalone binaries, worker mode for long-lived applications, is three times faster than PHP-FPM, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support, and more.</p>
<p>Recently, we&#39;ve seen support for FrankenPHP for <a href="https://blog.laravel.com/octane-frankenphp">Laravel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/php-runtime/frankenphp-symfony">Symfony</a>. So it&#39;s growing into something big.</p>

<h2 id="laravel"><a href="#laravel">#</a> Laravel</h2>
<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say at this point that Laravel&#39;s marketing strategy is working well. Laravel itself — <a href="https://laravel.com/">the open source framework</a> — is by far the most popular one within the PHP community; but they&#39;ve also managed to create an ecosystem of products built with and for Laravel, to build a sustainable business. Just recently, Laravel <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/1768417227202613437">hired 6 new people</a>, from a COO to BizOps to engineers; and Taylor mentioned that &#34;serious business is underway&#34;.</p>
<p>Modern businesses are growing and embracing PHP, which is great to see.</p>
<p>One of the things I embraced last year was <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a>, a tool that allows you to write interactive apps, without any JavaScript. I did some tinkering with it, and had a lot of fun making a game:</p>

<h2 id="discovering-php"><a href="#discovering-php">#</a> Discovering PHP</h2>
<p>What I found especially heartwarming to see is how people outside the PHP community are re-discovering PHP. There have been a number of examples of people coming from the JavaScript world, suddenly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spwv0RbITmE">realising Laravel is a thing</a>, and a <em>good</em> thing; and there are people like ThePrimeagen on YouTube who were pleasantly surprised by PHP:</p>

<h2 id="composer-and-packagist"><a href="#composer-and-packagist">#</a> Composer and Packagist</h2>
<p>The PHP ecosystem keeps growing as well: there&#39;s a continuous growth in packages, indicating an active ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://stitcher.io/resources/img/blog/php-in-2024/01.png"><img src="https://stitcher.io/resources/img/blog/php-in-2024/01.png" srcset="/resources/img/blog/php-in-2024/01-1050x466.png 1050w, /resources/img/blog/php-in-2024/01-1820x808.png 1820w, /resources/img/blog/php-in-2024/01-1486x660.png 1486w, /resources/img/blog/php-in-2024/01-2350x1044.png 2350w, /resources/img/blog/php-in-2024/01-2101x933.png 2101w" sizes="" alt=""/></a></p>
<p>On top of that, Packagist recently crossed the <strong>one hundred billion downloads</strong> milestone. That&#39;s a <a href="https://stitcher.io/blog/php-in-2022#the-ecosystem">doubling in two years time</a>! We&#39;re now at <strong>105 134 384 876</strong>, and that number keeps growing.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say: <strong>PHP is not dead</strong>!</p>
