    <h1>On Corpspeak</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><strong>I: A Simple Ask</strong><span> </span></p><p>I was 23 when I found myself awash in corpspeak.</p><p><span>I had just started my first white-collar job. My coworkers were </span><em>syncing up</em><span> to talk about </span><em>action items</em><span> and </span><em>circling back </em><span>to them later. They were saying that they didn’t have enough </span><em>context, </em><span>did anyone else have more </span><em>context</em><span>, Tom can you provide more </span><em>context</em><span>? They were </span><em>pivoting</em><span> to address the </span><em>low hanging fruit</em><span>;</span><em> </em><span>they were </span><em>touching base </em><span>about their recent</span><em> learnings; </em><span>they were </span><em>escalating issues </em><span>when they didn’t have </span><em>bandwidth</em><span>. They were </span><em>taking things offline</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>I didn’t understand why they used these words. Why </span><em>sync up</em><span> instead of </span><em>meet</em><span>? Why did people have </span><em>bandwidth</em><span> instead of </span><em>time</em><span>? Had we suddenly become computer modems and I didn’t realize it?</span></p><p><span>But more than confusing me, some words grated. This was especially true for words that seemed entirely unnecessary, like </span><em>ask</em><span> used as a noun (e.g., “I have an </span><em>ask</em><span> for you”) or </span><em>learnings</em><span>. At least </span><em>bandwidth</em><span> or </span><em>sync up</em><span> sounded kinda smarter. </span><em>Ask</em><span> sounded like a weird, non-committal version of </span><em>request</em><span> or an </span><em>assignment</em><span>. It was only one letter different from a perfectly valid alternative: </span><em>task</em><span>! </span><em>Learnings</em><span> sounded as though created by someone who, for arcane legal reasons, would be thrown in jail if they said </span><em>lessons.</em></p><p>My whole childhood, I had seen books and films mock jargon generally and corporate life specifically. Calvin and Hobbes ridiculed the use of incomprehensible language to puff up meaningless ideas. Office Space, Fight Club, American Beauty, and I Heart Huckabees satirized the dreary emptiness of white collar life. Didn’t my coworkers realize how ridiculous it sounds to use this jargon?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg" width="1456" height="462" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:462,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:164455,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dfcd9ef-9dda-451a-abd9-d1bb73dc173c_1600x508.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>When I started working, I promised myself I wouldn’t become one of them. I would keep myself pure and use concrete, meaningful English comprehensible to the outside world. And god help me, I would strangle myself with a USB cable before I used </span><em>ask </em><span>as</span><em> </em><span>a noun. </span></p><p><span>Eleven years later, I now </span><em>identify low hanging fruit</em><span> and </span><em>escalate issues</em><span> and </span><em>circle back</em><span> to last week’s </span><em>action items</em><span>. So, yeah, I fully failed. But goddammit, I don’t use </span><em>ask </em><span>as a noun.</span></p><p>After all that time, though, I finally see why people do.</p><p><strong>II: Discount Employees</strong></p><p>A few years ago, I learned of an employee blow-up at large, well-known company. To keep confidentiality, I’ll change names, places, and details, but the key points of the story are completely true. Let’s call the company Company X.</p><p><span>Company X operates all across the US, so employees are paid in part based on where they work. Work in a place with a hot job market - say, New York City - the company pays you more. Work in a place where you’d be lucky to get a job - say, Detroit - the company pays you less.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">1</a><span>  All Company X employees are aware that location affects employee pay. Everyone communally knows that you’ll get paid more in NYC than Detroit. </span></p><p><span>One day at Company X headquarters, employee Alice is going through some expense files on Dropbox. One file catches her eye: </span><em>Location Compensation. </em><span>She opens it to discover it discusses, very generally, how pay is set based on location. Again, all Company X employees know pay varies across locations. </span></p><p><span>But something about this file irks her. To distinguish where employees receive high pay versus low pay, Company X organized the locations into three bins: </span><em>discount</em><span>, </span><em>national</em><span>, and </span><em>premium</em><span>. New York City, naturally, is a </span><em>premium</em><span> location. Detroit is a </span><em>discount</em><span> location. One of her friends works in Detroit, and something doesn’t sit right about her friend being a </span><em>discount</em><span> employee.</span></p><p><span>So Alice makes a copy of the file and sends it to her friend Brenda in Detroit, who is even more incensed. Brenda sends it around to everyone she knows in the Detroit office, saying “</span><em>FYI Company X thinks we’re discount employees. Love working at a company that values us &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3.” </em></p><p><span>News spreads to other offices. Employees in other offices that think they might be </span><em>discount </em><span>locations get worked up. People start posting on internal message boards. The sentiment is all the same: a heavy, sarcastic “Feeling really valued rn”.</span></p><p><span>HR at Company X eventually gets wind of this and tries to shut it down. It’s obviously too late to stop people from knowing now, but they can still control the spread. Naturally, HR burns the evidence and deletes all the original files that mention </span><em>discount,</em><span> </span><em>national</em><span>, and </span><em>premium</em><span> locations from Dropbox. They create new files and  double-check the permissions on them. </span></p><p><span>To be extra-extra safe, HR also renames the </span><em>discount</em><span> bucket to </span><em>standard</em><span>. Now, the buckets are </span><em>standard, national, </em><span>and </span><em>premium.</em></p><p><span>HR will rely on common knowledge (within HR) that </span><em>standard</em><span> means cheap, and </span><em>national</em><span> means average, and </span><em>premium</em><span> means expensive. Even </span><em>if</em><span> anybody finds the file, it would be hard to throw a fit over being a ‘standard’ employee.</span></p><p><span>Again, while I’ve obscured some details here, the story is all true. At a large national company, there was a pay bucket called </span><em>discount</em><span>, people found it, got furious, so HR locked down the files and renamed </span><em>discount</em><span> to </span><em>standard</em><span> to stop it from happening again.</span></p><p><strong>III: The Vagueness is the Point</strong></p><p><span>Lots of people before me have noted that corporate jargon is riddled with euphemisms to hide nasty things. As </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/04/business-speak/361135/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the Atlantic notes</a><span>, the corporate world is full of nice-sounding phrases to use in place of </span><em>fire</em><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Streamline, restructure, let go, create operational efficiencies: </strong><span>All of these are roundabout ways of saying that people are about to lose their jobs.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Renaming </span><em>discount</em><span> </span><em>locations </em><span>to </span><em>standard locations </em><span>has the same effect: to hide the meaning of words and moreover, the negative feelings associated with them. It was not new information - all the Company X employees knew people in Detroit were paid less - but the emotional connotation of being labelled </span><em>discount</em><span> employees that caused the blow-up. </span></p><p><span>In fact, </span><em>standard</em><span> strips meaning and feeling so effectively that you might not even realize it was euphemism. </span><em>Standard </em><span>isn’t a lighter or more convoluted way of saying </span><em>discount</em><span>. It’s a word that conveys almost no meaning at all.</span><em> </em><span>Nothing about </span><em>standard </em><span>suggests ‘lower pay’.</span></p><p><span>In Succession, there’s storyline where two characters, Tom and Cousin Greg, are trying to figure out a slogan for their news network following a scandal. Originally they settle on “We Hear You”. They then discover that their company has an Amazon Alexa-like device that is literally listening when it shouldn’t be, making “We Hear You” a little on the nose. So </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCQhygMdFr4" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">they scramble to find a new slogan</a><span> and eventually settle on: </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp" width="498" height="272.3909090909091" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:722,&#34;width&#34;:1320,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:498,&#34;bytes&#34;:19110,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F602bc0fe-a931-49f9-ab6c-7b4ab5707084_1320x722.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>As Cousin Greg describes the slogan:</p><blockquote><p>It&#39;s good because, it&#39;s like, it&#39;s not clear exactly what the hell it means, so lots of wiggle room.</p></blockquote><p>I think Cousin Greg is onto something. Corpspeak is not just about putting a pretty mask on an ugly face. It’s about wiggle room. </p><p><span>By using one-size-fits-all words and phrases that work whether the situation is fine or dire, you can avoid making it clear </span><em>whether</em><span> the situation is fine or dire. Consider a few corpspeak phrases: </span></p><p><em>I’ll escalate this </em><span>could mean: </span></p><ul><li><p><span>“I guess my manager should know about this.”</span><em> </em><span>OR </span></p></li><li><p>“I’m telling.”</p></li></ul><p><em>Let’s take things offline </em><span>could mean: </span></p><ul><li><p><span>“Makes sense, we’ll figure out the details later.</span><em>” </em><span>OR </span></p></li><li><p>&#34;Let’s never talk about this again.” OR</p></li><li><p><span>“If I have to talk about this with you for one more minute I’m gonna go apeshit in front of all these people</span><em>.</em><span>”</span></p></li></ul><p><em>Tom, do you have more context?</em><span> could mean either:</span></p><ul><li><p>“Tom, were you around for the earlier meetings?” OR </p></li><li><p>“Tom, I have no idea what’s going on, please help me,” OR</p></li><li><p>“Tom, care to explain how you’ve fucked us over?”</p></li></ul><p>If you have enough, well, context, you’ll know exactly what the speaker means. Often, though, you’ll only have a general idea what they mean or how annoyed they are. </p><p><span>And that’s the point!

It has none of the emotional dirt and grime words pick up when tossed around in the outside world. </span><em>I don’t have the bandwidth for that</em><span> sounds neutral, sterile. And if that still sounds a tiny bit rude, we can throw in an extra qualifier to make it even more neutral: </span><em>I’ll check if I have bandwidth for that</em><span>. (Don’t say that! You know you’t.)</span></p><p>Corporate language isn’t used only to paper over bad things. It’s meant to maintain certain, corporate-setting-appropriate feelings — feelings of neutrality, of equality, of technical sophistication, of harmony, of efficiency. Which yes, also means papering over bad things.</p><p><span>To that end, you can see the corporate appeal of </span><em>bandwidth</em><span>. It not only mutes the rudeness of “I don’t have time for that”, but also carries an air of technological sophistication and objectivity. It’s not that you don’t want to do it; you calculated the computational resources available to conclude you don’t have the </span><em>bandwidth </em><span>for it.</span></p><p><span>(Also, maybe vagueness</span><em> does</em><span> play a role. As described </span><a href="https://www.td.org/insights/stuff-business-people-say-bandwidth" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span> by two talent development professionals - surely they know corpspeak! - </span><em>bandwidth </em><span>is used in place of “ability, aptitude, attention span, capability, capacity, competence, drive, energy, enthusiasm, intellect, interest, time, [or] willpower.” So the open-endedness allows the speaker to suggest they objectively can’t do something when they just don’t want to.)</span></p><p><span>Other corporate buzzwords similarly play up feelings. </span><em>Touching base </em><span>carries an aw-shucks, we’re-all-in-this-together feeling. </span><em>Sync </em><span>replaces </span><em>meet </em><span>because it feels efficient, high-tech. We’re not just </span><em>meeting</em><span> in some room, we’re </span><em>synchronizing</em><span> our mental states into a Six Sigma singularity. </span></p><p>Unfortunately, in order to create the preferred corporate environment feeling, corporate jargon does need to, you know, ignore a large chunk of the human experience. Reality is filled with opinions, hierarchy, fights, and fuck-ups. These grimy things get washed away by an jet-powered spray of neutralizing language, leaving only the desired corporate feelings. And, often, a vague feeling of emptiness.</p><p><strong>V. Neutralisms</strong></p><p><span>There’s a lovely little </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/sjuec9/ask_as_a_noun/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">r/etymology thread</a><span> about the origins of the noun form of </span><em>ask.</em><span> In it, one user comments:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>[The noun form of ask] bugs me too. Maybe it bothers me that using ask as a noun is passive voice, like the request is disembodied. </span><em>I&#39;m</em><span> not asking, the ask just appeared there!</span></p><p>But if I&#39;m being honest I probably just dislike it because it&#39;s business speak.</p></blockquote><p><span>These two reasons — disliking </span><em>ask</em><span> because it feels passive and disliking it because it’s corpspeak — are not mutually exclusive. In fact, I’d argue they’re one and the same.</span></p><p><span>Sure, it seems like a bad thing that </span><em>ask </em><span>is passive, that “the request is disembodied.” But a business setting might consider this a virtue.</span></p><p><span>Consider the obvious alternatives: </span><em>request</em><span>, </span><em>task</em><span>, </span><em>assignment</em><span>. Ever so subtly, these words convey information about the power dynamics at play. If I have a </span><em>request</em><span> for you, the power is in your hands to choose whether you do it. If I have a </span><em>task </em><span>or </span><em>assignment </em><span>for you, I hold the power. And in choosing a word, I reveal who has power.</span></p><p><em>Request </em><span>or </span><em>task </em><span>conveys who has power; </span><em>ask </em><span>obscures it.</span></p><p>This, of course, is useful for creating the desired, neutral emotional state preferred by corpspeak. Hierarchy makes people feel bad, so why not do away with the words that remind us of it? </p><p><span>Words like </span><em>ask </em><span>are barely euphemisms; they’re more like </span><em>neutralisms</em><span>. The words they replace - </span><em>request, assignment - </em><span>aren’t ‘bad words’ in any way. Corpspeak just prefers to play it safe and strip out anything that might, somehow, somewhere, elicit bad feelings. </span></p><p><span>Recently, a coworker was creating a presentation that discussed “key </span><em>learnings</em><span>”. Why use </span><em>learnings </em><span>over </span><em>lessons</em><span>? </span></p><p><em>Lessons </em><span>are something that someone - or maybe life - teaches you. Used in the wrong context, it might sound like someone messed up, and/or they were taught a lesson by someone who knew better than them. That hints at fuck-ups, or at least at hierarchy. </span><em>Learnings </em><span>has none of that baggage. As always, it sounds nice and neutral, like the knowledge just appeared out of thin air and floated into your mind. </span></p><p><span>This difference is *so subtle*. </span><em>Learnings</em><span> and </span><em>lessons</em><span> have the same definition. It’s just a difference in connotation. Corpspeak words are pod-people versions of their everyday equivalents: outwardly the same, but stripped of any soul.</span></p><p><strong>VI. A Confession</strong></p><p>This can sound conspiratorial, like there’s some shadowy cabal forcing people to use corpspeak. But no! It’s everyday people choosing to use it. Why? </p><p>Some reasons from my experience:</p><ol><li><p>We’re social creatures, and we like to fit in.</p></li><li><p>If we dropped our unfiltered opinions all the time, we’d be fired.</p></li><li><p>It’s emotionally draining to honestly discuss fights, fuck-ups, and hierarchy in a productive way. </p></li></ol><p>Point 3. sometimes looks like mutually-assured-destruction. We don’t say every thought in its purest form because we don’t want to hear all our coworkers’ thoughts in their purest forms. You might think Tom is a brown-noser, but Tom thinks you’re lazy. While it might be fun to tell Tom what you *really* think, hearing what Tom *really* thinks of you would be a huge bummer. Corpspeak lets you both say ‘whatever’ and get lunch.</p><p><span>Even in lower stakes situations, it’s taxing to talk about fights, fuck-ups, and hierarchy. When you use </span><em>request </em><span>or </span><em>assignment, </em><span>you have to think about whether you have power or not, and how the other people react to that power difference. If you openly say someone messed up, you’ll be on the receiving end of their anger. In many cases, using the vague, cagey language of corpspeak sidesteps all that. </span></p><p>To that end, I have a confession.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg" width="960" height="540" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:540,&#34;width&#34;:960,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:84470,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd44d414a-7495-484c-8671-45f9e6c726a0_960x540.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>“Forgive me Father, for I have an ask”</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>For all my railing on </span><em>ask</em><span>, I use </span><em>action item</em><span> all the time at work</span><em>. </em><span>If you haven’t used it, it means “something that a specific person should do.” It’s another term that replaces </span><em>request</em><span> and </span><em>assignment</em><span>, another term that clouds whether they have power in making them do it or not. So, yeah. </span><em>Action item</em><span> is just another version of </span><em>ask</em><span>. Despite my hatred of </span><em>ask,</em><span> I use </span><em>action item </em><span>all the time.</span></p><p>I use it partially because everyone around me uses it, sure. </p><p><span>But I also use </span><em>action item</em><span> because it’s easier. I often need to lay out tasks, requests, or whatever you want to call them. Some of them are assignments (I have power), and some of them are requests (they have power), and some of them are in a murky no-mans land between those two (the universe is an unknowable mystery). Often, I’m dishing out a mishmash of assignments and requests simultaneously. I can’t separate out which is which one-by-one. Instead, I use the vague, passive </span><em>action item </em><span>all the time so I don’t have to think about it.</span></p><p><strong>VII. Acceptance</strong></p><p>Articles like this often wrap up with a neat note saying We Should All Communally Agree to Stop Using Corporate Jargon and What a Better Place the World Would Be.  </p><p><span>I agree, up to a point. Words that have perfectly acceptable normal variants are better. We can use </span><em>meet</em><span> instead of </span><em>sync up.</em><span> Nobody needs to use </span><em>learnings</em><span>. I think we should expand the acceptable-feeling-range in a white-collar workplace. We should be able to more genuinely acknowledge mistakes, hierarchy, inequality. </span></p><p>But I sometimes think some writer-types, including my past self, can’t see that corporate language will never be the same as traditional writing. They can’t be the same, because their goals are not the same. </p><p>Traditional writing strives to elicit feeling. Preferably strong, complex cocktails of sadness, joy, fear, disgust, lust, Schadenfreude, ennui, that feeling when someone cancels plans you didn’t want to do anyway. Really anything that speaks to the human experience. The stronger and more complex the feeling, the better.</p><p>Corporate language strives to limit feeling to a pre-approved range. It’s aiming for a nice La Croix of neutral, mildly positive feeling.</p><p>After years of working in corporations, I don’t think it’s fair to expect corporate language to be traditional writing. Again, yes, I wish corporate language would open the acceptable emotional range. Negative emotions are huge part of the human experience. If a workplace tries to act like they don’t exist, it’ll get a lot of pent-up, frustrated employees. I wish that leaders could level more with their employees.</p><p>But a work email is not a Jonathan Franzen novel. The goals are different. A work email is just trying to convey some information about problems in a way that doesn’t piss anyone off. A novel is trying to make you ask deep, fundamental questions about the human experience. If you felt that every time you opened a work email, you’d quit your job by 10 AM. </p><p><span>In the story where HR replaced </span><em>discount </em><span>with </span><em>standard</em><span>, it did so because employees genuinely lost their shit. And you kinda understand why! Sure, </span><em>discount </em><span>is the clear, meaningful word and </span><em>standard </em><span>is the vague, meaningless one. But it does feel shitty to know that your company, indirectly, via where you work, considers you a </span><em>discount </em><span>employee.</span></p><p><span>When I told her the story, my girlfriend argued that HR should have found a term that conveyed the meaning of </span><em>discount </em><span>without its negative feeling.</span></p><p><span>I think this is impossible.</span><em> </em><span>Employees in some locations are paid less than employees in other locations, and that kinda sucks for the lesser-paid employees to remember. Any word that accurately conveys the situation will also convey it kinda sucks.</span></p><p><span>You could call the worst pay bucket (</span><em>discount</em><span>) something neutral-to-positive like </span><em>baseline </em><span>and call every other pay bucket something even more positive like </span><em>great </em><span>and </span><em>awesome </em><span>and </span><em>double-plus-awesome.</em><span> But this is a textbook corpspeak move!

As a result, there’s no communal stopping corpspeak. We’re all choosing to use it, partially out of inertia but partially out of necessity. We don’t want the emotional stakes of our job to be high. We don’t want to risk coworkers blowing up at us. We want to get the information, and get out. </p><p>So, sure, use more understandable words where possible. But also make peace with corpspeak.
