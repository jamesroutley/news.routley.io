absolute worst time of your life I don’t know how you guys are still standing up but I’m in awe.</p><p>I found myself reiterating the same advice to at least 7 people now, so I’ll write it all here for those who are too crippled to ask for help.</p><p>hope it’s useful folks and keep it up.</p><p>never surrender.</p><p>I’m receiving a variation of this, but the common element is always that the person feels completly lost.</p><p>lost because AI will take their job, lost because it seems there is too much to learn, lost because they don’t know if they actually like this whole tech thing, etc.</p><p>hold on.</p><p>hold it right there.</p><p>most had no idea. </p><p>they had the vaguest picture of what they would be doing in 5 years.</p><p>and trying to figure it out by looking at technology is the wrong way to look at it.</p><p>it would be like trying to obsess intensely over hammers, nails, saw to build a house. tech is the same; it’s just a set of tools to do something.</p><p>enter my favorite method to get your life untangled, which I call the wafflehouse method (bear with me, I swear this blog post is useful).</p><p>I’ll detail here how to use it, but remember that untangling your life goals is a deeply personal process. </p><p>take inspiration from this, but feel free to modify so that it feels good.</p><p>call in sick, cancel your meetings and plans for two days.</p><p>straight in the middle of the week.</p><p>don’t tell your kids, wife, moms or friends that you are taking off.</p><p>you are going to go on a deeply personal introspective adventure and the only one invited is you.</p><p>48h to find yourself in the whole year is the least you can do.</p><p>sorry for the image but yes that’s what you gonna do.</p><p>pick your favorite spot, the one you feel very good to be at, and can spend a whole day by yourself.</p><p>can’t give you advice on picking a spot just make sure that wherever you are going has deep significance for yourself.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

because you are going to be squatting there opening until closing.</p><p>bring you computer, your notepad and this image of yourself.</p><p>now that you are comfortably sitting with your beverage of choice it’s time to refine the image you painted into 2-3 clear goals that happen in 5 years time.</p><p>the goals need to be very specific and detailed.</p><p>if you feel absolutely ridiculous writing them down, it’s maybe too much, but don’t hold back. the goals need to match the image.</p><p>write as much detail as you can about each of these goals and make sure that there are as few as possible while still retaining the essence of the image.</p><p>now that you have these 2-3 5-year goals you interpolate what you need to achieve in 3 years time to be on track to hit them.</p><p>it’s ok if your interpolation is a bit crooked, you just need to trace a course here.</p><p>if you feel the 3 years are ridiculous, feel free to change the 5 years and adjust the knob of your dream self.</p><p>now you do the same on the 1-year goal.</p><p>you are for sure going to do some back and forth between the 1-3-5 years adjusting things as you go.</p><p>try to keep the number of goals as few as possible.</p><p>if they sprawl around, it might be best for you to reduce the scope of your image a bit. for instance trying to be a nobel prize winner marathon karateka black belt might be too much.</p><p>focus on one aspect if you see your goals proliferating, the one that is more important to you.</p><p>I know it’s tough to make a call here, but you have to be somewhat pragmatic at some point.</p><p>btw the goals aren’t starting in like january 1st, they start now now.</p><p>now you are going into the details for real. you’re going to make a DAG.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"
