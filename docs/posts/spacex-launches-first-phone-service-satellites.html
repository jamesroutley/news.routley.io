    <h1>SpaceX launches first phone service satellites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>SpaceX launched a rocket on Tuesday carrying the first set of Starlink satellites that can beam signals directly to smartphones from space.</p><p>Elon Musk’s space business struck a deal in August 2022 with wireless carriers to provide phone users in “dead zones” with network access via its Starlink satellites.</p><p>One of the carriers, T-Mobile US, confirmed that the satellites, carried on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, were in low-Earth orbit this morning.</p><p>The direct-to-cell service will begin with text messaging, followed by voice and data capabilities in the coming years, T-Mobile’s statement said. Satellite service will not be immediately available to T-Mobile customers; the company said that field testing would begin “soon”.</p><p>SpaceX plans to “rapidly” scale up the project, according to Sara Spangelo, senior director of satellite engineering at SpaceX. “The launch of these first direct-to-cell satellites is an exciting milestone for SpaceX to demonstrate our technology,” she said.</p><p>Mike Katz, president of marketing, strategy and products at T-Mobile, said the service was designed to help ensure users remained connected “even in the most remote locations”. He said he hoped dead zones would become “a thing of the past”.</p><p>Other wireless providers across the world, including Japan’s KDDI, Australia’s Optus, New Zealand’s One NZ and Canada’s Rogers will collaborate with SpaceX to launch direct-to-cell technology.</p><p><em>Reuters contributed reporting</em></p></div></div></div>
