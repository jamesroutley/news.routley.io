					<h3>What is that ?</h3>
						<p>	
							BlinderKitten is a free lighting software designed to be used during <b>live events</b> or <b>theater</b>. Unlike other lighting softwares, there is no restrictions that you can lift by paying or buying a dongle. Everything is available, unrestricted and free.
						</p>
						<p>
							The software is &#34;fixture-oriented&#34;, that means that you don&#39;t have to learn and control each DMX channel by hand like in a traditionnal lighting desk, here, you just have to tell BlinderKitten what kind of device you&#39;re using (called a <a href="https://norbertrostaing.gitbook.io/blinderkitten/object-types/fixture-types" target="_blank">fixture type</a>), add one <a href="" target="_blank">fixture</a> per device patched on your stage, fill the address in the fixture and BlinderKitten have now full control of your device.</p>
						<p>
							Every composition you make with your fixtures can be recorded in a <a href="https://norbertrostaing.gitbook.io/blinderkitten/object-types/cuelists" target="_blank">cuelist</a>, containing one cue by composition. you can define timing to go from one to others and act like a conductor, and also can have multiple cuelists working together, respecting LTP and HTP priorities. </p>
						<p>
							There is currently three functions to add automatic behaviors to your fixtures : effects, carousels and mappers.</p>
						<p>
							To render your creations, ou have a virtual faders panel and a virtual button panel. As BlinderKitten doesn&#39;t have a physical console, there is no limitation on the number of buttons or faders. You can also set the number of buttons above and below each fader.
						</p>
						<p>
							BlinderKitten can output as many universes you need (and you can) and can be remote controlled by OSC or MIIDI. As it can output artnet, it is fully compatible with <a href="https://www.capture.se/" target="_blank">capture</a>.
