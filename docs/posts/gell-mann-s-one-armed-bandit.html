    <h1>Gell-Mann&#39;s One-Armed Bandit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
<p>
A small observation about Large Language Models (LLMs), human psychology, and some common pricing models for the APIs of hosted models:</p>
<p>
LLMs induce Gell-Mann Amnesia when asked about any topic about which the inquirer is unfamiliar. If one should ask an LLM a question to which  one knows the answer, one scoffs at the small or large errors it makes. When one asks it about something with which one is unfamiliar, it outputs something &#34;reasonable&#34; that is difficult not to take at face value.</p>
<p>
LLMs, especially ones that have a per-token cost, operate similarly to slot machines. Exhibiting psychological similarities to a Skinner box, chat bots that sometimes have useful output perform variable schedule operant conditioning on the user, which is a highly effective schedule known for causing addiction. This is in addition to other psychological effects that LLMs induce when paying per-token, like plan continuation bias which is induced by output which almost meets the standards of the requester, but falls short in a critical way.</p>
<p>
A short search shows I&#39;m not the first to notice that using LLMs might be addictive. I&#39;m not the first to notice the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect they have either.</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a little nervous about the idea that we have created addictive bullshit machines that sound like experts on any topic about which the audience is uninformed. That seems like a problem.</p>
