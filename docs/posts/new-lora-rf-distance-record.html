    <h1>New LoRa RF distance record</h1>

                <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/article/lorawan-world-record-broken-twice-in-single-experiment-1">The long term LoRaWAN® distance world record of 832 km / 517 mi</a> has been broken. The new record now stands at 1336 km / 830 miles. </p>

<p>After 3 years, the new world record was set by installing LoRaWAN trackers on a fishing boat <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=8797219">Estrela de Sesimbra</a> and on its buoys on the Sesimbra coast, Portugal. The tracker was able to make contact with a gateway in the Canarian Islands. Three messages have been received by the <em>“cablpa-pitilleros”</em> gateway connected to The Things Stack Community Edition.</p>

<p>Nuno Cruz reports that the trackers were installed by the team of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://custodian.solvit.pt">Custodian project</a> which is lead by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.solvit.pt/">Solvit </a>and includes <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fit.isel.pt/">FIT</a>/<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.isel.pt/">ISEL</a> (where Nuno Cruz is a researcher), <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.aircentre.org/">AirCentre DOCAPESCA</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lotacor.pt/">LOTAÇOR</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/">NTNU</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.uavision.com/">UAVISION</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://terinovazores.pt/">TERINOV</a>. The project is funded by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.eeagrants.gov.pt/">EEAGRANTS</a> Blue Growth Programme.</p>
<p>The remarkable point of this record is that it is achieved at sea level. Reaching extended distances with LoRaWAN at sea level eliminates potential variables introduced by varying altitudes, providing a standardized and objective measure of the technology&#39;s capabilities. We do have to note that this is an exceptional achievement. The majority of The Things Stack-operated devices range between 25 and 100 meters (75-300 feet) from the gateway.</p>
<p>The tracker used to achieve this record is STMicroelectronics <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-strkt01.html">STEVAL-STRKT01</a>.</p>
