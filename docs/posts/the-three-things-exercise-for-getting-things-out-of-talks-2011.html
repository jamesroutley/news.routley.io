    <h1>The “three things” exercise for getting things out of talks (2011)</h1>

(More general advice on going to talks
is <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html">here</a>.
As with all my webpages, feedback is more than welcome!)

</p><p>

<em>The challenge of talks.</em>  It is tricky to get things out of
talks, even after a lot of practice.  It is very easy to go to a talk,
and at some point have your eyes glaze over.  Talks are like horses:
once you are thrown off, it is hard to get back on.  Especially if the
horse is stomping on your face.  (That&#39;s why it is very bad to come
into a talk a few minutes late --- even if it is sometimes
necessary.)  </p><p>

<em>&#34;Three Things&#34;</em> is an exercise to learn how to get things out of talks.
It can be useful if you are in the first few years of going to
seminars --- I&#39;ve intended it as practice for graduate students ---
but I&#39;ve also found that I got much more out of talks (especially
those out of my comfort zone) when using it.  It is admittedly a
little contrived, and when a bunch of us first experimented with it
(perhaps around 2007?), we stopped doing it after a while because we
got tired of it.
</p><p>
<em>The theory</em> is as follows.  If you can get even three small things out of a talk, 
it is a successful talk.  And if you can&#39;t get even  three small
things out of a talk, it was not a successful experience.
Note that the things you get out of a talk needn&#39;t be the things that
your neighbor got out of a talk, or the things the speaker expected
you to get out of the talk.
</p><p>
<em>Here is how it works.</em>
 Take a clean sheet of paper, or an index card. 
<em>Your goal</em> is to have three things, and only three things, on this
 sheet at the end of the talk.  The &#34;things&#34; can be of many forms:
</p><li> a definition you want to remember (e.g. &#34;a  K3 surface is...&#34;)
</li><li> a theorem you want to remember (&#34;the moduli space of polarized K3
  surfaces is smooth&#34;)
</li><li> a motivating or key example (&#34;a quartic is an example of a K3 surface&#34;)
</li><li> a motivating problem (&#34;why are all moduli spaces of polarized K3
  surfaces the same dimension?&#34;)
</li><li> a question you want to ask the speaker (&#34;why is that hypothesis
  in your theorem?&#34;)
</li><li> a question you want to ask someone else (a definition,
  motivation, a question about a connection etc.)
</li><li> anything else of a similar flavor:  something specific that made
 you think.
 Something vague (&#34;I liked the part where she talked about groups&#34;)
  does not count as a &#34;thing&#34;.
<p>  <em>As you watch the talk</em>, look out for &#34;things&#34; you like.  When one
  comes your way, write it down.  Then later write down a second.
  Then write down a third.  Hopefully a fourth will come your way ---
  and then you must look over the previous three, and decide which one
  must be cut.  A dirty secret is that you may not be able to prevent
  yourself from remembering the one you cut --- and the ones you kept 
				and reviewed will be more fixed in
  your mind.
</p><p>
(If you take notes in a more traditional sense, you can still play the
game, by putting a star beside each &#34;thing&#34;.  This works a little less
well; you will be less focused on looking for &#34;things&#34;.)
</p><p>

<em>After the talk:</em> if other people are playing, send each other
your things by email (or discuss them in person).  It is surprisingly
enlightening. And there will likely be some follow-up discussion.  It
doesn&#39;t take much time (to type or to send one sentence responses to
others&#39; things if the spirit moves you).  If you have questions, then
ask them to someone (perhaps the speaker over the semianr dinner; or
perhaps your advisor or your students or your colleagues).  Don&#39;t let
them drop.
