    <h1>Salesforce Lays Off 8k While Paying Matthew McConaughey $10M/Yr to Sit Around</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>CEOs making sane financial decisions!</h2><h2>Alright Alright Alright</h2><p>Salesforce, the cloud-based &#34;customer relationship management&#34; software colossus co-helmed by the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/salesforce-is-ditching-its-awkward-corporate-obsession-with-hawaiian-culture">definitely-not-Hawaiian Marc Benioff</a>, is the latest in a slew of tech giants to lay off thousands of employees, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-layoffs-marc-benioff-ohana-culture-8b3e82c"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a>.</p><p>Per the <em>WSJ</em>, the company will be letting go of 8,000 members from its massive workforce, formerly referred to by Benioff — who, again, is definitely not Hawaiian — as the &#34;Salesforce ohana,&#34; ohana being the Hawaiian name for &#34;family.&#34; (Salesforce stepped away from using that and other <a href="https://medium.com/@salesforce/50-ways-to-bring-the-aloha-spirit-into-your-company-da5b5535a811">Hawaiian terminology and practices</a> back in 2019 due to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-28/salesforce-s-hawaii-obsession-provokes-debate-over-appropriation">cultural appropriation concerns</a>.)</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s an unfortunate part that you have to say goodbye to folks who, in many cases, are your friends and you have relationships with,&#34; Benioff, an original co-founder of the firm, told the <em>WSJ</em>. &#34;But, ultimately, the success of the business has to be paramount.&#34;</p><p>A fair point, at least on the surface. Present-day Silicon Valley, which had previously enjoyed a decade of relatively non-stop growth and endless employee perks, is now attempting to grapple with post-pandemic slowdowns as well as a rapidly changing industry landscape. But Benioff&#39;s woes are a bit... different.</p><p>At Salesforce, massive amounts of company resources seem to be going to exceedingly peculiar places, including — but <em>certainly </em>not limited to — actor Matthew McConaughey&#39;s pockets. According to the <em>WSJ</em>, the Hollywood star was being paid <em>$10 million per year</em> to be a &#34;creative adviser and TV pitchman&#34; for the firm.</p><p>A sane financial decision to make for a $160 billion dollar company, we&#39;re sure.</p><h2>Boom Boom Pow</h2><p>It&#39;s been no secret that McConaughey has close ties to the firm — he&#39;s spoken at Salesforce events, attended company meetings (accompanied at times by Black Eyed Pea William &#34;will.i.am&#34; Adams), and has even appeared in the outfit&#39;s Super Bowl commercials.</p><p>But having celebrity ambassadors is one thing; as a company insider <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c9299d9-314f-4381-9378-ee008035fab5">told<em> The Financial Times</em></a> back in January, Benioff &#34;frequently involved&#34; his celebrity pals in &#34;strategy discussions,&#34; even granting them a seat at &#34;high-level corporate discussions.&#34; And while we&#39;re sure McConaughey is a smart enough guy, if mass layoffs were in order, we simply can&#39;t fathom that his brainstorming sessions were worth $10 million annually.</p><p>Paying McConaughey millions to hang out isn&#39;t the only Salesforce issue. The still-not-Hawaiian Benioff is well-known for lavishing his employees with wild perks, which included hosting wildly expensive celebrity-headlined conferences and opulent wellness retreats.</p><p>In any case, our thoughts are with the laid-off Salesforcers. Things will one day be alright, alright, alright.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-layoffs-marc-benioff-ohana-culture-8b3e82c"><em>At Marc Benioff&#39;S Salesforce, It&#39;s One Big Family—Until Trouble Hits</em></a> [<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>]</p><p><strong>More on tech layoffs:</strong> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/45000-tech-workers-layoffs"><em>Big Tech Announced More than 45,000 Layoffs in Recent Months</em></a></p></div></div>
