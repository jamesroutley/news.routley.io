<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/tds684b.jpg" alt="TDS 684B showing 4 1 GHz sine waves"/></p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/2024/04/17/Tektronix-TDS-Button-Swap.html">Tektronix TDS 684B oscilloscope</a> that I bought 
cheaply at an auction. It has 4 channels, 1 GHz of BW and a sample rate of 5 Gsps. Those are respectable 
numbers even by today’s standards. It’s also the main reason why I have it: compared to modern oscilloscopes, 
the other features aren’t nearly as impressive. It can only 
record 15k samples per channel at a time, for example. But at least the sample rate doesn’t go down when
you increase the number of recording channels: it’s 5 Gsps even all 4 channels are enabled.</p>

<p>I’ve always wondered how Tektronix managed to reach such high specifications back in the nineties, 
so in this blog post I take a quick look at the internals, figure out how it works, and
do some measurements along the signal path.</p>



<p>The first oscilloscopes of the TDS600 series were introduced around 1993. The last one, the 
TDS694C was released in 2002. The TDS684 version was from sometime 1995. The ICs on my 
TDS684C have date codes from as early as the first half of 1997.</p>

<p>The main characteristic of these scopes was their extreme sample rate for that era, going from
2 Gsps for the TDS620, TDS640 and TDS644, 5 Gsps for the TDS654, TDS680 and TDS684, and 10 Gsps for
the TDS694C which was developed under the <a href="https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/TDS694C"><em>Screamer</em></a>
code name.</p>

<p>The oscilloscopes have 2 main boards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the acquisition board contains all the parts from the analog input down to the sample memory as well as some
triggering logic.</p>

    <p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/acquisition_board.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/acquisition_board.jpg" alt="Acquisition board"/></a>
<em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a very busy CPU board does the rest.</p>

<em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2 flat cables and a PCB connect the 2 boards.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/interconnections.jpg" alt="Interconnections"/></p>

<p>The interconnect PCB traces go to the memory on the acquisition board. It’s safe to assume that
this interface is used for high-speed waveform data transfer while the flat cables are for lower speed
configuration and status traffic.</p>

<p><em>If you ever remove the interconnection PCB, make sure to put it back with the same orientation.
It will fit just fine when rotated 180 degrees but the scope won’t work anymore!</em></p>



<p>The TDS 684B has 4 identical channels that can easily be identified.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/acquisition_board_annotated.jpg"><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/acquisition_board_annotated.jpg" alt="Annotated acquisition board"/></a>
<em>(Click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>There are 6 major components in the path from input to memory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Analog front-end</p>

    <p>Hidden under a shielding cover, but you’d expect to find a bunch of relays there to switch between 
different configurations: AC/DC, 1Meg/50 Ohm termination, …</p>

    <p>I didn’t open it because it requires disassembling pretty much the whole scope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Signal Conditioner IC(?)</p>

    <p>This is the device with the glued-on heatsink. I left it in place because there’s no metal 
attachment latch. Reattaching it would be a pain. Since the acquisition board has a bunch 
of custom ICs already, chances are this one is custom as well, so knowing the exact part 
number wouldn’t add a lot of extra info.</p>

    <p>We can see one differential pair going from the analog front-end into this IC and a 
second one going from this IC to the next one, an ADG286D.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Semi ADG286D Mystery Chip</p>

    <p>Another custom chip with unknown functionality.</p>

    <p>Finally, an off-the-shelf device! But why is it only rated for 25MHz?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Semi ADG303 - A Custom Memory Controller Chip</p>

    <p>It receives the four 8-bit lanes from the four ADCs on one side and connects
to four SRAMs on the other.</p>

  <li>
    <p>4 <a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/as7c256.pdf">Alliance AS7C256-15JC</a> SRAMs</p>

    <p>Each memory has a capacity of 32KB and a 15ns access time, which allows for
a maximum clock of 66 MHz.</p>

    <p>The TDS 684B supports waveform traces of 15k points, so they either only use
half of the available capacity or they use some kind of double-buffering scheme.</p>

    <p>There are four unpopulated memory footprints. In one of my TDS 420A blog posts,
I extend the waveform memory 
<a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/2020/07/11/Option-Hacking-the-Tektronix-TDS-420A.html#in-search-of-the-missing-memory">by soldering in extra SRAM chips</a>.
I’m not aware of a TDS 684B option for additional memory, so I’m not optimistic
about the ability to expand its memory. There’s also no such grayed-out option
in the acquisition menu.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When googling for “ADG286D”, I got my answer when I stumbled on 
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/retr0.id/post/3ljqf5bvkys2d">this comment on BlueSky</a> which speculates that 
it’s an analog memory, probably some kind of CCD FIFO. Analog values are captured
at a rate of up to 5 GHz and then shifted out at a much lower speed and fed into the ADC. I later
found a

comments that confirm this theory.</p>



<p>Let’s verify this by measuring a few signals on the board with a different scope.
The ADC input pins are large enough to attach a 
<a href="https://tomverbeure.github.io/2025/04/12/DSLogic-U3Pro16-Teardown.html#probe-cables-and-clips">Tektronix logic analyzer probe</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/probing_the_adc.jpg" alt="Probing the ADC input"/></p>

<p><strong>ADC sampling the signal</strong></p>

<p>With a 1 MHz signal and using a 100Msps sample rate, the input to the ADC looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/1_1MHz_100Msps_no_clock.png" alt="1 MHz, 100 Msps waveform at ADC"/></p>

<p>The input to the ADC is clearly chopped into discrete samples, with a new sample
every 120 ns. We can discern a sine wave in the samples, but there’s a lot of noise on the
signal too. Meanwhile the TDS684B CRT shows a nice and clean 1 MHz signal. I haven’t
been able to figure out how that’s possible.</p>

<p>For some reason, simply touching the clock pin of the ADC with a 1 MOhm oscilloscope probe 
adds a massive amount of noise to the input signal, but it shows the clock nicely:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/2_1MHz_100Msps_with_clock.png" alt="1 MHz, 100 Msps waveform at ADC with clock included"/></p>

<p>The ADC clock matches the input signal. It’s indeed 8.33 MHz.</p>

<p><strong>Acquistion refresh rate</strong></p>

<p>The scope only records in bursts. When recording 500, 1000 or 2500 sample points at 100Msps, 
it records a new burst every 14ms or 70Hz.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/3_100MSps_2500pts_70Hz.png" alt="Acquistion refresh for 2500 points, 100Msps"/></p>

<p>When recording 5000 points, the refresh rate drops to 53Hz. For 15000 points, it drops
even lower, to 30Hz:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/4_100Msps_15000pts_29Hz.png" alt="Acquistion refresh for 15000 points, 100Msps"/></p>

<p><strong>Sampling burst duration</strong></p>

<p>The duration of a sampling burst is always 2 ms, irrespective of the sample rate
of the oscilloscope or the number of points acquired! The combination of a
2 ms burst and 8 MHz sample clock results in 16k samples. So the scope always
acquires what’s probably the full contents of the CCD FIFO and throws a large
part away when a lower sample length is selected.</p>

<p>Here’s the 1 MHz signal sampled at 100 Msps:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/5_1MHz_100Msps_2ms_acq.png" alt="Sampling burst of 2ms at 100 Msps"/></p>

<p>And here’s the same signal sampled at 5 Gsps:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/6_1MHz_5Gsps_2ms_acq.png" alt="Sampling burst of 2ms at 5 Gsps"/></p>

<p>It looks like the signal doesn’t scan out of the CCD memory in the order
it was received, hence the signal discontinuity in the middle.</p>

<p><strong>Sampling a 1 GHz signal</strong></p>

<p>I increased the input signal from 1 MHz to 1 GHz. Here’s the
ADC input at 5 Gsps:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/9_1GHz_5Gsps_8.3Mhz_sample_clock.png" alt="Sampling a 1 GHz signal at 5 Gsps"/></p>

<p>With a little bit of effort, you can once again imagine a sine wave
in those samples. There’s periodicity of 5 samples, as one would expect
for a 1 GHz to 5 Gsps ratio. The sample rate is still 8.3 MHz.</p>

<p><strong>Sampling a 200 MHz signal</strong></p>

<p>I also applied a 200 MHz input signal.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/12_200MHz_5Gsps_2.73us_period.png" alt="Sampling a 200 MHz signal at 5 Gsps"/></p>

<p>The period is now ~22 samples, as expected.</p>

<p>200 MHz is low enough to measure with my 350 MHz bandwidth Siglent oscilloscope. To confirm that
the ADG286D chip contains the CCD memory, I measured the signal on one of the
differential pins going into that chip:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/probing_input_adg286b.jpg" alt="Probing the input of ADG286D"/></p>

<p>And here it is, a nice 200 MHz signal:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/13_200MHz_going_into_CCD.png" alt="200 MHz seen on the input of the ADG286D chip"/></p>



<p>After initially publishing this blog post, I had a discussion on Discord about the noise issue
which made me do a couple more measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Input connected to ground</strong></p>

<p>Here’s what the ADC input looks like when the input of the scope is connected to ground:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/20_input_to_gnd_full.png" alt="Input connected to ground - full burst"/></p>

<p>2 major observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s a certain amount of repetitiveness to it.</li>
  <li>there are these major voltage spikes in between each repetition. 
They are very faint on the scope shot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s zoom in on that:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/21_input_to_gnd_zoom.png" alt="Input connected to ground - zoomed"/></p>

<p>The spikes are still hard to see so I added the arrows, but look how the sample pattern repeats 
after each spike!</p>

<p>The time delay between each spike is ~23.6 us. With a sample rate of 120ns, that converts into
a repetitive pattern of ~195 samples.</p>

<p>I don’t know why a pattern of 195 samples exists, but it’s clear that each of those 195 locations
have a fixed voltage offset. If the scope measures those offsets during calibration, it can
subtract them after measurement and get a clean signal out.</p>

<p><strong>50 kHz square wave</strong></p>

<p>Next I applied a 50kHz square wave to the input. This frequency was chosen so that, for the selected
sample rate, a single period would cover the 15000 sampling points.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/23_square_wave_full.png" alt="Square wave - full burst"/></p>

<p>2 more observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the micro-repetitiveness is still there, irrespective of the voltage offset due to the input signal. 
That means that subtracting the noise should be fine for different voltage inputs.</li>
  <li>We don’t see a clean square wave outline. It looks like there’s some kind of address interleaving
going on.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>50kHz sawtooth wave</strong></p>

<p>We can see the interleaving even better when applying a sawtooth wavefrom that covers one burst:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/tds684b/26_sawtooth_full.png" alt="Sawtooth wave - full burst"/></p>

<p>Instead of a clean break from high-to-low somewhere in the middle, there is a transition period
where you get both high and low values. This confirms that some kind of interleaving is happening.</p>



<ul>
  <li>The TDS684B captures input signals at high speed in an analog memory and digitizes them at 8 MHz.</li>
  <li>The single-ended input to the ADC is noisy yet the signal looks clean when displayed on the CRT of the
scope, likely because the noise pattern is repetitive and predictable.</li>
  <li>In addition to noise, there’s also an interleaving pattern during the reading out of the analog FIFO 
contents.</li>
  <li>The number of samples digitized is always the same, irrespective of the settings in the
horizontal acquisition menu.</li>
</ul>
