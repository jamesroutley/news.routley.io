    <h1>Your nines are not my nines (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
I&#39;ve had some occasions of late to peer through the looking glass into a 
world that I hadn&#39;t seen much of previously.  Specifically, I&#39;m talking 
about the world of so-called &#34;cloud&#34; stuff, where you basically pay 
someone else to build and run stuff for you, instead of doing it 
yourself.
</p><p>
I&#39;ll skip the analysis of build vs. <s>buy</s>rent and just jump 
straight to the point where you&#39;ve chosen &#34;<s>buy</s>rent&#34;.  Then you&#39;ve 
had a whole bunch of fun outages caused by something going wrong with 
their services.  Finally, you reach the point of a sit-down talk with 
the vendor to figure things out.  Maybe they send some sales people 
too, or perhaps it&#39;s just engineers.  You talk for a while, and before 
long, you realize what happened.
</p><p>
They are huge.  They are like a giant which lumbers around while you are 
a gnat.  You are nothing to them.
</p><p>
This becomes obvious when talking about some problem you experienced at 
the hands of their system.  The whole time, their dashboard stayed green 
because from their point of view, they had <em>tremendous</em> 
availability.  We&#39;re talking 99.999% here!  Totally legit!
</p><p>
Meanwhile, you were having a really bad day.  Nothing was working.  Your 
business was in shambles.  Your customers were at your throat yelling 
for action, and all you could do is point at the vendor.  What happened?
</p><p>
Well, this is the point where you find out that their &#34;99.999%&#34; 
availability is for <em>their entire system</em>.  They see that, and 
they&#39;re good.  It&#39;s not a problem!  Everything is fine.
</p><p>
This also completely misses the fact that for you, everything was 
failing.  It doesn&#39;t matter though, since your worst day still won&#39;t 
move the needle on their fail-o-meter.  They won&#39;t see you.  They won&#39;t 
have any idea anything even happened until you complain weeks later.
</p><p>
You are the bug on the windscreen of the locomotive.  The train has no 
idea you were ever there.
</p><p>
The problem is that they weren&#39;t monitoring from the customer&#39;s 
perspective.  Had they done that, it would have been clear that oodles 
of requests from some subset of customers were failing.  They would have 
also realized that certain customers had <em>all</em> of their requests 
failing.
</p><p>
For those customers, there were no nines to be had that day.
</p><p>
Seriously, if you have a multi-tenant system, you owe it to your 
customers to monitor it from their point of view.  Otherwise, how can 
you possibly know when you&#39;ve done something that&#39;ll leave them in the 
cold?
