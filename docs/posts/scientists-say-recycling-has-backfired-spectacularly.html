    <h1>Scientists Say Recycling Has Backfired Spectacularly</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>We thought we were doing the right thing!</h2><h2>Reduce, Reuse, Repudiate</h2><p>While recycling campaigns can help limit what heads to the landfill, scientists are now saying that it&#39;s masked the glaring problem of over-production and de-emphasized other waste reduction strategies that are far more sustainable.</p><p>In a <a href="https://theconversation.com/decades-of-public-messages-about-recycling-in-the-us-have-crowded-out-more-sustainable-ways-to-manage-waste-208924">new essay for <em>The Conversation</em></a>, an interdisciplinary group of researchers out of the University of Virginia that&#39;s been studying the psychology of waste found that many people over-emphasize the recycling aspect of the waste management industry&#39;s &#34;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&#34; slogan. The result, they say, is a major backfiring as the public has come to mistakenly consider recycling a get-out-of-jail-free card, confusing which goods are actually recyclable in the first place and ignoring the growing waste production catastrophe.</p><p>In a series of experiments, the UV researchers first asked participants first to list &#34;reduce,&#34; &#34;reuse,&#34; and &#34;recycle&#34; by order of efficacy — the correct answer being the same one in the old slogan — finding that a whopping 78 percent got it wrong. In a second experiment, the researchers had participants use a computer program to virtually &#34;sort&#34; waste into recycling, compost, and landfill bins. Unfortunately, the outcome of that survey was even more stark, with many incorrectly putting non-recyclable waste, such as plastic bags and lightbulbs, into the virtual recycle bin.</p><h2>Cause and Effect</h2><p>While over-emphasizing or getting the recycling protocol wrong is an <a href="https://futurism.com/plastic-recycling-landfill-greenpeace">issue on its own</a>, its downstream effects have been devastating as <a href="https://futurism.com/microplastics-bottled-water">microplastics from consumer waste</a> continue to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/science/ocean-plastic-animals.html">pollute our oceans</a>, <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/plastic-planet-how-tiny-plastic-particles-are-polluting-our-soil#:~:text=Microplastics%20can%20also%20interact%20with,Science%20Daily%20about%20the%20research.">land masses</a>, and <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/scientists-microplastics-human-lungs">bodies</a> — and as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00690-8">greenhouse gases from the production of all this stuff</a> keep <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/greenhouse-effect/">throttling our planet</a>.</p><p>While lots of governmental bodies are, as the researchers note, <a href="https://www.plantswitch.com/single-use-plastic-ban/">attempting to stem</a> and <a href="https://www.seasidesustainability.org/post/the-u-s-progress-with-single-use-plastic-bans#:%7E:text=Currently%2C%20the%20U.S.%20has%20not,placed%20bans%20on%20plastic%20bags.">even ban</a> the proliferation of single-use plastic goods such as plastic straws and bags, the industries responsible for creating those landfill-bound items keep making more and more of them, and even their own <a href="https://theconversation.com/designing-batteries-for-easier-recycling-could-avert-a-looming-e-waste-crisis-146065">mitigation strategies</a> are voluntary.</p><p>The onus to reduce, reuse, and recycle ends up falling on consumers — who, as the aforementioned studies show, aren&#39;t as well-trained on how to do them as we should be. It&#39;s a status quo that does little to tackle the global waste crisis and ends up using a lot of <a href="https://www.inverse.com/science/plastic-recycling-report">logistical and worker power to boot</a>.</p><p><strong>More on waste: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/oceans-plastic-pollution-unprecedented-levels"><em>The Ocean&#39;s Plastic Pollution Has Spiked to &#34;Unprecedented&#34; Levels</em></a></p></div></div>
