    <h1>Signal to leave Sweden if backdoor law passes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-entry-content"><section><p>According to Whittaker, the bill requires the encrypted messaging app Signal to install so-called backdoors in the software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you create a vulnerability based on Swedish wishes, it would create a way to undermine our entire network. Therefore, we would never introduce these backdoors, she says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the bill – which may be passed next year – is for the police and Security Service to be able to request message history in retrospect for individuals suspected of crimes.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces, on the other hand, are negative and write in a letter to the government that the proposal cannot be realized &#34;without introducing vulnerabilities and backdoors that can be exploited by third parties&#34;, reports SVT.</p></section></div></div>
