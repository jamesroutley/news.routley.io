<p>As fall becomes winter and another season passes, it is easy to be distracted by the end of autumn colors and the promise of approaching holidays. Conversations and actions about microplastics which are important all the time seem to take place only when we see the massive waste washing up on our shores or there are images in front of us of it rotting in landfills where it also enters the water stream. We know that our waters are now riddled with plastic, but it is important to remember that microplastics are everywhere, in our air, water, soil, and even the clouds drifting by</p>

<p>Microplastics in the body can damage organs, leech hazardous chemicals, weaken immune function, and alter reproduction capacity. But we really don’t know the full extent of the harm that plastic pollution is doing to us because of the lack of toxicology information on many of the chemicals used in plastic. Manufacturers use plastics in personal care, pharmaceuticals, detergents,</p>

<p>Here are five ways to minimize microplastic pollution in your everyday life and in your home.</p>



<ol>
<li>Avoid bringing in all new plastics and single-use plastics into your home and recycle what you have.</li>



<li>Buy fewer clothes and when you do, buy clothes made from organic and sustainable materials or second-hand. Wash your clothes less often and air dry them.</li>



<li>Buy plastic-free cosmetics, personal care products, detergents,</li>



<li>Use public or alternative transportation as much as possible. Reach has found that 200,000 tons of tiny plastic particles are blown from roads and make up nearly 30% of microplastics in the ocean. The fewer cars on the road, the less microplastic released from tires.</li>



<li>Bring your own bags when you go shopping and reuse the plastic bags you already have at home.  </li>



<li>Support legislation to reduce plastic pollution and support non-profits addressing the plastic crisis. </li>
</ol>



<p>Here are three well-vetted organizations fighting to reduce plastic pollution:</p>



<p><strong>Gayil Nalls, Ph.D.</strong> is the founder of World Sensorium Conservancy.</p>

<li>Switzer, L. It’s time to talk about plastic pollution and its impact on human health. Duke University School of Medicine.</li>
