    <h1>Birds make nests out of anti-bird pins</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                                                  
  <div><p>If you look around in cities, you can see anti-bird spikes on many buildings. The sharp metal spikes are placed to scare away birds, and to prevent them from building nests. But birds are not so easily scared away, it now appears. Researchers from two Dutch natural history museums collected nests of a carrion crow and a Eurasian magpie that were largely built with material that should have deterred birds: bird nests made of anti-bird spikes. &#34;It&#39;s like a joke, really&#34; says biologist Auke-Florian Hiemstra of Naturalis: &#34;Even for me as a nest researcher, these are the craziest bird nests I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;</p>

<p>The adaptability and creativity of urban birds seem to know no bounds. Researchers from Naturalis Biodiversity Center and the Natural History Museum Rotterdam describe these spiky structures in the scientific journal <em>Deinsea</em>. &#34;Just when you think you&#39;ve seen it all after half a century of studying natural history, these inventive crows and magpies really surprise me again,&#34; said Kees Moeliker, director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam and co-author of the scientific publication.</p>

<p>Magpies make a roof on their nest to prevent the robbery of eggs and young, and they specifically look for thorny plants in nature for this purpose. Spiky branches keep hungry egg robbers away. In the city there is another option: the anti-bird spikes. “They are literally made to keep birds at bay,” says Hiemstra, “which is how they seem to be used by birds as well.”</p>
