    <p>The coin <em>dime</em> was first conceived in the US Coinage Act of 1792, which aimed to standardize the silver coins circulating around the country to the de facto standard of the <a href="http://approximateknowledge.net/etym/2024/08/12/dollar.html">Spanish dollar</a>. Alexander Hamilton in particular was a big proponent of using a decimal system for the currency, intentionally distancing the new country from the Carolignian system of pounds, shillings, and pence in wide European use since Charlemagne’s edicts a thousand years earlier, in 792. The act specified decimal subdivisions of the dollar with Latin-inspired names: the 1/10 dollar disme (Latin <em>decima</em> meaning “tenth”), the 1/100 dollar cent (Latin <em>centum</em> meaning “hundred”), and the 1/1000 dollar mille (Latin <em>mille</em> meaning “thousand”).</p>

<p>From 1796 to 1853, dimes were mostly made of silver. They were small and thin to maintain their silver content at a tenth of the silver dollar’s. Dimes feature in many phrases that have become frozen into American English, such as <em>a dime a dozen</em> (literally 1861, figuratively 1930), <em>nickel and dime</em> (“cheap” 1879, “wear down” 1913), and <em>stop on a dime</em> (1927; the Ford origin that’s been picked up by LLMs appears to be made up by one person on Quora in 2021).</p>

<p>More recently, <em>drop a dime on</em> originally meant to make a phone call in the 1950s, as pay phones were 10 cents for a local call, before shifting to mean specifically “narc on”, perhaps because pay phones were anonymous. A <em>dime bag</em> of weed was $10 for one gram in the 1970s, not ten cents.</p>
