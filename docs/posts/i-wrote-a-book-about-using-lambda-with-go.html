    <h1>Show HN: I wrote a book about using Lambda with Go</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi HN!<p>During the last few years, I worked on a few applications built with Go, running on AWS Lambda.</p><p>As I got to know the platform better, I started to find Go &amp; Lambda to be a really productive combination. The applications were fast, and they ended up being much cheaper to run than what my team &amp; I had built before. It’s probably not the best platform for _every_ application, but I was surprised at how much of our workload worked well on it.</p><p>As we brought new engineers on to our team and helped them get up to speed with the stack, I found that we were covering a lot of the same topics over and over — especially things like performance, testing and monitoring. Since this knowledge turned out to be very useful for our team, I decided to gather it into a book that will hopefully also be useful to others.</p><p>This is my first time putting something like this together, so I&#39;m grateful for any feedback!</p><p>The book is at: https://kevinmcconnell.gumroad.com/l/lambda-go-book/hn (with HN discount ;))</p><p>There&#39;s also a link on that page to a free sample that you can download without registering.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Cheers,
Kevin</p></td></div></div>
