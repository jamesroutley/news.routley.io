    <h1>AT&amp;T says criminals stole phone records of &#39;nearly all&#39; customers in data breach</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. phone giant AT&amp;T confirmed Friday it will begin notifying millions of consumers about a fresh data breach that allowed cybercriminals to steal the phone records of “nearly all” of its customers, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>In a statement, AT&amp;T said that the stolen data contains phone numbers of both cellular and landline customers, as well as AT&amp;T records of calls and text messages — such as who contacted who by phone or text — during a six-month period between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. </p>

	
	


<p>AT&amp;T said some of the stolen data includes more recent records from January 2, 2023 for a smaller but unspecified number of customers.</p>

	
	


<p>The stolen data also includes call records of customers with phone service from other cell carriers that rely on AT&amp;T’s network, the company said. </p>

<p>AT&amp;T said the stolen data “does not contain the content of calls or texts,” but does include calling and texting records that an AT&amp;T phone number interacted with during the six-month period, as well as the total count of a customer’s calls and texts, and call durations — information that is often referred to as metadata. The stolen data does not include the time or date of calls or texts, AT&amp;T said.</p>

<p>Some of the stolen records include cell site identification numbers associated with phone calls and text messages, information that can be used to determine the approximate location of where a call was made or text message sent.</p>

<p>In all, the phone giant said it will notify around 110 million AT&amp;T customers of the data breach, company spokesperson Andrea Huguely told TechCrunch. </p>

	
	


	
	


<p>AT&amp;T published <a href="https://www.att.com/DataIncident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a website with information for customers</a> about the data incident.<strong> </strong>AT&amp;T also disclosed the data breach in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000073271724000046/t-20240506.htm">a filing with regulators</a> before the market opened on Friday.</p>

<h2 id="h-breach-linked-to-snowflake">Breach linked to Snowflake</h2>

<p>AT&amp;T said it learned of the data breach on April 19, and that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/att-reset-account-passcodes-customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unrelated to its earlier security incident</a> in March. </p>

<p>AT&amp;T’s Huguely told TechCrunch that the most recent compromise of customer records were stolen from the cloud data giant Snowflake <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/mandiant-hackers-snowflake-stole-significant-volume-data-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a recent spate of data thefts</a> targeting Snowflake’s customers.</p>

	
	


<p>Snowflake allows its corporate customers, like tech companies and telcos, to analyze huge amounts of customer data in the cloud. It’s not clear for what reason AT&amp;T was storing customer data in Snowflake, and the spokesperson would not say.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T is the latest company in recent weeks to confirm it had data stolen from Snowflake, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/live-nation-confirms-ticketmaster-was-hacked-says-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following Ticketmaster</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/07/snowflake-ticketmaster-lendingtree-customer-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LendingTree subsidiary QuoteWizard</a>, and others.</p>

	
	


<p>Snowflake blamed the data thefts on its customers for not using multi-factor authentication to secure their Snowflake accounts, a security feature that the cloud data giant did not enforce or require its customers to use. </p>

<p>Cybersecurity incident response firm Mandiant, which Snowflake called in to help with notifying customers, later said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/mandiant-hackers-snowflake-stole-significant-volume-data-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about 165 Snowflake customers had a “significant volume of data” stolen from their customer accounts</a>. </p>

	
	


<p>Mandiant attributed the breach to an as-yet-uncategorized cybercriminal group tracked only as UNC5537. Mandiant’s researchers say the hackers are financially motivated and have members in North America and at least one member in Turkey. </p>

<p>Some of the other corporate victims of the Snowflake account thefts had data subsequently published on known cybercrime forums. For AT&amp;T’s part, the company said that it does not believe that the data is publicly available at this time.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T’s statement said it was working with law enforcement to arrest the cybercriminals involved in the breach. AT&amp;T said that “at least one person has been apprehended.” AT&amp;T’s spokesperson said that the arrested individual was not an AT&amp;T employee, but deferred questions about the alleged criminals to the FBI. </p>

	
	


<p>An FBI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch on Friday that that after the phone giant contacted the agency to report the breach, AT&amp;T, the FBI and the Department of Justice agreed to delay notifying the public and customers on two occasions, citing “potential risks to national security and/or public safety.” </p>

	
	


<p>“AT&amp;T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&amp;T’s incident response work,” the FBI spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The FBI did not comment on the arrest of one of the alleged cybercriminals.</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/29/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the second security incident AT&amp;T has disclosed this year</a>. AT&amp;T was forced to reset the account passcodes of millions of its customers after a cache of customer account information — including encrypted passcodes for accessing AT&amp;T customer accounts — was published on a cybercrime forum. A security researcher told TechCrunch at the time that the encrypted passcodes could be easily decrypted, prompting AT&amp;T to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/att-notifies-regulators-after-customer-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take precautionary action to protect customer accounts</a>.</p>
