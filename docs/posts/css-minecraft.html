<p>trying to find a good example to explain how come Anthropic and OpenAI have dual products: they both have consumer products (their chat apps), but at the same time they are platforms, because everyone can use their API and build their own products.</p>
<p>the only company that I know of with such duality is Amazon - they have a consumer service which is amazon.com where people can buy stuff and they have AWS - which is a platform for everyone to build their own businesses.</p>
