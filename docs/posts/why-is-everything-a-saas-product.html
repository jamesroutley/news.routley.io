    <h1>Ask HN: Why is everything a SaaS product?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I understand the advantages of Saas - transparent updates, cloud based, redundancy, subscriptions, scaling, unicorns etc.<p>Why don&#39;t we have more businesses following the JetBrains model specially if the product is not a service that needs to run 24/7. I buy the product once and use it for perpetuity. If I want updates, I pay more.</p><p>As a consumer, my data does not leave my perimeter, my data is not sold or used for ads and I am not hooking into a subscription that I am going to forget soon.</p><p>1) Personal photos and videos backup and viewer. - Just give me a cheap cloud for backup and a desktop app for viewing.
2) Personal budget - Just give me a desktop app that connects to my different accounts and gives me overview.</p></div></div>
