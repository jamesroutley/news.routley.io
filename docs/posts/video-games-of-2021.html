    <h1>Video games of 2021</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Played a lot of Hades which <a href="https://blog.jonnew.com/posts/video-games-2020">I covered in last year’s post</a>. I dabbled in a few other games this year too.</p>

<h4>Gone Home</h4>
<p><em>PC</em></p>

<h4>Castle Crashers Remastered</h4>
<p><em>Switch</em></p>

<h4>Stephen&#39;s Sausage Roll</h4>
<p><em>PC</em></p>

<p>Somehow, a game that involves solving puzzles by rolling and pushing sausages onto grill-like tiles so they’re evenly cooked on both sides manages to be very challenging and satisfying. I don’t particularly care for the visual style, but this is an excellent puzzler. It would make a fantastic Switch game, but I don’t think there are any plans to port it over.</p>

<h4>Terraria</h4>
<p><em>PC</em></p>

<p>I did not think I would enjoy this as much as I have been. Terraria is sort of like a 2D Minecraft. I’ve been regularly playing with friends who recently moved away as a way to keep in touch. I thought I’d be bored because there didn’t seem to be much direction. But, there’s a ton to discover, fun quests, fun item upgrades, and plenty of monsters. Not to mention, given all the materials that are in this world, there’s a lot of very fun artistic structures that can be made. This game has been challenging, funny, and delightful, and has been a lot of fun to play with friends. Not sure it would be as enjoyable single player.</p>

<h4>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</h4>
<p><em>Switch</em></p>

<p>This is a sequel to the excellent <a href="https://blog.jonnew.com/posts/video-games-2016">Ori and the Blind Forest which I played 5 years ago</a>. Needless to say, the Will of the Wisps is a worthy successor. It’s just as beautiful (if not more so) and vibrant and fun as the original. There are a couple changes to how you upgrade Ori’s abilities, which to be honest I don’t really like, but in the end it’s a minor quibble for a fun and gorgeous game.</p>

<h4>Cities Skylines</h4>
<p><em>Switch</em></p>

<p>This game has been out for a few years, and is essentially the spiritual successor to SimCity. There’s a lot more to customize too; bike lanes, more parks, transit lines, public policies, almost everything you can think of. I’ve run into some weird simulation issues where a bunch of my citizens were sick and it wasn’t entirely clear why. I restarted from a save point, and strangely, it didn’t happen again. Also, the game is frustratingly dependent on cars. I can’t zone unless there’s an adjacent road, but worse, if I wanted a city center that was for pedestrians only, or a bike only city, I can’t do it. Gripes aside, this is a fun game to relax and fiddle with.</p>
