    <h1>RC W1&#39;23 | Wk 1/14</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Reflecting on the first week of my second batch at RC.</em></p><span id="continue-reading"></span><hr/><p>One week has gone by! I&#39;ll briefly summarize how my days went below and reflect on the whole but here&#39;s the short version.</p><p><strong>TLDR;</strong> I knew I wouldn&#39;t be making any huge strides toward my batch goals. I will probably never pair or socialize enough, because there are always more opportunities to do both! I have few regrets about how I spent my first week, but I feel like I&#39;m missing out a bit not being at the hub.</p><hr/><p>I&#39;m not sure how much detail to include for each day. There are often other little tasks that I accomplished which I feel like would just add noise, so I think I&#39;ll stick to the relatively (as in, relative to myself) noteworthy things I did each day.</p><p>I attended the opening talks and meet and greets, taking notes where I could to help me remember details about those in batch and continuing from Fall 2. And I made sure to schedule myself for automatic coffee-chat and pair-programming matches!</p><p>I spent some time collecting my thoughts and trying to narrow my focus for the batch. I decided by the end of the day that since I&#39;ve been playing a lot of solitaire (specifically, the <em>Zachlike Solitaire Collection</em>), I should consider making a solitaire game-engine in Rust. This would enable me to deep-dive on the topic of solitaire and card game design, a sizeable field of study for 12-weeks with clearly defined boundaries.</p><p>I attended the <strong>Daily Checkin</strong> event to share what I had been working on and what my plans were for the rest of that day with others in real-time. I also made it a point to use the &#34;couches&#34; Zoom room to work on some low-stakes tasks (like writing in my Obsidian vault) and made it known that I would be there. This resulted in three others joining and chatting about a range of topics. I didn&#39;t participate too much in the conversation (out of not really having anything to contribute) but it was nice to just be around others while idly listening to their conversation.</p><p>I made a choice not to attend the start of batch pairing workshop to accomplish a time-sensitive (but avoidable) task, and I regretted it. In my head I thought that since I was somewhat experienced with pair-programming it would be okay to skip. But I realized immediately after that it would have been a great opportunity to work closely with someone from my batch and lend what little knowledge I had to improve their experience.</p><p>I attended <strong>Daily Checkin</strong> again and volunteered to host the next one as the person hosting had been hosting them for a while!</p><p>I had a reasonable number of intentions for the day but a lot of them fell flat. I had regrets of the day prior fresh in my mind and was getting a little overwhelmed by how the majority of those in my batch seemed to be really connecting with one-another, where I felt like through poor choices I had barely given myself the chance. This compounded with today being the day those near <em>The Hub</em> in Brooklyn, NY invited to tour the space and settle-in, I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t feeling a bit jealous!</p><p>This all put me in a bit of a funk and I sat with it for far too long. Later, I knew that I should have just gone for a walk to clear my head. But it was a little too late by then. I at least was able to catch the latter half of <strong>Non-programming Talks</strong> (a wonderful tradition at RC).</p><p>I really made it a point to leave the funk of the day prior behind by throwing myself into (slightly too many) activities on this day. I hosted <strong>Daily Checkin</strong>, paired on a project I had started outside of the batch (<a href="https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/zulipsis">zulipsis</a>), had a coffee-chat with a batch-mate, attended a recurring event called <strong>Tool Talk Time</strong> and shared some (cli) tools I&#39;ve found useful (no, it wasn&#39;t <a href="https://veryth.ink/blog/how-i-track-my-time"><code>timew</code></a>), and finally attended <strong>Weekly Presentations</strong>.</p><p>I was too tired to get much else done, but I signed-off feeling satisfied with my day.</p><p>This day was cut short due to some external obligations, but I was able to host <strong>Daily Checkin</strong> again and tune-in for the <strong>Game Engine Interest Group</strong>. After sharing what my goals were with more experienced game-developers, I started getting the impression that maybe my goals of designing a game-engine right out of the gate might be a little too ambitious. But we&#39;ll see, perhaps I can still work on a game engine, but on a toy-scale.</p><p>Overall, it was an okay first week! I think I expected it to go better than it did, but I&#39;m happy I took control and threw myself back into it when I did. I&#39;m a little bummed to not be making it to <em>The Hub</em>, again, it definitely feels different than my last batch (S1&#39;21) as everyone was in the same boat and trying to come up with creative ways to bridge the divide. But I&#39;m going to make the best of what I&#39;ve got and try to compensate for not being physically present by attending more social events and perhaps making it a point to bond with the other strictly/mostly virtual attendees. I&#39;m looking forward to the next week as I begin to focus more on writing code to start making tangible progress toward my batch goals.</p></section></div>
