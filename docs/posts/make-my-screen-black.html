<h2>Why make my screen black</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>Save energy</p>
<p>Making your screen all black saves energy. This is especially true on OLED screens, where black pixels actually turn off.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As a prank</p>
<p>You can use this as a prank to pretend like the device is dead.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Check for dead pixels</p>
<p>A completely black screen makes it easier to spot dead pixels.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Stealth mode</p>
<p>When you&#39;re in a dark room and you want to temporarily switch off the display light, this can be easier than putting your device into standby mode.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Meditation</p>
<p>You can use this to meditate. Feel free to play your favorite meditation song while you&#39;re at it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Better than standby mode</p>
<p>You get most of the benefits of being in standby mode, with your apps still running in the background.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Check if screen is OLED</p>
<p>You can use this to check if your screen is an OLED one, as OLED screens don&#39;t emit light when set to black.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Use screen as mirror</p>
<p>Need to see who&#39;s behind you? A black screen can help you see reflections. Works better on glossy displays.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>See the dust</p>
<p>Need to clean your screen, but don&#39;t want to turn it off? This will help you see all those dust particles.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Because it&#39;s cool</p>
<p>Impress your friends - or just use it to stay stylish. Black will never go out of fashion.</p>
