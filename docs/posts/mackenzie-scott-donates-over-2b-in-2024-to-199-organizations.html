    <p>I love words, and this year this one has been on my mind a lot. It’s another one that seems to have undergone a kind of semantic shriveling. </p><p>On the list of its big, beautiful, original definitions? To devote resources for a useful purpose. To endow with rights. To clothe.</p><p>This morning with the help of my team, I uploaded information about $2,004,400,000 in gifts to the 199 organizations below. Roughly 75% of them are non-profits that support the economic security and opportunity of people who are struggling by improving access to affordable housing, jobs that provide stability for themselves and their families, child development and post-secondary education, healthcare, and financial counseling, business coaching, and low-interest rate loans focused on increasing economic potential and building wealth. The others support well-being through other means, such as work on human rights and natural resources conservation.</p><p>In a related project, I’ve asked the investment team helping me manage the assets I’m working to give away to source funds and companies focused on for-profit solutions to these challenges. Affordable housing funds increasing household resilience by partnering with local community organizations; women-focused digital health platforms; culturally-sensitive teletherapy for underserved communities. When I make gifts, rather than withdrawing funds from a bank account, or from a stock portfolio that increases the wealth and influence of leaders who already have it, I’d like to withdraw them from a portfolio of investments in mission-aligned ventures, with leaders from the populations they are serving, or from generally undercapitalized groups like women and people of color. In this way, the money can help address these issues twice, first by advancing economic mobility and unlocking the innovation and social benefit that comes from incorporating diverse needs and perspectives in the world being constructed around us, and next in the hands of experienced non-profit teams creating value through their transformative models of care and change. </p><p>The gratitude I feel to these non-profits, to these funds and companies, and to the people helping me give these assets away is similar. I’m inspired by all the ways people invest in each other.</p><p>See these <a href="https://yieldgiving.com/gifts?essay=20241218" rel="noopener noreferrer">gifts</a></p>
