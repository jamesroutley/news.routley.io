    <h1>Ask HN: Any solo game developers here?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN,</p><p>I&#39;m a full time game developer fifteen months into creating my city builder game. It&#39;s a lonely journey so I put together a very small group of other solo game developers.</p><p>We meet up every week (currently Tuesday nights, EST) to relate to the struggle, hang out, and sometimes rotate one person who presents for the night (they can teach or talk about anything game dev related, including their game). It&#39;s been a success and motivating for all involved. There&#39;s also a second group that meets on Thursday&#39;s, but this group is currently full. There&#39;s about 10 total people on the Discord server.</p><p>I&#39;m looking to add 2 people to the group who can commit to weekly meetups. You must be working on your game full time. Must be serious about finishing/releasing your game.</p><p>About the group:</p><p>We are late 20s - 30s and serious about releasing our respective games. We are pretty open and honest with each other, and will question each other/provide feedback freely.</p><p>About our games:</p><p>My game: Metropolis 1998</p><p>Person #2 Game: Basketball GM</p><p>Person #3 Games: 9001 and It Usually Ends In Nuclear War</p><p>Other people&#39;s game on the server who can publicly share:</p><p>Drift</p><p>Reisha Falls</p><p>Email is in profile</p></div></div></div>
