    <h1>Thoughts on corporate life.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been around 5 months since I joined the corporate workforce of America. Obviously, as many of its members I have very mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I’m happy to have a source of income and the ability to afford basic needs and a decent lifestyle. It also gives me the satisfaction of reaching personal career goals. On another hand, I have to do and say shit like happy Monday. Lol. No, in all seriousness, on another hand, I feel like these corporate jobs just suck your soul out. I feel like it makes me and everyone around very neutral and bland. Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? Is there another way to live? Who knows, and certainly, I don’t. Many people don’t even realize that this is happening or they are strong enough to keep their personality intact. But as a foreigner, I felt the need to adapt and I maybe adapted too much.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when I ask myself questions like what do I like to do or what are my hobbies I struggle to come up with a human answer. I hope I had dreams and goals and aspirations, and it would have been nice to remember them. But I understand the necessity for everyone to behave in a similar, predictable and interpretable way. Otherwise, it would be hard to operate and reach agreements in such a diverse workforce as here. Perhaps, this is one of the reasons why US corporate life is so different compared to Asian or European counterparts. Having worked in both, I guess I can see how in mono-cultures it’s easier for people to understand each other. This means they can afford to be less bland to avoid being misunderstood. And this is just my opinion, but it also feels like work friendships are stronger when you can freely express your thoughts and make any number of dark jokes.</p>
<p>Anyway, the overall corporate experience seems to be very confusing and hard to balance: you have to be firm enough to put your ideas forward with your will, but also flexible enough to adapt to different leadership styles and work situations. I can also blame parts of my confusion on my middle-level experience both work-wise and duration-wise, and partly on the female Asian obedience instincts that always and quietly whisper me to be softer. I don’t know if this is similar to other people’s experiences or even what to do with this. I just needed to put my thoughts into writing to, ironically, clean the slate. And maybe also to have a little bit of proof that I still have the ability to express non-neutral thoughts.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this and I’ll try to do more writing in the future with the things I learned in the freelance or corporate data/software worlds.</p>
