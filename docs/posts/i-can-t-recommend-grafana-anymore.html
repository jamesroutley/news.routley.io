    <h1>I can&#39;t recommend Grafana anymore</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><i></i> Published: 14/11/2025 </p><hr/><blockquote><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> This tells my personal experiences with Grafana products. It also incudes some facts but your experience may entirely vary and I would love to here your take.</p></blockquote><hr/><p>I started my work life at a small software company near my university. They develop, run websites and operate web services for multiple clients. Everyone had multiple responsibilities, and they heavily relied on interns and freshmen—which can be both bad and good.</p><p>At some point we needed a monitoring solution, and Zabbix didn’t fit well into the new and declarative world of containers and Docker. I was tasked to find a solution. I looked at Loki/Prometheus with Grafana and Elastic with Kibana. Elastic was a beast! Heavy, hard to run, resource-hungry, and complex, Loki and Prometheus were the perfect fit back then.</p><p>So I created a <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> with Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. Since they all had the internal Docker network, we required no auth between them. Grafana was only exposed over an SSH tunnel. One static scrape config and the Docker Loki log plugin later, we had our observability stack. For non-Docker logs, we used Promtail. Loki and Prometheus stayed on the same machine and all we required was a local volume mount. Load was minimal.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ This is when I learned that you should not transform every log parameter to an label just to make it easier to select in the Grafana UI. Having a label for latency with basically limitless values will fill every disks inodes, thats just how Cortex bin-packs.</p></blockquote><p>I also found out Grafana Labs has a cloud offering with a nice free tier. So I even used this for personal stuff. I had a good experience with them.</p><p>Time goes on, and I switched jobs. Now we have Kubernetes.</p><p>Time goes on, and Grafana changed the Grafana Agent setup to Grafana Agent Flow Mode—some adjustments, but okay - software changes. And man, did Grafana like to change things.</p><p>They started to build their own observability platform to steal some of DataDogs customers. They created Grafana OnCall their own notification system. Not only that, but they heavily invested in Helm charts and general starter templates. Basically two commands to install the metric/log shippers and use Grafana Cloud. And even when you don’t want or can’t use Grafana Cloud, here are the Helm charts to install Mimir/Loki/Tempo. To make things even easier, let’s all put it in an umbrella chart (it renders to 6k lines in the default state). Or use their Grafana Operator to manage Grafana installs - or at least parts of it.</p><p>As many may have experienced, software maintenance shows with age.</p><p>On the same day they deprecated the Grafana Agent, they announced Grafana Alloy. The all in one replacement. It can do Logs, Metrics, Traces (zipkin &amp; jaeger) and OTEL. The solution for everything!</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ They choose to use their own configuration language for alloy. Something that looks like HCL. I can understand why thy didn’t want to use YAML but I’m still not a fan of this. Not everything needs their own DSL.</p></blockquote><p>Happy End, right?  - Not quite</p><p>But I got it all working; now I can finally stop explaining to my boss why we need to re-structure the monitoring stack every year.</p><p>Grafana just released Mimir 3.0. They re-architected the ingestion logic for scalability, and now they use a message broker. Yes, Mimir in version 3.0 needs Apache Kafka to work.</p><p>I want stability for my monitoring; I want it boring, and that’s something Grafana is not offering.   It seems like the pace within Grafana is way too fast for many companies, and I know for a fact that that pace is partially driven by career-driven development. There are some smart people at Grafana but not every customer is smart nor has the capacity to make Grafana their priority number one. Complexity kills - we’ve seen this.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ Don’t get me wrong. Mimir, Loki and Grafana are technically really good software products and I (mostly) still like them but it’s the way these products are managed which makes me question them.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes I wonder how I would see this if I had chosen the ELK stack at my first job. I also wonder if the OpenShift approach (kube-prometheus-stack) with Thanos for long-term storage is the most time-stable solution.   I just hope OTEL settles, gets stable and boring fast, and just lets me pick whatever I want for my backend. Because right now I’m done with monitoring. I just want to support our application and do not want to revisit the monitoring setup every x weeks, because monitoring is a necessity—not the product. At least for most companies.</p></article></div>
