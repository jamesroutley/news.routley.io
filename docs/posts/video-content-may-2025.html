<p>To aid discovery I will give an overview of the 10 synthesizer videos I produced in May.</p>

<h2>Oberheim Xpander FM exploration</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11MKJkpqzwQ">Youtube 10:32</a></p>

<p>My first synthesizer demonstration video on Youtube! A sound design exploration of FM synthesis on the Oberheim Xpander. Somewhat unusually, I&#39;m using the filter as the carrier oscillator instead of VCO1. The designers of the instrument made a big deal of how hard it was to get linear FM from VCO2 to VCO1 working, but I think I prefer the sound of exponential FM from VCO2 to the VCF.</p>

<h2>Oberheim Xpander sawtooth pad</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7eaDSWgV68">Youtube 7:31</a></p>

<p>Another video with the Xpander. Sound designing  basic pad sound, with an eye to some of the subtle modulation possibilities of the Xpander.</p>

<p>The result is a very typical synth sound but I was pleased with how good it sounded.</p>

<h2>CrowBX PWM fun</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPHPeUP2-TU">Youtube 8:45</a></p>

<p>Exploring audio-rate pulse-width modulation on the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tags/crowbx.html">CrowBX</a>. A unique DIY instrument I built myself.</p>

<h2>MA-35 drum distortion</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PUIk942WTA">Youtube    1:39</a></p>

<p>I tried something different here; I recorded a small snippet of sound of a song I was working on. I didn&#39;t finish this song but I liked the distortion sound I made with the filter.</p>

<h2>Nonlinear Labs C15 - quick Karplus-Strong sound design</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm5hMbnxXt8">Youtube 3:07</a></p>

<p>The C15 is a bit of a niche instrument. I want to get better at programming it. What better way than to record a demonstration video?
One of the techniques implemented in this machine is  Karplus-Strong synthesis. The C15 makes this really easy because the comb filter is perfectly in tune with the default settings.</p>

<h2>Yamaha TX16W with AdventureKid waveforms</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGltwzNnEQ8">Youtube 4:11</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve blogged about this project <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tags/tx16w.html">previously</a> so I thought it would be nice to also show how it sounds in video form.</p>

<h2>Kurzweil K2000 FM synthesis</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WbLVceGh3I">Youtube 5:48</a></p>

<p>I have previously written about the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/0030-music-notes/#k2000">sneaky way the K2000 lets you do FM synthesis</a>. This video shows how it works.</p>

<h2>Kurzweil K2000 exponential envelopes via FUN</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6ZOTLFBCa8">Youtube 3:09</a></p>

<p>The envelope generators on the K2000 don&#39;t always sound great. I&#39;m starting to realize that is because they use linear slopes. You can create exponential slopes if you use the &#34;FUN&#34; function generators instead.</p>

<h2>Kurzweil K2000 digital synthesis</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrf8VoQXN8">Youtube 9:15</a></p>

<p>A demonstration of some other creative synthesis possibilities on the K2000. First I show how you can use the DSP engine to create a pulse-width modulation (PWM) sound, which is something these rom playback synths struggle with. The K2000 is much more than a rompler.</p>

<p>After the PWM I try out the &#34;WRAP&#34; DSP function which creates harsh digital noise. It reminds me a little of Noise Engineering  modules like <a href="https://noiseengineering.us/products/basimilus-iteritas-alter/">Basimilus Iteritas Alter</a> or <a href="https://noiseengineering.us/products/loquelic-iteritas/">Loquelic Iteritas</a>.</p>

<h2>Yamaha DX11 synth bass</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51SfSJQII8g">Youtube 5:15</a></p>

<p>A demonstration of how easy it is to make synth bass sounds on the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tags/dx11.html">DX11</a>. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m particularly good at FM synthesis but I know enough to make sounds I like.</p>

<p>I was trying to do the opposite of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XbrTC0NndM">this video</a> from Synthesizer Keith where he first gives a lecture on a white board before he sits down to program  a DX11 bass sound. What I wanted to show in this video is that you can also approach the instrument with an exploratory mindset and go by feel.</p>

<h2>Yamaha DX11 coarse pitch ratios</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBMxRyqmIeA">Youtube 6:15</a></p>

<p>Pedantically, this video is not from May 2025. I&#39;ve been <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/0050-fm-pitch-ratios/">trying to make sense of the pitch ratios on the DX11</a> and I thought I&#39;d also record a video.</p>
