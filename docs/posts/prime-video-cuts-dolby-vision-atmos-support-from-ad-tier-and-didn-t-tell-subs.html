<p>On January 29, Amazon started showing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-jacks-up-price-of-ad-free-prime-video-by-2-99-starting-in-2024/">ads to Prime Video subscribers</a> in the US unless they pay an additional $2.99 per month. But this wasn&#39;t the only change to the service. Those who don&#39;t pay up also lose features; their accounts no longer support Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>As noticed by German tech outlet <a href="https://www.4kfilme.de/amazon-prime-video-entfernt-dolby-atmos-und-dolby-vision-im-werbefinanzierten-abo/">4K Filme</a> on Sunday, Prime Video users who choose to sit through ads can no longer use Dolby Vision or Atmos while streaming. Ad-tier subscribers are limited to HDR10+ and Dolby Digital 5.1.</p>
<p>4K Filme confirmed that this was the case on TVs from both LG and Sony; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2024/02/11/amazon-prime-videos-new-ads-based-subscription-has-a-surprise/?sh=b2396657cd51">Forbes</a> also confirmed the news using a <a href="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65c8ed7ffc888dc89a418c08/AmazonStoryJackRyanPics/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&amp;width=1440">TCL TV</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;In the ads-free account, the TV throws up its own confirmation boxes to say that the show is playing in Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos. In the basic, with-ads account, however, the TV’s Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos pop-up boxes remain stubbornly absent,&#34; Forbes said.</p>
<p>Amazon hasn&#39;t explained its reasoning for the feature removal, but it may be trying to cut back on licensing fees paid to Dolby Laboratories. Amazon may also hope to push HDR10+, a Dolby Vision competitor that&#39;s free and open. It also remains possible that we could one day see the return of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to the ad tier through a refreshed licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Amazon has had a back-and-forth history with supporting Dolby features. In 2016, it first made Dolby Vision available on Prime Video. In 2017, though, Prime Video stopped supporting the format in favor of HDR10+. Amazon announced the HDR10+ format alongside Samsung, and it subsequently made the entire Prime Video library available in HDR10+. But in 2022, Prime Video started offering content like <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/amazon-tries-to-take-over-pirate-sites-that-sold-dvd-copies-of-rings-of-power/">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</a></em> in Dolby Vision once again.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Amazon wasn’t upfront about removals</h2>
<p>Amazon announced in September 2023 that it would run ads on Prime Video accounts in 2024; in December, Amazon confirmed that the ads would start <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/youll-be-paying-extra-for-ad-free-prime-video-come-january/">running on January 29</a> unless subscribers paid extra. In the interim, Amazon failed to mention that it was also removing support for Dolby Vision and Atmos from the ad-supported tier.</p>
<p>Forbes first reported on Prime Video&#39;s ad-based tier not supporting Dolby Vision and Atmos by assuming that it was a technical error. Not until after Forbes published its article did Amazon officially confirm the changes. That&#39;s not how people subscribing to a tech giant&#39;s service expect to learn about a diminishing of their current plan.</p>
<p>It also seems that Amazon&#39;s removal of the Dolby features has been done in such a way that it could lead some users to think they&#39;re getting Dolby Vision and Atmos support even when they&#39;re not.</p>
<p>As Forbes&#39; John Archer reported, &#34;To add a bit of confusion to the mix, on the TCL TV I used, the Prime Video header information for the<em> Jack Ryan</em> show that appears on the with-ads basic account shows Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos among the supported technical features—yet when you start to play the episode, neither feature is delivered to the TV.&#34;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/new-streaming-app-from-fox-disney-wbd-is-about-more-than-sports/">streaming services</a> overtake traditional media, many customers are growing increasingly discouraged by how the industry seems to be evolving into something strongly reminiscent of cable. While there are some aspects of old-school TV <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24070601/super-bowl-streaming-delay-spoilers">worth emulating</a>, others—like confusing plans that don’t make it clear what you get with each package—are not.</p>
<p>Amazon didn&#39;t respond to questions Ars Technica sent in time for publication, but we&#39;ll update this story if we hear back.</p>
