    <h1>Do we think of git commits as diffs, snapshots, and/or histories?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! I’ve been extremely slowly trying to figure how to explain every core
concept in Git (commits! branches! remotes! the staging area!) and commits have
been surprisingly tricky.</p>

<p>Understanding how git commits are implemented feels pretty straightforward to
me (those are facts! I can look it up!), but it’s been much harder to figure
out how other people think about commits. So like I’ve been doing a lot
recently, I went on Mastodon and started asking some questions.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-people-think-about-git-commits">how do people think about Git commits?</h3>

<p>I did a <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/111563158717698550">highly unscientific poll</a> on Mastodon about how people think about Git
commits: is it a snapshot? is it a diff? is it a list of every previous commit?
(Of course it’s legitimate to think about it as all three, but I was curious
about the <em>primary</em> way people think about Git commits). Here it is:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/git-commit-poll.png"/></p>

<p>The results were:</p>

<ul>
<li>51% diff</li>
<li>42% snapshot</li>
<li>4% history of every previous commit</li>
<li>3% “other”</li>
</ul>

<p>I was really surprised that it was so evenly split between diffs and snapshots.
People also made some interesting kind of contradictory statements like “in my
mind a commit is a diff, but I think it’s actually implemented as a snapshot”
and “in my mind a commit is a snapshot, but I think it’s actually implemented
as a diff”. We’ll talk more about how a commit is actually implemented later in
the post.</p>

<p>Before we go any further: when we say “a diff” or “a snapshot”, what does that
mean?</p>

<h3 id="what-s-a-diff">what’s a diff?</h3>

<p>What I mean by a diff is probably obvious: it’s what you get when you run <code>git show
COMMIT_ID</code>. For example here’s a typo fix from rbspy:</p>

<pre><code>diff --git a/src/ui/summary.rs b/src/ui/summary.rs

<p>You can see it on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/commit/24ad81d2439f9e63dd91cc1126ca1bb5d3a4da5b">https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/commit/24ad81d2439f9e63dd91cc1126ca1bb5d3a4da5b</a></p>

<h3 id="what-s-a-snapshot">what’s a snapshot?</h3>

<p>When I say “a snapshot”, what I mean is “all the files that you get when you
run <code>git checkout COMMIT_ID</code>”.</p>

<p>Git often calls the list of files for a commit a “tree” (as in “directory
tree”), and you can see all of the files for the above example commit here on
GitHub:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/tree/24ad81d2439f9e63dd91cc1126ca1bb5d3a4da5b">https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/tree/24ad81d2439f9e63dd91cc1126ca1bb5d3a4da5b</a> (it’s <code>/tree/</code> instead of <code>/commit/</code>)</p>

<h3 id="is-how-git-implements-it-really-the-right-way-to-explain-it">is “how Git implements it” really the right way to explain it?</h3>

<p>Probably the most common piece of advice I hear related to learning Git is
“just learn how Git represents things internally, and everything will make
sense”. I obviously find this perspective extremely appealing (if you’ve spent
any time reading this blog, you know I <em>love</em> thinking about how things are
implemented internally).</p>

<p>But as a strategy for teaching Git, it hasn’t been as successful as I’d hoped!
Often I’ve eagerly started explaining “okay, so git commits are snapshots with
a pointer to their parent, and then a branch is a pointer to a commit, and…“,
but the person I’m trying to help will tell me that they didn’t really find
that explanation that useful at all and they still don’t get it. So I’ve been
considering other options.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about the internals a bit anyway though.</p>

<h3 id="how-git-represents-commits-internally-snapshots">how git represents commits internally: snapshots</h3>

<p>Internally, git represents commits as snapshots (it stores the “tree” of the
current version of every file). I wrote about this in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/09/14/in-a-git-repository--where-do-your-files-live-/">In a git repository, where do your files live?</a>,
but here’s a very quick summary of what the internal format looks like.</p>

<p>Here’s how a commit is represented:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p 24ad81d2439f9e63dd91cc1126ca1bb5d3a4da5b
tree e197a79bef523842c91ee06fa19a51446975ec35

committer Adam Jensen &lt;adam@acj.sh&gt; 1672104890 -0500

<p>and here’s what we get when we look at this tree object: a list of every file /
subdirectory in the repository’s root directory as of that commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p e197a79bef523842c91ee06fa19a51446975ec35

</code></pre>

<p>What this means is that checking out a Git commit is always fast: it’s just as
easy for Git to check out a commit from yesterday as it is to check out a
commit from 1 million commits ago. Git never has to replay 10000 diffs to
figure out the current state or anything, because commits just aren’t stored as
diffs.</p>

<h3 id="snapshots-are-compressed-using-packfiles">snapshots are compressed using packfiles</h3>

<p>I just said that Git commits are snapshots, but when someone says “I think of
git commits as a snapshot, but I think internally they’re actually diffs”,
that’s actually kind of true too! Git commits are not represented as diffs in
the sense you’re probably used to (they’re not represented on disk as a diff
from the previous commit), but the basic intuition that if you’re editing a
10,000 lines 500 times, it would be inefficient to store 500 copies of that
file is right.</p>

<p>Git does have a way of storing files as differences from other ways. This is
called “packfiles” and periodically git will do a garbage collection and
compress your data into packfiles to save disk space. When you <code>git clone</code> a
repository git will also compress the data.</p>

<p>I don’t have space for a full explanation of how packfiles work in this post
(Aditya Mukerjee’s <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/unpacking-git-packfiles">Unpacking Git packfiles</a>
is my favourite writeup of how they work). But here’s a quick summary of my
understanding of how deltas work and how they’re different from diffs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Objects are stored as a reference to an “original file”, plus a “delta”</li>
<li>the delta has a bunch of instructions like “read bytes 0 to 100, then insert bytes ‘hello there’, then read bytes 120 to 200”. It cobbles together bytes from the original plus new text. So there’s no notion of “deletions”, just copies and additions.</li>
<li>I think there are less layers of deltas: I don’t know how to actually check how many layers of deltas Git actually had to go through to get a given object, but my impression is that it usually isn’t very many. Probably less than 10? I’d love to know how to actually find this out though.</li>
<li>The “original file” isn’t necessarily from the previous commit, it could be anything. Maybe it could even be from a later commit? I’m not sure about that.</li>
<li>There’s no “right” algorithm for how to compute deltas, Git just has some approximate heuristics</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-actually-happens-when-you-do-a-diff-is-kind-of-weird">what actually happens when you do a diff is kind of weird</h3>

<p>When I run <code>git show SOME_COMMIT</code> to look at the diff for a commit, what
actually happens is kind of counterintuitive. My understanding is:</p>

<ol>
<li>git looks in the packfiles and applies deltas to reconstruct the tree for that commit and for its parent.</li>
<li>git diffs the two directory trees (the current commit’s tree, and the parent commit’s tree). Usually this is pretty fast because almost all of
the files are exactly the same, so git can just compare the hashes of the identical files and do nothing almost all of the time.</li>
<li>finally git shows me the diff</li>
</ol>

<p>So it takes deltas, turns them into a snapshot, and then calculates a diff. It
feels a little weird because it starts with a diff-like-thing and ends up with
another diff-like-thing, but the deltas and diffs are actually totally
different so it makes sense.</p>

<p>That said, the way I think of it is that git stores commits as snapshots and
packfiles are just an implementation detail to save disk space and make clones
faster. I’ve never actually needed to know how packfiles work for any practical
reason, but it does help me understand how it’s <em>possible</em> for git commits to
be snapshots without using way too much disk space.</p>

<h3 id="a-wrong-mental-model-for-git-commits-are-diffs">a “wrong” mental model for git: commits are diffs</h3>

<p>I think a pretty common “wrong” mental model for Git is:</p>

<ul>
<li>commits are stored as diffs from the previous commit (plus a pointer to the parent commit(s) and an author and message).</li>
<li>to get the current state for a commit, Git starts at the beginning and
replays all the previous commits</li>
</ul>

<p>This model is obviously not <strong>true</strong> (in real life, commits are stored as
snapshots, and diffs are calculated from those snapshots), but it seems very
useful and coherent to me! It gets a little weird with merge commits, but maybe
you just say it’s stored as a diff from the first parent of the merge.</p>

<p>I think wrong mental models are often extremely useful, and this one doesn’t
seem very problematic to me for every day Git usage. I really like that it
makes the thing that we deal with the most often (the diff) the most
fundamental – it seems really intuitive to me.</p>

<p>I’ve also been thinking about other “wrong” mental models you can have about
Git which seem pretty useful like:</p>

<ul>
<li>commit messages can be edited (they can’t really, actually you make a copy of the commit with a new message, and the old commit continues to exist)</li>
<li>commits can be moved to have a different base (similarly, they’re copied)</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like there’s a whole very coherent “wrong” set of ideas you can have
about git that are pretty well supported by Git’s UI and not very problematic
most of the time. I think it can get messy when you want to undo a change or
when something goes wrong though.</p>

<h3 id="some-advantages-of-commit-as-diff">some advantages of “commit as diff”</h3>

<p>Personally even though I know that in Git commits are snapshots, I probably think of them as diffs most of the time, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>most of the time I’m concerned with the <strong>change</strong> I’m making – if I’m just
changing 1 line of code, obviously I’m mostly thinking about just that 1 line
of code and not the entire current state of the codebase</li>
<li>when you click on a Git commit on GitHub or use <code>git show</code>, you see the diff, so it’s just what I’m used to seeing</li>
<li>I use rebase a lot, which is all about replaying diffs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-advantages-of-commit-as-snapshot">some advantages of “commit as snapshot”</h3>

<p>I also think about commits as snapshots sometimes though, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>git often gets confused about file moves: sometimes if I move a file and edit
it, Git can’t recognize that it was moved and instead will show it as
“deleted old.py, added new.py”. This is because git only stores snapshots, so
when it says “moved old.py -&gt; new.py”, it’s just guessing because the
contents of <code>old.py</code> and <code>new.py</code> are similar.</li>
<li>it’s conceptually much easier to think about what <code>git checkout COMMIT_ID</code> is doing (the idea of replaying 10000 commits just feels stressful to me)</li>
<li>merge commits kind of make more sense to me as snapshots, because the merged
commit can actually be literally anything (it’s just a new snapshot!). It
helps me understand why you can make arbitrary changes when you’re resolving
a merge conflict, and why it’s so important to be careful about conflict
resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-other-ways-to-think-about-commits">some other ways to think about commits</h3>

<p>Some folks in the Mastodon replies also mentioned:</p>

<ul>
<li>“extra” out-of-band information about the commit, like an email or a GitHub pull request or just a conversation you had with a coworker</li>
<li>thinking about a diff as a “before state + after state”</li>
<li>and of course, that lots of people think of commits in lots of different ways depending on the situation</li>
</ul>

<p>some other words people use to talk about commits might be less ambiguous:</p>

<ul>
<li>“revision” (seems more like a snapshot)</li>
<li>“patch” (seems more like a diff)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="that-s-all-for-now">that’s all for now!</h3>

<p>It’s been very difficult for me to get a sense of what different mental models
people have for git. It’s especially tricky because people get really into
policing “wrong” mental models even though those “wrong” models are often
really useful, so folks are reluctant to share their “wrong” ideas for fear of
some Git Explainer coming out of the woodwork to explain to them why they’re
Wrong. (these Git Explainers are often well-intentioned, but it still has a chilling effect either way)</p>

<p>But I’ve been learning a lot! I still don’t feel totally clear about how I want to
talk about commits, but we’ll get there eventually.</p>

<p>Thanks to Marco Rogers, Marie Flanagan, and everyone on Mastodon for talking to
me about git commits.</p>
