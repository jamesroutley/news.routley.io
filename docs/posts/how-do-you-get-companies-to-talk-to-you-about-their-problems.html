    <h1>Ask HN: How do you get companies to talk to you about their problems?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I do product development for a team that&#39;s creating solutions for life sciences &amp; pharmaceutical companies that work with real-world data. This is a new industry vertical for us, so we don&#39;t have a bunch of existing customers we can go interview to understand what to build.</p><p>It&#39;s already a reasonably crowded space, but the few pharma teams we&#39;ve talked to express frustration with the speed and price of existing offerings. That said, I need much, much more information from users of existing offerings in our space to be able to form a product strategy that I have strong conviction in.</p><p>I was reading Airbyte&#39;s company handbook[1] the other day, and it mentioned the co-founders did 45 discovery calls with customers using existing ELT tools in 3 months! I would kill for that kind of access to teams in our target market.</p><p><i>How did they do that?</i> Is that just the power of the YC network, or is there something I&#39;m overlooking? My background is not in sales or BizDev, but I can pick up that skillset (or hire for it) to get these calls. Should I just start finding people in the pharma space, add them on LinkedIn, and request an informational interview? Are healthcare conferences good for getting these kinds of calls?</p><p>Open to any advice or guidance - thank you!</p><p>[1] https://handbook.airbyte.com/company/our-story (Fantastic doc, BTW)</p></div></div></div>
