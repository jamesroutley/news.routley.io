That means all the Pfizer vaccine data should be public by the end of the summer rather than, say, the year 2097.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Even if the FDA may not see it this way, I think Pittman did the agency — and the country — a big favor by expediting the document production.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">I’ve been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/well-all-be-dead-before-fda-releases-full-covid-vaccine-record-plaintiffs-say-2021-12-13" target="_blank">chronicling this fight</a> since November and have heard from of readers who said they felt something was suspicious, even nefarious, in the FDA’s proposed slo-mo timeline. Making the information public as soon as possible may help assuage the concerns of vaccine skeptics and convince them the product is safe.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Pittman in his order nodded to this as well, including a quote from the late senator John McCain, who said that excessive administrative secrecy “feeds conspiracy theories and reduces the public’s confidence in the government.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Still, the FDA is likely to be hard-pressed to process 55,000 pages a month.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The office that reviews FOIA requests has just 10 employees, according to a declaration filed with the court by Suzann Burk, who heads the FDA’s Division of Disclosure and Oversight Management. Burk said it takes eight minutes a page for a worker “to perform a careful line-by-line, word-by-word review of all responsive records before producing them in response to a FOIA request.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">At that rate, the 10 employees would have to work non-stop 24 hours a day, seven days a week to produce the 55,000 pages a month (and would still fall a bit short).</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">But as lawyers for the plaintiffs Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency pointed out in <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gdvzymjqrpw/FDA%20FOIA%20plaintiff%20brief.pdf" target="_blank">court papers</a>, the FDA as of 2020 had 18,062 employees. Surely some can be dispatched to pitch in at the FOIA office.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">Aaron Siri of Siri &amp; Glimstad, who represents the plaintiffs, in an email said the decision &#34;came down on the side of transparency and accountability.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">His clients — a group that includes more than 200 doctors, scientists, professors and public health professionals, including some who have publicly questioned the efficacy of lockdown policies, mask mandates and the vaccine itself — have pledged to publish all the information they receive from the FDA on their website.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">The Justice Department, which represented the FDA in the litigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday evening. Pfizer, not a party to the suit, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">Pittman in his order made clear that the FOIA request, even if burdensome, has to be a priority for the FDA.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">Quoting from remarks made during the hearing before him on December 14, he wrote that “there may not be a ‘more important issue at the Food and Drug Administration . . . than the pandemic, the Pfizer vaccine, getting every American vaccinated,&#34; and assuring the public that the vaccine was not &#34;&#39;rush[ed] on behalf of the United States.&#39;&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">Read more:</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/wait-what-fda-wants-55-years-process-foia-request-over-vaccine-data-2021-11-18" target="_blank">Wait what?
