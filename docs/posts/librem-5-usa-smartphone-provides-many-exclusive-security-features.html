    <h1>Librem 5 USA Smartphone Provides Many Exclusive Security Features</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In today’s connected world it is nearly impossible to purchase a secure smartphone that is made in America.</p><p>As a matter of fact the most popular smartphones on the market are made overseas such as the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smartphones.</p><p>However, Purism is manufacturing a secure smartphone, Librem 5 USA, that is manufactured in the United States for supply chain security purposes.</p><p>There are numerous security benefits provided by the Librem 5 USA that include:</p><ul><li>Secure supply chain centered on made in the USA electronics at Purism’s facility located in the USA</li><li>Device assembled in the USA</li><li>Publicly available schematics</li><li>The Liberm 5 USA is designed for security and privacy rather than for consumerism</li><li>Hardware isolation of components</li><li>Bootable from SD card</li><li>Removable radio modules</li><li>Replaceable lithium battery</li><li>Secure cryptographic removable smart card</li><li>Hardware kill switches put the product owner in full control over device</li><li>Private and secure operating system, PureOS</li><li>PureOS is fully open source and auditable for better security and privacy</li><li>No intrusive mystery proprietary code supporting surveillance and data mining apps or technologies</li><li>PureOS supports private and secure apps developed with fully auditable source code</li><li>Purism supports decentralized application developers centered on providing secure apps</li><li>Security and privacy protection by default</li><li>Librem 5 USA is supported by secure and private cellular service provided by Librem AweSIM</li><li>Purism offers anti-interdiction services to ensure devices are not altered in transit</li><li>Librem 5 USA supports true convergence with PC apps using a lapdock or mouse, keyboard, and monitor</li></ul><p>As you can see, the Librem 5 USA smartphone is purposely designed to enable the product owner to have full control over their device for the most secure and private experience in the world.</p><p>Purism does not employ predatory surveillance and data mining technologies unlike popular smartphones supported by the Apple iOS or Google’s Android OS.</p><p>The Librem 5 USA smartphone is developed for security and privacy rather than for consumerism separating our smartphones from the most popular smartphones on the market.</p><p>Other smartphone manufacturers and operating system developers enable intrusive app developers, including those from China and Russia, to surveil their paying customers while data mining highly confidential personal and business information from their customer to exploit for financial gain posing massive security and privacy threats to the customer, including the customer’s employer.</p><p>PureOS is designed to secure your confidential personal and business information rather than expose it to intrusive app developers who wish to exploit your confidential information for profits.</p><p>At Purism, we value you as our customer, not our product to exploit for financial gain at the expense of your security and privacy.</p><h2>Purism Products and Availability Chart</h2><table id="tablepress-46"><thead><tr><th> </th><th>Model</th><th>Status</th><th>Lead Time</th><th> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img
