    <h1>Ask HN: What 1980s/90s-era shareware did you purchase?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Shareware was a common software business model back in the 1980s and 90s, though it&#39;s rare (or not called that) nowadays. Even the legendary DOOM was shareware, with the first few missions for free and the later missions available for a nominal fee (a practice not uncommon for games at the time).</p><p>In the 90s i used perhaps half a dozen pieces of shareware with any regularity but only purchased three (in no particular order):</p><p>1) TheDraw - an ANSI/ASCII art editor, which i briefly used for creating animated screens for use with dial-up BBSes.</p><p>2) 4DOS/4NT was a command.com replacement for DOS/Windows which offered features such as the command-line editing available in all modern shells.</p><p>3) DOOM, which my two housemates chipped in to help buy. We played the hell out of it, multi-player on two 486/66&#39;s connected with a serial cable.</p><p>All of the purchases arrived via snail-mail, with TheDraw and DOOM on floppy disks and 4DOS on a CD. A couple weeks after buying it, one of my housemates took the DOOM disk(s?) to his father&#39;s place and ended up infecting it with a virus.</p><p>What shareware, if any, did you purchase back in the day (and what did you use it for)?</p><p>Edit: there was a 4th: WinRCS was a Windows front-end to the RCS version control system. It didn&#39;t get much use but it was my introduction to source code control.</p></div></div></div>
