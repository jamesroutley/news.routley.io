    <h1>Ask HN: I&#39;ve Built a DHT Torrent Sniffer and Search Engine. Should I Release?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Recently I was researching about DHTs and developed a DHT Sniffer in Go which connects to some known DHT Routers and sniffs all the annoucements.
I&#39;ve quickly added ZincSearch and it is now basically a search engine which can search for hashes, name or files contained in the torrents. It is able to index around 5-10k annoucements per second, so the index grows quite fast.</p><p>Now, I am thinking about releasing it as open-source for others to study, but not sure if I should, because it might be used for &#34;evil&#34;.</p></div></div></div>
