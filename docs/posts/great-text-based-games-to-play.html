    <h1>Ask HN: Great text based games to play?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I’m of a younger generation, and have seen a lot of references to text based games in popular media. Games where it gives you a prompt like “You are in a forest” and you can type things like “I climb a tree” or “I look around” and it responds to that.</p><p>I’d love to try one of these out. I have a modern computer so I’m guessing it’ll have to be emulated somehow, but what do you recommend as a great text based game to try? Like ones that really make you think and get creative</p></div></div></div>
