    <h1>Launch HN: Patched (YC S24) – AI workflows for post-code tasks</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN, we are Asankhaya and Rohan, founders of Patched (<a href="https://patched.codes">https://patched.codes</a>). We help dev teams accelerate tasks like code reviews, docs, and patches through customizable, self-hostable workflows. Here’s a quick video walkthrough: <a href="https://youtu.be/5hvWGB5avVo" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/5hvWGB5avVo</a></p><p>There is a lot of excitement around code generation and the development inner loop. But having built DevSecOps startups previously, we know how the bottlenecks developers face often occur in the “outer loop”, especially after the code is written. With Patched, we want to help code get shipped as fast as it is generated.</p><p>Patched has two core components.  First is the workflow builder that switches seamlessly between no-code and full-code. Second is the chat-based query interface for your code, logs, and issue tracker. When used together, they can help orchestrate and automate the most painful parts of the software development lifecycle.</p><p>Here is an example PR created by a patchflow that automates SDK generation with complex type information: <a href="https://github.com/stack-auth/stack/pull/300">https://github.com/stack-auth/stack/pull/300</a>.</p><p>Under the hood, Patched is powered by our patchwork library (<a href="https://github.com/patched-codes/patchwork">https://github.com/patched-codes/patchwork</a>) and an LLM optimization proxy(<a href="https://github.com/codelion/optillm">https://github.com/codelion/optillm</a>) - both of which we have open-sourced. You can run these workflows within your CI/CD pipeline, or from the command line, completely independent of our platform. This gives you full control without being locked in, while allowing us to build a monetizable product around it.</p><p>While there are some great point solutions for tackling individual tasks, we believe the real solution lies in an open, holistic approach—one that teams can tweak, extend, or self-host.</p><p>You can try Patched at <a href="https://app.patched.codes/signin">https://app.patched.codes/signin</a> - we’d love to hear your feedback on our approach and the user experience.</p></div></div></div>
