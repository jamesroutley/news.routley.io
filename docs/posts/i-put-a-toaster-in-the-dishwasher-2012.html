    <h1>I put a toaster in the dishwasher (2012)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anonymous, if you let it dry thoroughly, and plug it in under safe conditions (no flammables nearby, preferably outside on a large concrete slab, etc) it should be fun to find out!  After several days in the rain, it is likely to have some rust and other degradation, so I would do this very carefully, but I would do it. To speed drying and stop the rusting, you could preheat your oven to something low, say 200 degrees, then turn it off and put the toaster in the oven. Make sure you turn the oven off before putting the toaster in, and no higher than about 200, because the toaster has some plastic and rubber parts.  </p><p><span><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=867089453858920482&amp;postID=5520662929156291465">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></div>
