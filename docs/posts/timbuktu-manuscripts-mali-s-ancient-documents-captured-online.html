It was put together by Google, along with local and international partners.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It features a picture of the dance of the Dogon ethnic group. It also showcases art, such as that of award-winning Abdoulaye Konaté, and an image of builders plastering the Great Mosque of Djenné, a Unesco world heritage site about 500km (310 miles) south of Timbuktu.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Brian David Melnyk/ Google Arts and Culture</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Google Arts and Culture</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Google Art and Culture</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The ancient documents were originally written in medieval Arabic but have now been translated to English, French, Spanish and modern Arabic to make them more accessible, which Google Program Manager and Digital Archaeologist Chance Coughenour told the BBC was a first.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Making a digital record and copy of the manuscripts is very important and for the first time we&#39;re bringing the fruits of our labour after so many years,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For centuries Timbuktu was a cultural hub on the African continent, as well as an Islamic centre of learning. The city&#39;s mosques played a critical role in the spread of Islam throughout West Africa in the 15th and 16th Centuries, <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/119/">according to Unesco.</a></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Over the last seven years Mali&#39;s traditional leaders, historians and digital archaeologists have been hard at work to make sure that the ancient manuscripts, some dating back to the 11th Century, containing the country&#39;s rich history are preserved by digitising them. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The project presents an opportunity for people to learn from those who came before them, said Dr Haidara (below).</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Google Arts and Culture</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The digitising of these manuscripts began with a call to Google by Dr Haidara in 2014. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He invited the company to visit Mali to see the renowned manuscripts of Timbuktu and to learn the story of why they were at risk. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On arrival they found texts which included early Qurans and some with diverse topics including astronomy, maths and geography. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The team then had the task of not only going through hundreds of pages to make a digital record of these but to make them visually appealing online. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Up to 40,000 pages will now be available online, covering topics from biology to music. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Google Arts and Culture</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Google Arts and Culture</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is a project the people of Mali have kept their eyes on for many years since Islamist militants set fire to libraries in Timbuktu as they tried to destroy the priceless papers. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Over a period of six months, manuscripts were smuggled out of Timbuktu to Mali&#39;s capital Bamako, as time was running out to rescue and preserve the documents from near destruction. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>In 2016 an alleged member of an Islamist group, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi">was found guilty of intentionally ordering attacks on religious and historic building</a> in Timbuktu by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
