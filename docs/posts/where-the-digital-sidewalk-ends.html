Like everyone who needs to go anywhere, we also use a mapping app on our phones to figure out how to get from here to elsewhere. However, unlike most people who get around primarily in cars, we have been sorely disappointed at being directed to hop a fence to jaywalk across four lanes of 40-mph traffic when we request a bike route (this is a lived experience). </span></span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-mtxvn18853"><span><span>It doesn&#39;t have to be this way, of course.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is by far the largest and most comprehensive database of map data in the world. It is open-source and available for anyone to use. It is also collectively constructed by either volunteers who contribute data that is of personal (or maybe civic, or other) interest to them, or by corporations who have a vested interest in some aspect of the map.</span></span></span></p></li><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-qxyqv232"><span><span><span>OSM represents the map of the world as a </span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-hook="WebLink"><span><u><span>graph of nodes and edges</span></u></span></a><span><span> (“ways” in OSM parlance). Generally, nodes are points on the map (buildings, bus stops, mailboxes, …) and ways are streets, roads, highways, and such. The nodes are pairs of coordinates latitude and longitude (GPS points, kinda). The edges are two or more nodes connected by a line which can be used to represent roads and other ways as well as areas, like building footprints, political boundaries. </span></span></span></p></li><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-b02aa31666"><span><span><span>When Google, Apple, a Tesla car, or anyone else that provides routing as a service calculate a route, they use an application called a </span></span><strong><span><span>routing engine</span></span></strong><span><span> that consumes (takes as input) a graph representation of the world like OSM to find an optimal path through it, along connected ways, between two nodes. However, an unfortunate aspect of computer applications is that they can’t operate on data that don’t exist; in order for a routing engine to use a possible path through the world, that path has to be represented as a sequence of ways in the map data it consumes.</span></span></span></p></li></ul></div><p dir="auto" id="viewer-3uewp238"><span><span><span>With that, let’s take a look at </span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://osm-viz.fly.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-hook="WebLink"><span><u><span>osm-viz</span></u></span></a><span><span>.

Clicking on a selection will cause a web of similarly-colored lines to be drawn over the map (sometimes a rich web, sometimes a pitifully sparse one). You can zoom in or out, but will notice that the data we are visualizing only cover the greater Bay area (vaguely, north to Santa Rosa, east to Sacramento, south to Gilroy).</span></span></span></p><div data-breakout="normal"><div id="viewer-6dkzb14239"><div><figure role="button" data-hook="imageViewer" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="true"><div id="6dkzb14239"><wow-image id="343b46_47fae23b45d84a1d887a7fdbe2fcacc0~mv2.jpg" data-image-info="{&#34;containerId&#34;:&#34;6dkzb14239&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;,&#34;isLQIP&#34;:false,&#34;isSEOBot&#34;:true,&#34;imageData&#34;:{&#34;width&#34;:200,&#34;height&#34;:200,&#34;uri&#34;:&#34;343b46_47fae23b45d84a1d887a7fdbe2fcacc0~mv2.jpg&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-has-ssr-src=""><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/343b46_47fae23b45d84a1d887a7fdbe2fcacc0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_200,h_200,al_c,q_80,enc_auto/343b46_47fae23b45d84a1d887a7fdbe2fcacc0~mv2.jpg" alt="Very little of SF is currently adequately mapped for pedestrian routing" data-pin-url="https://www.smolways.com/post/where-the-digital-sidewalk-ends" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/343b46_47fae23b45d84a1d887a7fdbe2fcacc0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_280,h_280,al_c,lg_1,q_80/343b46_47fae23b45d84a1d887a7fdbe2fcacc0~mv2.jpg"/></wow-image></div><figcaption dir="auto">Open Sidewalks data for SF</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p dir="auto" id="viewer-nctxe14150"><span><span><span>Let’s look at the first selection: </span></span><span><span>“First-class citizen sidewalks.”</span></span><span><span> As mentioned above, generally OSM </span></span><em><span><span>ways</span></span></em><span><span> represent streets, roads, highways, and the like.

For the most part, sidewalks in OSM are represented as metadata attached to car infrastructure – “here is Main St. and Main St. has a sidewalk on both sides”. OSW sees sidewalks as ways (roads for people) in their own right – “here is a sidewalk that runs between these two points.” In our app, we call these sidewalks, that exist as ways distinct from roads and streets, </span></span><em><span><span>first-class citizen</span></span></em><span><span> sidewalks. When you click on this selection, you will see that some pretty remarkable work has been done to map sidewalks in the Bay area!

But imagine what would happen, how much confidence you would have filling in missing connections, if you were to remove the satellite image from the background.</span></span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-d5jsd317"><span><span><span>This is analogous to what a computer would be faced with if it were tasked with calculating routes through the network of nodes and edges that is the OSM map.</span></span><strong><span><span> Computers simply can’t draw a path of connected edges through a graph whose edges aren’t connected.</span></span></strong><span><span> Further, we can see anecdotally how a strategy of relying on edges that assure us of the existence of nearby, parallel edges leads to failure modes that, well, require us to use caution because directions “may not reflect actual conditions.”</span></span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-r5qis320"><span><span><span>The final, concluding observation that we make in this is that, if we want a mapping app that calculates high quality, trustworthy routes for bicyclists, pedestrians, (and people using strollers, people on crutches, blind people, wheelchair users, people on crutches, tourists, etc.) and which is capable of giving precise, step-by-step directions on par with directions that established mapping apps can give to car drivers today, </span></span><strong><span><span>then we need to map the world for bicyclists and pedestrians. </span></span></strong></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-tujlq9029"><span><span><span>We want a mapping app that can tell us, as a bicyclist or scooter user:</span></span></span></p><div data-breakout="normal"><ul><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-ddnag13271"><span><span><span>when and where to merge left or right, </span></span></span></p></li><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-fk5mr13354"><span><span><span>when we need to leave a bike lane and get onto a shared road, </span></span></span></p></li><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-047fb13438"><span><span><span>when we are permitted to get up on a sidewalk to avoid dangerous traffic. </span></span></span></p></li></ul></div><p dir="auto" id="viewer-wvi6f13608"><span><span><span>We want a mapping app that can tell us, as a pedestrian or wheelchair user:</span></span></span></p><div data-breakout="normal"><ul><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-ylqg614119"><span><span><span>where sidewalks narrow or widen, </span></span></span></p></li><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-7m0p814294"><span><span><span>where there are obstructions like bus stops or mailboxes, </span></span></span></p></li><li dir="auto" aria-level="1"><p dir="" id="viewer-3pzas14383"><span><span><span>where there are steps, or no curb cuts. </span></span></span></p></li></ul></div><p dir="auto" id="viewer-gd33215626"><span><span><span>We want a mapping app where we can type in a destination, press</span></span><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>“Go,”</span></span></strong><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong><span><span>and just follow directions without needing to give them any more attention than you would if you were driving a car.  </span></span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-9ugmd16070"><span><span><span>None of this will be possible as long as bike lanes and sidewalks are only metadata attached to streets.

Mounting a lightweight tool with this capability to a bicycle or similar device, we hope to be able to draw OSM map data while riding the ways. This way we can record the location of infrastructure such as missing paths. We can also survey large areas fast, recording the presence of things like bike racks, damaged infrastructure and other features that interest us and our partners in business and government. </span></span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-ij1uh18748"><span><span><span>Right now, the prototype is a work in progress – minimally functional but with lots of room for improvement. Some other ideas we hope to explore in the future are adding cameras to it to collect image data, and adding an accelerometer to gather estimates of surface quality.</span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>
