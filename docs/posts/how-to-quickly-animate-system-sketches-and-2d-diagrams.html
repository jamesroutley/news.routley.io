    <h1>Ask HN: How to quickly animate system sketches and 2D diagrams?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I&#39;m using Mermaid, Excalidraw and PlantUML diagrams to explain and document what I&#39;m working on and they work great and are a lot better than screens of prose, but I&#39;ve become aware that something is missing: motion.<p>Animation brings a whole lot more to explanations, making simple explanations of how request coalescing works easy to understand, token simulations [0] through to helping explain concepts like Fresnel lenses [1]. Embedding them into GitHub READMEs, tweets and documentation would be awesome.</p><p>Google do it to illustrate posts (e.g. <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/a-safer-default-for-navigation-https.html" rel="nofollow">https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/a-safer-default-for-naviga...</a>).</p><p>I found Excalidraw Claymate [2] but the stop motion approach with no tweening support makes it painful to create animations where circles move from place to place. There&#39;s also Manim [3] but I think this is more for maths.</p><p>Adobe Flash used to be the go-to; what do you reach for when you want to illustrate a concept with an animated diagram?</p><p>0. <a href="https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-token-simulation" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-token-simulation</a></p><p>1. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30576688" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30576688</a></p><p>2. <a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/excalidraw-claymate" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dai-shi/excalidraw-claymate</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim</a></p></div></div>
