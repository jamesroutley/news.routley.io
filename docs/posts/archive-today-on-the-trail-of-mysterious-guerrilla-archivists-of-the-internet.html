<p>Do you like reading articles in publications like Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal or the Economist, but can’t afford to pay what can be hundreds of dollars a year in subscriptions?  If so, odds are you’ve already stumbled on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.today" target="_blank">archive.today</a>, which provides easy access to these and much more: just paste in the article link, and you’ll get back a snapshot of the page, full content included.</p>

<p>For a long time, I assumed that this was some kind of third-party skin on top of the venerable <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive,</a> whose Wayback Machine provides a very similar service at the very similar address of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://archive.org" target="_blank">archive.org</a>.  However, the Wayback Machine is slow, clunky, frequently errors out, and most importantly, it’s very easy for websites to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/sections/360000425652-Wayback-Machine-Web-Archiving" target="_blank">opt out</a>, retroactively erasing all their content forever.  In contrast, archive.today has <em>no </em>opt-outs or erase buttons: like it or not, they store everything and it’s not going anywhere, with some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/636912269578665984/does-your-site-save-all-pages-that-people-post" target="_blank">limited exceptions</a> for law enforcement, <a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/677918691356278784/i-found-many-children-porn-images-on-archive-who">child porn</a>, etc.</p>



<p>The Internet Archive is a legitimate 501(c)(3) non-profit with a budget of $37 million and 169 full-time employees in 2019.  archive.today, by contrast, is an opaque mystery.  So who runs this and where did they come from?</p>



<h2 id="the-origins-and-owners-of-archive-today">The origins and owners of archive.today</h2>



<p>The first historical record we have of the site dates from May 16, 2012, when a “Denis Petrov” from Prague, Czech Republic <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://who.is/whois/archive.is" target="_blank">registered the domain archive.is</a>, the original name of the site.  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://who.is/whois/archive.today" target="_blank">archive.today</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/archiveis/status/455710701948903424" target="_blank">followed in 2014</a>, and the site has since registered countless variations: archive.li, archive.ec, archive.vn, archive.ph, archive.fo, etc.  Denis Petrov is a common Russian name, with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=denis%20petrov" target="_blank">pages and pages of matches on LinkedIn</a>, but it may well be an alias: informer.com notes that the same contact information was used to register <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://website.informer.com/Denis+Petrov.html" target="_blank">a series of very sketchy domains</a>, ranging from “carding forum” <em>verified.lu</em> to piracy sites <em>btdlg.com</em> and <em>moviesave.us</em> (all long since gone), many seeded with German keywords (<em>spiel, gewinnt, online</em>).</p>



<p>Domains aside, “Denis Petrov” has little presence on the web, and three seemingly connected domains proved dead ends. The obvious <em>denispetrov.com</em> was an entertaining rabbit hole, with the author <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100622120438/http://www.denispetrov.com/" target="_blank">an accomplished programmer with an interest in Web automation</a>, but it’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070217031023/http://www.denispetrov.com/?p=47" target="_blank">clearly the work of a New Yorker</a>, they’re blogging at the tail end of a 25-year career and the blog dries up entirely in 2011, so it doesn’t match the place or time. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040207134158/http://denis.biz/" target="_blank">denis.biz</a> (2001) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080323134702/http://petrov.net/" target="_blank">petrov.net</a> (1998!) contain nothing.  The one intriguing bit of evidence we have is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kiwifarms.net/threads/archive-md-vs-brave-browser.71896/page-2" target="_blank">this series of screenshots</a> (<a href="https://archive.li/PC2g5">archive</a>) where Brave’s tech support addresses <em>webmaster@archive.is</em> as “Denis”, but odds are that’s just from the same DNS record..</p>



<p>We can glean a few more clues from <em>archive.today</em>‘s web presence.  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.is/faq" target="_blank">The FAQ</a>, unchanged since 2013 (!), states that they are located in Europe and asks for PayPal donations in euros.  Looking through the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/archive/2021/12" target="_blank">voluminous Tumblr blog</a>, featuring tons of questions but very terse answers, the author’s English is excellent but not <em>quite </em>native, with occasional Noun Capitalization also hinting at a German background.  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/132405567756/%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%81%D1%8F-%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-url-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9" target="_blank">Yet they answer questions in Russian</a>, and the site uses a Russian analytics engine.</p>

<p>The most interesting detective work to date comes from Stack Exchange, where <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/145817/on-which-country-are-the-creators-and-servers-of-archive-today-archive-is-base" target="_blank">Ciro Santilli</a> managed to link the profile picture of an account <em>archive.today</em> once used to archive LinkedIn content to a “Masha Rabinovich” in Berlin.  Even more intriguingly, in a <a href="https://community.f-secure.com/en/discussion/14768/what-is-the-evidence-of-harmful-behaviour#M3733">2012 F-Secure forum post</a>, a “masharabinovich” complains about <em>“my website <a href="http://archive.is/&amp;#8221" rel="nofollow">http://archive.is/&amp;#8221</a>;</em> being blacklisted.  They pop up on Wikipedia as well <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Masharabinovich" target="_blank">getting told off</a> for adding too many links to archive.is, including a mention that they’re using the Czech ISP fiber.cz, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Masharabinovich&amp;offset=20091219064619&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Masharabinovich" target="_blank">their early edit history</a> includes many updates to the pages “Russian passport” and “Belarusian passport”.  “Masha” (Маша) is a common Russian diminutive of Maria, although it can also be a Hebrew form of Moses (מַשה), and Rabinovich is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname.</p>



<p> <a href="https://archive.vn/blhHz">Early Github captures</a> on <em>archive.today </em>are linked to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/grhmc/status/1334138105738256389" target="_blank">now completely disappeared account</a> called “volth” (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.vn/kqftP" target="_blank">copy archived by archive.today itself</a>), who was a fluent speaker of Russian, contributed extensively to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS" target="_blank">NixOS</a> (which <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/list-of-companies-using-nixos-technologies/8428/7" target="_blank">archive.today uses</a>) and has a profile picture not dissimilar to Masha’s.  The linked <a href="http://volth.com">volth.com</a> domain is now only an empty husk, but it dates back to 2004, with early versions first doing some kind of sketchy search engine network marketing thing (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050129084842/http://volth.com/" target="_blank">2005</a>), promising “Total Success in Internet” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032812/http://volth.com/">2008</a>) and eventually being <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100529063016/http://www.volth.com:80/" target="_blank">put up for sale</a> (2010), making it likely that its original owners the Espinosas are unrelated to whoever owns the domain today.</p>



<p>While we may not have a face and a name, at this point we have a pretty good idea of how the site is run: it’s a one-person labor of love, operated by a Russian of considerable talent and access to Europe.  Let’s move on to the nitty gritty.</p>



<h2 id="how-archive-today-works">Infrastructure</h2>



<p>There are two components to any archival site: the scraper that copies the pages, and the storage system where the pages are kept and retrieved on demand.  Helpfully, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.today/faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> shares some details of what the storage side at least used to look like:</p>



<p>The archive runs Apache Hadoop and Apache Accumulo. All data is stored on HDFS, textual content is duplicated 3 times among servers in 2 datacenters and images are duplicated 2 times. Both datacenters are in Europe, with <a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/674936420267393024/parlez-vous-fran%C3%A7ais-parce-que-jai-remarqu%C3%A9-que">OVH hosting at least one of them</a>.</p>

<p>In 2012, the site <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/38139265209/what-will-happen-to-the-data-when-you-shut-the" target="_blank">already had 10 TB</a> of archives and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/41291326993/so-if-you-say-it-costs-you-money-how-much-is" target="_blank">cost ~300 euros/mo to run</a>, escalating to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/72136308644/how-much-does-it-cost-you-to-host-a-website-of" target="_blank">2000 euros by 2014</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/151510917631/how-do-you-guys-keep-the-lights-on-i-gave-the" target="_blank">$4000 by 2016</a>.  As of 2021, they have archived on the order of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/661314951417315328/what-percentage-of-5-char-codes-is-used-now-full" target="_blank">500 million pages</a>, and with the average size of a webpage clocking in at well over 2 MB these days, that’s a cool 1,000 TB to deal with.  (For comparison, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/internet-archive-celebrates-25-years-and-launches-fund-raising-campaign-amid-new-legal-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet Archive is around 40,000 TB</a>.)</p>



<p>The less discussed but more controversial half of the site is scraping, the process of vacuuming up live webpages.  Since 2021, this uses a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/618635148292964352/what-scraper-or-headless-browser-are-you-using-it" target="_blank">modified version of the Chrome browser</a>, and the blog <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/653166387151437824/what-is-the-total-number-of-pages-it-can-store" target="_blank">readily admits</a> that the availability of computing power to run these automated browsers is now the main bottleneck to expanding the site.  To avoid detection, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Talk:Archive.today" target="_blank">archive.today runs via a botnet</a> that cycles through countless IP addresses, making it quite difficult for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/88257/deny-access-to-archive-is" target="_blank">grumpy webmasters</a> to stop their sites getting scraped.  Access to paywalled sites is through logins secured via unclear means, which need to be replenished constantly: <a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/667206146733588480/why-cant-we-archive-an-instagram-account">here’s the creator asking for Instagram credentials</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, the serving of the website is also subject to a perpetual <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.archive.today/post/188657795411/i-see-the-new-md-domain-archive-md-and-9-months" target="_blank">game of cat and mouse</a>: <em>“I can only predict that there will be approximately one trouble with domains per year and each fifth trouble will result in domain loss.”</em>  As of today, archive.today still works, but users are redirected to archive.md.</p>



<h2>Funding</h2>



<p>The other major source of permanent uncertainty is the site’s funding model.  We’ve established that its costs are considerable, but according to the creator, <a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/656947801397362688/how-does-this-website-earn-you-money-does-it-help">as of 2021 ads and donations covered less than 20% of expenses</a>, with <a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/673230761828188160/how-was-last-years-2021-donations-compared-with">donations on the order of 6000 euros</a>.  PayPal donations, previously accepted, were switched off around 2022 since <a href="https://archive.md/FoEX8">the creator could no longer top up the account</a>, implying they’re in Russia, and they complain about the <a href="https://archive.md/GSDwV">difficulty of doing cross-border payments</a> “across the Iron Curtain”.  Donations these days are via <a href="https://liberapay.com/archiveis/donate">Liberapay</a>, an obscure French non-profit organization, and YC-backed startup <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/archive.today">BuyMeACoffee</a>.  Surprisingly, <a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/680725980039479296/cant-you-buy-cards-with-crypto-or-something-like">the creator has a healthy skepticism of crypto</a>, so this remains unsupported.</p>



<p>The other source of income is ads.  The FAQ, far out of date, has a “<em>promise it will have no ads at least till the end of 2014</em>“, but there have long been Yahoo network ads injected on top of pages when you use mobile (but, oddly, not on desktop).  Revenue is even more of a question mark, but apparently on good days they “<a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/666150469075402752/how-much-revenue-are-you-generating-from-the-ads">almost cover expenses</a>” (a remark that doesn’t quite square with the other comment about ads and donations together covering less than 20%), while on bad days <a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/675851380224819200/i-havent-seen-any-ads-on-your-site-in-a-long">they’re getting kicked out from serving ads</a> because an archive of the Internet will inevitably archive advertiser-unfriendly NSFW content too.</p>



<h2>Archive.today, not tomorrow?</h2>



<p>So there we have it: the site is a one-man battle against entropy, constantly battling domain registrars, anti-scraping systems, copyright enforcement, easily spooked advertisers, and global financial system payment rails designed to obstruct Russian citizens. By staying anonymous and keeping a low profile, they’ve (likely?) managed to avoid the kind of legal tussles that have embroiled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan">Alexandra Elbakyan</a> of Sci-Hub fame, but they’ve still funded it to the tune of tens of thousands of euros during that time.  They clearly have a second source of considerable income that’s likely somewhat sketchy as well, so if that ever goes away, archive.today is likely to go away with it.</p>



<p>The creator is fully aware that the site is a mere “<a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/660719734341386240/is-there-any-structure-in-place-to-assure-the">weak tool</a>” that is “<a href="https://blog.archive.today/post/657822115776610304/not-respecting-peoples-privacy-copyright-laws">doomed to die</a>“, but the bus factor of one combined with its semi-legal nature means there can be no real continuity: there will never be a legally incorporated Archive.Today Foundation to carry on his work.  It’s a testament to their persistence that they’re managed to keep this up for over 10 years, and I for one will be buying Denis/Masha/whoever a well deserved <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/archive.today">cup of coffee</a>.</p>
