            when you select a symbol.

          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>
            Anyone who works with LaTeX knows how time-consuming it can be
            to find a symbol in
            <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/">symbols-a4.pdf</a>
            that you just can&#39;t memorize. Detexify is an attempt to simplify this search.
          </p>
          <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
          <p>
            Just draw the symbol you are looking for into the square area above and look what happens!
          </p>
          <h2>My symbol isn&#39;t found!</h2>
          <p>
            The symbol may not be trained enough
            or it is not yet in the list of supported symbols.
            <strike>In the first case you can do the training yourself.</strike>
            In the second case just drop me a line (mail@danielkirs.ch)!
            <em>I am rewriting parts right now and training isn&#39;t functional in this version.</em>
          </p>
          <h2>I like this. How can I help?</h2>
          <p>
            <strike>You could spare some time training Detexify.</strike>
            You could also look at the source of the
            <a href="http://github.com/kirel/detexify">frontend</a>
            and
            <a href="https://github.com/kirel/detexify-hs-backend">backend</a>
            on Github.
            If you really, really like this
            you can also donate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The backend server is running on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2ed6dc53403b">Digital Ocean (referral link)</a>
            so you can also reduce my hosting costs by using that referral link.
          </p>
          <h2>Why should I donate?</h2>
          <p>
            Hosting of detexify costs some money. If Detexify helps you, you might want to help cover these costs.
          </p>
          <h2>This doesn&#39;t work at all!?</h2>
          <p>
            Be sure you use a modern browser. A recent version of
            <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>
            or
            <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>
            should do the trick.
          </p>
          <h2>Do you support Unicode?</h2>
          <p>
            No. Have a look at
            <a href="http://shapecatcher.com">http://shapecatcher.com</a>
            for Unicode.
          </p>
          <h2>I am a researcher. Can I use Detexify&#39;s training data?</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/kirel/detexify-data">Yes.</a>
          </p>
          <h2>Who created Detexify?</h2>
          <p>
            Philipp KÃ¼hl had the initial idea and
            <a href="http://kirelabs.org">Daniel Kirsch</a>
            made it happen.
