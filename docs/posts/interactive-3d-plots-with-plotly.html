    <h1>Interactive 3D Plots with Plotly</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>I’ve recently had to plot a lot of 3D elements like point clouds and meshes for my research. Compared to 2D plots, 3D plots benefit greatly from <em>interaction</em>: translating and rotating the plot gives a better sense of the geometry of elements in the plot. I’ve found that <a href="https://plotly.com/python/3d-charts/">plotly</a> is the easiest and most responsive tool for interactive 3D plots, and this post is a primer on how I make them.</p>

<h2 id="visualizing-meshes-with-plotly">Visualizing meshes with plotly</h2>
<p>Below is an example of a sphere rendered with Python and plotly.</p>

<p>The code is straightforward: pass the vertices and faces of a mesh to plotly’s <code>create_trisurf()</code> function. 
</p>

<h2 id="adding-other-elements-to-the-same-plot">Adding other elements to the same plot</h2>
<p>Use the <code>add_trace()</code> function to add other elemnts, e.g. a point cloud, to the same figure.</p>





<h2 id="saving-the-plot">Saving the plot</h2>
<p>Besides using <code>fig.show()</code> to show the plot, you can save it as html, or even log it to wandb:</p>



<h2 id="why-not-matplotlib-or-trimesh">Why not matplotlib or trimesh?</h2>
<p>3D plotting in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43187484/matplotlib-slow-3d-scatter-rotation">matplotlib</a> is extremely slow. The <a href="https://trimsh.org/trimesh.scene.scene.html#trimesh.scene.scene.Scene.show">trimesh Scene visualizer</a> is also slower than plotly. Interactive features for both matplotlib and trimesh become unusable as the number of elements in the plot grows.</p>

<p>Plotly, on the other hand, uses a webGL backend to render in the browser. If you have hardware acceleration turned on for your browser it is even faster. I haven’t tried visualizers from other libraries like <a href="http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/python_api/open3d.visualization.Visualizer.html">open3d</a>, as I was pretty happy with plotly once I started using it.</p>
