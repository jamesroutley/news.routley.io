    <h1>Last Issue of &#34;ECMAScript News&#34;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td><span><p>Dear readers!</p>

<p>Sadly, we have to inform you that this is the last issue of “ECMAScript News”. We have been operating at a loss for too long: The number of advertisers and subscribers has been slowly but steadily decreasing over the last two years (vs. constant growth before that). Therefore, we made the difficult decision to stop publishing this newsletter.</p>

<p>The first issue came out on 2016-09-27. We published a total of 368 issues and are thankful for many loyal readers during many interesting years!</p>

<p>Axel may continue this newsletter in some shape or form next year. If he does, he’ll inform you via one last email in 2026.</p></span></td></div></div>
