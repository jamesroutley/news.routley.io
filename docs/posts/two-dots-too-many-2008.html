				<p>The Turkish newspaper <a href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/8748359.asp?gid=229&amp;sz=65966">Hürriyet</a> reports a tragic consequence of the failure to localize cell phones.</p>

<p>Ramazan Çalçoban sent his estranged wife Emine the text message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zaten sen sıkışınca konuyu değiştiriyorsun.
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#34;Anyhow, whenever you can&#39;t answer an argument, you change the subject.&#34;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what she thought he wrote was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Zaten sen sikişınce konuyu değiştiriyorsun.
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#34;Anyhow, whenever they are fucking you, you change the subject.&#34;</p>
<p>She showed the message to her father, who angrily called Ramazan and accused him of calling his daughter a prostitute. Ramazan went to his wife&#39;s home to apologize, only to be attacked by his wife, her father, and two sisters. He was stabbed in the chest but succeeded in grabbing a knife, stabbing his wife, and getting away. Emine died of her wounds; Ramazan killed himself in jail.</p>
<p>How exactly did this tragedy come about? Turkish has four high vowels, front unrounded /i/, written &lt;i&gt;, front rounded /y/, written &lt;ü&gt;, back unrounded /ɨ/, written &lt;ı&gt;, and back rounded /u/, written &lt;u&gt;.  The verb form that Ramazan wrote was <i>sıkışınca</i>, which is a gerund of <i>sıkışmak</i>, literally &#34;to get wedged, to get in a tight spot&#34;, but here with the sense of &#34;to be unable to answer an argument&#34;. What his wife thought he wrote was <i>sikişince</i>, the corresponding form of <i>sikişmek</i> &#34;to fuck&#34;.  The verb stems <i>sıkış</i> &#34;to get wedged&#34; and <i>sikiş</i> &#34;to fuck&#34; differ only in the backness of their vowels, which is reflected graphically in the presence or absence of a dot. The problem was that Emine&#39;s cell phone was not localized properly for Turkish and did not have the letter &lt;ı&gt;; when it displayed Ramazan&#39;s message, it replaced the &lt;ı&gt;s with &lt;i&gt;s.</p>
<p>To see exactly how the misinterpretation arose, it may help to understand the structure of the Turkish sentences involved. <i>zaten</i> means &#34;anyhow&#34; and <i>sen</i> &#34;you&#34;. <i>konuyu</i> is the definite accusative of <i>konu</i> &#34;subject&#34;, which tells us that it is the object of the following verb. <i>değiştiriyorsun</i> is the second person singular subject form of <i>değiştirmek</i> &#34;to change&#34; in the present tense, meaning &#34;you change&#34;. As you can see, the verb comes at the end of its clause, following the object. Only one verb, the second one, is marked for its subject: the suffix <i>sun</i> tells us that the subject of &#34;change&#34; is &#34;you&#34;. The verb of the first clause is unmarked for subject.</p>
<p>If you have compared carefully what Ramazan sent and what Emine received, you may have noticed that Emine and her father should have had a clue as to what Ramazan meant in spite of the replacement of &lt;ı&gt; by &lt;i&gt;.  When you replace the &lt;ı&gt;s of <i>sıkışınca</i> with &lt;i&gt;s as the cellphone did, the result is not <i>sikişinc<b>e</b></i>   &#34;on fucking&#34; but <i>sikişinc<b>a</b></i>. This is incorrect because it fails to conform to the rules of <i>vowel harmony</i>. In Turkish, most suffixal high vowels must agree with the preceding vowel in frontness and rounding, and most suffixal non-high vowels must agree with the preceding vowel in frontness. You can see this in the two forms of the infinitive suffix: <i>mek</i> after front vowels and <i>mak</i> after back vowels.</p>
<p>The gerund suffix used here has four forms: <i>ince</i>, used after front unrounded vowels, as in <i>gelince</i> &#34;on coming&#34;, <i>ünce</i>, used after front rounded vowels, as in <i>görünce</i> &#34;on seeing&#34;, <i>ınca</i>, used after back unrounded vowels, as in <i>alınca</i> &#34;on taking&#34;, and <i>unca</i>, used after back rounded vowels, as in <i>yorunca</i> &#34;on tiring&#34;.  The final &lt;a&gt; of the word <i>sikişinca</i> that Emine received should have served as a clue that the preceding vowels were intended to be back, not front.</p>
<p>There are several lessons to take away from this tragedy. One is that localization is a good thing.  Another is that it is best not to kill people who make you angry until you have carefully investigated the situation, if then. But as a phonologist and student of harmony systems, I have to see this as a compelling argument for paying attention to vowel harmony.</p>
