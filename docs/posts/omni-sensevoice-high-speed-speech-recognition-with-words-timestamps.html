<p data-block-key="f7wiy"><b>Response and repair</b> [<a href="#behavior-repair">ðŸ”—</a>]</p><p data-block-key="bodnp">But I weigh participation history (&#34;how long has this person been active in the group?&#34; and &#34;how much have they contributed?&#34;) the <i>opposite</i> way when <i>responding to</i> the misbehavior. Because, if we know someone, if they&#39;ve accumulated a history of contribution, then we may have more <i>incentive</i> to repair, and we likely have more <i>ability</i> to repair.</p><p data-block-key="dh79l">First, <b>incentive</b>: I&#39;ll be ruthlessly pragmatic for a moment. We have a limited amount of time and energy to do this emotionally exhausting work. So if we notice destructive behavior by an <b>utter stranger</b>, versus by someone who has already demonstrated a commitment to the group and its goals, then it does make sense to prioritize spending our time talking with and healing the relationship with the known person.</p><p data-block-key="59ml0">I distinguish more, here, between an utter stranger and someone who has at least a <i>little</i> history of good-faith, healthy group activity.</p><p data-block-key="4okls">And it&#39;s important here to balance both retaining seasoned, committed contributors and nurturing newer contributors, to work towards succession and sustainability. If the long-time volunteer is burning out, or otherwise on a trajectory towards less contribution, the group has less incentive to find a mutually agreeable way to keep them around. Conversely, if the new volunteer holds significant promise aside from this one misstep, the group has more incentive to repair.</p><p data-block-key="78ml">And as for <b>ability</b>: We more likely have a relationship with a better-known person (so, we know how to contact them and are more likely to be able to have a difficult but productive conversation), we have context for why they&#39;ve misstepped, and we have some knowledge of their motivations and goals.</p><p data-block-key="5suom">In the fictional example I created, if other members of the group decide they want to hold the long-time volunteer accountable, they won&#39;t have trouble finding a way to contact him, and they can figure out who among them has the most rapport and credibility with him. They can think ahead of time about what he&#39;s good at and what he values, and privately work on ideas about how to reorganize the group&#39;s work to preserve those while reducing what&#39;s not working. This sort of strategizing makes it easier (not easy) to repair, and is much harder to do with a stranger. It takes time and compassion.</p><p data-block-key="3br6e">This depends on relationships and recalcitrance. Sometimes the long-timer has absolutely no friends in the group, and is so obstinate that they&#39;re not willing to ever entertain the possibility that they ought to change. But don&#39;t assume. I&#39;ve succeeded several times at getting folks like this to listen and apologize and start on the road to change, even when others thought there&#39;d be no getting through to them. Skill and patience can do a lot.</p><p data-block-key="1rvi1">(There&#39;s one more thing that I&#39;m not addressing at all here: the thorny labyrinth of <i>obligation</i>. What do we owe to each other? To what extent does the group owe the individual a responsibility for repair, and does that responsibility differ toward the newcomer and toward the long-timer? If you are eager for an unsatisfying conversation where I gesture a lot and say things like &#34;what even is a community?!?!&#34; then you can ask me about this the next time we talk synchronously - <a href="https://jacobian.org/">Jacob</a> enjoyed it, anyway.)</p><p data-block-key="qr56">This is all relative to a lot of other factors, for sure. But I do think it can make sense to <i>respond</i> to misbehavior with context of the person&#39;s other actions, and spend more effort on repair and coaching with people who have greater experience or who have contributed a lot.</p>
