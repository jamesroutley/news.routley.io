    <h1>Ceiling Air Purifier</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p><span>

Imagine a high-capacity air filter that is extremely quiet and doesn&#39;t
get in the way.  I think I see how to build one; here&#39;s a prototype:

</span></p><p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/ceiling-fan-air-purifier-prototype-big.jpg"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/ceiling-fan-air-purifier-prototype.jpg" width="550" height="330" srcset="/ceiling-fan-air-purifier-prototype.jpg 550w,/ceiling-fan-air-purifier-prototype-2x.jpg 1100w"/></a>

</p>
<p>

By putting a fan on the ceiling you can have very long blades.  This
is important for keeping noise down: the longer your blades are the
more air you move at a given rotational velocity, which is a major
determinant of noise.  Testing my prototype, it has a CADR of ~180 CFM
and is only 33dB.  By contrast, the Wirecutter&#39;s top-recommended <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-purifier/">air
purifier</a> (<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01728NLRG/">Coway
AP-1512HH</a>) has a CADR of 233 CFM (31% higher) at 54 dB (21dB
louder) or 110 CFM (38% lower) at 36 dB (3dB louder).  With some
tweaks it should be able to match the commercial purifier&#39;s
performance, without being louder.

</p>
<p>

Volume is very important here: people often select purifiers based
on their maximum flow, but then run them on a lower setting or even
turn them off because they are too loud.

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/ceiling-air-purifier-from-below-big.jpg"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/ceiling-air-purifier-from-below.jpg" width="550" height="412" srcset="/ceiling-air-purifier-from-below.jpg 550w,/ceiling-air-purifier-from-below-2x.jpg 1100w"/></a>

</p>
<p>

Note that while my purifier is an octagon of 12x20 filters
around a 52&#34; fan, a nonagon would have been better.  Not only should
that get you 12% more filtration, but you don&#39;t have to fill gaps
between the filters.

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/ceiling-fan-filter-and-person-big.jpg"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/ceiling-fan-filter-and-person.jpg" width="550" height="304" srcset="/ceiling-fan-filter-and-person.jpg 550w,/ceiling-fan-filter-and-person-2x.jpg 1100w"/></a></p>

One downside of using this much tape, especially some of it with
the sticky side bare, is that you get an adhesive smell. The smell
fell below where I could detect after about a day, but Julia could
still smell it for about five days.

</p>
<p>

To determine the CADR of the prototype I followed the approach I
described in <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/testing-air-purifiers">Testing Air
Purifiers</a>, where I created smoke by burning matches and then
tracked how quickly the purifier could reduce pm2.5 levels:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/mighty-vs-ceiling-decay-big.png"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/mighty-vs-ceiling-decay.png" width="550" height="328" srcset="/mighty-vs-ceiling-decay.png 550w,/mighty-vs-ceiling-decay-2x.png 1100w"/></a>

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/mighty-vs-ceiling-derivative-big.png"><img src="https://www.jefftk.com/mighty-vs-ceiling-derivative.png" width="550" height="309" srcset="/mighty-vs-ceiling-derivative.png 550w,/mighty-vs-ceiling-derivative-2x.png 1100w"/></a>

</p>
<p>

To determine volume levels, I used a Sennheiser 835s dynamic
microphone with a foam windscreen, connected to an AudioBox 1818VSL to
record samples of each purifier option and silence.  Here are the
samples:

</p>
<p>

<audio controls="" src="/silent-room-sample.wav"></audio> (<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/silent-room-sample.wav">Silence</a>)</p>
<p>

<audio controls="" src="/ceiling-fan-high-sample.wav"></audio> (<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/ceiling-fan-high-sample.wav">Ceiling Purifier</a>)</p>
<p>


<audio controls="" src="/purifier-medium-sample.wav"></audio> (<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/purifier-medium-sample.wav">AP-1512HH Medium</a>)</p>
<p>

<audio controls="" src="/purifier-high-sample.wav"></audio> (<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/purifier-high-sample.wav">AP-1512HH High</a>)</p>
<p>

To compute the loudness of each sample I ran:

</p>
<pre>ffmpeg -i sample.wav -af\
  loudnorm=I=-16:dual_mono=true:TP=-1.5:LRA=11:print_format=summary\
  -f null -
</pre><p>

This gives loudness in LUFS, which is K-weighted dB.  I don&#39;t have any
calibrated tooling, but I can report values in loudness units (LU)
relative to silence.  Trusting the manufacturer&#39;s rating of 53.8 dB
for the AP-1512HH on High, however, lets us determine absolute
loudness for the other options:

</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Sample</th>
<th>Relative</th>
<th>Absolute
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everything Off</td>
<td>normalized to 0 LU</td>
<td>25 dB
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ceiling Purifier High</td>
<td>7.3 LU</td>
<td>32.6 dB
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AP-1512HH Medium</td>
<td>10.8 LU</td>
<td>36.1 dB
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AP-1512HH High</td>
<td>28.5 LU</td>
<td>53.8 dB
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>

I think it ought to be possible to get even better performance out of
the ceiling purifier by building a <a href="https://www.texairfilters.com/how-to-improve-the-efficiency-of-the-box-fan-and-merv-13-filter-air-cleaner/">shroud</a>.
The ideal shroud is generally quite a bit narrower than I would guess:
I&#39;ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom/status/1427792853636460544">people
measuring</a> peak performance with only a 14&#34; hole for a 20&#34; fan.
They report ~40% more airflow without increased noise, but I would
want to run tests and verify that here.

</p>
<p>

With ~12% improvement from switching to nine filters and ~40% from
better shrouding, this ought to get us from a CADR of ~180 CFM to ~280
CFM.  Even if we only get half that improvement, a CADR ~230 CFM gets
us even with the commercial purifier, at far lower volumes.

</p>
<p>

In terms of cost, materials for one fan are nine MERV-14 filters for
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B007KPY0VS">$110</a> plus ~$5 for
tape.  The ceiling fan was a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hunter-Mariner-52-in-Indoor-Outdoor-White-Ceiling-Fan-59127/205223776">Hunter
Mariner 52&#34;</a>, which seems to cost $106 now, though it&#39;s not
something I installed for this project.  A real-product version of
this would replace the tape with a frame you attach to the ceiling,
into which you could slide filters.  Maybe $100?  If someone wanted to
build and sell something I&#39;d be pretty happy to see that!
