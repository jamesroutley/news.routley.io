    <h1>Apple&#39;s Software Quality Crisis</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><div><p>Mar 2, 2025<!-- --> - ⏱️ <!-- -->4 minutes to read</p></div></section><h2>Update: March 4, 2025</h2>
<p>The response to this post has been overwhelming, with sharing on
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43243075">Hacker News</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1j2j7b4/apples_software_quality_crisis_when_premium/">Reddit</a>.
It&#39;s clear that many others are experiencing frustrations with Apple&#39;s
software, indicating quality issue within Apple&#39;s OSes portfolio.</p>
<p>To provide more context, here&#39;s the workflow that triggers these issues:
I create a new note at the start of each lecture, add a title and tags
for organization, and begin writing with my Apple Pencil Pro.<!-- --></p>

<p>As a long-time Apple user, I&#39;ve always appreciated the integration of
hardware and software, signature of the Apple ecosystem. However, recent
experiences with my iPad Air 11&#34; M2 has left me questioning whether
Apple has lost sight of what once made their products great.</p>
<h2>A Brief Timeline</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>November 6, 2024</strong>: Visited the Apple Store in Turin with my then new iPad
Air 11&#34; M2 experiencing significant lag and overheating when using Notes and
Freeform with Apple Pencil Pro.</li>
<li><strong>November 13, 2024</strong>: Received a replacement unit after store
representatives suggested a hardware swap.</li>
<li><strong>February 27, 2025</strong>: The replacement unit is now having identical
performance issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Premium Hardware, Struggling Software</h2>
<p>In November, I visited the Apple Store in Turin to address persistent issues
with my iPad Air 11&#34; M2 running iPadOS 18.1. Despite having cutting-edge
hardware, I&#39;ve been experiencing significant lag when using <em>basic</em> Apple
applications like Notes and Freeform.</p>
<p>The performance issues don&#39;t stop at sluggish response times. During these
use cases, my iPad overheated, making it uncomfortable to
hold or even rest the palm on, raising concerns about potential long-term
hardware damage.</p>
<p>What made this particularly frustrating is that these aren&#39;t third-party
applications pushing the hardware to its limits. These are Apple&#39;s own
applications that should be <em>theoretically</em> optimized for their hardware.</p>
<p>After demonstrating the issues in person to Apple Store staff (that were
courteous and professional), the support representative that was handling my
case suggested a hardware replacement.<!-- --></p>
<p>I think this highlights a growing challenge for Apple&#39;s support model:
how do you troubleshoot software issues when the traditional solution has been
to replace hardware?</p>
<p>I think this experience feels symptomatic of a broader decline in Apple&#39;s
software quality.</p>
<p>My replacement iPad Air 11&#34; M2 with the Apple Pencil Pro is once again
struggling with the same basic tasks. Despite multiple iPadOS updates since my
original complaint (we&#39;re now on 18.3.1), the fundamental issues remain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant lag when using Apple&#39;s own Notes and Freeform applications</strong>:
Input latency increases dramatically after about 5-10 minutes of use, with
stroke rendering delayed by up to 5 seconds;</li>
<li><strong>Device overheating during standard usage scenarios</strong>: CPU temperatures
reach concerning levels (based on device&#39;s external heat) during pencil
input;</li>
<li><strong>Poor responsiveness with the Apple Pencil Pro</strong>: Palm rejection fails
intermittently, and pressure and roll sensitivity becomes inconsistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>This recurrence with a replacement device (and other friend&#39;s iPads) confirms
what I and the support representative suspected last November - this is a
software optimization problem, not a hardware defect.</p>
<h2>Details Worth Noting</h2>
<p>Since my original complaint, I&#39;ve discovered
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS/search/?q=overheating">numerous</a> forum threads
and social media discussions from iPad users experiencing similar issues. This
suggests a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.</p>
<p>I think these are sympthoms of two main problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thermal Management Issues</strong>: The SoC should throttle performance
before reaching high external temperatures;</li>
<li><strong>Memory Management Problems</strong>: The gradual degradation in performance makes
me think of memory leaks or improper garbage collection in Apple&#39;s Note and
Freeform applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most concerning is that multiple software updates have failed to address these
performance issues while introducing new features that add more strain to the
system (like Apple Intelligence, but that&#39;s a story for another day).</p>
<h2>Reconsidering the &#34;Apple Tax&#34;</h2>
<p>For years, many of us have willingly paid the &#34;Apple tax&#34;, the premium price
for Apple products justified by superior user experience, design, and ecosystem
integration. But if software quality continues to decline, this value
proposition becomes increasingly difficult to defend.</p>
<p>The persistence of these issues through multiple software updates suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Feature prioritization over optimization</strong>: Engineering resources appear
focused on adding new capabilities rather than fixing existing performance
problems;</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate performance testing</strong>: Real-world usage scenarios with Apple&#39;s
own applications aren&#39;t being adequately tested.</li>
</ol>
<p>As customers paying premium prices for Apple products, we at least deserve:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Acknowledgment of known performance issues;</li>
<li><strong>Focus on fundamentals</strong>: Updates focused on performance and stability;</li>
<li><strong>Extended support</strong>: Consideration for extended warranties when software
issues impact hardware lifespan.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Apple experience was once defined by the words &#34;it just works&#34;.<!-- --></p>
<p>After months of hoping for improvement, I&#39;m faced with difficult decisions
about my future in the Apple ecosystem. This issue, along with several others,
albeit smaller, ones, has severely damaged my confidence in new Apple products.</p>
<p>Apple should return to its roots - creating products that prioritize user
experience over feature <em>creep</em>. Apple needs to reclaim that ethos.</p></article></div>
