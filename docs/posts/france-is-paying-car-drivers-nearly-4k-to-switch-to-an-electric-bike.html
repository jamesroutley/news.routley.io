    <h1>France is paying car drivers nearly $4k to switch to an electric bike</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Ooh la la! France will now pay you €4,000 (nearly US $4,000) to swap your old polluting car for a cleaner, more efficient, and more city-appropriate electric bicycle. That marks <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/14/france-3000-e-bike-credit-to-trade-in-old-gas-car/">a major increase in the incentive</a> designed to improve French cities.</p>

<p>Pedal bicycles are also included in the generous incentive package, though <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/21/electric-bicycles-e-bikes-to-outsell-cars-in-europe/">e-bikes are contributing to one of the biggest jumps in cycling ever across Europe</a> and much of the world.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk./article/on-your-ebike-and-heres-4-000-for-it-says-macron-z8sb80629"><em>The Times</em></a>, the full €4,000 incentive is awarded to those in lower income brackets that live in low-emission urban zones. Wealthier two-wheel converts will receive a reduced incentive commensurate with their income level. For those looking to buy a new electric bike but not ready to give up their polluting car, a subsidy of up to €400 is available.</p>
<p>Some cities have even more generous electric bicycle subsidies. The Socialist-Green council of Paris offers up to €500 toward the purchase of an e-bike or a folding pedal bike. </p>

<h2 id="h-france-s-major-e-bike-incentive">France’s major e-bike incentive</h2>
<p>France is working hard to push urban drivers out of cars and towards smaller and more environmentally responsible forms of transportation. In large cities like Paris, reduction in traffic from a switch to bicycles and scooters is perhaps just as important to many residents as the environmental effects.</p>
<p>We recently covered the case of an <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/19/paris-traffic-vassla-is-e-cargo-bikes/">electric bicycle company that is switching from vans to cargo e-bikes</a> to increase the number of electric bikes it could deliver each day. The company’s delivery vans were simply too slow in Paris traffic, and switching to cargo e-bikes will help ramp up deliveries by using smaller, quicker, and more efficient vehicles.</p>
<p>In a city like Paris, such e-bike deliveries are proving easier and easier. Mayor Anne Hidalgo has taken <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/02/24/pariss-great-experiment-will-ban-cars-in-much-of-the-city-instead-opting-for-bikes-scooters-legs/">an aggressive approach</a> to making the city friendlier to cyclists, pedestrians, and basically every form of alternative transportation.</p>

<p>It’s a move that is becoming more common in cities around the world as residents demand more accessible urban planning.</p>
<p>The concept of walkable cities that are designed to prioritize the mobility of people over cars has led to <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/05/12/nyc-wants-to-take-25-of-its-street-space-away-from-cars-in-favor-of-a-walkable-bikeable-city/">calls for changes across much of Europe and the US.</a> In many cases that means repurposing car lanes and on-street parking into dedicated lanes for public transportation or bike lanes, as well as expanding sidewalks and pedestrian streets.</p>
<p>Many cities are banning cars in downtown areas or introducing congestion pricing to disincentivize driving in the most crowded urban areas.</p>
<p>Europe has also taken a lead in government-sponsored incentives for commuters to switch to two-wheeled vehicle as a way to de-emphasize the roles of cars in cities. Some countries <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/02/03/these-countries-pay-people-to-ride-bicycles-and-e-bikes-to-work-shouldnt-the-us-too/">have begun offering tax incentives</a> that essentially pay citizens to cycle to work instead of using a car.</p>
<p>Belgium recently made headlines when it increased its bike-to-work incentive to €0.25 per kilometer (approximately US $0.45 per mile), according to the <a href="https://leva-eu.com/belgian-ecycling-commuters-can-earn-up-to-quarter-of-euro/">Light Electric Vehicle Association</a>.</p>
<p>But Belgium isn’t alone in offering cash in exchange for pedaling to work. The Netherlands offers nearly as much, and the UK offers even more. A mileage allowance of around USD $0.26 per mile is available to British cyclists who use their bikes to commute to work, according to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/the-netherlands-is-giving-tax-breaks-to-cycling-commuters-and-they-re-not-the-only-ones/">World Economic Forum</a>.</p>
<p>The UK also offers a lease-to-own incentive program that rewards cyclists with discounted bikes and cycling gear.</p>
