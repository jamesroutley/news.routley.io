			<p>Scientists at the University of Sydney have, for the first time, used a quantum computer to engineer and directly observe a process critical in chemical reactions by slowing it down by a factor of 100 billion times.</p>
<p>Joint lead researcher and PhD student, Vanessa Olaya Agudelo, said: “It is by understanding these basic processes inside and between molecules that we can open up a new world of possibilities in materials science, drug design, or solar energy harvesting.</p>
<p>“It could also help improve other processes that rely on molecules interacting with light, such as how smog is created or how the ozone layer is damaged.”</p>

			<p>Specifically, the research team witnessed the interference pattern of a single atom caused by a common geometric structure in chemistry called a ‘conical intersection’.</p>
<p>Conical intersections are known throughout chemistry and are vital to rapid photo-chemical processes such as light harvesting in human vision or photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Chemists have tried to directly observe such geometric processes in chemical dynamics since the 1950s, but it is not feasible to observe them directly given the extremely rapid timescales involved.</p>
<p>To get around this problem, quantum researchers in the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-physics.html">School of Physics</a> and the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-chemistry.html">School of Chemistry</a> created an experiment using a trapped-ion quantum computer in a completely new way. This allowed them to design and map this very complicated problem onto a relatively small quantum device ­– and then slow the process down by a factor of 100 billion.</p>
<p>Their research findings are published today in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01300-3"><em>Nature Chemistry</em></a>.</p>
<p>“In nature, the whole process is over within femtoseconds,” said Ms Olaya Agudelo from the School of Chemistry. “That’s a billionth of a millionth – or one quadrillionth – of a second.”</p>
<p>“Using our quantum computer, we built a system that allowed us to slow down the chemical dynamics from femtoseconds to milliseconds. This allowed us to make meaningful observations and measurements.</p>
<p>“This has never been done before.”</p>

			<p>Joint lead author Dr Christophe Valahu from the School of Physics said: “Until now, we have been unable to directly observe the dynamics of ‘geometric phase’; it happens too fast to probe experimentally.</p>
<p>“Using quantum technologies, we have addressed this problem.”</p>
<p>Dr Valahu said it is akin to simulating the air patterns around a plane wing in a wind tunnel.</p>
<p>“Our experiment wasn’t a digital approximation of the process – this was a direct analogue observation of the quantum dynamics unfolding at a speed we could observe,” he said.</p>
<p>In photo-chemical reactions such as photosynthesis, by which plants get their energy from the Sun, molecules transfer energy at lightning speed, forming areas of exchange known as conical intersections.</p>
<p>This study slowed down the dynamics in the quantum computer and revealed the tell-tale hallmarks predicted – but never before seen – associated with conical intersections in photochemistry.</p>

			<p>Co-author and research team leader, <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/ivan-kassal.html">Associate Professor Ivan Kassal</a> from the School of Chemistry and the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/nano/">University of Sydney Nano Institute</a>, said: “This exciting result will help us better understand ultrafast dynamics – how molecules change at the fastest timescales.</p>
<p>“It is tremendous that at the University of Sydney we have access to the country’s best programmable quantum computer to conduct these experiments.”</p>
<p>The quantum computer used to conduct the experiment is in the Quantum Control Laboratory of <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/michael-biercuk.html">Professor Michael Biercuk</a>, the founder of quantum startup, <a href="https://q-ctrl.com/">Q-CTRL</a>. The experimental effort was led by <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/tingrei-tan.html">Dr Ting Rei Tan</a>.</p>
<p>Dr Tan, a co-author of the study, said: “This is a fantastic collaboration between chemistry theorists and experimental quantum physicists. We are using a new approach in physics to tackle a long-standing problem in chemistry.”</p>
