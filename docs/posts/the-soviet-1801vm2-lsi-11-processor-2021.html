    <h1>The Soviet 1801VM2 LSI-11 Processor (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>The Soviet-made 1801VM2 CPU (a binary-compatible implementation of the PDP11 instruction set and QBUS interface) was developed in 1982. The 1801VM2 is a further development of the earlier 1801VM1 doubling the original 5MHz clock speed. From a constructive standpoint this CPU is a completely independent development.</p>

<p>In comparison with 1801VM1, expanded arithmetic instructions (MUL, DIV, ASH, ASHC – part of a the set of PDP-11 EIS), and also operations from the floating point instruction set (FIS) were added. The FIS instructions (FADD, FSUB, FMUL, FDIV) are realized through subroutines – when performing these instructions there is a special type of interrupt and the program handler in memory (“shadow” system ROM K1801RE2) of the console mode is executed, a ‘firmware’ style of FIS implementation, as its not truly hardware (the ROMs break down the FIS instructions into something the 1801VM2 can execute)</p>

<p>The 1801VM2 was the heart of a number models of DVK computer. DVK was developed at the Research Institute of Precision Technology , Zelenograd (just outside of Moscow). The first model DVK-1 was developed in 1981, and released in 1983. Architecturally DVK copies mini-computers from DEC PDC-11 and PDP-11. By 1990, 200,000 DVK computers of the nine different models were produced.</p>

<p>Use of the processor continued well into the 1990’s. The “Romashka” belonged to the latest generation of electronic typewriters, which in their functionality were close to computer text editors. This typewriter made it possible to automatically format text (set alignment, change the spacing between characters and between lines, use bold and underlined fonts, etc.) and had an electronic memory of at least one page (3800 bytes).  In the West these half typewriter half computer were called Word Processors, and were quite popular through the 1980’s.   The machine’s control unit was a microcomputer based on the KM1801VM2 processor.</p>

<p>In 1984, the military-grade microprocessor 1806VM2 was released.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock rate: up to 5 MHz</li>
<li>Number of Instructions: 77</li>
<li>Contains 134,636 integral elements</li>
<li>Power consumption: up to 0.025W</li>
</ul>
<p>The 1806VM2 developers fixed the microcode bug present in 1801VM2 (much to the relief, or annoyance of programmers). The 1806VM2 was supplied in a 42-lead dual in-line ceramic package with flat leads, N1806VM2 in a 64-lead CQFP. The rhombus marking on the chips denotes a military-grade device.</p>

<p>In 1990, a radiation-hardened microprocessor was introduced, compatible with the 1806VM2, known as the 1836VM2/N1836VM2.  Just like in other countries, existing code base and known reliability are more of a driver of what the military/industry uses than having the latest and greatest.  There are still MIL-STD-1750A processors being made and used, rad-hard 8051s and 80186s, and Soviet PDP-11 processors right there with them.</p>
