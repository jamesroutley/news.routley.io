      <span>Abstract:</span>  C-rusted is an innovative technology whereby C programs can be (partly)
annotated so as to express: ownership, exclusivity and shareability of
language, system and user-defined resources; dynamic properties of objects and
the way they evolve during program execution; nominal typing and subtyping. The
(partially) annotated C programs can be translated with unmodified versions of
any compilation toolchain capable of processing ISO C code. The annotated C
program parts can be validated by static analysis: if the static analyzer flags
no error, then the annotations are provably coherent among themselves and with
respect to annotated C code, in which case said annotated parts are provably
exempt from a large class of logic, security, and run-time errors.
