    <h1>Ask HN: Resources for General Purpose GPU development on Apple&#39;s M* chips?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While Apple M* chips seems to have an incredible unified memory access, the available learning resources seem to be quite restricted and often convoluted. Has anyone been able to get past this barrier? 
I have some familiarity with general purpose software development with CUDA and C++. I want to figure how to work with/ use Apple&#39;s developer resources for general purpose programming.</p></div></div>
