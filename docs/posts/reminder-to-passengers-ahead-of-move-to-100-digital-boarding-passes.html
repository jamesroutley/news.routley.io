    <h1>Reminder to passengers ahead of move to 100% digital boarding passes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Ryanair, Europe’s No.1 airline, today (Thurs, 6 Nov) reminded passengers that from Wed (12 Nov) it will move to 100% digital boarding passes.<em> </em>This means that from Wed (12 Nov) passengers will no longer be able to download and print a physical paper boarding pass but will instead need to use the digital boarding pass generated in their “myRyanair” app during check-in to board their Ryanair flight.</p>



<p>This transition, already adopted by nearly 80% of Ryanair’s 207M+ annual passengers, will deliver a faster, smarter, and greener travel experience. It will also give passengers easier access to a range of innovative in-app features, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Order to Seat:</strong> Order food and drinks from your phone and get served first.</li>



<li><strong>Live Flight Information:</strong> Real-time status updates on boarding, gates, and delays.</li>



<li><strong>Direct Updates:</strong> Instant notifications from Ryanair’s operations centre during disruption.</li>



<li><strong>Alternative Flight Options:</strong> Real-time alternative flight options during disruption.</li>



<li><strong>Travel Documents:</strong> accessible in one convenient place. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ryanair CMO, Dara Brady, said:</strong></p>



<p><em>“We are now just a little less than a week out from our move to 100% digital boarding passes, meaning that from Wednesday, 12 November, passengers will no longer be able to download and print a physical paper boarding pass but will instead need to use the digital boarding pass generated in their “myRyanair” app during check-in to board their Ryanair flight.</em></p>



<p><em>While over 80% of passengers already use digital boarding passes, and therefore won’t be affected by this progressive change, we remind the small number of passengers who still print boarding passes to download the myRyanair app ahead of the move to 100% digital boarding passes from Wednesday, 12 November.</em></p>



<p><em>Moving fully digital means a faster, smarter, and greener experience for passengers, whilst also providing easier access to a range of innovative in-app features, including ‘Order to Seat’, live flight information and direct updates during disruption. We look forward to delivering an enhanced travel experience for 100% of our customers, streamlined through our best-in-class myRyanair app.”</em></p>
