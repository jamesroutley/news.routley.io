    <h1>frood, an Alpine initramfs NAS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>My NAS, <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Frood?ref=words.filippo.io">frood</a>, has a bit of a weird setup. It’s just one big initramfs containing a whole Alpine Linux system. It’s delightful and I am not sure why it’s not more common.</p>
<ul>
<li>As long as the bootloader can find the kernel and initramfs, the machine comes up cleanly.</li>
<li>A/B deployments and rollbacks are just a matter of choosing a different boot option.</li>
<li>The system is defined declaratively in the git repo that builds the initramfs.</li>
<li>Importantly to me, it’s not defined in some complex DSL: if I want a file to exist at <code>/etc/example.conf</code> I put it in <code>root/etc/example.conf</code>, and the rest is done by a few hundred lines of scripts I can (and have) read.</li>
<li>Configuring it doesn’t look any different than configuring any regular Alpine system.</li>
<li>I can test the next deploy with a qemu oneliner.</li>
<li>There are very very few moving parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this already sounds appealing, you can skip to the “How it works” section below.</p>
<h2 id="but-why">But why</h2>
<p>I’ve always liked running systems from memory: it’s fast and prevents wear on the system storage device, which is often some janky SD card, because the good drives are dedicated to the ZFS pool.</p>
<p>However, you immediately have the problem of how to persist configuration changes.</p>
<p>Alpine’s answer to this is “<a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Diskless_Mode?ref=words.filippo.io">diskless mode</a>” where any customization is kept in an overlay file. After boot, the stock system looks for a file matching <code>*.apkovl</code> in all available filesystems, applies it, and then installs any missing apk packages from a local cache.</p>
<p>The first problem with that is complexity: the tool to generate and manage the apkovl, <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_local_backup?ref=words.filippo.io">lbu(1)</a>, is pretty good but that process has <em>a lot</em> of moving parts. Find the apkovl, apply it, mount the filesystems in the new fstab, install the missing apks, resume the boot process. Over the past year, I had this break multiple times, either because <a href="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/14624?ref=words.filippo.io">it couldn’t find the filesystem anymore</a> or because the apks did not get installed. The boot process depends on the package manager!</p>
<p>The second problem is that I would really like the state of the system to be tracked in git. Graham Christensen has a very good pitch for declarative or immutable systems in “<a href="https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/?ref=words.filippo.io">Erase your darlings</a>”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I erase my systems at every boot.</p>
<p>Over time, a system collects state on its root partition. This state lives in assorted directories like <code>/etc</code> and <code>/var</code>, and represents every under-documented or out-of-order step in bringing up the services.</p>
<p>“Right, run <code>myapp-init</code>.”</p>
<p>These small, inconsequential “oh, oops” steps are the pieces that get lost and don’t appear in your runbooks.</p>
<p>“Just download ca-certificates to … to fix …”</p>
<p>Each of these quick fixes leaves you doomed to repeat history in three years when you’re finally doing that dreaded RHEL 7 to RHEL 8 upgrade.</p>
<p>“Oh, touch <code>/etc/ipsec.secrets</code> or the l2tp tunnel won’t work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to solve that by making (most) changes via Ansible, but then I had a multi-layer situation where I needed to make a change in Ansible, then deploy it, then save it with lbu to the apkovl.</p>
<p>There are of course many alternatives for declarative systems: from <a href="https://nixos.org/?ref=words.filippo.io">NixOS</a> (which <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3l76qq2gwdz2h?ref=words.filippo.io">just doesn’t sound fun</a>) to <a href="https://gokrazy.org/?ref=words.filippo.io">gokrazy</a> (which is <a href="https://abyssdomain.expert/@zekjur@mas.to/113338344895999793?ref=words.filippo.io">not quite ready to ship ZFS</a>) to embedded toolchains like <a href="https://buildroot.org/?ref=words.filippo.io">buildroot</a> or the newer <a href="https://u-root.org/?ref=words.filippo.io">u-root</a>.</p>
<p>Thing is though, I really like Alpine: a simple, well-packaged, lightweight, GNU-less Linux distribution. What I don’t like are its init and persistence mechanisms.</p>
<p><img src="https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-22.13.37.png" alt="a screenshot of four texts saying &#34;yeah I think all my objections to Alpine are basically its flaky init and its persistency mechanism&#34; &#34;if I run apk at build time to make a chonky initramfs, write 300 lines to replace init, I might be golden&#34; &#34;all of the mkinitfs complexity and flakyness is in finding the modules, loading them, finding the root, finding the apk cache, installing it&#34; &#34;all of that goes poof”" loading="lazy"/></p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>When it boots, Linux expects an <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html?ref=words.filippo.io">“initramfs” image</a>. It’s a simple <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html?ref=words.filippo.io#why-cpio-rather-than-tar">cpio</a> archive of the files that make up the very first root filesystem at boot. <em>Usually</em> the job of this system is to load enough modules to mount the real rootfs and pivot into it. Nothing stops us from putting the entire system in it, though! Who needs a rootfs?</p>
<h3 id="building-an-initramfs">Building an initramfs</h3>
<p>The starting point is <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/alpine-make-rootfs?ref=words.filippo.io">alpine-make-rootfs</a>, which is a short (~500 lines) script meant to build a container image. It’s really 90% of what we need.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
set -e

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alpinelinux/alpine-make-rootfs/v0.7.0/alpine-make-rootfs \
    &amp;&amp; echo &#39;e09b623054d06ea389f3a901fd85e64aa154ab3a  alpine-make-rootfs&#39; | sha1sum -c &amp;&amp; \
    chmod +x alpine-make-rootfs

ROOTFS_DEST=$(mktemp -d)

# Stop mkinitfs from running during apk install.
mkdir -p &#34;$ROOTFS_DEST/etc/mkinitfs&#34;
echo &#34;disable_trigger=yes&#34; &gt; &#34;$ROOTFS_DEST/etc/mkinitfs/mkinitfs.conf&#34;

export ALPINE_BRANCH=edge
export SCRIPT_CHROOT=yes
export FS_SKEL_DIR=root
export FS_SKEL_CHOWN=root:root
PACKAGES=&#34;$(cat packages)&#34;
export PACKAGES
./alpine-make-rootfs &#34;$ROOTFS_DEST&#34; setup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>alpine-make-rootfs will copy the files from the <code>root</code> directory, install the packages from the <code>packages</code> file, and run the <code>setup.sh</code> script in a chroot.</p>
<p>Then, we extract the boot directory and package the rest into an initramfs archive.</p>
<pre><code>cd &#34;$ROOTFS_DEST&#34;
mv boot &#34;$IMAGE_DEST&#34;
find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip &gt; &#34;$IMAGE_DEST/initramfs-lts&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>That’s truly very nearly it! It’s impressive how Alpine lends itself to this with practically no hacks.</p>
<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
<p>The packages we install are the usual stuff you’d install on a server. Only a few are noteworthy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/alpine-base?ref=words.filippo.io">alpine-base</a> is the metapackage that installs apk, busybox, openrc, and a few config files.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/linux-lts?ref=words.filippo.io">linux-lts</a> is the kernel, along with its modules. I considered thinning down the modules to only the ones I needed, but it’s ultimately a lot of hacks just to save a couple hundred MB. Note there is no modloop! The modules are always available.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/linux-firmware-i915?ref=words.filippo.io">linux-firmware-i915</a> is the i915 folder of Linux firmware. Need to install at least one package providing <code>linux-firmware-any</code> (including <code>linux-firmware-none</code>) or <code>linux-firmware</code> gets installed, which installs them all.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/intel-ucode?ref=words.filippo.io">intel-ucode</a> is the microcode update. It installs a file in <code>/boot</code> that can be used as a pre-initramfs. This is in fact easier to set up than on bigger systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/syslinux?ref=words.filippo.io">syslinux</a> is the bootloader. Way simpler than GRUB, it installs in the filesystem partition, and then boots the kernel from that partition. This closes the loop: as long as we boot the right partition, there is no way for anything but our system to load. Nothing in the boot process needs to discover <em>or even give a name to</em> a filesystem.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/openrc-init?ref=words.filippo.io">openrc-init</a> is the init. Alpine doesn’t actually use OpenRC’s init, it uses the one from busybox, but I found OpenRC’s easier to set up. Note though that <a href="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues/16562?ref=words.filippo.io">it doesn’t work with busybox’s shutdown/reboot/poweroff commands</a> so you need to use <code>openrc-shutdown</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/agetty?ref=words.filippo.io">agetty</a> if you plan to ever connect a keyboard and screen.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setup-script">Setup script</h3>
<p>The <code>setup.sh</code> script is also nothing special. We just need to link <code>/init</code>, set up the run-levels, and set the root password. (Yes, that’s my actual password hash. No you won’t break it.)</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
set -e

ln -s /sbin/openrc-init /init

rc-update add devfs sysinit
rc-update add dmesg sysinit

EOF
</code></pre>
<p>In practice I set up a few more services here, but they are not needed to run the system. This is just where you declaratively specify how the system is configured.</p>
<h3 id="root-skeleton">Root skeleton</h3>
<p>The root skeleton is similarly system-specific, and it’s so nice to be able to drop files into the image just by creating them. For example, if I want something to run at boot, I just add a file to <code>root/etc/local.d/</code>.</p>
<p>A few noteworthy files in the skeleton.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
openrc-shutdown -p now
</code></pre>
<p><code>root/etc/acpi/PWRF/00000080</code> makes the power button work with openrc-init.</p>
<p><code>root/etc/network/interfaces</code> and <code>root/etc/hostname</code> and <code>root/etc/hosts</code> get the network to work.</p>
<p><code>root/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</code> and <code>root/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub</code> and <code>root/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> for obvious reasons.</p>
<pre><code>sshd_disable_keygen=yes
</code></pre>
<p><code>root/etc/conf.d/sshd</code> avoids generating non-Ed25519 host keys.</p>
<p>Finally, a bit of persistence for the two things that truly can’t do without it: the RNG seed (arguably not necessary with hardware randomness) and Tailscale (which really doesn’t know how to run without persistence, alas). Rigorously UUID mounted.</p>
<pre><code>UUID=B61B-19E7   /media/usb   vfat   noatime,rw,fmask=177 0 0
</code></pre>
<p><code>root/etc/fstab</code></p>
<pre><code>seed_dir=/media/usb/persist/seedrng
</code></pre>
<p><code>root/etc/conf.d/seedrng</code></p>
<pre><code>TAILSCALED_OPTS=&#34;-state /media/usb/persist/tailscaled.state&#34;
</code></pre>
<p><code>root/etc/conf.d/tailscale</code></p>
<h3 id="qemu-testing">qemu testing</h3>
<p>Here’s something beautiful about this setup: you can meaningfully test it in qemu by just pointing it at the kernel and initramfs. Even works emulated on my arm64 M2.</p>
<pre><code>qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4G -kernel &#34;images/$image/vmlinuz-lts&#34; \
    -initrd &#34;images/$image/initramfs-lts&#34; -append &#34;console=ttyS0&#34; \
    -nographic -device qemu-xhci -device usb-storage,drive=usbstick \
    -drive if=none,id=usbstick,file=usb_disk.img,format=raw
</code></pre>
<p>This includes a persistence device that I formatted with the same UUID as the production one. Since Tailscale configuration is in there, the qemu image comes up as a different Tailscale device, and I can SSH into it separately.</p>
<h3 id="bootloader">Bootloader</h3>
<p>Installing or updating the bootloader is done from the system itself with <code>extlinux</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf /media/usb/boot/syslinux
mkdir -p /media/usb/boot/syslinux

cp /usr/share/syslinux/*.c32 /media/usb/boot/syslinux/

extlinux --install /media/usb/boot/syslinux

cat &gt; /media/usb/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg &lt;&lt;EOF
PROMPT 0

LABEL new

INITRD /boot/intel-ucode.img-new,/boot/initramfs-lts-new
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>We have three boot entries: regular, old, and new. When deploying a new version of the system, we rsync it over, and then use <code>extlinux --once</code> to select it for the next boot.</p>
<pre><code>rsync -Pv &#34;$image/vmlinuz-lts&#34; root@frood:/media/usb/boot/vmlinuz-lts-new
rsync -Pv &#34;$image/initramfs-lts&#34; root@frood:/media/usb/boot/initramfs-lts-new
rsync -Pv &#34;$image/intel-ucode.img&#34; root@frood:/media/usb/boot/intel-ucode.img-new
echo &#34;extlinux --once=new /media/usb/boot/syslinux&#34; | ssh root@frood sh
</code></pre>
<p>If the machine comes up cleanly, then we move the regular image to old, and new to regular. Otherwise, another reboot rolls it back.</p>
<h3 id="a-simple-status-service">A simple status service</h3>
<p>I wanted a simple service to get the status of the system at a glance. There are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3lbn65cmodk2w?ref=words.filippo.io">a million ways</a> to do this, but I chose to write a small Go server. It’s not needed to make this system work, but I am including it to show how easy it is to add a service.</p>
<p>Before the alpine-make-rootfs invocation, I added a couple lines to build all Go binaries in a local module into <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>. Note that even the Go toolchain is selected declaratively from the <code>go.mod</code> thanks to <code>GOTOOLCHAIN=auto</code>.</p>
<pre><code>go env -w GOTOOLCHAIN=auto
go build -C bins -o &#34;$ROOTFS_DEST/usr/local/bin/&#34; ./...
</code></pre>
<p>Then I created <code>root/etc/init.d/srvmonitor</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/sbin/openrc-run
# shellcheck shell=sh

description=&#34;Serve scripts from /etc/monitor.d&#34;
command=/usr/local/bin/srvmonitor
command_background=true
pidfile=&#34;/run/${RC_SVCNAME}.pid&#34;

depend() {
    need net localmount
    after firewall
}
</code></pre>
<p>And finally I added one line to <code>setup.sh</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rc-update add srvmonitor default
</code></pre>
<p>That’s it. The Go server listens on port 80 on the Tailscale IP, and serves the output of scripts I put in <code>/etc/monitor.d/</code>.</p>
<h2 id="frood">frood</h2>
<p>The entire setup <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mostly-harmless/tree/main/frood?ref=words.filippo.io">is open source, in my mostly-harmless repository</a>. You might be interested in how <a href="https://abyssdomain.expert/@filippo/113382333291761248?ref=words.filippo.io">I made ZFS imports work</a>, which is not covered above.</p>
<p>I have not made it into a reusable project partially because there is <em>so little</em> to it. Adding hooks to configure things would easily double its size. I encourage you to just fork it if you’d like.</p>
<p>One thing I haven’t solved yet is how to inject secrets. For now they are just <code>.gitignore</code>’d. Maybe I’ll plug in a YubiKey and use <code>age-plugin-yubikey</code> to decrypt them, and <code>yubikey-agent</code> for the host key. Or maybe this board has a TPM and I can use the simplicity of this system to get a full Secure Boot chain that unlocks TPM keys. That’d be fun.</p>
