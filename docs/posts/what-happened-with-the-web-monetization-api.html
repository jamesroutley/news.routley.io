    <h1>What Happened with the Web Monetization API?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I was <a href="https://css-tricks.com/more-people-dipping-toes-into-web-monetization/">pretty hot on it for a minute</a>. I wanted it to succeed and thought it had the bones to make it. Coil was the main startup trying to push it. They did the right thing by just making it work first, showing there is interest, then pushing to get it standardized. But <a href="https://www.coil.com/">Coil failed</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we started Coil in 2018, Interledger was only an idea. Over the last five years we breathed life into the technology and sparked a vibrant ecosystem around it. Now it’s time to pass the torch to a neutral body in the form of the <a href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger Foundation</a> to steward the future development of Interledger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know much about Interledger. It seems alive-<em>ish</em>? They had a “Summit” recently and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmjeQb79mwQ">I watched some of it</a> but it didn’t do much for my understanding.</p>
<p>Then recently I saw <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@sara/111774573812373512">a good thread</a> from <a href="https://sarafen.com/">Sara</a> including this:</p>

<p>Sara started it by saying that she just wants to “click a little button and send money from me to the person/org/persons operating a website”. Totally! I’m obsessed with that use case. It needs to be built into the browsers and web standards such that it’s incredibly smooth and fast. I wanna send $1 to a website, it happens instantly and anonymously, and the developer can do things around this. Like unlock features! For instance, stop showing ads, offer more complete downloads, unlock tutorial courses, etc. Make it <em>easier</em> and <em>faster</em> than using a credit card.</p>
<p>It appears that the Web Monetization API is up to the task. I friggin’ love the example of how to use it as a developer:</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;!doctype <span>html</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>html</span> <span>lang</span>=<span>&#34;en&#34;</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>charset</span>=<span>&#34;utf-8&#34;</span> /&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>title</span>&gt;</span>My Blog<span>&lt;/<span>title</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>link</span>
      <span>rel</span>=<span>&#34;monetization&#34;</span>
      <span>href</span>=<span>&#34;https://example.com/pay&#34;</span>
      <span>onmonetization</span>=<span>&#34;sayThanks(this)&#34;</span>
    /&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
      <span><span>function</span> <span>sayThanks</span><span>(monetizedLink)</span> </span>{
        
      }
    </span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
<p>And of course there are more APIs, like for checking how much a user contributed, if they have already contributed, etc. </p>
<p>Does it have legs anymore? I just have no idea. Sorry if the title of the post led you to believe I might have an answer. I’m just <em>looking</em> for the answer.</p>
<p>Again though, poking a button to send a website bucks through web standards is a great idea. </p>
<p>I’ll leave it with my favorite use case (removing ads) and what I’ve written before, in hopes that this part can be done right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removing ads is the most basic and obvious use case, and I hope some people give that a healthy try. […] I’d want to clearly be able to control the dollar-level of when you get that perk, but more importantly, in order to really make good on the promise of not delivering ads, you need to know very quickly if any given user is supporting you at the required level or not. For example, you can’t wait 2600 milliseconds to decide whether ads need to be requested. Well, you can, but you’ll wreck your ad revenue. And you can’t simply request the ads and hide them when you find out, lest you are not really making good on a promise, as trackers’n’stuff will have already done their thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/about/">PPK</a> is now DevRel for the Interledger Foundation, so apparently it’s heating up again. The news is that the API will hook up to an online “wallet” powered by <a href="https://fynbos.app/">fynbos</a>. I’ve never heard of it, but it looks like it connects to banks and credit cards, not crypto. It’s not that I’m some big stan for Big Banks, but crypto was (is) just so absolutely riddled with scams and crime that I just can’t anymore. Decoupling the Web Payments API and crypto is certainly the right move right now.</p>
