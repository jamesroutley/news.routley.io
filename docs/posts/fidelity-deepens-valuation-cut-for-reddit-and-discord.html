				<p id="speakable-summary">Fidelity has further slashed the estimated worth of its holding in the social platform Reddit and the chat app Discord as well as SaaS startup Gupshup, giving a preview into how one of the world’s largest asset manager sees the impact of the ongoing slowdown in the public market on privately-held startups.</p>
<p>Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its holdings in Reddit at $15.4 million as of May 31, according to the fund’s monthly disclosure released Friday. That’s down 7.36% from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/fidelity-reddit-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16.6 million mark at April’s closure</a> and altogether a slide of 45.4% since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment in August 2021</a>. The updated share value suggests a $5.5 billion valuation for Reddit.</p>
<p>Fidelity marked down the value of its Discord’s holding to $1.7 million, down 13.4% from a month ago and 47% since the $3.3 million initial investment. (Worth noting that the vast majority of markdown in the value of Reddit and Discord holdings by Fidelity predominantly occurred last year.)</p>
<p>Reddit, which is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/multiple-subreddits-and-moderators-are-now-protesting-reddits-api-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grappling a revolt from moderators</a> of some popular subreddits over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/multiple-subreddits-and-moderators-are-now-protesting-reddits-api-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API cost changes</a>, was valued at $10 billion when the social media giant attracted funds in August 2021. Discord raised funding in September 2021 at a valuation of $15 billion.</p>
<p>The financial giant also readjusted the value of its holding in Twitter to $6.86 million, up from $6.55 million from a month prior, but still down 65% since the original investment. It slashed its holding in SaaS startup Gupshup to $10.15 million, down from $11 million at April’s closure and 38% since the original investment.</p>
