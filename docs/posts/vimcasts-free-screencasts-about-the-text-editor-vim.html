      <p>Yanking and pasting works seemlessly between Neovim’s regular buffers and terminal buffers.
In this video, we’ll look at how the Normal mode paste command works in a terminal buffer, and we’ll create a mapping to help with pasting text directly from Terminal mode.</p>

  <h3>Learn to use Vim efficiently in your Ruby projects</h3>
  <p>
      In association with thoughtbot, one of the most well respected Rails consultancies in the world, I&#39;ve produced a series of screencasts on how to make navigating your Ruby projects with Vim ultra-efficient.
      Along the way, you’ll also learn how to make Ruby blocks a first-class text object in Vim.
      This lets you edit Ruby code at a higher level of abstraction.
