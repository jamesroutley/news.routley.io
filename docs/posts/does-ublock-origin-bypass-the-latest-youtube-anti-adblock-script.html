        <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
        <p>We are currently evaluating if uBlock Origin&#39;s filters have been updated to deal with the latest Anti-Adblocker script. This website doesn&#39;t check your device. It simply compares text files provided by the uBO team to let you know the current status of uBO&#39;s solutions for YouTube.</p>
        
        
            
            
            
        <h2>What should I do now?</h2>
        <p>Please come back later.</p>
                        
        <!--Button to auto-update quick filters.-->
        
        

        <h2>What does this website do?</h2>
        <p>It simply gets the info of the latest <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenhawk8054/misc/main/yt-fix.txt">YT script ID solved by uBlock Origin</a> and compares it against the latest <a href="https://pastefy.app/G1Txv5su/raw">YouTube Anti-Adblocker script ID</a>.
            If it&#39;s the same, then the uBlock Origin team has finally updated their filters. If it&#39;s not, a fix is on the way. This website does not check if your own uBlock Origin version is up-to-date.</p>

        <h2>How can I contribute to this website?</h2>
        <p>You can make changes and pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/drHyperion451/does-uBO-bypass-yt/tree/dev"><code>dev</code></a> branch.</p>
