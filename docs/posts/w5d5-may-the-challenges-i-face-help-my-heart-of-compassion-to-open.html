      <div><p>I&#39;ve been on the job search a few times now, but I still get the emotional swings. I guess it&#39;ll never go away, so the only thing you can do is make the experience less painful.</p><p>I came across this quote by Jack Kornfield on Tim Ferriss&#39; <a href="https://tim.blog/2023/07/30/jack-kornfield-3-transcript/">podcast</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Let suffering teach you compassion because in Tibet, in some of the Tibetan teachings, they actually pray for suffering. They say, &#34;May I be granted enough suffering so that the great heart of compassion will open in me.&#34;</p></blockquote><p>It&#39;s a helpful reframing, to think of the experience as another rep at the emotional gym.</p></div>
