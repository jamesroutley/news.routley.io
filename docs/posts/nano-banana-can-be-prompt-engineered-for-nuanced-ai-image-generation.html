    <h1>Nano Banana can be prompt engineered for nuanced AI image generation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may not have heard about new AI image generation models as much lately, but that doesn’t mean that innovation in the field has stagnated: it’s quite the opposite. <a href="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev">FLUX.1-dev</a> immediately overshadowed the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a> line of image generation models, while leading AI labs have released models such as <a href="https://replicate.com/bytedance/seedream-4">Seedream</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/ideogram-ai/ideogram-v3-turbo">Ideogram</a>, and <a href="https://replicate.com/qwen/qwen-image">Qwen-Image</a>. Google also joined the action with <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/imagen/">Imagen 4</a>. But all of those image models are vastly overshadowed by ChatGPT’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">free image generation support</a> in March 2025. After going <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/openai-ceo-chatgpt-studio-ghibli-ai-images-1236349141/">organically viral</a> on social media with the <code>Make me into Studio Ghibli</code> prompt, ChatGPT became the new benchmark for how most people perceive AI-generated images, for better or for worse. The model has its own image “style” for common use cases, which make it easy to identify that ChatGPT made it.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens_hu13840334073228854249.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens_hu9642028181388950696.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens_hu15202136820295934118.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/chatgpt_gens.webp 1024w" src="https://www.vesto.me/2025/11/12/chatgpt_gens.webp" alt="Two sample generations from ChatGPT. ChatGPT image generations often have a yellow hue in their images. Additionally, cartoons and text often have the same linework and typography."/><figcaption><p>Two sample generations from ChatGPT. ChatGPT image generations often have a yellow hue in their images. Additionally, cartoons and text often have the same linework and typography.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Of note, <code>gpt-image-1</code>, the technical name of the underlying image generation model, is an autoregressive model. While most image generation models are diffusion-based to reduce the amount of compute needed to train and generate from such models, <code>gpt-image-1</code> works by generating tokens in the same way that ChatGPT generates the next token, then decoding them into an image. It’s extremely slow at about 30 seconds to generate each image at the highest quality (the default in ChatGPT), but it’s hard for most people to argue with free.</p><p>In August 2025, a new mysterious text-to-image model appeared on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text-to-image">LMArena</a>: a model code-named “nano-banana”. This model was <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/">eventually publically released by Google</a> as <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/image/">Gemini 2.5 Flash Image</a>, an image generation model that works natively with their Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Unlike Imagen 4, it is indeed autoregressive, generating 1,290 tokens per image. After Nano Banana’s popularity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/">pushed the Gemini app</a> to the top of the mobile App Stores, Google eventually made Nano Banana the colloquial name for the model as it’s definitely more catchy than “Gemini 2.5 Flash Image”.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/ios.webp 296w" src="https://www.vesto.me/2025/11/12/ios.webp#center" alt="The first screenshot on the iOS App Store for the Gemini app." width="25%" height="25%"/><figcaption><p>The first screenshot on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729">iOS App Store</a> for the Gemini app.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I care little about what leaderboards say which image generation AI looks the best. What I do care about is how well the AI adheres to the prompt I provide: if the model can’t follow the requirements I desire for the image—my requirements are often <em>specific</em>—then the model is a nonstarter for my use cases. At the least, if the model does have strong prompt adherence, any “looking bad” aspect can be fixed with prompt engineering and/or traditional image editing pipelines. After running Nano Banana though its paces with my comically complex prompts, I can confirm that thanks to Nano Banana’s robust text encoder, it has such extremely strong prompt adherence that Google has understated how well it works.</p><h2 id="how-to-generate-images-from-nano-banana">How to Generate Images from Nano Banana</h2><p>Like ChatGPT, Google offers methods to generate images for free from Nano Banana. The most popular method is through Gemini itself, either <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">on the web</a> or in an mobile app, by selecting the “Create Image 🍌” tool. Alternatively, Google also offers free generation in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat">Google AI Studio</a> when Nano Banana is selected on the right sidebar, which also allows for setting generation parameters such as image aspect ratio and is therefore my recommendation. In both cases, the generated images have a visible watermark on the bottom right corner of the image.</p><p>For developers who want to build apps that programmatically generate images from Nano Banana, Google offers the <code>gemini-2.5-flash-image</code> endpoint <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash-image">on the Gemini API</a>. Each image generated costs roughly $0.04/image for a 1 megapixel image (e.g. 1024x1024 if a 1:1 square): on par with most modern popular diffusion models despite being autoregressive, and much cheaper than <code>gpt-image-1</code>’s $0.17/image.</p><p>Working with the Gemini API is a pain and requires annoying image encoding/decoding boilerplate, so I wrote and open-sourced a Python package: <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg">gemimg</a>, a lightweight wrapper around Gemini API’s Nano Banana endpoint that lets you generate images with a simple prompt, in addition to handling cases such as image input along with text prompts.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>from</span> <span>gemimg</span> <span>import</span> <span>GemImg</span>

My go-to test case is:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Create an image of a three-dimensional pancake in the shape of a skull, garnished on top with blueberries and maple syrup.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I like this prompt because not only is an absurd prompt that gives the image generation model room to be creative, but the AI model also has to handle the maple syrup and how it would logically drip down from the top of the skull pancake and adhere to the bony breakfast. The result:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU_hu2763368023143779032.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU_hu5784325784934638275.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU_hu6440430231719997140.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU.webp 1024w" src="https://www.vesto.me/2025/11/12/7fm8aJD0Lp6ymtkPpqvn0QU.webp"/></figure><p>That is indeed in the shape of a skull and is indeed made out of pancake batter, blueberries are indeed present on top, and the maple syrup does indeed drop down from the top of the pancake while still adhereing to its unusual shape, albeit some trails of syrup disappear/reappear. It’s one of the best results I’ve seen for this particular test, and it’s one that doesn’t have obvious signs of “AI slop” aside from the ridiculous premise.</p><p>Now, we can try another one of Nano Banana’s touted features: editing. Image editing, where the prompt targets specific areas of the image while leaving everything else as unchanged as possible, has been difficult with diffusion-based models until very recently with <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/flux-kontext">Flux Kontext</a>. Autoregressive models in theory should have an easier time doing so as it has a better understanding of tweaking specific tokens that correspond to areas of the image.</p><p>While most image editing approaches encourage using a single edit command, I want to challenge Nano Banana. Therefore, I gave Nano Banana the generated skull pancake, along with <em>five</em> edit commands simultaneously:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Make ALL of the following edits to the image:
</span></span><span><span>- Put a strawberry in the left eye socket.
</span></span><span><span>- Put a blackberry in the right eye socket.
</span></span><span><span>- Put a mint garnish on top of the pancake.
</span></span><span><span>- Change the plate to a plate-shaped chocolate-chip cookie.
</span></span><span><span>- Add happy people to the background.
</span></span></code></pre></div><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/Yfu8aIfpHufVz7IP4_WEsAc_hu2530120139784384354.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/Yfu8aIfpHufVz7IP4_WEsAc_hu10040310528197400991.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/Yfu8aIfpHufVz7IP4_WEsAc_hu4234659249983822366.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/Yfu8aIfpHufVz7IP4_WEsAc.webp 1024w" src="https://www.vesto.me/2025/11/12/Yfu8aIfpHufVz7IP4_WEsAc.webp"/></figure><p>All five of the edits are implemented correctly with only the necessary aspects changed, such as removing the blueberries on top to make room for the mint garnish, and the pooling of the maple syrup on the new cookie-plate is adjusted. I’m legit impressed. Now we can test more difficult instances of prompt engineering.</p><h2 id="the-good-the-barack-and-the-ugly">The Good, the Barack, and the Ugly</h2><p>One of the most compelling-but-underdiscussed use cases of modern image generation models is being able to put the subject of an input image into another scene. For open-weights image generation models, it’s possible to “train” the models to learn a specific subject or person even if they are not notable enough to be in the original training dataset using a technique such as <a href="https://replicate.com/docs/guides/extend/working-with-loras">finetuning the model with a LoRA</a> using only a few sample images of your desired subject. Training a LoRA is not only very computationally intensive/expensive, but it also requires care and precision and is not guaranteed to work—speaking from experience. Meanwhile, if Nano Banana can achieve the same subject consistency without requiring a LoRA, that opens up many fun oppertunities.</p><p>Way back in 2022, I <a href="https://minimaxir.com/2022/09/stable-diffusion-ugly-sonic/">tested a technique</a> that predated LoRAs known as textual inversion on the original Stable Diffusion in order to add a very important concept to the model: <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ugly-sonic">Ugly Sonic</a>, from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mW9FE5ILJs">initial trailer for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie</a> back in 2019.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/ugly_sonic_2_hu2002268229199463666.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/ugly_sonic_2_hu6718565199842401138.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/ugly_sonic_2_hu16727248490479852133.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/ugly_sonic_2.webp 2048w" src="https://www.vesto.me/2025/11/12/ugly_sonic_2.webp"/></figure><p>One of the things I really wanted Ugly Sonic to do is to shake hands with former U.S. President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a>, but that didn’t quite work out as expected.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/59aec00fb3f1e797_hu9380676553791965051.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/59aec00fb3f1e797_hu10280365710318650849.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/59aec00fb3f1e797.webp 768w" src="https://www.vesto.me/2025/11/12/59aec00fb3f1e797.webp" alt="2022 was a now-unrecognizable time where absurd errors in AI were celebrated."/><figcaption><p>2022 was a now-unrecognizable time where absurd errors in AI were celebrated.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Can the real Ugly Sonic finally shake Obama’s hand?

That said, there are still issues: the color grading/background blur is too “aesthetic” and less photorealistic, Ugly Sonic has gloves, and the Ugly Sonic is insufficiently lanky.</p><p>Back in the days of Stable Diffusion, the use of prompt engineering buzzwords such as <code>hyperrealistic</code>, <code>trending on artstation</code>, and <code>award-winning</code> to generate “better” images in light of weak prompt text encoders were very controversial because it was difficult both subjectively and intuitively to determine if they actually generated better pictures. Obama shaking Ugly Sonic’s hand would be a historic event. What would happen if it were covered by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>? I added <code>Pulitzer-prize-winning cover photo for the The New York Times</code> to the previous prompt:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/P17saPyAD63iqtsPwIC_qAY_hu13612633179784444149.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/P17saPyAD63iqtsPwIC_qAY_hu17940574390438898663.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/P17saPyAD63iqtsPwIC_qAY_hu6622068553098998220.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/P17saPyAD63iqtsPwIC_qAY.webp 1184w" src="https://www.vesto.me/2025/11/12/P17saPyAD63iqtsPwIC_qAY.webp"/></figure><p>So there’s a few notable things going on here:</p><ul><li>That is the most cleanly-rendered New York Times logo I’ve ever seen.

Again, there aren’t many obvious signs of AI generation here: Ugly Sonic clearly has five fingers!</p><p>That’s enough Ugly Sonic for now, but let’s recall what we’ve observed so far.</p><h2 id="the-link-between-nano-banana-and-gemini-25-flash">The Link Between Nano Banana and Gemini 2.5 Flash</h2><p>There are two noteworthy things in the prior two examples: the use of a Markdown dashed list to indicate rules when editing, and the fact that specifying <code>Pulitzer-prize-winning cover photo for the The New York Times.</code> as a buzzword did indeed improve the composition of the output image.</p><p>Many don’t know how image generating models actually encode text. In the case of the original Stable Diffusion, it used <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32">CLIP</a>, whose <a href="https://openai.com/index/clip/">text encoder</a> open-sourced by OpenAI in 2021 which unexpectedly paved the way for modern AI image generation. It is extremely primitive relative to modern standards for transformer-based text encoding, and only has a context limit of 77 tokens: a couple sentences, which is sufficient for the image captions it was trained on but not nuanced input. Some modern image generators use <a href="https://huggingface.co/google-t5/t5-base">T5</a>, an even older experimental text encoder released by Google that supports 512 tokens. Although modern image models can compensate for the age of these text encoders through robust data annotation during training the underlying image models, the text encoders cannot compensate for highly nuanced text inputs that fall outside the domain of general image captions.</p><p>A marquee feature of <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/">Gemini 2.5 Flash</a> is its support for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/29/agentic-coding/">agentic coding</a> pipelines; to accomplish this, the model must be trained on extensive amounts of Markdown (which define code repository <code>README</code>s and agentic behaviors in <code>AGENTS.md</code>) and JSON (which is used for structured output/function calling/MCP routing). Additionally, Gemini 2.5 Flash was also explictly trained to understand objects within images, giving it the ability to create nuanced <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/conversational-image-segmentation-gemini-2-5/">segmentation masks</a>. Nano Banana’s multimodal encoder, as an extension of Gemini 2.5 Flash, should in theory be able to leverage these properties to handle prompts beyond the typical image-caption-esque prompts. That’s not to mention the vast annotated image training datasets Google owns as a byproduct of Google Images and likely trained Nano Banana upon, which should allow it to semantically differentiate between an image that is <code>Pulitzer Prize winning</code> and one that isn’t, as with similar buzzwords.</p><p>Let’s give Nano Banana a relatively large and complex prompt, drawing from the learnings above and see how well it adheres to the nuanced rules specified by the prompt:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Create an image featuring three specific kittens in three specific positions.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>All of the kittens MUST follow these descriptions EXACTLY:
</span></span><span><span>- Left: a kitten with prominent black-and-silver fur, wearing both blue denim overalls and a blue plain denim baseball hat.
</span></span><span><span>- Middle: a kitten with prominent white-and-gold fur and prominent gold-colored long goatee facial hair, wearing a 24k-carat golden monocle.
</span></span><span><span>- Right: a kitten with prominent #9F2B68-and-#00FF00 fur, wearing a San Franciso Giants sports jersey.
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>Aspects of the image composition that MUST be followed EXACTLY:

I suspect that if precedent is set from <a href="https://www.mckoolsmith.com/newsroom-ailitigation-38">existing IP lawsuits against OpenAI and Midjourney</a>, Google will be in line to be sued.</p><p>Another note is moderation of generated images, particularly around NSFW content, which always important to check if your application uses untrusted user input. As with most image generation APIs, moderation is done against both the text prompt and the raw generated image. That said, while running my standard test suite for new image generation models, I found that Nano Banana is surprisingly one of the more lenient AI APIs. With some deliberate prompts, I can confirm that it is possible to generate NSFW images through Nano Banana—obviously I cannot provide examples.</p><p>I’ve spent a very large amount of time overall with Nano Banana and although it has a lot of promise, some may ask why I am writing about how to use it to create highly-specific high-quality images during a time where generative AI has threatened creative jobs. The reason is that information asymmetry between what generative image AI can and can’t do has only grown in recent months: many still think that ChatGPT is the only way to generate images and that all AI-generated images are wavy AI slop with a piss yellow filter. The only way to counter this perception is though evidence and reproducibility. That is why not only am I releasing Jupyter Notebooks detailing the image generation pipeline for each image in this blog post, but why I also included the prompts in this blog post proper; I apologize that it padded the length of the post to 26 minutes, but it’s important to show that these image generations are as advertised and not the result of AI boosterism. You can copy these prompts and paste them into <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat">AI Studio</a> and get similar results, or even hack and iterate on them to find new things. Most of the prompting techniques in this blog post are already well-known by AI engineers far more skilled than myself, and turning a blind eye won’t stop people from using generative image AI in this manner.</p><p>I didn’t go into this blog post expecting it to be a journey, but sometimes the unexpected journeys are the best journeys. There are <em>many</em> cool tricks with Nano Banana I cut from this blog post due to length, such as providing an image to specify character positions and also investigations of styles such as pixel art that most image generation models struggle with, but Nano Banana now nails. These prompt engineering shenanigans are only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p><em>Jupyter Notebooks for the generations used in this post are split between the <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg">gemimg repository</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/nano-banana-tests">second testing repository</a>.</em></p></div></div>
