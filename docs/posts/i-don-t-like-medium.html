    <h1>I Don&#39;t Like Medium</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>When Medium arrived on the Internet it was seen (or probably more pertinently, sold) as harkening a new era for content publishers all over to take back the reigns of blogging and easily and freely share their thoughts to the world.</p>
<p>It had this cool and novel feature for the time, called highlights. Users can highlight some text and a toolbar would appear with options to Tweet it and maybe do other things like post a comment which quotes it.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a random Medium blog that I found:</p>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Medium article" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/sdgluck-1654758687.png"/></p>
<hr/>
<p>50% of the page is filled with cruft, encircled in red. All I care about as a reader is the stuff in the green box, the actual article content.</p>
<p>It&#39;s even worse when you reach your &#34;free member-only stories&#34; limit. The articles become locked-out with a box that looks like this:</p>
<hr/>
<p><img alt="Medium article locked-out" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/sdgluck-1654793747.png"/></p>
<hr/>
<p>It says I can continue to read if I sign up. So that&#39;s what I did. But then...</p>
<hr/>

<p>I have been tricked into creating an account! This is a dark pattern, and I don&#39;t like it.</p>
<p>On a device with &#34;slow 3G&#34; (a mode that can be enabled in Chrome DevTools) this page took a whopping 42 seconds to settle. It requested a total of 106 external resources over the network, which is less concerning as most of the modern web uses HTTP multiplexing these days. For what amounts to a blog article, I can&#39;t find enough reasons that justify such high numbers.</p>
<p>On &#34;fast 3G&#34; it took 15 seconds which isn&#39;t nearly as bad, but still isn&#39;t great. On the global average mobile connection speed of ~30Mbps (as of writing this), it took 6 seconds. That&#39;s more reasonable but still quite a wait for what amounts to a webpage with some text and images on it.</p>
<p>I like the Bear platform because it does exactly what I want a blogging platform to do and nothing more. It has a text box for your text, and then it puts that text on a webpage. What else do you need? Leave content syndication to others. That is already a solved problem by Reddit, Hacker News, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Though Bear does have a &#34;discovery feed&#34;, it doesn&#39;t take 5+ seconds to load.</p>
<p>I understand there is need for content creators to be able to easily publish their thoughts online, and platforms like Medium provide not only that, but a way to monetise their content too. Thinking out loud is important. I enjoy reading other people&#39;s thoughts. I just don&#39;t like reading them on Medium.</p>
