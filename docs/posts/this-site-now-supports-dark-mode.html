<p>Inspired by <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/dark-mode/">Charles
Eckman’s recent blog post</a>, I’ve added dark mode support to my
website. This post talks about some of the implementation details, and
how I used ChatGPT to teach myself enough CSS to make it to the finish
line.</p>
<h2 id="colors-colors-everywhere">Colors, colors everywhere!</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, the code change is actually really easy. You replace
every single color in your CSS with a CSS variable, and then declare
your light mode/dark mode color scheme using a <code>@media</code>
selector.</p>
<pre><code>:root {
  --background-color: #fff;
  --text-color: #000;
  /* ... more colors ... */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background-color: #222;
    --text-color: #eee;
    /* ... more colors ... */
    }
}

body {
    color: var(--text-color);
    background-color: var(--background-color);
}</code></pre>
<p>The actual hard part is hunting down every single color in your
site’s CSS. I’d been using Pure.css as kind of a “I really do not want
to think about CSS” layer, and the Pure CSS had at least 60 different
colors. I could have whipped out some regex to transform it all, but
instead I decided to just rip out Pure entirely. It turns out that I
didn’t need it at all. CSS has gotten a lot, lot better since I first
did my site’s CSS. Chrome’s inspector tools were incredibly useful for
hunting down which rule was actually responsible for something I was
seeing, so I could copy over the relevant snippet from Pure.</p>
<p>The second most annoying part is hunting down all the small things
you don’t normally think about, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the subtle highlighting effect when you hover over my site header
menu</li>
<li>the blue color of a link (and the purple of a clicked link), and
then trying to replicate the “feel” of those blues and purples in a dark
mode context.</li>
<li>the odd-even highlighting effect of my striped data tables in places
like the <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/factobattery/">Factobattery essay</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, syntax highlighting in code snippets was mildly annoying,
but mostly because highlight.js is bloated and tries to support every
language in existence. (No, I do not particularly care to define a color
for syntax highlighting BNF grammars or verilog. You’ll node that the
CSS snippet above isn’t syntax highlighted correctly, and that’s because
I have better things to do.)</p>
<p>KaTeX compiled output turned out to be a non-issue - it just inherits
the color/background color of normal text. I also did not attempt to
invert any image colors; you’re just going to have to deal with blocks
of color in images.</p>
<p>Finally, I did this dark mode writeup… well, in the dark, so I could
actually see how my colors looked when my laptop monitor was turned down
to its lowest setting, in a dark room.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-css-tutor">ChatGPT, CSS Tutor</h2>
<p>I do not think I would have had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">spoons</a> to make it
through this dark mode project if I did not have ChatGPT to act as a
tutor. What could have been 30 minutes of head-banging turned into a 1
minute read through ChatGPT’s explanation of how
<code>table.striped th</code> differed from
<code>table .striped th</code>. Other questions I asked ChatGPT, for
which it gave me nearly perfect answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>how would I use css to reset the styling on an &lt;a&gt; link
element? I want it to look black, no underline like normal text</li>
<li>(after getting back an answer recommending setting color: black) is
the default text color actually black or is there some “unset” color
that I should be using?</li>
<li>how do I write css to make alternating table rows gray / white?</li>
<li>how can I use python watchdog to monitor a directory and do
something to any changed files?</li>
<li>is there a way to have two observers watching different directories?
how would I have to change the <code>if __main__</code> section to wait
on both observers?</li>
<li>How would I concisely express these two CSS rules as one combo rule?
table .striped td, table .striped th</li>
<li>why doesn’t it work to do table .striped td, th</li>
<li>what is the selector for a &lt;th&gt; element nested under a
&lt;table class=“striped”&gt;? (here’s where I finally figured out what
noob mistake I was making.)</li>
<li>does it matter if there’s a space between table and .striped</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these questions, “python watchdog” and “alternating table rows
gray/white” is one that would have been easily answerable by Google.
Even then, I only asked the basic python watchdog question so that I
could set up the context to add my followup question. ChatGPT’s ability
to answer very specific clarifying questions in the context of previous
Q/A pairs is just such a transformative experience. Can you imagine
trying to ask Google “does it matter if there’s a space between table
and .striped”? No need to imagine, just ask Google. Absolutely
useless.</p>
<p>I’ve been increasingly working this way with ChatGPT and there is
very much an educational revolution just waiting to happen here.</p>
