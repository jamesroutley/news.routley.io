    <h1>Why did these algae grow like this in the pool?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>A great many curves (described by exponentials, logarithms, powers, trigonometric functions, etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureqa" rel="noreferrer">might be fit</a> to the contour of any particular natural phenomenon. Alternatively, there are published &#34;atlases&#34; of surfaces of revolution:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SsiE5.png" width="500"/></p><p>Undirected curve-fitting and shape-matching can provide a useful closed-form analytical expression but may not provide insight into the underlying processes.</p>
<p>As an alternative, we might propose a hypothesis based on biophysical principles and see where it takes us.</p>
<p>Although I&#39;ve never studied algae growth specifically, based on a research background in mechanical engineering, materials science and biophysics, it occurs to me that the features resemble at least two other distinct features, and a commenter has helpfully described a third scenario:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>The constant-stress hanging rod loaded by self-weight only.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IyvbN.png"/></p><p>(All images from quick online searches of the relevant keywords.)</p>
<p>A classic statics problem is to design a rod or wire, hanging from its own weight, such that its internal stress is everywhere constant. Here, the cross-section area must increase when moving up because the applied weight progressively increases. This problem has enormous importance in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator#Cable_section" rel="noreferrer">prospective design of a space elevator</a>, where we find that existing materials would require an impossibly large cross section for the required height.</p>
<p>To summarize the problem, for a height-dependent radius <span>$r(z)$</span>, the weight below any vertical position <span>$z$</span> is <span>$W(z)=\int_0^z \rho\pi r(z^\prime)^2\,dz^\prime$</span>, with material density <span>$\rho$</span> (<span>$z^\prime$</span> is a dummy variable). Equivalently, the extra weight per vertical slice <span>$dz$</span> is <span>$dW=\rho\pi r(z)^2 dz$</span>. We require that <span>$\frac{W(z)}{\pi r(z)^2}$</span> is a constant stress <span>$\sigma$</span>.</p>
<p>What function solves <span>$\frac{dr(z)}{dz}=\frac{\rho r(z)}{2\sigma}$</span>? The exponential <span>$r(z)\sim\exp\left(\frac{\rho z}{2\sigma}\right)$</span>, and this provides an exponential/logarithm surface of revolution.</p>
<p><strong>What does this have to do with algae growth?</strong> Assuming the algae is buoyant, upward movement is spontaneous, and thus we might expect vertical stringers of algae  to form. But the vertical and bending stresses arising from gentle water motion could prompt proliferation in a mechanosensitive manner, in the same way that plants strengthen in the wind. Perhaps vertical assemblies of algae efficiently evolve to a stable level of constant stress, similar to our bones:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nVsrv.png"/></p><p><strong>So the first hypothesis is that the algae features taper because of an intrinsic or externally imposed requirement for near-constant stress.</strong> This allows equations to be derived as described above. If the underlying biological behavior is confirmed and if the features are similar to the predictions, then we might be prepared to present an argument for causality, subject to strict and rigorous examination through experiment.</p>
<p>(2) <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite_(crystal)" rel="noreferrer">Dendrite</a> growth during solidification or precipitation</strong></p>
<p>In a supersaturated solution or supercooled melt, protruding dendrites spontaneously form because any region that randomly pokes out a bit is exposed on more sides to material with a driving force to join it:</p>
