    <h1>Local-First From Scratch, part 1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, December 17, 2024</em></p><p>Since around Thanksgiving, I&#39;ve been working on the draft of a book I&#39;m tentatively calling &#34;Local-First from Scratch.&#34; The idea is basically to write <a href="https://bytes.zone/projects/tinyping/">tinyping</a>, but do it in book form.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>One thing I had to decide right away was whether this would use some off-the-shell local-first library or if I was going to explain and implement everything from first principles. I chose the latter, which I think will make for a more interesting read, and has a nice side benefit that it doesn&#39;t tie the book to the libraries and frameworks that are popular (or exist!) today. Hopefully that will mean that it stays pretty evergreen!</p><p>This choice has also made me dive deeply into the theory behind CRDTs. I&#39;ve found a lot of things that I just misunderstood on previous learning expeditions, just by following the little voice in my head that says &#34;heyâ€¦ is that right, actually?&#34; I want to get things right so that I&#39;m not misleading people, and that turns out to be a pretty powerful motivator for learning!</p><p>I hope that I can ship a first beta version to a small group of readers in the first couple of months of 2025. If you&#39;re interested, please get in touch!</p><p>Here&#39;s a basic outline:</p><ol><li><strong>Introduction:</strong> a similar pitch to what I just wrote above, but less meta.</li><li><strong>Foundations:</strong> what we&#39;re building, why local-first, and what are CRDTs?</li><li><strong>Breaking Ground:</strong> Implementing some basic CRDTs (and logical clocks)</li><li><strong>Building an App:</strong> Modeling the data in our app based on the building blocks we just implemented.</li><li><strong>First Client:</strong> Building a TUI to be able to use the app model we just made.</li><li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Building a server to synchronize data between replicas.</li><li><strong>Second Client:</strong> Building a browser-based client using the same codebase and sync server, and extending the app model to support time reporting.</li><li><strong>Sync Revisited:</strong> Making the sync protocol way more efficient by only sending the parts of the data that have changed.</li><li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> What we&#39;ve learned, what we could do next, and where to go from here.</li><li><strong>Appendix, Sequence CRDTs:</strong> Extending our CRDT building blocks to support sequences.</li></ol></article></div>
