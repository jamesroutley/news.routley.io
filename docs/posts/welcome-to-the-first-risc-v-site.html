    <h1>Welcome to the First RISC-V Site</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>You&#39;ve made it to the world&#39;s first website hosted on a RISC-V computer that serves up multimedia. In fact, it could be the only one, but this should hopefully change in the future.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hosting this site on a LicheePi, a RISC-V SBC (Single Board Computer) that costs only $26 USD. What do you get for only 26 Freedom Bucks?
</p><ul>
<li>One C906 core running at 1 GHz</li>
<li>512MB of memory</li>
<li>One micro SD card slot</li>
<li>One WiFi chip</li>
<li>One USB port</li>
<li>One HDMI port</li>
<li>Lots of GPIO pins</li>
<li>That&#39;s it!</li>
</ul>
That doesn&#39;t look like a lot, and it isn&#39;t. In fact, this C906 CPU core is only in-order. This means that if some program needs to access some memory, everything stops until that memory gets accessed, which makes for an extremely slow experience. What&#39;s more important is what you can do with all you have, however.

<p>I have this LicheePi board plugged into a power strip that&#39;s shared with my main PC, and connected to my WiFi network as there are no USB ethernet drivers in the kernel it&#39;s running. The WiFi hardware yields a speed of about 30 megabits, which is not great yet not terrible. I actually guessed this at first and later found out with iperf that it was exactly 30 megabits. What a coincidence! The board is running Armbian Linux and I access it over SSH. Why? This is because SSH lets you go anywhere, but more
importantly, SSH doesn&#39;t take much processing power, in comparison to a display which consumes almost everything. Remember, I never claimed that the LicheePi had a GPU to use (see above), so it needs to render everything in the framebuffer with the CPU. It turns out that there is in fact a &#34;2D accelerator&#34; but it doesn&#39;t seem to do much and still can&#39;t stop the system from chugging if you want to do graphics.</p>
<p>For the website itself, Nginx hosts it just fine. I just installed it like you would on a plain-jane vanilla Linux server. Finally, for the website content, I&#39;ve tried to make it as simple yet pretty as possible in order to save on bandwidth. The reason you see this pretty font is because it&#39;s downloaded from Google Fonts.
However, there is a particularly bandwidth-hungry demo you&#39;ll see below.</p>
<p>Output of Neofetch running on this LicheePi:</p>

<p>Not much to see here!</p>

<p>It seems like it&#39;s too common for websites today to be bloated to the extreme with too much JavaScript, images, videos, and other bulky content.
Many websites today ring in at a size of multiple megabyteS. This is just unacceptable for those without good connections, or those who are used to low-latency experiences, like me. I can personally feel mere milliseconds of delay because I&#39;m used to musical instruments and pro audio where there is little to no latency all the time. Luckily, this site is different. It is no more than a few kilobytes in size, unless you count optional content which you&#39;ll see very soon. Despite being only kilobytes big and no more than a single page, I think this site still looks great. It has nice font(s), a nice background, and a nice structure.
Why can&#39;t more sites be like this? If this were the standard of today, then we all could save tons of electricity and costs and just use $26 computers to handle it all, and users would have a much better experience too. That&#39;s like having your cake and eating it too!
In addition, if one cheap little $26 gadget can do this, then what could a $60 one do? The VisionFive 2 already offers staggering performance in comparison yet only costs about that much.
</p>

<p>It&#39;s time for the huge file you&#39;ve been waiting for. Actually, it&#39;s not so huge because I&#39;m using the Opus codec. It&#39;s a quick little recording of me playing a particular song. Can you guess what song it is? If you have an answer, email me below. Hint: It&#39;s in Spanish.</p>
<audio preload="none" controls="">
<source src="mystery.opus" type="audio/ogg"/>
Mystery song not available :(

<p>If you ever feel lonely, then remember that you can always come back to this site and listen to this little ditty anytime you want anywhere you wish. :)</p>

<p>Feel free to send an email if you have more questions about this RISC-V setup. :)</p>

<h3>How is this site using SSL if you have so little processing power?</h3>
<p>I have this site behind Cloudflare which offers serving up SSL between clients and Cloudflare, and plain old HTTP between Cloudflare and the host (this RISC-V computer).
Therefore, all the hard work is done by computers which aren&#39;t this one.</p>
<h3>This site is pretty cool. Do you have anything else in RISC-V?</h3>
<p>In addition to having the world&#39;s first RISC-V powered website, I also have the world&#39;s first RISC-V Minecraft server. In fact, the board that powers it (a VisionFive 1) sits no more than a few feet away from the board which served up the page you&#39;re reading right now. Check it out at riscv.hajime.sh!</p>
<p>Also of note is that I was planning to use this LicheePi to host a Velocity server for that MC server, but it turns out Java is having some funky PaX errors, so this website was the next best use I could think of for it. If I got another then maybe I could think about making that server. Or I could leave it for some other RISC-V board in the future.</p>
<h3>I can&#39;t figure out what song you played.</h3>
<p>Another Hint: I&#39;m playing a special kind of guitar through a special set of effects.</p>
<h3>That song is in Spanish but this page is in English. What gives?</h3>
<p>A Spanish version is coming soon!</p>
<h3>I checked the LicheePi out and there are so many options!</h3>
<p>The $26 cost is if you want to get the 512MB RAM version with the dock. The board itself is cheaper, but you need a funky connector setup to use it. The dock which contains this funky connector setup has a nonzero cost, and, therefore, when combined with the board itself, adds up to $26.</p>
<h3>This site is so effective. How?</h3>
<p>That&#39;s because I kept it so simple. Everything is on one page (discounting the future Spanish version which will be on a different page) and everything is split up into various sections. I only use one font for all the text that isn&#39;t preformatted. To top it all off, there is zero (0, nada, zilch) JavaScript of any kind. There isn&#39;t even another CSS file; it&#39;s within the HTML. Check it for yourself. All in all, this makes for a very focused experience that more websites should take advantage of. Other &#34;simple&#34; websites tend to spoil the experience by eschewing CSS or fonts. However, CSS only adds mere bytes to the download size and external sites can provide fonts.</p>
<h3>Your main site (jghuff.com) doesn&#39;t claim to be on RISC-V. What&#39;s going on?</h3>
<p>I was in a bit of a pickle when finding a domain to put this site on. You see, I have that other site on a regular server in my house behind Cloudflare. Cloudflare doesn&#39;t offer to protect different ports depending on the source and distination. What this means is that if I were going directly through CF, then you&#39;d need to visit this website with an ugly :8080 tacked on the end. That&#39;s bad UX. To solve that, I decided to take advantage of my Oracle Free Tier VM to run HAProxy to simply convert ports. Therefore, the complete chain is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You</li>
<li>Cloudflare</li>
<li>HAProxy</li>
<li>RISC-V Server</li>
</ul>
Shockingly, this setup works well.
<h3>How do you edit this page?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s simpler than you might think. I just use nano to edit the file directly and that&#39;s it.</p>
<h3>This stuff seems pretty advanced. Are you in college or someplace like that?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked! I&#39;m currently a student at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<h3>How reliable is this site?</h3>
<p>The LicheePi is a bit of a piece of junk. If I use a USB power adaptor with a good amount of power available, then I can&#39;t restart the board or it will go into a reboot loop from thermal shutdown. I tried fixing this with an upside down can of compressed air but that didn&#39;t do much. The &#34;fix&#34; I found was to use a cheapo USB phone charger with a cheapo USB-C cord and that seems to work fine. <em>If this website goes down in the future, it might be because the board kicked the bucket or I unplugged it.</em> Therefore, keep an archive of this site handy for when this does happen because it&#39;s currently not plugged into a UPS.</p>
<h3>Pics or it didn&#39;t happen.</h3>
<p>I know. A photo of some kind would be helpful, but it would inflate this site&#39;s size a whole lot. Actually, today, photos can be compressed to be mere kilobytes, so I guess the step that has the most friction here is transferring a file from my camera/phone to the LicheePi.</p>
<h3>I hate that you are messing around with RISC-V which only barely exists. Why the heck are you wasting your time when you could just use an x86 server instead. Why does this even matter.</h3>
<p>I live on the bleeding edge :)</p>
