            <p>It&#39;s been almost three months since the last lab note, and I lament that I didn&#39;t document the process and the shifts that were happening with my work. But then again, I was busy writing code and talking to potential users.</p><p>Back at <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/lab-note-073-existing-in-a-digital-space/" rel="noreferrer">#073</a>, I was playing with an LLM chat app that gave you product recommendations. I found myself doing it more lately with GPT and figured that more and more people would do it too. ChatGPT didn&#39;t give a great experience with it, so I figured it was worth a shot. However, two things stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>First, it&#39;s an uphill battle fighting with product providers to give you accurate product information. So most of the time, you&#39;re going to be doing an arms race with crawlers. That didn&#39;t seem particularly appealing to me.</p><p>Second, I had an experience that was more in line with the stuff that I&#39;d been doing in these lab notes: I had my agent read my notes.</p><p>I had been using Roam Research for years now, not feeling the need to switch, like productivity junkies. But one day, I realized that LLMs are pretty good now, but that when they fall on their face in performance, it&#39;s usually because they simply don&#39;t have the right context. Hence, if I just export my Roam Research notes into Obsidian, I could misuse Claude Code to read my notes for me.</p><p>The result was electrifying. It felt like talking to a friend that was into all the same things I was into, and I never had to explain any context. In conjunction, I noticed there were other people discovering same thing: that you can &#34;misuse&#34; Claude Code for non-coding tasks. In mid-July, came the final push. I noticed that <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/what-is-algebraic-about-algebraic-effects/" rel="noreferrer">Every.to</a>, a company whose blog I follow, had a podcast in which they talked about how they operated as an AI company. They basically document their ways of working and use agents to help them automate or partially automate it. That brought a focus and clarity to the overall picture of all the pieces that I&#39;d been collecting and researching over the years.</p><p>I started to try working this way. I took <a href="https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals?ref=interjectedfuture.com">Hamel and Shreya&#39;s system eval course</a>, and misused Claude to help me do system evals as a hacked-together test. I wrote about the process, and it was a glimpse into a future way of working.</p><figure><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/system-eval-with-obsidian-and-claude-code/"><div><p>System eval with Obsidian and Claude Code</p><p>Lately, I’ve been experimenting with a different system eval stack than what you might normally hear about: Obsidian and Claude Code. Typically, Obsidian is used as a personal note taking app/knowledge base and Claude Code is used as a coding agent. I’m misusing both to hack together a system</p><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/icon/favicon-16.ico" alt=""/><span>Interjected Future</span><span>Wil Chung</span></p></div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/thumbnail/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-26--2025--10_42_49-PM.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>Encouraged, I tried to find a way to leverage LLMs in engineering. It&#39;s not quite as easy, as vibe coding is production is nothing like vibe coding for ephemeral apps. They actually take quite a bit of scaffolding to make it work.</p><figure><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/vibe-coding-for-experts-needs-scaffolding/"><div><p>The Hidden Scaffolding Behind Production Vibe Coding</p><p>I’m not near a level where it’s 10k LOC per day, but the volume of commits is noticeably higher w/ Claude/Codex now. Back in Feb/Mar when Claude Code came out, I was writing an implementation of DBSP (incremental computation with some mathy stuff) and I couldn’</p><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/icon/favicon-17.ico" alt=""/><span>Interjected Future</span><span>Wil Chung</span></p></div><p><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/thumbnail/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-9--2025--11_43_18-AM-1.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>While this is better than what I was doing before, I&#39;m still trying to find something that meets my standards for code. I&#39;d like to accelerate with LLMs like others too, but while I&#39;m in control, I have a bar that the LLM designs just can&#39;t seem to reach at the moment. I&#39;m still working out the kinks.</p><p>This time it feels different. It feels like I&#39;m doing customer development right, and it feels like I have an open secret that I want to find others with that same open secret. So for now, I&#39;m just doing customer development and building to something usable and launch-able. </p><p>I&#39;ll talk more about it all later, but in the meantime, someone had asked me for podcast recommendations for biking or swimming, so here&#39;s my one-time list.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcVSgYz5SJ8&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Sarah Paine Lectures on Dwarkesh Podcast</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.computerenhance.com/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Computer Enhance</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FallofCivilizations?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Fall of Civilizations</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@daltonplusmichael?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Dalton + Michael</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/archive?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>This American Life</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Game Maker’s Toolkit</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Howtown?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Howtown</strong></a></p>
