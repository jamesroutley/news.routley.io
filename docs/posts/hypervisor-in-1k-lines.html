In this book, you&#39;ll learn how to build a minimal RISC-V hypervisor which can boot Linux-based operating systems.</p><p>This is a sequel to the online book <a href="https://1000os.seiya.me/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Operating System in 1,000 Lines</a>. In that book, you have learned how to build a minimal operating system from scratch in C, but this time, we&#39;ll start from scratch (again) in your favorite language, Rust!</p><p>From scratch means we&#39;ll start from the bare-metal programming in Rust, that is <em>type-1 hypervisor</em>, in 1000 lines of code like we did for the OS.</p><p>However, this time we&#39;ll cheat a little bit, by relying on the power of Rust&#39;s ecosystem: third-party libraries (<em>&#34;crates&#34;</em>) to avoid implementing things that don&#39;t really matter for learning hypervisors.</p><ul><li>You can download the implementation examples from <a href="https://github.com/nuta/hypervisor-in-1000-lines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</li><li>This book is available under the <a href="https://creativecommons.jp/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CC BY 4.0 license</a>.
