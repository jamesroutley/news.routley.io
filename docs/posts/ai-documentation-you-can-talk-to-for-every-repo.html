      <p>In <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/cj:_Making_a_minimal,_complete_JIT.html">a
recent blog post</a>, I unveiled <a href="https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj">cj</a>, a small,
dependency-free JIT compiler framework in C. In theat post, I discussed
the idea of implementing a small programming language in it.</p>
<p>Of course, once I had had the idea, <a href="https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj/blob/master/examples/minilang.c">my
fingers couldn’t stop typing until it was done</a>. So now we have a
small, Lisp-y (admittedly by syntax only) language implemented using
<code>cj</code>, in a total of around 400 lines of C, 300 of which are
the parser and AST. Here’s the language:</p>
<pre><code># main is our entry point, call calls other functions
(def main (x) (sub (call inc x) 15))

# add and sub do math, all functions are unary
(def inc (x) (add x 2))</code></pre>
<p>Since building a JIT-compiled language in less than 100 lines is cool
in any language, today I want to walk you through how the implementation
works. A few caveats before we begin, however: for the purposes of this
post we’ll focus on the code generator; the parser and any error
handling are out of scope for brevity (you can find them in the version
checked into the repository).</p>
<p>So, let’s dive right in!</p>
<h4 id="prelude-an-api-and-an-ast">Prelude: An API and an AST</h4>
<p>Before we implement anything, let me give you a quick rundown of the
<code>cj</code> functions we will be using today. This is intended as a
reference, jump back here if you need clarification on any of the bits
we’re using!</p>
<pre><code>// Our main CJ context that we’ll carry around
cj_ctx* cj = create_cj_ctx();

// we generate a scratch, a place from which we get our registers
// platform-independently
cj_builder_scratch scratch;

// we initialize it
cj_builder_scratch_init(&amp;scratch);

// ... and eventually release it
cj_builder_scratch_release(&amp;scratch);

// we generate a frame for each function
typedef cj_builder_frame;

// initializing a function and saving the info in the frame
cj_builder_fn_prologue_with_link_save(cj, /*optional stack bytes*/0, &amp;frame);

// and eventually we return something from the frame
cj_builder_return_value(cg-&gt;cj, &amp;frame, (cj_operand)value);

// we can make operands (a register, memory, address, value, etc.)
cj_operand constant = cj_make_constant(42);
cj_operand dst = cj_builder_scratch_acquire(&amp;scratch);

// we can assign things (basically a wrapper around MOV instructions)
cj_builder_assign(cj, dst, constant);

// we can add and subtract the same way
cj_add(cj, dst, constant);
cj_sub(cj, dst, constant);

// we can generate labels we can jump to
cj_label entry;
cj_mark_label(cj, entry);

// and then jump to them with arguments (in our case we just need one)
cj_builder_call_unary(cj, &amp;scratch, entry, constant);

// in the end, we generate something executable
cj_fn function = create_cj_fn(ctx);

// we can just call it
function();

// or find labels in it
void (*fn)(void) = cj_resolve_label(cj, function, entry);

// and call those
fn();</code></pre>
<h4 id="the-ast">The AST</h4>
<p>I know I said we wouldn’t be looking at the parser code, but we at
least need to know the data structure we will be working with once
parsing is done. So for the purposes of this blog post we will pretend
that there is a magical function called
<code>parse_expr(input_string)</code> that gives us back an AST.</p>
<p>So, what does our AST for the simple language we defined above look
like?</p>
<pre><code>typedef enum { NODE_NUM, NODE_PARAM, NODE_ADD, NODE_SUB, NODE_CALL } node_kind;

typedef struct node node;
struct node {
  node_kind kind;
  int value;
  int target;
  char name[32];
  node *left;
  node *right;
  node *arg;
};</code></pre>
<p>So we have numbers, parameters, and calls, and because we are lazy we
also bake the <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code> primitives in as
special tokens. A <code>node</code> then has that token type and a bunch
of other things we don’t know about yet, as well as some children
(<code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>arg</code>).</p>
<p>All of these values are filled conditionally: <code>value</code> is
filled if we have a number, <code>name</code> if we have a parameter,
<code>left</code> and <code>right</code> if we are dealing with an
<code>add</code> or <code>sub</code> node. Calling is a little special:
it has an <code>arg</code> (simple because all functions are unary), but
it also has a <code>target</code>, which is the label we are going to
jump to. More about that later, since that part is on us, not the
parser. This AST also serves as our intermediate representation, so it
mixes parse- and compile-level concepts for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>The AST for our example program would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// (def inc (x) (add x 2))
// (def main (x) (sub (call inc x) 15))
node X       = (node){ .kind=NODE_PARAM };
node TWO     = (node){ .kind=NODE_NUM, .value=2 };
node FIFTEEN = (node){ .kind=NODE_NUM, .value=15 };

node INC_BODY  = (node){ .kind=NODE_ADD, .left=&amp;X, .right=&amp;TWO };

node CALL_INC  = (node){ .kind=NODE_CALL, .name=&#34;inc&#34;, .arg=&amp;X };
node MAIN_BODY = (node){ .kind=NODE_SUB,  .left=&amp;CALL_INC, .right=&amp;FIFTEEN };</code></pre>
<p>And that concludes what we need to know about the AST!</p>
<h4 id="a-note-on-def">A note on <code>def</code></h4>
<p>Actually, hold on. None of this deals with functions yet. We need to
add another wrinkle to this.</p>
<p>I designed the parser to parse one expression at a time. This is
normal, but it’s also an incomplete grammar. Our example above has at
least two expressions (two functions), and we need to be able to deal
with that.</p>
<p>We also do not have an AST node for functions. This is odd, since
functions are definitely part of the AST, but in our minimal language
where functions are always the top-level concept, we can get away with
something simpler:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
  char name[32];
  char param[32];
  node *body;
  cj_label entry;
  int (*fn)(int);
} function;</code></pre>
<p>The function structure is mostly self-explanatory: we keep the name
and parameter, and the expression that constitutes the function body.
And once again we do not create a separate intermediate representation;
instead, the function that we emit as well as the label we assign
it—more on that later—get inserted directly into the same structure. Not
clean, but it serves us well.</p>
<p>Our functions from above would thus look like this:</p>
<pre><code>function inc   = { .name=&#34;inc&#34;, .param=&#34;x&#34;, .body=&amp;INC_BODY };
function main  = { .name=&#34;main&#34;, .param=&#34;x&#34;, .body=&amp;MAIN_BODY };</code></pre>
<p>We are now ready to sketch a quick and dirty main function:</p>
<pre><code>int main(void) {
  static const char *input = &#34;(def main (x) (sub (call inc x) 15))\n&#34;
                                    &#34;(def inc (x) (add x 2))\n&#34;;
  function functions[MAX_FUN];
  int function_count = 0;

  while (&lt;input end condition&gt;) functions[function_count++] = parse_function(input);
  
  // ... here goes the rest
}</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj/blob/fa7405823721187454a01e071421fdbe40179e20/examples/minilang.c#L281-L293">actual
parser</a> has a lexer and is generally a bit more fiddly, but none of
this matters for this tutorial.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick peek at how we parse the function to see what we
start with, and then we can get started with the compiler for real:</p>
<pre><code>static function parse_function(input) {
  function fn;
  memset(&amp;fn, 0, sizeof(fn));
  
  fn.name = parse_function_head(input);
  fn.param = parse_function_param(input);
  fn.body = parse_expr(input);
  
  return fn;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So by the time we get our grubby little hands on the function, the
parse-y bits have been filled, but the compile-y bits are still TBD.</p>
<p>Now our real job begins!</p>
<h4 id="part-i-resolving-calls">Part I: Resolving calls</h4>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to resolve function calls first so
we can jump between things later. After parsing, we call a function
named <code>resolve_calls()</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>static int find_function(function *fns, int count, const char *name) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    if (strcmp(fns[i].name, name) == 0) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}

static void resolve_calls(node** all_nodes, int num_nodes, function *fns, int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_nodes; i++) {
    node *n = &amp;all_nodes[i];
    if (n-&gt;kind == NODE_CALL) n-&gt;target = find_function(fns, count, n-&gt;name);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is relatively trivial code: we iterate over all the nodes we
parsed (you can check how we do that in the full implementation), find
all call nodes, and fix up its target. For our simple example, this is
good enough.</p>
<p>It completes our nodes and sets the target of all calls correctly,
ensuring that we can jump to them correctly when time comes.</p>
<p>Next up: compiling functions!</p>
<h4 id="part-ii-compiling-functions">Part II: Compiling functions</h4>
<p>A note before we begin: it’s important to remember that what we are
doing here during the compile process is essentially filling a buffer. A
lot of this code looks similar to an interpreter, but none of the code
actually gets executed here. Instead, we just push all of the code into
a big buffer, and then generate a function from it later. Keep this in
mind as we move along.</p>
<p>Before we actually emit code for the functions, we need to assign a
label for each of them. You can think of a label as a place for us to
jump to from a GOTO, only in machine code. So go ahead and do this
really quickly in our main function:</p>
<pre><code>int main(void) {
  static const char *input = &#34;(def main (x) (sub (call inc x) 15))\n&#34;
                                    &#34;(def inc (x) (add x 2))\n&#34;;
  function functions[MAX_FUN];

  // parse-y and resolve-y bits ...

  cj_ctx *cj = create_cj_ctx();
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; function_count; i++) functions[i].entry = cj_create_label(cj);

  // ... here goes the rest
}</code></pre>
<p>What we do here is create a <code>cj</code> context (the bits that
store all of its state), and then we assign a label to each of the
functions. We will use these in our backend when calling the
functions.</p>
<p>So one half of the functions struct is filled. We need to fill the
other half, and generate the callable version of the function.</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
  cj_ctx *cj;
  function *functions;
  cj_builder_scratch scratch;
} codegen;

int main(void) {
  static const char *input = &#34;(def main (x) (sub (call inc x) 15))\n&#34;
                                    &#34;(def inc (x) (add x 2))\n&#34;;
  function functions[MAX_FUN];

  // setup ...

  codegen cg = {.cj = cj, .functions = functions};
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; function_count; i++) emit_function(&amp;cg, &amp;functions[i]);

  // ... here goes the rest
}</code></pre>
<p>In our main function, we just wrap the context and the list of
functions in a single structure called <code>codegen</code> for ease of
access (and tuck in a <code>cj_builder_scratch</code>, which we will
learn about later), and call <code>emit_function</code> on each of our
functions. What does <code>emit_function</code> look like, then?</p>
<pre><code>static void emit_function(codegen *cg, function *fn) {
  cj_builder_scratch_init(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
  cj_mark_label(cg-&gt;cj, fn-&gt;entry);
  cj_builder_frame frame;
  cj_builder_fn_prologue_with_link_save(cg-&gt;cj, 0, &amp;frame);
  cj_operand result = emit_expr(cg, fn-&gt;body);
  cj_builder_return_value(cg-&gt;cj, &amp;frame, result);
  cj_builder_scratch_release(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
}</code></pre>
<p>What a simple function, right?! Nonetheless, it’s doing some very
complicated book-keeping and we should probably go through it
line-by-line.</p>
<p>First we initialize the <code>cj_builder_scratch</code> thingie we
created. This structure gives us fresh registers for a frame, so we
re-initialize it for every function; we will see it in action
below<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We then set the label of the function our emitted code using
<code>cj_mark_label</code>; when the function is called, we jump
there.</p>
<p>Next, we emit a prologue. What is a prologue? Basically, each
architecture has a different calling convention, and there are common
chores we have to do when initializing a frame, initializing registers
and stack pointers and so on. The “high level” API of <code>cj</code>
abstracts this for us. Well, kind of. We still need to do some special
work for arm64, which is expressed by the <code>with_link_save</code>
part of the function. It basically saves the previous caller’s
information on the stack before we begin (only on arm64).</p>
<p>Then we finally are ready to emit the function body, calling
<code>emit_expr</code>. It will return the value of the last expression
(a <code>cj_operand</code>) that we can then mark as the return value
and release the scratch.</p>
<h4 id="part-iii-compiling-expressions">Part III: Compiling
expressions</h4>
<p>So, how do we actually compile this AST now? Let’s look at
<code>emit_expr</code> to figure it out!</p>
<pre><code>static cj_operand emit_expr(codegen *cg, node *n) {
  switch (n-&gt;kind) {
  case NODE_NUM: {
    cj_operand dst = cj_builder_scratch_acquire(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
    cj_builder_assign(cg-&gt;cj, dst, cj_make_constant((uint64_t)(uint32_t)n-&gt;value));
    return dst;
  }
  case NODE_PARAM: {
    cj_operand dst = cj_builder_scratch_acquire(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
    cj_builder_assign(cg-&gt;cj, dst, cj_builder_arg_int(cg-&gt;cj, 0));
    return dst;
  }
  case NODE_ADD:
  case NODE_SUB: {
    cj_operand lhs = emit_expr(cg, n-&gt;left);
    cj_operand rhs = emit_expr(cg, n-&gt;right);

    if (n-&gt;kind == NODE_ADD) cj_add(cg-&gt;cj, lhs, rhs);
    else cj_sub(cg-&gt;cj, lhs, rhs);

    cj_builder_scratch_release(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
    return lhs;
  }
  case NODE_CALL: {
    cj_operand arg = emit_expr(cg, n-&gt;arg);
    return cj_builder_call_unary(
        cg-&gt;cj, &amp;cg-&gt;scratch, cg-&gt;functions[n-&gt;target].entry, arg
    );
  }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>That one is a lot, so we’ll go through all the cases in turn. For now
we just focus on perceiving that we have a big <code>switch</code>
statement for each of the AST nodes we have defined.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the number node.</p>
<pre><code>case NODE_NUM: {
  cj_operand dst = cj_builder_scratch_acquire(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
  cj_builder_assign(cg-&gt;cj, dst, cj_make_constant((uint64_t)(uint32_t)n-&gt;value));
  return dst;
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we’re using our scratch to create a register and then assign the
constant in our node to it (this boils down to a <code>MOV</code>
instruction).</p>
<p>Parameters work similarly:</p>
<pre><code>case NODE_PARAM: {
  cj_operand dst = cj_builder_scratch_acquire(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
  cj_builder_assign(cg-&gt;cj, dst, cj_builder_arg_int(cg-&gt;cj, 0));
  return dst;
}</code></pre>
<p>The key difference between this and the number code is that we put
the argument value in the register instead of a constant.
<code>cj</code> takes care of handling these arguments for us by
respecting the platform’s calling convention, locating the appropriate
register, and returning it as an operand we can pass into the
assignment, all in <code>cj_builder_arg_int</code>, which returns an
operand based on the parameter index.</p>
<p>Addition and subtraction are the first recursive cases:</p>
<pre><code>case NODE_ADD:
case NODE_SUB: {
  cj_operand lhs = emit_expr(cg, n-&gt;left);
  cj_operand rhs = emit_expr(cg, n-&gt;right);

  if (n-&gt;kind == NODE_ADD) cj_add(cg-&gt;cj, lhs, rhs);
  else cj_sub(cg-&gt;cj, lhs, rhs);

  cj_builder_scratch_release(&amp;cg-&gt;scratch);
  return lhs;
}</code></pre>
<p>We emit our left and right arguments (since they are expressions
themselves), and then emit either an <code>ADD</code> or a
<code>SUB</code> expression. Then we can release one of our scratch
arguments, and return the left-hand side expression. Why the left-hand
side expression? Both <code>ADD</code> and <code>SUB</code> will store
the result of their respective operation in the register on the left, so
that is the one we will return. This also explains why we release one
argument only: the right-hand side can be forgotten about, but the left
needs to be preserved.</p>
<p>The final trick is calling:</p>
<pre><code>case NODE_CALL: {
  cj_operand arg = emit_expr(cg, n-&gt;arg);
  return cj_builder_call_unary(
    cg-&gt;cj, &amp;cg-&gt;scratch, cg-&gt;functions[n-&gt;target].entry, arg
  );
}</code></pre>
<p>We emit our argument first, then emit a call to the function we want
to call. The high-level API of <code>cj</code> takes care of this for us
once again, taking care of argument initialization, calling labels, and
cleaning up after the call. One final complication is that we need to
know the label of what we’ll call. In this expression, we just use the
node’s <code>target</code> field we defined above in Part I.</p>
<p>We now have everything in place, and can generate code and call
it!</p>
<h4 id="part-iv-execution">Part IV: Execution</h4>
<p>As a reminder, this is the code we want to generate:</p>
<pre><code># main is our entry point, call calls other functions
(def main (x) (sub (call inc x) 15))

# add and sub do math, all functions are unary
(def inc (x) (add x 2))</code></pre>
<p>We now have generated all the code and are ready to call our
JIT-compiled function:</p>
<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  // all of our setup

  cj_fn module = create_cj_fn(cj);

  int main_idx = find_function(functions, function_count, &#34;main&#34;);
  int (*main_fn)(int) = cj_resolve_label(cj, module, functions[main_idx].entry);
  int result = main_fn(55);
  printf(&#34;main(55) = %d\n&#34;, result); // will print 42

  // cleanup goes here
}</code></pre>
<p>All we do is generate all of our code, find the offset of our main
function, and call it! If this seems like magic, it kind of is:
<code>create_cj_fn</code> tells the machine that this buffer is not code
anymore but data instead. The call to <code>cj_resolve_label</code>
calculates the offset into that buffer that leads us to our label and
gives us the pointer to it. By casting it to a function pointer, we can
then just call it.</p>
<p>And that’s it! In just over 90 lines of code, we compiled a
non-trivial program and executed it, <em>all at runtime</em>. Pretty
cool, right?</p>
<h3 id="fin">Fin</h3>
<p>This was a lot, certainly. Admittedly, even with the “high level”
helpers, building anything with <code>cj</code> is still very low-level
(by design). I still hope it is somewhat accessible for all, and that,
if you so desire, you explore the <a href="https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj/tree/master/examples">other
examples</a> <code>cj</code> ships with. See you around!</p>
<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>
<p><span id="1">1.</span> Register names and purposes are
backend-dependent, and I wanted to build a way to get to registers when
I need them without having to think about any of that. What we
explicitly do not do is manage the registers for the user, doing full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register
allocation</a>. I might get there in the future, but currently
<code>cj</code> does not provide this.</p>
