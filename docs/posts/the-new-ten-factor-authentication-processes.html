      <p>Dear Faculty,</p>
<p>Beginning next semester, we will be moving from two-factor to ten-factor authentication requirements for accessing the university‚Äôs digital resources. The first and second factors, signing in and entering a passcode from your phone app, will remain the same. From there:</p>
<p><strong>Third Factor:</strong> Go out to your car and add the digits of your vehicle identification number to the digits of the passcode that your phone generates when you arrive at your car (we use <span>GPS</span> tracking between your phone and the University‚Äôs virtual parking pass technology to determine when you‚Äôve arrived at your car).</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Factor:</strong> When you return to the building with the sum of the <span>VIN</span> number and passcode, take it directly to your department‚Äôs Academic Administrative Assistant (<span>AAA</span>). Presuming she recognizes you on sight, she will take the sum you present to her and multiply it by a factor that only she can access. She will then use the new, increased total to remotely unlock your email. By the time you return to your office you‚Äôll be able to continue signing in, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth Factor:</strong> This factor is a ‚Äúredundancy safety net‚Äù built in to account for the fact that the <span>AAA</span> might be brand new or not know you or suffers from a facial recognition disorder. In this scenario, the <span>AAA</span> will draw only a tiny amount of blood in order to verify your identity. It will take some time to sequence your <span>DNA</span>, and you‚Äôll have to do without email during this processing period, but that is the cost of digital safety.</p>
<p><strong>Sixth Factor:</strong> After the <span>AAA</span> has facilitated the previous factor, by whatever method, the next step in 10-factor authentication is to write a sentence using the academic vocabulary word that will pop up on your screen at this step of the sign-in process. The word could be any word, but it will probably be ‚Äúintersectionality,‚Äù ‚Äúontology,‚Äù or ‚Äúheuristic.‚Äù While the system verifies that your definition is sufficiently accurate, please report to campus police, where you‚Äôll undergo a very brief body cavity search. For security reasons, we cannot tell you what we‚Äôre looking for. This is about digital safety.</p>
<p><strong>Seventh Factor:</strong> Once your sentence is approved, please ‚Äúunpack‚Äù it into more straightforward wording that any undergrad, regardless of <span>ACT</span> score or actual desire to go to college, can immediately understand. Then simply translate the sentence into French, Spanish, German, Mandarin, Arabic, American Sign Language, and Latin and type it into the box. It will automatically be transmitted to our Learning Outcomes Assessment Team. They will decide if your sentence is appropriately ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù and ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù to today‚Äôs students. Please do not try to interfere with this determination. We pay the Outcomes Assessment administrators an almost criminal salary to oversee this kind of thing; we are asking you to trust that their online degrees in Leadership and Organizational Psychology really do qualify them to make decisions about your specific academic discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Eighth Factor:</strong> At this step, you will receive an online survey, which you must complete while the Assessment Team is going through their approval processes. The survey will address student success and how you can contribute to it. You will be asked to commit to activities such as carrying boxes on student move-in day, fielding student calls to our counseling center, which due to defunding no longer employs actual counselors (just do the best you can), or acting as a ‚Äúlearning buddy‚Äù for a student-athlete, who will need your help with things like writing papers, getting extra groceries, laundering workout gear, etc. The more creative and boundary-violating you‚Äôre willing to be, the better‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly two more steps to go!!!</p>
<p><strong>Ninth Factor:</strong> The penultimate step is to go get fully trained on our new learning management system. We know you‚Äôre tired of us switching it every two years right after you finally grasp it, but we‚Äôre probably going to keep doing that. Since many of you are either not compliant about training or simply unable to figure out the software (baffling, since you have Ph.Ds), we‚Äôre making mandatory training on the <span>LMS</span> an integral factor of the email login processes. Each time you sign in, you‚Äôll need to learn a new bell or whistle of our new system. You might think there aren‚Äôt enough bells and whistles for us to teach you a new one every time you log on, but there are. And when there aren‚Äôt, we‚Äôll switch to a new <span>LMS</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Tenth Factor:</strong> The tenth factor, to borrow a term from the above-mentioned OA team, which is second only to cybersecurity in terms of university budget expenditures, aims to ‚Äúclose the loop‚Äù on the login process. Once your sentence is approved, please upload a digital artifact that offers concrete evidence that your teaching methods are able to overcome socioeconomic inequities, faulty K-12 school systems, mental health challenges, challenging family circumstances, the stress of taking on student loans, and weather patterns that prevent students from making it to campus.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It‚Äôs come to our attention that some of you don‚Äôt drive, which, honestly, just never occurred to us. Should you not own a car, you may experience problems progressing beyond the Third Factor. For a fee, you can purchase a temporary <span>VIN</span> from the <span>AAA</span> for use in the authentication process. At the time of purchase, please have your student ID, driver‚Äôs license, passport, recent utility bill, and Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods reward card ready. Feel free to contact IT Support with comments or suggestions for improvement to the new authentication process. Thank you for your patience as we seek to streamline your login experience.</p>
