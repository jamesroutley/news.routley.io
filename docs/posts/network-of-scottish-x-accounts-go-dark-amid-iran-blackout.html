    <h1>Network of Scottish X accounts go dark amid Iran blackout</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
  <strong>A network of fake Scottish</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25757818.ofcom-launches-probe-x-ai-chatbot-concerns/" target="_blank"><strong>X accounts</strong></a> <strong>linked to</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/national/25758779.swinney-very-concerned-situation-iran/" target="_blank"><strong>Iran</strong></a> <strong>has gone dark, after an internet blackout was imposed in the</strong> <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25756687.iranian-scientist-glasgow-calls-government-back-protestors/" target="_blank"><strong>West Asian</strong></a> <strong>nation.</strong>
</p><p>
  The silence from the group of accounts, which began on Thursday, comes amid widespread protests against the leadership of the Islamic Republic.

  Industry publication <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UK Defence Journal</a>, which has tracked the accounts for months, <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said that</a> multiple X accounts claiming to be supporters of <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/scottish-independence/?ref=au" target="_blank">Scottish independence</a> have ceased activity. 
</p>
<p>
  One such account, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/fiona175161" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fiona</a>’, has not posted since Thursday.

</p>
<p>
  The account, which describes itself as “a proud Scottish lass” and “passionate about Scotland&#39;s independence &amp; our right to self-determination”, is based in Europe (according to X’s location data). 
</p>
<p>
  However, this is likely due to the use of a VPN which obscures the country or region the account is located in. 
</p>
<p>
  Other accounts, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/jakeq9170/status/2009122928085160433" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jake</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://x.com/lucy9760" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lucy</a>’, have also been quiet since the blackout began. 
</p>
<div id="inArticleAd-1"></div>
<p>
  The accounts, which have thousands of followers, increasingly shared extreme content in the days prior to going dark.
</p>
<p>
  ‘Jake’ claimed that a “top BBC anchor resigned on air and was immediately detained by security services” and that “crowds have surrounded the residence of the newly appointed ‘Governor General’ imposed by London”.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, ‘Fiona’ said that “protesters have seized Balmoral Estate” and “International markets are dumping UK assets as images of tanks in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/local-news/edinburgh-news/?ref=au" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> go viral”.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Lucy’ claimed that &#34;farmers have used tractors to block the A1 at the English border”, while another account called ‘<a href="https://x.com/kelly18600" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kelly</a>’ said that “army trucks are rolling down the Royal Mile. Soldiers in fatigues are guarding the Scottish Parliament”.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, a group of pseudonymous accounts expressing support for Scottish independence went dark immediately after the internet in Iran collapsed amid Israeli and US strikes in June 2025.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25413339.iranian-bots-behind-1-300-pro-independence-x-accounts/" target="_blank">disinformation analysis firm Cyabra claimed</a> that as much as “26% of profiles discussing Scottish independence were fake”.

  Similarly, a 2024 <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/watt/hub/images/hiding-under-the-kilt1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> by researchers at Clemson University has estimated that 4% of content relating to independence were linked to one Iranian-backed bot network of around 80 accounts. 
</p>
<p>
  According to the study, &#34;the accounts in this network all have false persona which purport to be citizens of the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
  &#34;They post messages which support left leaning political views and attack conservative politicians, champion Scottish independence and back the Scottish National Party (<a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/snp/" target="_blank">SNP</a>) and denounce <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/israel/" target="_blank">Israel</a> and its behavior in the ongoing war in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/gaza/" target="_blank">Gaza</a>.”
