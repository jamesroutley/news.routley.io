    <h1>Sunken temple and sanctuary from ancient Egypt</h1>

									<p>With a unique survey-based approach that utilises the most sophisticated <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/franck-goddio/system-approach-technology/">technical equipment</a>, Franck Goddio and his team, in cooperation with the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, were able to locate, map and excavate parts of the city of Thonis-Heracleion, which lies 6.5 kilometres off today’s coastline. The city is located within an overall research area of 11 by 15 kilometres in the western part of Aboukir Bay at a depth of approx. 10 metres. Research started in 1996. It took years to map the entire area. First discoveries could be made in 2000. Franck Goddio has found important information on the ancient landmarks of Thonis-Heracleion, such as the <b>grand temple of Amun</b> and his son Khonsou (Herakles for the Greeks), the harbours that once controlled all trade into Egypt, and the daily life of its inhabitants. He has also solved a <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/fileadmin/pics/3_5_finds/documents/Franck_Goddio_Stele_Heracleion.pdf" title="Opens internal link in current window" target="_blank">historic enigma</a> that has puzzled Egyptologists over the years: the archaeological material has revealed that Heracleion and Thonis were in fact one and the same city with two names; Heracleion being the name of the city for the Greeks and Thonis for the Egyptians.</p>
									<h5>What the City looked like</h5>
									<p>The <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/finds/" title="Opens internal link in current window" target="_blank">objects</a> recovered from the excavations illustrate the cities’ beauty and glory, the magnificence of their grand temples and the abundance of historic evidence: <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/fileadmin/pics/3_5_finds/documents/Franck_Goddio_ColossalStatues.pdf" title="Opens internal link in current window" target="_blank">colossal statues</a>, inscriptions and architectural elements, jewellery and coins, ritual objects and ceramics - a civilization frozen in time.</p>
									<p>The quantity and quality of the archaeological material excavated from the site of Thonis-Heracleion show that this city had known a time of opulence and a peak in its occupation from the 6th to the 4th century BC. This is readily seen in the large quantity of coins and ceramics dated to this period. The port of Thonis-Heracleion had numerous large basins and functioned as a <b>hub of international trade</b>. The intense activity in the port fostered the city’s prosperity. More than <b>seven hundred discovered ancient anchors</b> of various forms and <b>79 wrecks</b> dating from the 6th to the 2nd century BC (further 40 wrecks could be detected but still require verification) are also an eloquent testimony to the intensity of maritime activity here.</p>
									<p>The city extended all around the temple and a network of canals in and around the city must have given it a lake dwelling appearance. On the islands and islets dwellings and secondary sanctuaries were located. Excavations here have revealed beautiful archaeological material such as <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/finds/#c2007">bronze statuettes</a>. On the north side of the temple to Herakles, a grand canal flowed through the city from east to west and connected the port basins with a lake to the west.</p>
									<p>Thonis-Heracleion was also the site of the <b>celebration of the Mysteries of Osiris</b>. This important ceremony was performed each year in honour of the rebirth of the god Osiris. Texts and figures in the Osirian chapels in the temple of Dendera and on the stele of the royal Decree of Canopus describe the details of the celebration of this vigil and re-awakening of the god. In his ceremonial boat Osiris was brought in procession from the city&#39;s great temple of Amun-Gereb to his shrine in <a href="https://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/canopus/">Canopus</a>.</p>
