    <h1>The Death of a Mnemonist</h1>

            <div><p><span>S</span>olomon Shereshevsky dreamt of being a hero. He spent his life waiting for ‘something fine, something grand’. Born in the 1880s in the small Russian town of Rezhitsa, now Rēzekne in Latvia, he was a sometime music student, efficiency expert and broker.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, he was working on a newspaper. His editor asked why he never took notes in meetings. I remember everything, Shereshevsky said. The editor read out a section of print. Shereshevsky repeated it word for word. The editor sent him for tests.</p>
<p>That brought him to neuropsychologist Alexander Luria. Over the next 30 years Luria would discover that Shereshevsky’s memory had no limits. Luria read the first lines of Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> to him in Italian, a language he didn’t know. Some 15 years later, without notice, Luria asked Shereshevsky to repeat them: he did so flawlessly.</p>
<p>Part of his ability was down to extreme synaesthesia. A fence had a salty taste and a sharp, piercing sound. ‘The word mama’, he said, ‘is a bright haze.’ But his principal strategy was to turn every word into an image, and to distribute each image in his mind along a street he knew well. Somehow he had invented for himself the memory palace, a mnemonic tool dating back to antiquity. Cicero attributes the technique to Simonides, a sixth-century BC poet.<span> </span></p>
<p>But why was his memory so strong? Shereshevsky remembered his first months: his wickerwork crib, brown walls, white sheets, his mother’s embrace, warmth and then cold. His awareness, Luria wrote, was dominated by ‘images of his childhood: of the little house he had lived in in Rezhitsa; of the yard [with] horses standing in the shed, where everything smelled of oats and manure’. Wherever he walked in his mind, he walked himself back there.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a classical precedent for this, too. In his first-century BC treatise <em>On the Latin Language</em>, Varro offers a derivation for the verb <em>recordari</em>,<em> </em>to remember<em>.</em> It is formed from <em>revocare</em>, to call back, he says, wrapped around the word <em>cor</em>, meaning heart.</p>
<p>Shereshevsky died on 1 May 1958, not a hero, but possessed of greatness yet.</p>
