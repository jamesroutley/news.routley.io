<p>Arm is facing down its biggest competition ever, with the up-and-coming RISC-V architecture threatening to unseat it as the CPU at the center of almost every portable device. Now, one of Arm&#39;s biggest customers is trying out RISC-V, as Qualcomm is <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/08/leading-semiconductor-industry-players-join-forces-to-accelerate">getting involved</a> in a joint venture dedicated to the architecture.</p>
<p>The joint venture doesn&#39;t have a name yet, but Qualcomm, NXP, Nordic Semiconductor, Bosch, and memory giant Infineon are all teaming up to form a new company that Qualcomm&#39;s press release says is &#34;aimed at advancing the adoption of RISC-V globally by enabling next-generation hardware development.&#34; At first, the group will be focused on automotive uses, with an &#34;eventual expansion&#34; to IoT and mobile, Qualcomm&#39;s biggest market.</p>
<p>Arm doesn&#39;t manufacture any chips itself and instead exists as a design and licensing operation. It licenses both the Arm architecture, allowing companies to design an Arm-compatible chip themselves (this is what Apple does), and it also licenses completed CPU designs, allowing partners like Qualcomm, Samsung, and MediaTek to produce new SoCs year after year.</p>
<p>Previously, we would have said Qualcomm&#39;s &#34;next-generation hardware&#34; project revolves around its acquisition of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-closes-nuvia-deal-promises-in-house-laptop-cpus-by-2h-2022/">Nuvia</a>, a chip design house that was founded by ex-SoC engineers from Apple, which currently makes the fastest mobile ARM chips available. Qualcomm&#39;s CPUs all use Arm&#39;s designs, and they are regularly a generation or two behind what Apple can do. If Nuvia lives up to its potential, Qualcomm&#39;s Arm chips would finally be competitive. The company says chips from Nuvia are expected to hit the market <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/qualcomm-nuvia-based-snapdragon-due-in-2024-increases-design-wins">in 2024</a> for PCs, so Qualcomm will be sticking with Arm for a while longer. Qualcomm&#39;s &#34;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/with-qualcomm-and-android-the-polestar-3-is-more-smartphone-like-than-ever/">Snapdragon Automotive</a>&#34; products are usually based on 5-year-old phone designs, but it sounds like that&#39;s changing. A RISC-V transition, if one ever comes, is a few years down the line.</p>

<p>RISC-V is threatening Arm for a few reasons. First is its open source licensing, which potentially lets companies avoid the fees Arm charges to make any chip compatible with its instruction set. Second is that RISC-V is also a way for companies to insulate themselves from Arm, which has become an increasingly unstable hardware partner. Arm is at the center of most mobile devices, but it doesn&#39;t make a ton of money off of this licensing business.
</p><p>Arm&#39;s parent company, SoftBank, seems frustrated with Arm&#39;s current business model and has been looking for a way to cash out. For a while, it looked like SoftBank was going to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/nvidia-reportedly-to-acquire-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion/">sell Arm</a> to Nvidia, but after regulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/nvidia-abandons-66-billion-arm-purchase/">shut that idea down</a>, SoftBank moved on with plans for an IPO. Arm has now been telling customers to expect a &#34;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/risc-y-business-arm-wants-to-charge-dramatically-more-for-chip-licenses/">radical shake-up</a>&#34; of its business model, with the plan to charge &#34;several times more&#34; for chip licenses. Arm is also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/arm-sues-qualcomm-over-its-1-4-billion-nuvia-acquisition/">suing Qualcomm</a> right now over a licensing fee disagreement related to its acquisition of Nuvia.</p>
<p>Reason #3 to switch to RISC-V is that Arm has been used as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/softbanks-arm-cuts-ties-with-huawei-leaving-future-chip-production-in-doubt/">a chess piece</a> in the US-China trade war. The RISC-V Foundation <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-semiconductors-insight-idUSKBN1XZ16L">moved to Switzerland</a> in 2019 and a year later rebranded to &#34;<a href="https://riscv.org/about/history/#international">RISC-V International</a>,&#34; indicating that it won&#39;t be subject to US political influence. This has caused tech companies in the Arm&#39;s biggest market, China, to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3201887/tech-war-china-bets-risc-v-chips-escape-shackles-us-tech-export-restrictions">rally around</a> RISC-V.</p>
<p>Of course, one big reason to stick with Arm is that everything works with it. Hardware, OSes, compilers, developer tools, app ecosystems, and everything else you need to make a mobile device is built up around the Arm ecosystem. This is the most important area RISC-V has to catch up in, but it&#39;s making progress.</p>
<p>The biggest news recently is that Google wants to make RISC-V a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-announces-official-android-support-for-risc-v/">tier-one architecture</a> for Android. 2D Android apps are written in Java and compiled for your processor (sometimes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/google-play-dumps-apks-for-the-more-google-controlled-android-app-bundle/">in the cloud</a>!), so a sizable chunk of RISC-V app support will happen automatically. Google&#39;s porting is still a work in progress, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1210&amp;v=xLwdUn3DQp8&amp;feature=youtu.be">latest roadmap</a> seems to be targeting 2024 for a working public release, with things like emulators and the NDK (the SDK for non-java code like 3D games) scheduled for next year.</p>
