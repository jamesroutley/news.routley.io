<p>Billionaire tech mogul and Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel has reportedly hired embattled former Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who abruptly stepped down from office amid allegations of corruption, to help run his investment fund. </p>



<p>Kurz, 35, will serve as a global strategist for California-based <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/10/thiel-talks-crypto-china-at-pricey-dinners-for-proteges-senate-campaigns/">Thiel Capital</a> beginning in the first quarter of 2022. The former chancellor confirmed his career move to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/austrias-ex-chancellor-kurz-work-thiel-capital-reports-2021-12-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austrian media outlets.</a></p>



<p>Kurz, who was once Europe’s youngest elected leader at age 31, resigned as Austria’s chancellor in October after prosecutors announced he was under investigation for allegations of corruption.</p>



<p>Austrian authorities are investigating claims that Kurz and his political allies used public money to publish doctored polls in a bid to retain power. Kurz has denied wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Though he initially retained a role as the conservative Austrian People’s Party’s parliamentary leader, Kurz left politics entirely earlier this month, citing a desire to spend time with his family.</p>



<p>He plans to commute between Europe and Thiel Capital’s US headquarters, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/austrias-ex-chancellor-kurz-work-thiel-capital-reports-2021-12-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters reported</a>, citing Austrian news outlet Heute. His pay is reportedly far higher than the €300,000 ($340,000) he earned as chancellor.</p>



<p>Thiel, 54, co-founded financial tech firm PayPal in 1998 and was an early investor in Facebook. His personal net worth is estimated to be $3.3 billion, according to Forbes.</p>

<p>Thiel is also a <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/25/how-peter-thiel-became-the-most-feared-man-in-silicon-valley/">prominent political donor</a> known for his conservative views. He supported former President Donald Trump’s bid for the White House in 2016 and remained a vocal backer during his term in office.</p>
