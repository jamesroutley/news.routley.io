    <h1>Meta introduces Segment Anything Model 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The SAM 2 model extends the promptable capability of SAM to the video domain by adding a per session memory module that captures information about the target object in the video. This allows SAM 2 to track the selected object throughout all video frames, even if the object temporarily disappears from view, as the model has context of the object from previous frames. SAM 2 also supports the ability to make corrections in the mask prediction based on additional prompts on any frame. </p><p>SAM 2’s streaming architecture—which processes video frames one at a time—is also a natural generalization of SAM to the video domain. When SAM 2 is applied to images, the memory module is empty and the model behaves like SAM.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
