            <p><a href="https://joinpeertube.org/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">PeerTube</a> is a decentralized alternative to YouTube that doesn&#39;t believe in harvesting user data and pushing people into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)?ref=news.itsfoss.com">echo chambers</a> via a proprietary algorithm. Built on open standards and federation, it lets communities host and share video without depending on a central server.</p><p>Earlier this year, the project <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/peertube-mobile-app-crowdfunding/">asked for donations</a> to improve its mobile app and help them reach certain funding goals. The developers made it clear that improving the mobile experience was a key priority, and community backing has helped fund ongoing development. </p><p>Now, PeerTube has shipped a fresh release.</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%86%95-peertube-73-whats-new">üÜï PeerTube 7.3: What&#39;s New?</h2><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2025/09/peertube-7-3-admin-onboarding-wizard.png" width="898" height="729" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/peertube-7-3-admin-onboarding-wizard.png 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2025/09/peertube-7-3-admin-onboarding-wizard.png 898w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p><p><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2025/09/peertube-7-3-live-stream-scheduling.png" width="1226" height="738" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/peertube-7-3-live-stream-scheduling.png 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/peertube-7-3-live-stream-scheduling.png 1000w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2025/09/peertube-7-3-live-stream-scheduling.png 1226w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></p></div></div><figcaption><p><i><em>The new admin onboarding wizard on the left, and live stream scheduling on the right.</em></i></p></figcaption></figure><p>Admins of PeerTube instances will be glad to learn that the cluttered horizontal menu has been replaced with a clean, easy-to-navigate side panel. This redesign makes accessing settings, customization, and user management much faster, with a new &#34;<em>Logo</em>&#34; page for configuring icons and logos displayed on the platform.</p><p>Similarly, the <strong>new admin onboarding wizard</strong> (<em>shown above</em>) guides instance owners through setup, making it easy to configure colors, platform type, logos, favicons, and banners. Basically, the left-hand panel keeps everything organized, while the wizard ensures nothing important is missed during initial setup.</p><p>Email notifications have also received a major upgrade. <strong>PeerTube now supports multilingual emails</strong>, with French and Chinese available right now. Volunteers are invited to help translate both the platform and its emails via <a href="https://weblate.framasoft.org/projects/peertube?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Weblate</a>.</p><p>Live streaming gets a boost too. Users <strong>can now schedule live streams in advance</strong>, allowing viewers to see upcoming events on the channel and live stream pages. This is a surefire way to improve community engagement and gives creators a clear way to plan broadcasts.</p><p>Playlist management has also been improved. Admins can reorder public playlists, set default video licenses, visibility, and comment policies, making it easier to organize content and maintain consistent settings across a channel.</p><h2 id="%F0%9F%93%A5-get-peertube">üì• Get PeerTube</h2><p>The latest release and full changelog are available on <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v7.3.0?ref=news.itsfoss.com">GitHub</a>.
