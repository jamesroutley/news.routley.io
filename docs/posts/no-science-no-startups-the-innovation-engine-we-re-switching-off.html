    <h1>No science, no startups: The innovation engine we&#39;re switching off</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

					<p>Tons of words have been written about the Trump Administrations <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5419855-trump-administration-cuts-science-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">war on Science</a> in Universities. But few people have asked what, exactly, is science? How does it work? Who are the scientists? What do they do? And more importantly, why should anyone (outside of universities) care?</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, you won’t see answers to these questions in the general press – it’s not clickbait enough. Nor will you read about it in the science journals– it’s not technical enough. You won’t hear a succinct description from any of the universities under fire, either – they’ve long lost the ability to connect the value of their work to the day-to-day life of the general public.)</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to describe how science works, how science and engineering have worked together to build innovative startups and companies in the U.S.—and why <u>you</u> should care.</p>
<p>(In <a href="https://steveblank.com/2025/04/15/how-the-u-s-became-a-science-superpower/">a previous post I described how the U.S. built a science and technology ecosystem</a> and why investment in science is directly correlated with a country’s national power. I suggest you read it first.)</p>

<p><strong>How Science Works<br/>
</strong>I was older than I care to admit when I finally understood the difference between a <em>scientist</em>, an <em>engineer</em>, an <em>entrepreneur</em> and a <em>venture capitalist</em>; and the role that each played in the creation of advancements that made our economy thrive, our defense strong and America great.</p>
<p><strong>Scientists<br/>
</strong><em>Scientists </em>(sometimes called researchers) are the people who ask lots of questions about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> things work. They don’t know the answers. <em>Scientists</em> <em>are driven by curiosity</em>, willing to make educated guesses (the fancy word is hypotheses) and run experiments to test their guesses. Most of the time their hypotheses are wrong. But every time they’re right they move the human race forward. We get new medicines, cures for diseases, new consumer goods, better and cheaper foods, etc.</p>
<p>Scientists tend to specialize in one area – biology, medical research, physics, agriculture, computer science, materials, math, etc. — although a few move between areas. The U.S. government has supported scientific research at scale (read billions of $s) since 1940.</p>
<p>Scientists tend to fall into two categories: <em>Theorists</em> and <em>Experimentalists</em>.</p>

</strong><em>Theorists</em> develop mathematical models, abstract frameworks, and hypotheses for how the universe works. They don’t run experiments themselves—instead, they propose new ideas or principles, explain existing experimental results, predict phenomena that haven’t been observed yet. Theorists help define what reality might be.</p>
<p>Theorists can be found in different fields of science. For example:</p>
<p><em>Physics</em><em>                    </em>Quantum field theory, string theory, quantum mechanics</p>
<p>The best-known 20th-century theorist was Albert Einstein. His tools were a chalkboard and his brain. in 1905 he wrote an equation E=MC<sup>2 </sup>which told the world that a small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy. <img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33115" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/einstein-at-the-blackboard/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=2294%2C1782&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2294,1782" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;1&#34;}" data-image-title="Einstein at the blackboard" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=468%2C363&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=162%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="162" height="126" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=1024%2C795&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=150%2C117&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=768%2C597&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1193&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1591&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?w=1404&amp;ssl=1 1404w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px"/>When he wrote it down, it was just theory. Other theorists in the 1930s and ’40s took Einstein’s theory and provided the impetus for building the atomic bomb. (Leo Szilard conceived neutron chain reaction idea, Hans Bethe led the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, Edward Teller developed hydrogen bomb theory.) Einstein’s theory was demonstrably proved correct over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p><strong>Experimentalists<br/>
</strong>In addition to theorists, other scientists – called <em>experimentalists</em> – design and run experiments in a lab. The pictures you see of scientists in lab coats in front of microscopes, test tubes, particle accelerators or NASA spacecraft are likely experimentalists. They test hypotheses by developing and performing experiments. An example of this would be <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/">NASA’s James Webb telescope</a> or the LIGO <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">Gravitational-Wave Observatory</a> experiment. (As we’ll see later, often it’s engineers who build the devices the experimentalists use.)<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33116" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/experimentalist/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=375%2C314&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="375,314" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}" data-image-title="Experimentalist" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=375%2C314&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=184%2C154&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="184" height="154" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=150%2C126&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?w=375&amp;ssl=1 375w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"/></p>
<p>Some of these experimentalists focus on <em>Basic Science,</em> working to get knowledge for its own sake and understand fundamental principles of nature <em>with n</em><em>o immediate practical use</em> in mind.</p>
<p>Other experimentalists work in <em>Applied Science, </em>which uses the findings and theories derived from Basic Science to design, innovate, and improve products and processes.</p>
<p>Applied scientists<em> s</em>olve practical problems oriented toward real-world applications. (Scientists at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/manhattan-project-science-at-los-alamos.htm">Los Alamos</a> weretrying to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass">critical mass of U-235</a> (the minimum amount that would explode.) Basic science lays the groundwork for breakthroughs in <em>applied</em> science. For instance: Quantum mechanics (basic science) led to semiconductors which led to computers (applied science). Germ theory (basic science) led to antibiotics and vaccines (applied science). In the 20th century Applied scientists <u>did not</u> start the companies that make end products. Engineers and entrepreneurs did this. (In the 21st century more Applied Scientists, particularly in life sciences, have also spun out companies from their labs.)</p>

<p><em>Corporate Research Centers</em></p>
<p>This changed in 1982, when the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that it was legal for companies to buy their own stock (reducing the number of shares available to the public and inflating their stock price.) Very quickly <em>Basic</em> Science in corporate research all but disappeared. Companies focused on <em>Applied</em> Research to maximize shareholder value. In its place, Theory and Basic research is now done in <em>research </em>universities.</p>
<p><em>Research Universities<br/>
</em>From the outside (or if you’re an undergraduate) universities look like a place where students take classes and get a degree. However, in a <em>research</em> university there is something equally important going on. <em>Science</em> faculty in these schools not only teach, but they are <em>expected to</em> <em>produce</em> new knowledge—through experiments, publications, patents, or creative work. Professors get grants and contracts from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NIH, DoD), foundations, and industry. And the university builds Labs, centers, libraries, and advanced computing facilities that support these activities.</p>
<p>In the U.S. there are <strong>542</strong> research universities, ranked by the <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/carnegie-classification/classification-methodology/2025-research-activity-designations/">Carnegie Classification</a> into three categories.</p>

They ask research questions, then hire grad students, postdocs, and staff and write grant proposals to fund their work, often spending 30–50% of their time writing and managing grants. When they get a grant the lead researcher (typically a faculty member/head of the lab) is called the Principal Investigator (PI).</p>
<p>The Labs are both workplaces and classrooms. Graduate students and Postdocs do the day-to-day science work as part of their training (often for a Ph.D.). Postdocs are full-time researchers gaining further specialization. Undergraduates may also assist in research, especially at top-tier schools.</p>
<p>(Up until 2025, U.S. science was deeply international with ~40–50% of U.S. basic research done by foreign-born researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and faculty). Immigration and student visas were a critical part of American research capacity.)</p>
<p>The results of this research are shared with the agencies that funded it, published in journals, presented at conferences and often patented or spun off into startups via technology transfer offices. A lot of commercial tech—from Google search to CRISPR—started in university labs.</p>
<p>Universities support their science researchers with basic administrative staff (for compliance, purchasing, and safety) but uniquely in the U.S., by providing the best research facilities (labs, cleanrooms, telescopes), and core scientific services: DNA sequencing centers, electron microscopes, access to cloud, data analysis hubs, etc. These were the best in the world – until the sweeping cuts in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Engineers Build on the Work of Scientists<br/>
</strong>Engineers design and build things <em>on top of the discoveries of scientists</em>. For example, seven years after scientists split the atom, it took 10s of thousands of <em>engineers</em> to build an atomic bomb. From the outset, the engineers knew what they wanted to build because of the basic and applied scientific research that came before them.</p>

<p>Engineers create plans, use software to test their designs, then… cut sheet metal, build rocket engines, construct buildings and bridges, design chips, build equipment for experimentalists, design cars, etc.</p>
<p>As an example, at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">Nvidia</a> their GPU chips are built in a chip factory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSMC</a>) using the <em>Applied</em> science done by companies like <a href="https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applied Materials</a> which in turn is based on <em>Basic</em> science of <a href="https://nano.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semiconductor researchers</a>. And the massive data centers OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, et al that use Nvidia chips are being built by mechanical and other types of engineers. <img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33128" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/types-of-scientists-3/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=581%2C288&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="581,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;1&#34;}" data-image-title="Types of Scientists" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=468%2C232&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=307%2C152&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="307" height="152" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?w=581&amp;ssl=1 581w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=150%2C74&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px"/></p>
<p>My favorite example is that the reusable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzVgPdBqM4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX rocket landings</a> are made possible by the <em>Applied</em> Science research on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization">Convex Optimization</a> frameworks and algorithms by Steven Boyd of Stanford. And Boyd’s work was based on the <em>Basic</em> science mathematical field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convex analysis</a> (SpaceX, NASA, JPL, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab all use variations of Convex Optimization for guidance, control, and landing.)</p>
<p><strong>Startup Entrepreneurs Build Iteratively and Incrementally<br/>
</strong>Entrepreneurs build companies to bring new products to market. <em>They hire engineers</em> to build, test and refine products.</p>
<p>Engineers and entrepreneurs operate with very different mindsets, goals, and tolerances for risk and failure. (Many great entrepreneurs start as engineers e.g., Musk, Gates, Page/Brin). An engineer’s goal is to design and deliver a solution to a <em>known</em> problem with a given set of specifications.</p>
<p>In contrast, entrepreneurs start with a series of <em>unknowns</em> about who are the customers, what are the wanted product features, pricing, etc. They retire each of these risks by building an iterative series of minimum viable products to find product/market fit and customer adoption. They pivot their solution as needed when they discover their initial assumptions are incorrect. (Treating each business unknown as a hypothesis is the entrepreneurs’ version of the Scientific Method.)</p>
<p><strong>Venture Capitalists Fund Entrepreneurs<br/>
</strong>Venture capitalists (VCs) are the people who <em>fund entrepreneurs</em> who work with engineers who build things that applied scientists have proven from basic researchers.</p>
<p>Unlike banks which will give out loans for projects that have known specifications and outcomes, VCs invest <em>in a portfolio</em> of much riskier investments. While banks make money on the interest they charge on each loan, VCs take part ownership (equity) in the companies they invest in. While most VC investments fail, the ones that succeed make up for that.</p>
<p>Most VCs are not scientists. Few are engineers, some have been entrepreneurs. The best VCs understand technical trends and their investments help shape the future. <em>VCs do not invest in science/researchers</em>. VCs want to minimize the risk of their investment, so they mostly want to take engineering and manufacturing risk, but less so on applied science risk and rarely on basic research risk. Hence the role of government and Universities.</p>
<p>VCs invest in projects that can take advantage of science and deliver products within the time horizon of their funds (3–7 years). Science often needs decades before a killer app is visible.</p>
<p>As the flow of science-based technologies dries up, the opportunities for U.S. venture capital based on deep tech will decline, with its future in countries that are investing in science – China or Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Why Have Scientists? Why Not Just a Country of Engineers, Entrepreneurs and VCs (or AI)?<br/>
</strong>If you’ve read so far, you might be scratching your head and asking, “Why do we have scientists at all? Why pay for people to sit around and think? Why spend money on people who run experiments when most of those experiments fail? Can’t we replace them with AI?”</p>
<p>The output of this university-industry-government science partnership became the foundation of Silicon Valley, the aerospace sector, the biotechnology industry, Quantum and AI. These investments gave us rockets, cures for cancer, medical devices, the Internet, Chat GPT, AI and more.</p>
<p>Investment in science is directly correlated with national power. Weaken science, you weaken the long-term growth of the economy, and national defense.</p>
<p>Tech firms’ investments of $100s of billions in AI data centers is greater than the federal government’s R&amp;D expenditures. <em>But these investments are in <u>engineering</u> not in science</em>. The goal of making scientists redundant using artificial general intelligence misses the point that AI will (and is) making scientists more <em>productive – not replacing them.</em></p>
<p>Countries that neglect science become dependent on those that don’t. U.S. post-WWII dominance came from <em>basic science investments</em> (OSRD, NSF, NIH, DOE labs). After WWII ended, the UK slashed science investment which allowed the U.S. to commercialize the British inventions made during the war.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union’s collapse partly reflected failure to convert science into sustained innovation, during the same time that U.S. universities, startups and venture capital created Silicon Valley. Long-term military and economic advantage (nuclear weapons, GPS, AI) trace back to scientific research ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Scientists</em> come in two categories
<ul>
<li>Theorists and experimentalists</li>
<li>Two types of experimentalists; Basic science (learn new things) or applied science (practical applications of the science)</li>
<li>Scientists train talent, create patentable inventions and solutions for national defense</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Engineers</em> design and <em>build things on top of the discoveries of scientists</em></li>
<li><em>Entrepreneurs</em> test and push the boundaries of what products could be built</li>
<li><em>Venture Capital</em> provides the money to startups</li>
<li>Scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs – these roles are complementary
<ul>
<li>Remove one and the system degrades</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Science won’t stop
<ul>
<li>Cut U.S. funding, then science will happen in other countries that understand its relationship to making a nation great – like China.</li>
<li>National power is derived from investments in Science</li>
<li>Reducing investment in basic and applied science makes America weak</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Appendix – How Does Science Work? – The Scientific Method</strong></p>
<p><img/>The goal of the scientific method is to turn a guess (in science called a hypothesis) into actual evidence. Scientists do this by first designing an experiment to test their guess/hypothesis. They then run the experiment and collect and analyze the result and ask, “Did the result validate, invalidate the hypothesis? Or did it give us completely new ideas?” Scientists build instruments and run experiments not because of what they know, but because of what they don’t know.</p>

<p>These experiments can be simple ones costing thousands of dollars that can be run in a university biology lab while others may require billions of dollars to build a satellite, particle accelerator or telescope. (The U.S. took the lead in Science after WWII when the government realized that funding scientists was good for the American economy and defense.)</p>
<p>Good science is reproducible. Scientists just don’t publish their results, but they also publish the details of how they ran their experiment. That allows other scientists to run the same experiment and see if they get the same result for themselves. That makes the scientific method self-correcting (you or others can see mistakes).</p>
<p>One other benefit of the scientific method is that scientists (and the people who fund them) expect most of the experiments to fail, but the failures are part of learning and discovery. They teach us what works and what doesn’t. Failure in science testing unknowns means learning and discovery.</p>
