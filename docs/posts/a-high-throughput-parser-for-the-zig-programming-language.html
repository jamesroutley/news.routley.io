<p dir="auto">A high-throughput tokenizer and parser (soon™️) for the Zig programming language.</p>
<p dir="auto">The mainline Zig tokenizer uses a deterministic finite state machine. Those are pretty good for some applications, but tokenizing can often employ the use of other techniques for added speed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Two tokenizer implementations are provided.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">A version that produces a few bitstrings per 64-byte chunk and uses those to skip over continuation-character matching. I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN8LDpWuPWw&amp;t=530s" rel="nofollow">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FDiUKafPs0U&amp;t=210s" rel="nofollow">talks</a> on this subject. (<strong>Currently this code has gone poof, but I will resurrect this for comparison&#39;s sake within 3 months (when I give my final Utah-Zig talk on the subject of the Zig Tokenizer in July)</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">A version that produces bitstrings for EVERYTHING we want to do within a 64-byte chunk, and utilizes vector compression to find the extents of all tokens simulataneously. See <a href="https://validark.dev/presentations/simd-intro#keywords-lookup" rel="nofollow">this animation</a>. I also gave a talk (really more of a rant) about my grand plans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM1FNB5nagk" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Unfortunately it did not turn out how I had hoped because I got sick before I had time to give it the love it deserves. But my next talk shall knocketh thy socks off, guaranteed!</p>

<p dir="auto">The test bench as it sits on my computer right now prints this out when I run it:</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Currently the utf8 validator is turned off! I did a lot of performance optimization the past few days and did not finish porting my changes over yet.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The test bench fully reads in all of the Zig files under the folders in the <code>src/files_to_parse</code> folder. In my test I installed the Zig compiler, ZLS, and a few other Zig projects in my <code>src/files_to_parse</code> folder. The test bench iterates over the source bytes from each Zig file (with added sentinels) and calls the tokenization function on each <strong>with the utf8 validator turned off</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To tokenize 3,218 Zig files with 1,298,380 newlines, the original tokenizer and my new tokenizer have the following characteristics:</p>

<p dir="auto">Please keep in mind that comparing to the legacy tokenizer&#39;s speed is not necessarily straightforward. It is not difficult for me to see the legacy tokenizer&#39;s performance change by ~15% by making a trivial change in my code. It varies heavily depending on the particular compile. That said, here are some numbers I am seeing on my machine (with the utf8 validator turned off on my implementation):</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fix utf8 validator and get a good SWAR implementation.</li>
<li>Make it so we can return memory which holds the non-newline bitmaps.</li>
<li>Actually implement the AST parser.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Oddly enough, I think some of this code is more maintainable too, as adding an operator or keyword to the tokenizer is literally just adding another string into the relevant array. All of the assumptions and tricks I use are explicitly checked for in compile-time assertions (<code>grep</code> for <code>comptime assert</code>), so violating any of those invariants will result in compile errors that tell you why you can&#39;t change certain things.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, I do have a bunch of weird SWAR tricks that the compiler will hopefully perform automatically one day.</p>

<p dir="auto">In the delicate balancing act that is performance optimization, you generally want:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The ability to process more than one thing at once</li>
<li>Fewer unpredicable branches</li>
<li>A linear traversal over a smaller amount of contiguous memory</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I try to achieve each of these in the following ways:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">SIMD, i.e. single-instruction, multiple data. Instead of operating on a single element at a time, you can operate on 16, 32, or 64 elements simultaneously. Instead of going character-by-character, we use SIMD to check for the length of identifiers/keywords, the length of quotes, the length of whitespace, and the length of comments or single-line quotes. This allows us to move quicker than one byte at a time. We also use a SIMD technique to validate proper utf8 conformance, ported from <a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> by <a href="https://github.com/travisstaloch/">travisstaloch</a> for use in <a href="https://github.com/travisstaloch/simdjzon/">simdjzon</a>. Please note that that particular code is licensed under the Apache license, included at the bottom of the <code>main.zig</code> file.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">I do not actually use SIMD to find &#34;character literals&#34; of the form <code>&#39;a&#39;</code> because these are generally extremely short and did not actually give much benefit in tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">We can&#39;t and don&#39;t want to use SIMD for absolutely everything because:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Comments can be inside of quotes and quotes can be inside of comments
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Selecting which bitstring to match in next is (probably?) not that efficient. You&#39;d have to multiply each vector and then OR all the vectors together, get the next position, then repeat. I might try out this approach, but I doubt it will be that practical. I also note when I look at the arm64 output that it takes <em>much</em> more vector instructions than on x86_64, and doing everything in SIMD generates several hundred instructions on arm64. It might still be worth it though, especially on x86_64, but I doubt it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Operators are all over the place and doing everything in SIMD would require a lot of work that&#39;s not that bad for scalar code to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">SWAR, i.e., SIMD within a register. This is where we read multiple bytes into a 4 or 8 byte register and use conventional arithmetic and logical instructions to operate on multiple bytes simultaneously.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>SWAR fallbacks are provided for machines which lack proper SIMD instructions.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We can check for equality against a character by broadcasting the character and performing an xor operation:</li>
</ul>

--------------------
  0x~~~~00~~~~~~~~~~"><pre><code>  0xaabbccddeeffgghh
^ 0xcccccccccccccccc
--------------------
  0x~~~~00~~~~~~~~~~
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The previous step will result in 0&#39;s in the byte array in the positions where we found our target byte (in this case, <code>cc</code>). We can then add a broadcasted <code>0x7F</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  0x~~~~00~~~~~~~~~~

<ul dir="auto">
<li>This will result in a 1 bit in the most significant bit of each byte that didn&#39;t start out as a 0 after the previous step. The only problem with the technique as I have presented it thus far is the potential for overflow across bytes. To remedy this, we mask out the highest bit of each byte before starting this algorithm. That way, when we add 7F we know it cannot overflow beyond the most significant bit of each byte, and then we know we can look at the most significant bit of each byte to tell us whether our target byte was <strong>not</strong> there.</li>
<li>Then we can mask out the most significant bit of each byte and emulate a movmask operation, i.e. concentrate the bits together, with a multiplication:</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Example with 32 bit integers:
We want to concentrate the upper bits of each byte into a single nibble.

<li>Even on machines with vectors and powerful instructions, SWAR techniques may still be employed for operator matching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Reducing unpredictable branches through:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Using SIMD/SWAR. Using a conventional while loop to capture a completely unpredictable number of characters in the aforementioned categories all but guarantees a branch mispredict every time we exit the loop, and possibly multiple throughout the loop if the branch predictor is having a bad day. Using SIMD/SWAR, we can instead produce a bitstring with 0&#39;s marked in the place corresponding to target characters like the matching <code>&#34;</code>, shift the bitstring according to our cursor&#39;s position, and count the trailing ones (the reason the bits are the inverse of what you might expect is because when we shift the bitstring it will be filled with 0&#39;s). In most cases, a single &#34;count trailing one&#39;s&#34; operation is all we need to find the position we are supposed to go to next. No need for a totally unpredictable while loop that goes character-by-character!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Using perfect hash functions. Specifically, keywords like <code>var</code> and <code>const</code> are mapped into a 7 bit address space by a perfect hash function. Identifiers can be checked against the list of keywords by applying the perfect hash function to each identifier and doing a table lookup to find what keyword it may match, then doing a single 16-byte vs 16-byte comparison to see if the identifier matches that keyword. The keywords are padded in memory to be 16 bytes and have a <code>len</code> stored in the final byte so we can check that the incoming identifier has the same length as the prospective keyword. We also use Phil Bagwell&#39;s array-mapped trie compression technique, meaning we have a 128-bit bitmap and find which position to check using the bitmap, thereby enabling us to have a packed buffer that need not have 128 slots. We do a similar trick for operators.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>One cool thing I can do because of Zig&#39;s comptime execution feature is tell Zig that a dummy operator/keyword is needed when we do not have an operator or keyword which hashes to the maximum 7 bit value, i.e. 127 (because I am hashing these to 7 bits of address space). If an operator or keyword is added or removed which hashed to 127, the comptime logic will automatically remove or add the dummy operator/keyword. Very nifty! At the moment, one of the perfect hash schemes needs a dummy element and the other does not. It&#39;s nice knowing that if we make a change like changing the hash function or adding/removing an operator or keyword, it will automatically figure out the right thing to do. These kinds of tricks are not good in conventional programming languages. We either have to do this work at start-up time or, even worse, someone bakes all the assumptions into the code and then changing it becomes a game of Jenga, except harder because the pieces are not all in one place. In Zig, we write it once and compile-time execution takes care of the rest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I use a trick where I just allocate the upper-bound amount of memory for tokens per-file, and use the <code>resize</code> facility of the allocator to reclaim the space I did not fill. The nice thing about this trick is I can always assume there is sufficient space, which eliminates the need to check that such a thing is safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I place sentinels at the end of files (and I place a newline at the front) to make the rest of the code simpler. This allows us to safely go back a character at any point if the perfect hash function wants us to grab the last two characters from an identifier with only one character, and allows us to safely go past the end of the source file as well. By placing <code>&#34;</code> and <code>&#39;</code> characters at the end of our buffer, we can eliminate bounds-checking in the code that searches for those characters, and simply check whether we hit the sentinel node after the hot loop finishes. We currently don&#39;t break out of these for newlines though, which we should probably do. All other validation for these should occur when actually trying to allocate the string or character they are supposed to represent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Some things we do unconditionally that could be hidden behind a branch, but are very inexpensive so there is no point. Other things we hide behind a branch when it&#39;s expensive and generally predictable. E.g. utf8 validation is typically just making sure all bytes are less than 128, i.e. 0x80. Once we see some non-ascii sequences, then we have to do the more computationally expensive work of making sure the byte sequence is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Table lookups. I consolidate the SIMD/SWAR code into one so that we go down the exact same codepaths to find how many non_newline/identifier/non_unescaped_quote/space characters to jump over. This is probably much more efficient than having 4 separate copies of the same hot loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Inlining the SIMD/SWAR loop, even on machines that need to unroll 8 times. This turns out to be worth it in my tests, probably because it is an extremely hot loop!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">We reduce memory consumption by not storing start indices explicitly, which typically need to match the address space of the source length. In the case of Zig, where source files are constrained to be at most ~4GiB, only 32 bits of address space is needed for any given file. Thus the goal becomes reducing 32-bit start indices to something smaller. Quasi-succinct schemes for reducing the space consumption of monotonically increasing integer sequences immediately spring to mind, such as <a href="https://www.antoniomallia.it/sorted-integers-compression-with-elias-fano-encoding.html" rel="nofollow">Elias-Fano encoding</a>. However, we can achieve good space compression by simply storing the length of each token rather than the start index. Because tokens almost always have a length that can fit in a byte, we try to store all lengths in a byte. In the event that the length is too large to be stored in a byte, we store a <code>0</code> instead and make the next 4 bytes the true length. This works because tokens cannot have a length of 0, else they would not exist, therefore we can use lengths of <code>0</code> to trigger special behavior. We also know that this idea does not affect the upper bound on the number of Token elements we need to allocate because in order for a token to take up 3 times as much space as a typical token, it needs to have a length of at least 256, which the astute reader may note is significantly larger than 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Use fewer variables where possible. While machines nowadays have <em>a lot</em> more registers than they used to, you still only have access to 16 or 32 general purpose registers! If you have more variables than that, you have to spill to the stack (it&#39;s actually worse than this, because intermediate values in expressions temporarily need their own registers too). While machines do have extra registers they can use under the hood, you do not! Therefore, we can get better performance by</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Using pointers rather than pointers + index</li>
<li>Being clever about how we write out our <code>non_newlines</code> bitstrings. Instead of storing all of the bitstrings I get from the SIMD/SWAR code on the stack in a <code>[4]u64</code> (on 64 bit machines), and then writing separately to a <code>non_newlines</code> pointer, I write <em>all</em> the bitstrings into the memory allocated for the <code>non_newlines</code> bitstrings. Each time, I increment the place we are writing in the allocation by the width of a single bitstring, i.e. 8 bytes on 64 bit machines. Since I always write the <code>non_newlines</code> into the current position in the allocated memory and the other bitstrings are written after it, we will be left at the end with only <code>non_newlines</code> bitstrings. The only downside is we need to overallocate an extra 3 u64&#39;s than we otherwise would, but that&#39;s hardly any trouble. Here is a diagram of how this strategy looks in memory:</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9| &lt;- slots
|a|b|c|d|   &lt;- We write our bitstrings to 4 slots. (`a` is `non_newlines`)

<p dir="auto">In the last few days, I have:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Disabled loop unrolling for quote parsing loop on SWAR-enabled machines. Only a 1% uplift on my Sifive U74, but considering that&#39;s about 9 milliseconds at the moment, I&#39;ll take it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Updated the keyword lookup algorithm for non-vector architectures to use aligned loads where possible. There still could be room for improvement but today I saw a <strong>~5% performance uplift</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Updated to a <a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/pull/2042" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/simdjson/simdjson/pull/2042/hovercard">slightly better optimized version</a> of the escape-detection algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Made toggles so that <code>&#34;</code> and <code>&#39;</code> can be moved between the SIMD/SWAR section and a naïve scalar version very easily. It appears that for machines which have to use SWAR, it is faster to do the naïve scalar version (almost <strong>~8% uplift on my RISC-V SiFive U74</strong>). On the other hand, it&#39;s still more efficient on my desktop to do quote classification in SIMD, but for other less-powerful devices, it may not be worth it.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There is also a trade-off to be made on big-endian hardware. The SIMD <code>&#39;</code>/<code>&#34;</code> escape detection algorithm currently has to be done in little-endian, so there necessarily has to be a reversal somewhere (or byte-reversal on the vectors) if we want to not use the naïve scalar version.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">With SIMD, we need to do a vector reversal, unless we have fast machine-word bit-reverse instructions. At the moment I am not aware of any ISA&#39;s supported by the Zig compiler with a fast bit-reverse instruction besides arm/aarch64.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We take advantage of arm&#39;s bit-reverse instruction (<code>rbit</code>) so that we can use <code>clz</code> directly in our bitstring queries, rather than <code>rbit</code>+<code>clz</code>. On little-endian machines, we do the flip after the escape-detection algorithm. On big-endian, we can do it before, but then we can just bitreverse the backslashes before and after the escape detection algorithm. arm is typically little-endian these days, but who knows, maybe a future ISA can take advantage of the flexibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">mips64 and powerpc64 have built-in <code>clz</code> instructions, and emulate <code>ctz</code> via <code>@bitSizeOf(usize) - clz(~x &amp; (x -% 1))</code>. Therefore, if we wanted to do quotes in SIMD <em>and</em> use <code>clz</code>, we would have to flip our bitstrings twice! Ouch! Hopefully I or someone else figures out how to make a big-endian equivalent of the escape character bitstring generation algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">some sparc64 machines have <code>popc</code> (e.g. niagara 2 and up), which can emulate <code>ctz</code> via <code>popc(~x &amp; (x -% 1))</code>. To do <code>clz</code> we have to do <code>x |= x &gt;&gt; 1; x |= x &gt;&gt; 2; x |= x &gt;&gt; 4; x |= x &gt;&gt; 8; x |= x &gt;&gt; 16; x |= x &gt;&gt; 32;</code> to spread the most-significant bit all the way right-wards, then we can invert the bitstring to get a mask of the leading zeroes, and popcount that. So on big-endian sparc64 machines, we WANT to do a bitreverse. Also, LLVM&#39;s Vectorization currently does not work on sparc64 (or powerpc) machines, so we probably have to use the SWAR algorithm for the time being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">machines which do not have <code>clz</code> builtin can probably emulate a <code>ctz</code> faster than a <code>clz</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">With SWAR, we can do either a <code>@byteSwap</code> on the register being treated as a vector or we can reverse the bits with a bitreversing movmask algorithm. The problem with the latter is that we have to do an extra shift right on the bitstring before multiplying because the most significant bit of the most significant byte has to be moved to the lowest bit position of its byte. We <em>can</em> avoid this extra shift by instead using a multiply-high operation and concentrating the bits in the upper half of a double machine-word, and maintaining a 3 instruction movmask. However, the problem with this idea is that multiply-high might be a function call or have terrible throughput / port constraints, whereas multiplies typically have a throughput of 1 per cycle. Is the throughput actually a problem in practice though? Unsure. We <em>do</em> have quite a lot of other work to do in between multiplies.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>To generate 3 bitstrings for a chunk, we need 3 extra instructions for the bitreversed movmask (assuming we don&#39;t do <code>&#39;</code>/<code>&#34;</code> in SWAR). Therefore, if we can do a machine-word byte-reverse faster than 3 shifts and/or in fewer than 3 instructions, it would be smarter to do the byte-reverse. Alternatively, if we have fast multiply-high&#39;s somehow, we could use that to eliminate the 3 extra shifts (per native subchunk).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">For now, I think the bitstring escape sequence algorithm is best left disabled on big-endian hardware without a fast bit-reverse (so just arm atm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Since sparc64 and powerpc have to use SWAR until LLVM improves, they should do quote/escape logic in scalar code, not vector code. sparc64 machines lack bit-reverse and byte-reverse, so we can use the movemask-reversed function on sparc64.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">powerpc can stay in big-endian land and use <code>clz</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">mips64 has an extension to the ISA which adds vector instructions, although I&#39;m not sure if it has gone into real hardware yet or whether those vectors are actually useful for the kind of SIMD we are doing here.</p>

<p dir="auto">Replaced the SWAR movmask algorithm with one significantly better on typical hardware. Before, we were using <a href="http://0x80.pl/articles/scalar-sse-movmask.html" rel="nofollow">an algorithm from Wojciech Muła</a> which for 64 bit operand <code>x</code> would basically do: <code>(@as(u128, x) * constant) &gt;&gt; 64</code>. Now, we can stay within the lower 64 bits by concentrating the target bits in the most significant byte, so no widening is necessary. This is really good news for basically every machine I could find info on for the difference between <code>mulhi</code> vs <code>mul</code>. Typically <code>mulhi</code> instructions have much higher latency and signicantly worse throughput, and some machines do not even have a <code>mulhi</code> instruction at all. My algorithm modifies <a href="http://0x80.pl/articles/scalar-sse-movmask.html" rel="nofollow">Wojciech Muła&#39;s algorithm</a> to use only the lower 64 bits of the product of the multiplication:</p>

<p dir="auto">Fixed random performance issues, like the compiler not realizing that our SIMD/SWAR chunks are always aligned loads. (It matters a lot on less-mainstream machines!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Made the SIMD/SWAR code go chunk by chunk in lockstep rather than have each individual component load its 64 (on 64-bit machines) bytes separately. I am assuming that LLVM was able to reuse loaded vectors on some occasions, but in practice I saw a massive speedup in the last week. Granted, the utf8 validator was turned off temporarily while it is being reworked. However, on my Zen 3 machine I typically saw basically no performance difference between running the utf8 validator versus not. The reason for this is because we can almost always exit early (when the entire chunk is ascii). Due to alignment/cache/happenstance, I typically saw my tokenization times go <em>down</em> with the utf8 validator turned <em>on</em>, so I don&#39;t think I am unfairly advantaging my most recent measurements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Turned off the utf8 validator. I need to fix the types for it so it can be re-enabled. We also need to port a SWAR version. simdjson or Golang might have some tricks we can use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Added an option to enable or disable the folding of comments into adjacent nodes (<code>FOLD_COMMENTS_INTO_ADJACENT_NODES</code>). This should make it a little easier to change my mind on the particulars of the AST implementation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Added more tests and compile-time assertions. We&#39;re getting there!</p>
