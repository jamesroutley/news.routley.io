<p id="speakable-summary">Bedrock Robotics, an autonomous vehicle technology startup founded by veterans of Waymo and Segment, has been operating quietly for more than a year. Now, it’s breaking cover with an $80 million funding round from investors Eclipse and 8VC. </p>

<p>Bedrock Robotics is focused on developing a self-driving kit that can be retrofitted to construction and other worksite vehicles, <a href="https://bedrockrobotics.com/news/introducing-bedrock-robotics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to the company</a>. The announcement confirms some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/30/techcrunch-mobility-a-ride-sharing-pioneer-comes-for-uber-tesla-loses-more-ground-and-dog-like-delivery-robots-land-in-texas/">TechCrunch’s reporting</a> in May. Bedrock is “upgrading existing fleets with sensors, compute, and intelligence that understands project goals, adapts to changing conditions, and executes work around the clock,” <a href="https://bedrockrobotics.com/news/introducing-bedrock-robotics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to a blog post written by co-founder and CEO Boris Sofman.</a></p>







<p>Sofman previously led Waymo’s now shuttered self-driving trucks program. But he’s perhaps best known for his role as co-founder and CEO of Anki Robotics, which made the popular Cozmo consumer robot, and shut down in 2019. Other co-founders include Waymo veterans Kevin Peterson, who is now CTO, Ajay Gummalla, who is a VP of engineering, and Tom Eliaz, who previously worked at Segment and Twilio, is also a VP of engineering.</p>

<p>The company could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update this article with new details once Bedrock responds.</p>

<p>Bedrock is the latest company to steer engineers who are adept at robotics, autonomy, and AI toward the off-road environment. Several autonomous vehicle startups have popped up in recent years with an aim to apply their self-driving systems to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/18/vcs-and-the-military-are-fueling-self-driving-startups-that-dont-need-roads/">off-road environments</a>, like construction, mining, industrial sites, and even defense.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Pronto, a San Francisco-based startup that has developed a self-driving system designed for haulage trucks and other off-road vehicles used at construction and mining sites, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/av-startup-pronto-ai-acquires-off-road-autonomous-vehicle-rival-safeai/">acquired competitor</a> SafeAI. Other startups that play in the fragmented and broad sector of off-road autonomy include Kodiak Robotics, Polymath Robotics, Seattle-based <a href="https://www.overland.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Overland AI</a>, New Brunswick, Canada-based <a href="https://www.potentialmotors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Potential</a>, and more established companies like Forterra.</p>

<p>Bedrock said it’s focused on construction sites and is testing in Arkansas, Arizona, Texas, and California with four corporations: Sundt Construction, Zachry Construction Corporation, Champion Site Prep Inc., and Capitol Aggregates Inc.</p>
