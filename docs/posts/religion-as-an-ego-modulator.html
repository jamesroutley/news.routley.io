Anyone who contradicts or denies these beliefs is condemned or cast out as a heretic.</span></p><p><span>It’s tempting to think of metaphysical belief as something esoteric and removed from daily life. But </span><strong>metaphysical beliefs provide a foundation for our picture of reality</strong><span>—they are the roots from which a worldview grows.</span></p><p><span>If you believe in a paternalistic king god, you will likely value hierarchy and power. If you believe in a pantheistic god who is present in every animal, tree, hill, and rock, you will have a deep empathy for nature. If you’re a scientifically-minded atheist, you probably see reality as something to be studied and harnessed. None of these associations is set in stone—there are certainly some anarchic Christians and plenty of environmentalist atheists. But in general,</span><strong> people take their metaphysical beliefs seriously, and use them to guide their behavior</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>It’s important to recognize that </span><strong>a person’s ego is not fixed</strong><span>. Any meaningful and lasting change in our beliefs corresponds to a change our ego. Or as William James put it, “If you can change your mind, you can change your life.” He believed that </span><strong>one of the markers of religious experience is </strong><em><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanoia_(psychology)" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">metanoia</a></strong></em><span>, a fundamental and stable change in an individual’s life-orientation.</span></p><p><span>James was a Harvard philosopher and psychologist with particular interest in the psychology of religion. In 1901 he delivered a series of lectures, now published as </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Varieties_of_Religious_Experience" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Varieties of Religious Experience</a></em><span>, which set the foundation for a scientific study of religious attitudes. </span></p><p>Despite the title, the most profound passages in the book discuss not the varieties, but the commonalities of religious experience:</p><blockquote><p>When we survey the whole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have prevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the other are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian, and Buddhist saints are practically indistinguishable</p></blockquote><p><span>As a self-described &#34;radical empiricist,&#34; he spends much of the lectures enumerating the external, visible effects of religious experience. James points out that </span><strong>the saints of all religions are inclined towards living a simple life and treating others selflessly</strong><span>. He describes the “saintly character” as having:</span></p><blockquote><p>1. A feeling of being in a wider life than that of this world&#39;s selfish little interests…</p><p>2. A sense of the friendly continuity of the ideal power with our own life, and a willing self-surrender to its control.</p><p>3. An immense elation and freedom, as the outlines of the confining selfhood melt down.</p><p>4. A shifting of the emotional centre towards loving and harmonious affections, towards “yes, yes” and away from “no,” where the claims of the non-ego are concerned.</p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, </span><strong>the hallmark of a religious mind is a smaller ego</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Half a century later, </span><strong>Aldous Huxley expanded on James’ theory by drawing from a wide variety of religious texts</strong><span>. In his book </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perennial_Philosophy" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Perennial Philosophy</a></em><span>, Huxley attempts to further distill the common element of religion.</span></p><p><span>Again, Huxley’s thesis is that religion serves to lessen our ego, though </span><strong>he emphasizes the porousness of the ego-barrier</strong><span> as much as its overall size. Huxley draws more deeply from mystical traditions, which are concerned not only with external saintly behavior, but also with an internal our sense of unity with world. While discussing the “</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/tat-tvam-asi" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">thou art that</a><span>” doctrine of Hinduism, Huxley differentiates and unites these two methods of spiritual attainment:</span></p><blockquote><p>The man who wishes to know the &#34;that&#34; which is &#34;thou&#34; may set to work in any one of three ways. He may begin by looking inwards into his own particular thou and, by a process of &#34;dying to self&#34;…Or else he may begin with the thous existing outside himself, and may try to realize their essential unity with God and, through God, with one another and with his own being. Or, finally (and this is doubtless the best way), he may seek to approach the ultimate That both from within and from without, so that he comes to realize God experimentally as at once the principle of his own thou and of all other thous, animate and inanimate.</p></blockquote><p><span>Huxley contends that </span><strong>all religions are systems for reducing our individual egos</strong><span> and identifying more strongly with the group—and in the case of the most extreme mystics, with the universe itself.</span></p><p><span>But both </span><strong>these approaches ignore the wide range of cases where religion creates </strong><em><strong>outsized</strong></em><strong> egos</strong><span>. Cult leaders, abusive priests, and starry-eyed New Agers have all found their way into an </span><em>ego-maximizing</em><span> side of religion. There has to be a more generic description of religion than James or Huxley account for.</span></p><p><span>Most religions have a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Higher Power</a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Transcendental Self</a><span> at the root of their ontology. This is why Huxley and James identified a common pattern of ego-reduction across religions—the more deeply you become aware of an immense Other, the smaller you feel yourself to be.</span></p><p><span>But it’s easy to see how </span><strong>the same metaphysics can be perverted to have an equal but opposite effect</strong><span>. The concept of a Higher Power immediately creates a sense of hierarchy, and anyone who believes themselves to be “closer” to that Power than others will feel their ego begin to inflate.</span></p><p><span>Seeing </span><strong>religion as an ego-modulator, instead of simply as an ego-reducer</strong><span>, helps to explain a wide variety of religious phenomena.</span></p><p><span>In the case of Catholicism, it’s easy to see how </span><strong>the concept of God as King reinforces loyalty and obedience</strong><span> to the Church, which is organized in a hierarchy, with the Pope as God’s ultimate representative on Earth.</span></p><p><span>But </span><strong>the Catholic Church is also a perfect case study for ego-modulation gone wrong</strong><span>. From 1950 to 2002, about </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay_Report#Summary" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">4% of priests were accused of child sexual abuse</a><span>. What went wrong?</span></p><p><span>In his book </span><em>Facing the Dragon</em><span> (</span><a href="https://superbowl.substack.com/p/book-review-facing-the-dragon" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">which I reviewed</a><span>), Psychologist Robert Moore argued that </span><strong>elevating particular people to serve as divine representatives can cause their ego to inflate out of control</strong><span>. Moore says:</span></p><blockquote><p>Think if you were the pope. It would be a real spiritual problem to deal with your grandiosity because everyone constantly dumps their idealizing projections onto you. It would be a tremendous problem. If you think the priest has a problem, the bishop has a greater problem, the archbishop an even worse one, and if you were trying to be the spiritual leader of all the millions of Roman Catholics in the world, think of carrying that archetypal burden. Think about going around the world and having 400,000 people gathered in front of you idealizing you while you do Mass. This man obviously has to be relatively healthy emotionally or he would become greatly disturbed.</p><p>So clergy have a huge emotional challenge. Just because you are ordained doesn’t mean that your shadow disappears. I deal with clergy all the time who have massive problems managing their own grandiosity. They tend to act out a lot. In fact, the phenomena of clergy acting out sexually, or in substance abuse, workaholism, or any other compulsive behavior, relate directly to the problem of managing their inner grandiosity.</p></blockquote><p><span>It’s important to recognize that </span><strong>the ego-structure set up by Catholic metaphysics allowed the abuse to happen</strong><span>. It granted priests divine authority, despite their humanness, and both the priests and their parishioners take this quite literally. It’s noteworthy that the quote “absolute power corrupts absolutely” </span><a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quote/lord-acton-writes-to-bishop-creighton-that-the-same-moral-standards-should-be-applied-to-all-men-political-and-religious-leaders-included-especially-since-power-tends-to-corrupt-and-absolute-power-corrupts-absolutely-1887" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">was explicitly about the Catholic Church</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Buddhism makes for a good second case study, as it has a very different type of metaphysics from Catholicism. Rather than placing a King God at the top of a rigid hierarchy, Buddhism denies the existence of any individual self. In Buddhism, </span><strong><span>ego-reduction comes about through contemplation and gradual understanding of impermanence and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">non-self</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Where does it go wrong? We might think that with no deity to align yourself with, no individual could be elevated above their peers. But </span><strong>Buddhism deifies more “realized” practitioners</strong><span>. Those who are perceived as having reached </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(Buddhism)" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Nirvana</a><span> naturally have higher status and authority. They are seen as having special access to spiritual knowledge.</span></p><p><span>Buddhists typically take </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Restraint_and_renunciation" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">serious precautions</a><span>, in part to prevent abuse of this authority. But it has sometimes gone horribly wrong, especially when sects don’t take those precautions seriously. The most heartbreaking case is that of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96sel_Tendzin#Controversy" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ösel Tendzin</a><span>, who slept with and forcibly raped his students, all while knowing he was HIV-positive. </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/12/the-zen-predator-of-the-upper-east-side/383831/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Atlantic</a><span> and </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/16/is-enlightenment-compatible-with-sex-scandals/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Slate Star Codex</a><span> have catalogued several other cases.</span></p><p><span>This is a common pattern among Enlightenment-oriented religions—</span><strong>those who are deemed “fully realized” gain an unworldly amount of power and prestige</strong><span>.</span></p><p>This one is a bit of a stretch. Bear with me for a minute while I—inadvisably—equate science with religion.</p><p><span>Friedrich Hayek popularized the term </span><em>Scientism</em><span> to describe the dogmatic attitude displayed by the strongest advocates for modern science. Typically, the word </span><em>Scientism</em><span> is used pejoratively, but I would argue Scientism comes with a huge benefit: it helps establish the importance of science in the public’s imagination. </span><strong>The average person can become enamored with science for unscientific reasons</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>The High Priest of Scientism would have to be Carl Sagan, whose popular expositions of scientific knowledge—especially through the program </span><em>Cosmos</em><span>—inspired </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZmafy_v8g8" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">billions and billions</a><span> (okay, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">only half a billion</a><span>) people.</span></p><p><span>While it’s not entirely fair to call it a religion, the parallels between Scientism and traditional religion </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism#Relevance_to_debates_about_science_and_religion" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">have been thoroughly discussed</a><span>. Sagan even delivered a series of lectures in tribute to William James, called </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Varieties_of_Scientific_Experience" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Varieties of Scientific Experience</a><span>. </span></em></p><p><span>Importantly, </span><strong>Scientism engenders the same ego-reducing effect as religion</strong><span>. This is most evident in Sagan’s description of the Pale Blue Dot photo (below):</span></p><blockquote><p>Look again at that dot. That&#39;s here. That&#39;s home. That&#39;s us.

One of science’s strongest dogmas is the transpersonal nature of scientific progress—no individual can claim unique authority. Everyone’s work is subject to verification and criticism.

There is plenty of hatred for the outgroup (looking at you, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">r/skeptic</a><span>).
