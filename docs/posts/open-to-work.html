								<p>I decided to leave my job (Principal Software Engineer) after 4 years. I have no idea what I want to do next, so I’ve been having loads of chats to try and work that out.</p><p>I like working in mission focused organizations, working to fix problems across the stack, from interpersonal down to the operating system. I enjoy “going where I’m rare”, places that don’t always get the most attention. At my last job, I most enjoyed working to drive engineering standards for all products across the company, mentoring engineers across all teams and seniority levels, and serving as an advisor for senior leadership as we grew the engineering team from 3 to 150 people.</p><p>If you have a role that you think I’d like to hear about, I’d love to hear about it at jobs{}pault.ag (where the {} is an @ sign).</p>
