    <p>I&#39;m doomscrolling Reddit.</p>
<p>Every post is either political ragebait, recycled &#34;funny&#34; cat videos, &#34;Am I the asshole for divorcing my husband after he killed our two children while drunk and high?&#34;-type slop, or tired wojack memes.</p>
<p>Then, finally: an authentic, human-sounding title.</p>
<p>&#34;Anyone else feel like the internet is just… broken now?&#34;</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posthuman/post-1.webp" alt="post"/></p>
<p>The post has nearly 6,000 upvotes, hundreds of comments, and an unsettling sense of genuine despair:</p>
<p>&#34;Everything online feels either like an ad, a hustle, or someone desperately trying to go viral. Nothing feels real anymore.&#34;</p>
<p>It resonates deeply. But as I read further, something nags at the back of my mind. The wording, the rhythm is too perfectly calibrated, suspiciously optimized to trigger maximum relatability. I click on the poster&#39;s username.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posthuman/profile-1.webp" alt="profile"/></p>
<p>Their profile is a barren wasteland of karma-farming garbage: viral pet clips, recycled feel-good stories, endless reposted memes. They churn out multiple threads daily yet never engage in comments. Typical bot behavior.</p>
<p>Returning to the original post, the last sentence catches my eye:</p>
<p>&#34;This was written in 1928—it’s incredible how it predicted the moment we’re living in today and where we&#39;re heading.&#34;</p>
<p>The sentence is underlined, and colored blue: it&#39;s a hyperlink. Embedded neatly into the text, it uses a shortened domain &#34;rddit.org&#34;. At first it seems legit. Platforms do shorten links for tracking and branding, after all. Twitter has t.co, Facebook uses fb.me. Makes sense Reddit might have something similar.</p>
<p>Yet I&#39;ve never noticed Reddit using &#34;rddit.org&#34; before. Curiosity, perhaps paranoia, drives me to a quick WHOIS lookup.</p>
<p>Turns out &#34;rddit.org&#34; isn&#39;t owned by Reddit. It’s registered anonymously via a cheap freemium link shortener. It could redirect anywhere. I know better than to click shady links on Reddit...</p>
<p>I click it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m swiftly redirected to Amazon, landing on a listing for a modern, illustrated edition of Edward L. Bernays&#39; classic: &#34;Propaganda.&#34; And there it is, undeniable in the URL bar: the affiliate tag, &#34;manwithhairwe-20&#34;.</p>
<p>The book has thirteen oddly generic reviews. After clicking my way to the illustrator&#39;s Amazon profile, the truth emerges: the seller specializes in selling classic texts freshly &#34;enhanced&#34; with AI-generated art.</p>
<p>An AI-powered bot pretending to be a human, lamenting AI-powered bots who pretend to be human, to gain human trust, so that it can covertly market AI-illustrated books. The Trojan horse of late-stage capitalism, cyberpunk dystopia and fuckity-fuck-what-the-fuck-is-going-on.</p>
<p>I scroll back to the comments. There&#39;s hundreds of users interacting, none apparently noticing the ruse. The top comment mentions something called &#34;Dead Internet Theory&#34;: the belief that most online interactions are automated loops of bots communicating with eachother.</p>
<p>The irony hits like a train. Did anyone commenting realize they were trying to engage with a bot designed to monetize their empathy? Maybe they were also bots, spiraling endlessly into their algorithmically optimized oblivion?</p>
<p>Sorting by controversial, I find one tiny, nearly invisible, buried comment:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posthuman/comment-1.webp" alt="comment"/></p>
<p>Is this commenter the only other surviving human? Or just another bot, designed to provoke more comments, more engagement?</p>
<p>My browser tabs multiply frantically. Reddit melts into conspiracy forums, WHOIS lookups, and archived Amazon profiles. Everything is spinning.</p>
<p>A bot selling fake empathy to promote fake products through a fake sense of community.</p>
<p>Maybe nothing is real anymore.</p>
<p>Was my spiraling paranoia exactly what they wanted? To drive me insane, so that I click more frantically, driving engagement metrics higher?</p>
<p>Are they watching, judging my reaction whilst calibrating tomorrow&#39;s psyop?</p>
<p>Quoting Orwell feels cliché:</p>
<p>&#34;If you want a picture of the future, <del>imagine a boot stamping on a human face</del> imagine a bot making you sad and angry in order to farm engagement and sell you AI-generated slop--forever.&#34;</p>
