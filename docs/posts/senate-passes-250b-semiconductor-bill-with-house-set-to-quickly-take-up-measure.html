  </p></div><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate" target="_blank">The Senate on Wednesday passed a bill</a> aimed at increasing U.S. competition with China by a 64-33 vote, sending the $250 billion measure to the House of Representatives.</p><p>The bill, officially called the CHIPS Act of 2022, cleared a 60-vote cloture hurdle Tuesday, setting it on course to easily pass Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she plans to take up the bill quickly and send it to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank">President Biden&#39;s desk.</a></p><p>&#34;It’s been a long journey to get to this point, but history will show that by passing this CHIPS-Plus bill, we are confronting the challenges of today and building a prosperous and secure tomorrow for all Americans,&#34; Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., said Wednesday on the Senate floor. </p><div baseimage="https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/aaToddYoung.jpg" source="Getty Images"><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/343/192/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/686/384/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"/><source media="(min-width: 767px) and (max-width: 1023px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/672/378/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/1344/756/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"/><source media="(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1279px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/931/523/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/1862/1046/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/720/405/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1, https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/1440/810/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"/> <img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/02/640/320/aaToddYoung.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="Sen.
