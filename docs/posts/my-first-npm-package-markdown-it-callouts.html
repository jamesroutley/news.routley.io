    <h1>My First NPM Package: markdown-it-callouts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I’ve got a blog post in the works that uses infoboxes. Previously I had a little snippet adapted from <a href="https://github.com/rothsandro/eleventy-notes">eleventy-notes</a> so I could parse <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts">Obsidian callouts</a> into <code>aside</code> elements, but now I wanted to have special styling.</p>

<pre><code><span>&gt;</span> [!info] They&#39;re defined like this!
<span>&gt;</span> The first line is the title, and subsequent lines are the body.
<span>&gt;</span> You can put whatever elements you want in here too, like code blocks or images.</code></pre>
<p>I rolled up my sleeves and added all the <code>markdown-it</code> rendering code and CSS I needed. Once I had the new feature in place to correctly handle this non-standard markdown feature, I wanted to package it up for reusability. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/markdown-it-callouts">on GitHub</a>, but it’s surprisingly annoying to pull in a Typescript dependency via a Git link. I <em>could</em> check in the compiled artifacts to source control, but that’s a poor practice if I can avoid it. Instead I decided to publish the package to npm.</p>
<p>My first attempt to publish on npm only sent up my Typescript source files, which is gives you the same problems as pulling in the Github repo. I had to learn about the <code>package.json</code> field <code>files</code>, so that way npm would package up my artifacts and not my source code. Otherwise the publishing process was familiar to me from publishing Rust crates. I ran <code>npm publish</code> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-callouts">the package went up on the registry</a>. Feel free to check it out for your own projects, if you also want a convenient way to parse callouts.</p>
