<p>This has been my most ambitious project yet. I learned how to design electronics and circuit boards. I learned a new programming language called Rust and wrote my first driver, I upped my CAD skills, 3D printed, and did my first resin casting. I generated the images pictured on the cards above using an AI image synthesizer which I’m hosting on my own server. </p><p>I haven’t designed a game for them yet! I’ve got some ideas, and I’m curious to explore the new interactions and game mechanics these unlock. If you know anyone out there who’d want to play around with these, try out ideas, give suggestions, or nerd out on game design, send me an email: <a href="mailto:jonah@wyldcard.io">jonah@wyldcard.io</a></p><p>Special thanks to Ish, who inspired me to actually build something, and to Brady who taught me everything about electronics.</p>
