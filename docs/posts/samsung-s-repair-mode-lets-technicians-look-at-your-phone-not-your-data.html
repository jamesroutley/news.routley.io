<p>Samsung is introducing an interesting new feature for people sending in their Galaxy phones for repair: &#34;repair mode.&#34; When shipping off your phone, you might want to do something to protect your data, and the new feature sounds like a great solution. It locks down your data, but not your phone.</p>
<p>Handling data during a mail-in repair process is tough. You could wipe your phone, but that&#39;s a big hassle. You don&#39;t want to just send in a completely locked down device, as technicians can&#39;t thoroughly test it if they&#39;re locked out of everything. While in repair mode, technicians can still poke around in your device and test everything, but they&#39;ll only see the default apps with blank data. When you get your device back, you can re-authenticate and disable repair mode and you&#39;ll get all your data back.</p>
<p>The feature was first spotted by <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-repair-mode-data-isnt-stolen-during-phone-repair/">SamMobile</a>, and Samsung has so far only announced the feature in a <a href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%EC%82%BC%EC%84%B1-%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C%ED%8F%B0%EC%97%90-%EC%88%98%EB%A6%AC-%EB%AA%A8%EB%93%9C-%EC%B6%94%EA%B0%80-%EA%B0%9C%EC%9D%B8%EC%A0%95%EB%B3%B4-%EC%9C%A0%EC%B6%9C-%EC%9B%90">Korean press release</a>; it is first launching in Korea for the Galaxy S21 (the S22 is Samsung&#39;s latest flagship phone). Repair mode can be turned on from the settings menu, and Samsung says (through Google translate), &#34;You won&#39;t be able to access your personal data, such as photos, messages, and accounts,&#34; and anyone with the phone will &#34;only use the default installed apps.&#34;  Repair mode can be exited the same way, though you&#39;ll need to authenticate with a pattern, pin, or fingerprint.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Samsung doesn&#39;t explain how the feature works, but Android has a number of built-in capabilities that would make it relatively simple to implement such a feature. Android supports multiple user accounts, which allow for multiple separate sets of apps and data. It wouldn&#39;t take much to lock down the primary user and spin up a &#34;guest&#34; user with no data for the repair people to work with. It&#39;s also possible that Samsung is locking down the entire user data partition. Repair technicians could get a temporary data store and access to the read-only system partition, which houses all the OS files you would need for testing.</p>
<p>However the feature works, it&#39;s a great idea, and it&#39;s something we&#39;d like to see other manufacturers implement. For now, repair mode is only available on one model of device and only in Korea, but Samsung says it will get a wider rollout in the future.</p>
