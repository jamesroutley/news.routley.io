                                The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the
                                power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating
                                systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of
                                a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1. reliably identifying interactable
                                icons within the user interface, and 2. understanding the semantics of various
                                elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the
                                corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce OMNIPARSER,
                                a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured
                                elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions
                                that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We
                                first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and
                                an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized
                                models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption
                                model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. OMNIPARSER
                                significantly improves GPT-4V&#39;s performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And
                                on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, OMNIPARSER with screenshot only input
                                outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of
                                screenshot
