    <h1>More telcos confirm Salt Typhoon breaches as White House weighs in</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies confirmed that Chinese government-backed snoops accessed portions of their systems earlier this year, while the White House added another, yet-unnamed telecommunications company to the list of those breached by Salt Typhoon.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/14/salt_typhoon_hacked_multiple_telecom/">digital intrusion</a>, which has been called the​ &#34;worst telecom hack in our nation&#39;s history,&#34; gave Beijing-backed spies the &#34;capability to geolocate millions of individuals&#34; and &#34;record phone calls at will,&#34; Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/12/27/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-38/">told</a> reporters.</p>
<p>In a statement emailed to <em>The Register</em>, AT&amp;T said the foreign spies compromised &#34;a small number&#34; of its customers in the espionage campaign and added that the PRC-backed crew had since been kicked out of its networks.</p>

    

<p>&#34;We detect no activity by nation-state actors in our networks at this time,&#34; an AT&amp;T spokesperson said. </p>

        


        

<p>&#34;Based on our current investigation of this attack, the People&#39;s Republic of China targeted a small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest,&#34; the statement added. &#34;In the relatively few instances in which an individual&#39;s information was impacted, we have complied with our notification obligations in cooperation with law enforcement.&#34;</p>
<p>AT&amp;T continues to monitor its networks and work with government officials, other telecom firms, and cybersecurity experts on the investigation, the spokesperson said.</p>

        

<p>Verizon also confirmed that the Chinese intruders had accessed &#34;a small number of high-profile customers in government and politics.&#34; A spokesperson told <em>The Register</em> that it notified these customers, and has since &#34;contained the cyber incident brought on by this nation-state threat actor.&#34;</p>
<p>An unnamed, &#34;highly respected&#34; cybersecurity company has also confirmed the containment, the Verizon spokesperson added.</p>
<p>According to the operator&#39;s chief legal officer, Verizon partnered with federal law enforcement, national security agencies, other telecom partners, and security firms upon detecting the network activity.</p>

        

<p>&#34;We have not detected threat actor activity in Verizon&#39;s network for some time, and after considerable work addressing this incident, we can report that Verizon has contained the activities associated with this particular incident,&#34; Verizon&#39;s Chief Legal Officer Vandana Venkatesh told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, Lumen Technologies, another one of the firms <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/07/verizon_att_lumen_salt_typhoon/">reportedly breached</a> in the attack, told us that it has also booted the Chinese attackers out of its systems, and said it found &#34;no evidence&#34; that customer data was accessed.</p>
<p>&#34;An independent forensics firm has confirmed Salt Typhoon is no longer in our network,&#34; a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>. &#34;In addition, our federal partners have not shared any information that would suggest otherwise.&#34;</p>
<p>T-Mobile&#39;s security boss previously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/05/tmobile_cso_telecom_attack/">spoke</a> to <em>The Register</em> about the espionage campaign and said it thwarted successful attacks on its systems &#34;within a single-digit number of days.&#34;</p>
<h3>9 telecom firms compromised, White House says</h3>
<p>The companies&#39; admissions come as a top White House official added another unnamed firm to the breach, bringing the total thus far to nine. Neuberger previously said eight had been compromised. Only three — AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile US — have confirmed the intrusion.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We believe a large number of individuals were affected by geolocation and metadata of phones; a smaller number around actual collection of phone calls and texts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#34;The Chinese gained access to networks, essentially had broad and full access,&#34; Neuberger told reporters. &#34;We believe that&#39;s why they had the capability to geolocate millions of individuals, to record phone calls at will, because they had that broad access.&#34;</p>
<p>In one instance, the spies broke into an admin account that then gave them access to more than 100,000 routers, she added. &#34;So, when the Chinese compromised that account, they gained that kind of broad access across the network,&#34; Neuberger said. &#34;That&#39;s not meaningful cybersecurity to defend against a nation-state actor.&#34; </p>
<p>The White House doesn&#39;t yet have a number on how many total people were affected by the breach, she added. </p>
<p>&#34;We believe a large number of individuals were affected by geolocation and metadata of phones; a smaller number around actual collection of phone calls and texts,&#34; Neuberger said. &#34;And I think the scale we&#39;re talking about is far larger on the geolocation; probably less than 100 on the actual individuals.&#34;</p>
<p>Following the intrusion, the White House emphasized the inadequacy of voluntary cybersecurity measures against nation-state threats. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched a public rule <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/06/salt_typhoon_fcc_proposal/">proposal</a> requiring basic cybersecurity practices for telecom carriers. The commissioners are expected to vote on the rule by January 15.</p>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the FCC&#39;s own efforts, US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/11/telecom_cybersecurity_standards/">proposed legislation</a> that would require the FCC to issue binding rules for telecom systems.</p>
<p>Plus, according to Neuberger, all of the nine telecom CEOs whose companies were hacked have signed on to the government&#39;s 60-day Enduring Security Framework.</p>
<p>This public-private effort aims to put in place minimum cybersecurity practices that have been agreed upon by intelligence officers, CISA, the FBI, and telecom security experts. ®</p>
