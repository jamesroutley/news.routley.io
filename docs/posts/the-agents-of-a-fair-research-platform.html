    <h1>The Agents of a FAIR Research Platform</h1>

<p>To explain a FAIR research platform, we have to show how they are built from mindless stuff, smaller
and simpler than anything we’d consider smart. What could these simpler particles be – the “agents”
that compose the platform? There are many questions to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: How do agents work?</li>
<li>Embodiment: What are they made of?</li>
<li>Interaction: How do they communicate?</li>
<li>Learning: How do we make new agents and change old ones?</li>
<li>Character: What are the most important kinds of agents?</li>
<li>Authority: What happens when agents disagree?</li>
<li>Intention: How could such networks want or wish?</li>
<li>Competence: How can groups of agents do what separate agents cannot do?</li>
<li>Selfness: What gives them unity or personality?</li>
<li>Meaning: How could they understand anything?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions all seem difficult when we sever each one’s connections to the other ones. But once
we see a platform as a society of agents, each answer can illuminate the rest.</p>
