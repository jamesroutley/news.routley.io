My failed attempt at using a closet as an office
</h3>

<div id="post-body-8845916411747620132">
<p>My partner and I both work from home. I&#39;m very thankful for that as we have two young children and a commute would take up the same time we spend on getting them ready for the day. However, it&#39;s been quite a journey coming up with a home office setup that works for both of us.</p>

<p>We&#39;re fortunate that our 2-bedroom house in the bay area is fairly roomy - large living room, large bedroom, and a large addition to the house that looks very much like it was designed to be an office.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the layout:</p>
