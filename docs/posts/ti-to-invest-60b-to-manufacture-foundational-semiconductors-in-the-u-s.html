<p><b>DALLAS, </b>June 18, 2025 – Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today announced its plans to invest more than $60 billion across seven U.S. semiconductor fabs, making this the largest investment in foundational semiconductor manufacturing in U.S. history. Working with the Trump administration and building on the company’s nearly 100-year legacy, TI is expanding its U.S. manufacturing capacity to supply the growing need for semiconductors that will advance critical innovations from vehicles to smartphones to data centers. Combined, TI’s new manufacturing mega-sites in Texas and Utah will support more than 60,000 U.S. jobs.</p>
<p>“TI is building dependable, low-cost 300mm capacity at scale to deliver the analog and embedded processing chips that are vital for nearly every type of electronic system,” said Haviv Ilan, president and CEO of Texas Instruments. “Leading U.S. companies such as Apple, Ford, Medtronic, NVIDIA and SpaceX rely on TI’s world-class technology and manufacturing expertise, and we are honored to work alongside them and the U.S. government to unleash what’s next in American innovation.”</p>
<p>“For nearly a century, Texas Instruments has been a bedrock American company driving innovation in technology and manufacturing,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. “President Trump has made it a priority to increase semiconductor manufacturing in America – including these foundational semiconductors that go into the electronics that people use every day. Our partnership with TI will support U.S. chip manufacturing for decades to come.”</p>

	<div data-lid="richText_402c"><p><b>Unleashing what’s next in American innovation</b></p>
<p>Today, TI is the largest foundational semiconductor manufacturer in the U.S., producing analog and embedded processing chips that are critical for smartphones, vehicles, data centers, satellites and nearly every other electronic device. In order to meet the steadily growing demand for these essential chips, TI is building on its legacy of technology leadership and expanding its U.S. manufacturing presence to help its customers pioneer the next wave of technological breakthroughs.</p>
<p><b>Igniting intelligence with Apple</b></p>
<p>“Texas Instruments&#39; American-made chips help bring Apple products to life, and together, we’ll continue to create opportunity, drive innovation, and invest in the future of advanced manufacturing across the U.S.,” said Apple’s CEO Tim Cook.</p>
<p><b>Fueling the future with Ford</b></p>
<p>Ford and TI are working to strengthen American manufacturing, combining Ford’s automotive expertise with TI’s semiconductor technology to help drive innovation and secure a robust, domestic supply chain for the future of mobility. “At Ford, 80% of the vehicles we sell in the U.S. are assembled in the U.S., and we are proud to stand with technology leaders like TI that continue to invest in manufacturing in the U.S.,” said Jim Farley, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p><b>Connecting patient care with Medtronic</b></p>
<p>Medtronic and TI are partnering to improve lives when it matters most. “At Medtronic, our life-saving medical technologies rely on semiconductors to deliver precision, performance, and innovation at scale,” said Geoff Martha, Medtronic chairman and CEO. “Texas Instruments has been a vital partner – especially during the global chip shortages – helping us maintain supply continuity and accelerate the development of breakthrough therapies. We’re proud to leverage TI’s U.S.-manufactured semiconductors as we work to transform healthcare and improve outcomes for patients around the world.”</p>
<p><b>Advancing AI with NVIDIA</b></p>
<p>NVIDIA is partnering with TI to unleash the next generation of artificial intelligence architectures. “NVIDIA and TI share the goal to revitalize U.S. manufacturing by building more of the infrastructure for AI factories here in the U.S.,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with TI by developing products for advanced AI infrastructure.”</p>
<p><b>Securing high-speed satellite internet with SpaceX</b></p>
<p>SpaceX is increasingly leveraging TI’s high-speed process technology to connect its Starlink satellite internet service with TI’s latest 300mm SiGe technology manufactured in Sherman, Texas. “Our fundamental mission is to revolutionize global connectivity and eliminate the digital divide. Core to this mission is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible,” said Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX. “SpaceX is manufacturing tens of thousands of Starlink kits a day – all right here in the U.S. – and we are making huge investments in PCB manufacturing and silicon packaging to expand even further. TI’s U.S.-made semiconductors are crucial for securing a U.S. supply chain for our products, and their advanced silicon manufacturing capabilities provide the performance and reliability needed to help us meet the growing demand for high-speed internet all around the world.”</p>
