    <h1>Ask HN: Brother printers sending ink data to Amazon?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A most unusual thing. Every once in a while I get an email from Amazon that it&#39;s time to re-order Brother ink. I always delete these because I rarely print, but also figure it&#39;s just Amazon reminding me to buy something.</p><p>Today I decided to opt out/unsubscribe once and for all. Instead I see this at the bottom of the email:</p><p>&#34;Click here to view or manage settings, including the option to opt out if you are already using another replenishment service.</p><p>This took me to https://drs-web.amazon.com/settings</p><p>&#34;The data shown is based on estimated consumption reported by smart devices and orders you place through Amazon.&#34;</p><p>Here it had a link to &#34;Consumption history&#34; which upon clicking showed me the ink levels of my Brother printer for the past <i>two weeks</i>. Date and time.</p><p>WTF?! It is not apparent that I can disable this function. Can anyone else duplicate?</p><p><i>Update</i> : This is part of Alexa it seems, and folded in to the Dash replenishment protocol; note I have never had a Dash button.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s instructions for this were not very helpful.</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201357520</p><p>Some digging revealed a Brother help document:</p><p>https://help.brother-usa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/172810/~/cancel-enrollment-%28amazon-smart-reorders%29</p><p>This bothers me quite a lot. I never authorized, opted in, or gave either device permission to connect, let alone Amazon to monitor and nag me about it!</p><p>Model: Brother MFC-J485DW</p><p>Purchased from: Best Buy, an American retailer, after July of 2019.</p><p>Firmware: N1901041316</p></div></div></div>
