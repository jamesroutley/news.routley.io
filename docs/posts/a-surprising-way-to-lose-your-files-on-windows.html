    <h1>A surprising way to lose your files on Windows</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This sad sequence of events just happened to a relative, and they&#39;re distraught. I haven&#39;t used Windows for ~15 years but since it was my area of expertise back then I still get lumbered with these problems. This one really surprised me though.</p><p>They logged into Windows 7 (I know, upgrade...) and it looked like their files were missing. In a panic, they opened Explorer and searched for their files. They turned up in the search. They just didn&#39;t show up in the usual &#34;My Documents&#34;, &#34;My Pictures&#34;, &#34;My Videos&#34; paths.</p><p>They decided to move the files &#34;to the correct place&#34;. And then they shut the computer down.</p><p>The next time they started it, the same thing happened. This is where I got called in, because <i>this</i> time, the files didn&#39;t show up in a search. I told them to turn the computer off immediately and drop it with me.</p><p>Can you guess what happened? Well, check this out:</p><p>- Windows couldn&#39;t use their user profile because it was corrupted</p><p>- So it created a temporary profile in &#34;C:\Users\TEMP&#34;. (This wasn&#39;t obvious to the user because Explorer hides the &#39;detail&#39; of the file path and simply shows the username)</p><p>- Unwittingly, when they moved the precious files to the &#34;correct&#34; place, they were putting them into a <i>temporary</i> profile.</p><p>- On shutdown, Windows promptly deleted the temporary profile, so &#34;C:\Users\TEMP&#34; got wiped along with all of the files.</p><p>I was frankly astonished that Windows would drop them into a temporary user profile without dire warnings about its transience. Anyway, now I have to try to recover not only the files, but the directory structures. I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s possible... :(</p></div></div></div>
