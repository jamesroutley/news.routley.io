																			<div><p>The European Commission has required Apple to make a series of additional changes under the Digital Markets Act:</p><p><strong>Communication and promotion of offers</strong></p><ul>
<li>Today, we’re introducing updated terms that let developers with apps in the European Union storefronts of the App Store communicate and promote offers for purchase of digital goods or services available at a destination of their choice. The destination can be a website, alternative app marketplace, or another app, and can be accessed outside the app or within the app via a web view or native experience.</li>
<li>App Store apps that communicate and promote offers for digital goods or services will be subject to new business terms for those transactions — an initial acquisition fee, store services fee, and for apps on the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement (EU) Addendum, the Core Technology Commission (CTC). The CTC reflects value Apple provides developers through ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users.</li>
<li>Music streaming apps on the App Store in the European Economic Area (EEA) wanting to use the Music Streaming Services Entitlement (EEA) can use these options.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Update to Business Terms for Apps in the European Union</strong></p><ul>
<li>By January 1, 2026, Apple plans to move to a single business model in the EU for all developers. Under this single business model, Apple will transition from the Core Technology Fee (CTF) to the CTC on digital goods or services. The CTC will apply to digital goods or services sold by apps distributed from the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative marketplaces.</li>
<li>Apps currently under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU continue to be subject only to the CTF until the transition to the CTC is fully implemented next year. At that time, qualifying transactions will be subject to the CTC, and the CTF will no longer apply. Additional details regarding this transition will be provided at a later date.</li>
</ul><p><strong>User Experience Update</strong></p><ul>
<li>Beginning with iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6, iOS and iPadOS will provide an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alt-distribution-ux-in-the-eu/">updated user experience</a> in the EU for installing alternative marketplaces or apps from a developer’s website. Additionally, later this year, we will provide an API which will allow developers to initiate the download of alternatively distributed apps they publish from within their app.</li>
</ul><p>To learn more, view <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/communication-and-promotion-of-offers-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/">Communication and promotion of offers on the App Store in the EU</a>.
