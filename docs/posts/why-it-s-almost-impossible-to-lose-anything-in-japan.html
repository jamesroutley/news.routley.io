<p>Unlike other countries, if you lose your wallet or phone in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan</a>, you are very likely to get it back…and quickly. Their lost and found service owes its success to efficiency, a <a href="https://www.japan.go.jp/tomodachi/2016/spring2016/sharing_police_model.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community-based</a> police force, and most especially, Japan’s strong culture of morality.</p>
<p>In 2019, $35M in cash was lost in Japan, and of that, a whopping $24.9M was returned! Common lost items, including phones, usually find their owners the same day. In Japan, citizens are required to take lost property to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koban </a>(police station). From there, it is either returned or stored at the <a href="https://tokyocheapo.com/locations/central-tokyo/idabashi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo hub</a> until claimed. Unclaimed property is auctioned off by the city.</p>
<p>Japan’s high rate of lost item return is due mainly to the culture of the Japanese, and what they refer to as the ‘<a href="https://ludwig.guru/s/in+the+eyes+of+society" target="_blank" rel="noopener">societal eye</a>.’ Young children are taught not to keep things that don’t belong to them, with parents often accompanying them to the police station as a learning opportunity. A strong sense of individual honor and fear of public shame keeps the system, and the country, thriving.</p>
