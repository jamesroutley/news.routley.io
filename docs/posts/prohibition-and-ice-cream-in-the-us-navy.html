<p>The US Navy had ended the rum ration in 1862 and imposed progressively more stringent restrictions on what alcohol sailors could have on shipboard. General Order 99 ended even the serving of alcohol in the wardroom and the captain’s cabin. An updated repost.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibition and Ice Cream</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-62565"></span>Prohibition also had a surprising and unexpected result — the growth in the popularity of ice cream. During Prohibition, many American breweries, including Yuengling and Anheuser-Busch, switched from brewing beer to making soda and ice cream. Ice cream parlors became popular places to socialize for both young and old. By the end of the decade, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/ice-cream-military/535980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans were consuming more than a million gallons of ice cream per day</a>—and, crucially, associating it with the comfort and diversion formerly assigned to alcohol. </p>
<p><strong>World War II and the Navy’s Ice Cream Barge</strong></p>
<p>Ice cream was important for morale. In 1942, the U.S.S. Lexington was slowly sinking from a Japanese torpedo attack, before the crew abandoned ship, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/ice-cream-military/535980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they broke into the freezer and ate all the ice cream</a>. Survivors <a href="http://kfor.com/2013/11/11/great-state-wwii-veteran-recalls-strange-incident-during-coral-sea-battle/" data-omni-click="r&#39;article&#39;,r&#39;&#39;,d,r&#39;intext&#39;,r&#39;2&#39;,r&#39;None&#39;">describe</a> scooping ice cream into their helmets and licking them clean before lowering themselves into the Pacific. </p>
<p><strong>Ice Cream as a Reward</strong></p>
<p>Ice cream became a reward for meritorious service. Specifically, on carriers, a reward system was set up for every pilot rescued by destroyers, escorts, submarines, or any other craft that brought a downed pilot back to the ship. During World War II; ten, twenty, or even thirty gallons of ice cream might be the payoff for a rescued pilot.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.wearethemighty.com/history/navy-tradition-ice-cream-pilots?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Kocurko spent World War II</a> in the Navy and found out about the ice cream tradition while serving on a destroyer escort. “We’d get 10 gallons of ice cream every time we picked up a pilot, which was a real treat. So we started joking, ‘Let’s shoot one down.”‘</p>
<p>Sometimes ice cream may be better than even a tot of rum.</p>
