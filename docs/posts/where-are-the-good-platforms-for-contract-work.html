    <h1>Ask HN: Where are the good platforms for contract work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I&#39;ve been looking for contract work for the past couple months, and it&#39;s been dire. All the job boards are looking for full time employees, and on Hacker News the only recommendation is Toptal.<p>Is there really no other platform for decently paid contract work that&#39;s not a complete race to the bottom? I find I&#39;m close to having to abandon 10 years of consulting because I have no idea where to find anything else than full-time employment.</p><p>The other two job boards I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on are mostly about React and other frontend roles, with offers few and far between. Linkedin is similarly dire for contract work.</p><p>Is Toptal the only option for someone with 16 years experience that wouldn&#39;t want to work for peanuts? Or just going back to being an employee?</p><p>(In case anyone&#39;s reading that&#39;s looking for a senior Elixir/Rust/Go engineer/sysadmin, resume&#39;s in my profile. I&#39;m based in London.)</p><p>EDIT: excellent responses so far, thanks. I like how many are suggesting going through recruiters, while the common motif on other similar posts is to avoid LinkedIn. I&#39;ve started cleaning up my Linkedin profile this week, and I already have a dozen recruiters setting up appointments with me. I will try and explicitly request contract jobs with them.</p></div></div>
