    <h1>A Summer Of Growth</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Many of you know that I have applied for a spot at <a href="https://recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a> this summer. For those of you who don&#39;t, let me give you a brief outline of what it is: it&#39;s a retreat for programmers, meaning that you spend a certain, predefined amount of time there (usually six or twelve weeks) to work on something that interests you, possibly with other people. I of course want to take this opportunity to make zepto a better language.</p>
<p>Well, after two interviews and writing a little interpreter for them, I was admitted. Yay me! That means I will be in New York for twelve weeks and miss all of you a great deal. It also means that I currently feel like dancing through this grey January-in-Berlin-morning. I am excited.</p>
