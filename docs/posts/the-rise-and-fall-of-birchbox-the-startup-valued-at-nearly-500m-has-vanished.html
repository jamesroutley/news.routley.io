                        <p>In 2014, Birchbox was considered a pioneer of the subscription box industry, boasting hundreds of thousands of subscribers and a $485 million valuation. </p><p>But late in 2021, the brand was acquired for $45 million, a fraction of its former valuation, following layoffs and a dwindling customer base.</p><p>Now, Birchbox seems to have all but disappeared, leaving frustrated vendors and customers in its wake who say the company owes them money. Neither Birchbox nor its parent company, FemTec Health, immediately responded to Insider&#39;s request for comment. </p><p>Here&#39;s how a once-hot startup got its start, defined a category, then seemingly &#34;vanished.&#34;</p>

But instead of movies, Birchbox customers would receive designer beauty products, many of them in miniature size, from the likes of Nars and Kiehl&#39;s for $10 per month. </p><p>&#34;We were inspired by other companies doing similar things — <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/netflix" rel="" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="80" data-uri="2543e10113024f42b078ddd51f61e56c">Netflix</a> and Zappos,&#34; Beauchamp <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/birchbox-katia-beauchamp-harvard-2011-8" rel="nofollow sponsored" data-analytics-module="body_link">told Insider in 2011</a>. &#34;Our goal was to change the way that consumers shop online.&#34; </p><p>Beauchamp and Barna secured $1.4 million in seed funding prior to launch, and by 2011, had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/makeup-at-your-doorstep-startup-birchbox-closes-a-105-million-round-2011-8" rel="nofollow sponsored" data-analytics-module="body_link">raised another $10.5 million in Series A funding</a> from the likes of Accel Partners and First Round Capital. By then, 45,000 customers had signed on for monthly beauty boxes and the company had begun expanding to other categories, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/birchbox-for-men-coming-in-time-for-the-holidays-2011-10" rel="nofollow sponsored" data-analytics-module="body_link">like men&#39;s grooming</a>.</p>

                        </figure><p>While Birchbox was an innovator in the world of monthly subscription boxes, by the mid-2010s you could subscribe to regular deliveries of anything from razors to lingerie to dog food.</p><p>But the startup had also spawned imitators in the beauty industry, which meant that Birchbox was losing market share. In 2016, The Wall Street Journal counted <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/birchbox-retrenches-amid-rapid-rise-in-competition-cash-squeeze-1465983002" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module="body_link">at least 300 subscription beauty services</a> and noted that rival service Ipsy was beating Birchbox in terms of subscribers: Ipsy had over 1.5 million, while Birchbox had just over 1 million. </p><p>And while Birchbox offered customers the option to buy full-size products after they&#39;d tried the mini version, it didn&#39;t result just in more sales for Birchbox — the company was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-10/beauty-startup-birchbox-is-boosting-the-sales-of-competitors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module="body_link">bolstering sales at traditional retailers too</a>. Bloomberg reported Sephora and Ulta were getting a 5% and 6% sales boost, respectively, from Birchbox subscribers. Meanwhile, Sephora had launched a monthly beauty box of its own. </p>
                        
                        <p>Barna, the cofounder and co-CEO, announced in 2016 she was <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/02/16/birchbox-co-founder-hayley-barna-joins-first-round-capital/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-module="body_link">leaving the company</a> to join venture capital firm and Birchbox investor First Round Capital. That same year, Birchbox started scaling back its growth plans, pausing on new physical store openings, suspending plans to expand in China, shrinking its New York City headquarters space, and cutting about 50 of its 300 employees, The Journal reported at the time. </p><h2>After funding struggles and layoffs, Birchbox was acquired</h2><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image">
