    <h1>OpenBSD Based Challenge Day 3</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>by Root BSD</p>

<p>Today I learned some cool new things about tmux(1),xterm(1), and installed the source tree via cvs(1).</p>

<p>Day 3 into the challenge and I&#39;m getting some cool refreshers about using xterm(1) and tmux(1). Turns out my problem with tmux is because the -2 flag needs to be set for 256 color mode in the terminal (my main terminal sakura doesn&#39;t require this). I was unsuccessful in getting 256 color-mode set in ~/.tmux.conf. So I set this in my ~/.cwmrc</p>

<p><code>xterm -e tmux -2</code></p>

<p>Simple enough! The tmux(1) man page was pretty lengthy, so I made heavy use of the / command to find right keywords to get me going. Setting colors for the window statuses is done like this,</p>

<p><code>setw -g window-status-current-style &#39;fg=colour0 bg=colour36 bold&#39;</code>
<code>setw -g window-status-current-format &#39; #I#[fg=colour0]:#[fg=colour0]#W#[fg=colour0]#F &#39;</code></p>

<p><code>setw -g window-status-style &#39;fg=colour49 bg=colour233&#39;</code>
<code>setw -g window-status-format &#39; #I#[fg=colour192]:#[fg=colour193]#W#fg=colour194]#F &#39;</code></p>

<p>window-status-current is the active tab, window-status-format is the inactive tab. The clock on the right hand side is set like this,</p>

<p><code>set -g status-right &#39;#[fg=colour233,bg=colour42] %m/%d #[fg=colour233,bg=colour42] %I:%M:%S &#39;</code></p>

<p>There is also a clock-mode-style option to set 12 or 24 hour formats.</p>

<p>Control of tmux(1) is pretty straightforward. CTRL-b is the prefix key. C-b “ will split the window horizontally, C-b % will split the window vertically. C-b c will open a new window in a tabbed arrangement, windows are numbered beginning with 0. C-b arrow key will move you to your desired frame. C-b C-arrows resize panes, C-b ! will break your current frame from the panes into it&#39;s own tab, etc. The tmux(1) manpage has a detailed list of all the keybindings. They can be configured in the ~/.tmux.conf</p>

<p>Another cool feature I discovered is attach/detach client feature. C-b d will “detach” the client, basically suspending all your work to disk. Then resume with <code>tmux attach</code>, really neat stuff. I feel like I&#39;m only scratching the surface of what I can do with tmux. I normally just use it because I&#39;m a tabbed window manager kind of guy and I don&#39;t want 20 terminals open, rather one terminal open with tmux doing the heavy lifting for me.</p>

<p>Another really cool thing I learned is how to resize the internal border (space between text and window border) in xterm(1), it can be done with the -b flag
or in the ~/.Xdefaults(or .Xresources)</p>

<p><code>xterm*internalBorder: 8</code></p>

<p>If only xterm(1) did better with transparency, I may switch to it on my production machine. Normally I use the sakura terminal.</p>

<p>I also went ahead and installed the entire OpenBSD source tree via anoncvs. Instructions are listed in the anoncvs section on OpenBSD&#39;s main website. The key thing is to setup your src ports and xenocara folders to belong to the wsrc group. However I was still not getting write permissions so I just set my user as the folder&#39;s owner. Don&#39;t know if this is cheating or not, but they advised not to do too much as root.</p>

<p><code>chown user src ports xenocara</code></p>

<p>Well that&#39;s enough for today. I also found a neat way to read gopher sites through links fb via floodgap.com&#39;s gopher proxy lite.</p>

<p><a href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?=gopher.floodgap.com+70+312f6e6577">http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?=gopher.floodgap.com+70+312f6e6577</a></p>

<p>Gopher is an alternative web protocol and gopher sites are called &#39;gopher holes&#39;. A lot of interesting reads can be found in gopher holes. I also found a gemini portal for the gemini protocal, but many of the listed sites didn&#39;t work. I&#39;ll look more into that.</p>

<p>All in all using OpenBSD this way is opening my mind to a based kind of simplicity in OpenBSD that I knew was there, but never really forced myself to learn it. I realize now just how bloated my normal way of using the machine is. Now I understand that the software in ports is there for us to use and enjoy, however base tools, command line tools do take it to a calmer level of computer interaction. I expect this month to really change the way I use an OpenBSD system going forward. Anyways, happy hacking in OpenBSD!</p>

<p>Also, please forgive me but I installed scrot. No more photos of the LCD screen with my phone, that just didn&#39;t feel right.</p>
