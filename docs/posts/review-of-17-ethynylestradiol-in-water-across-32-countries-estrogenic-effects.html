      17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a synthetic estrogen with very strong estrogenic potency. Due to its wide usage in human and livestock as well as its high recalcitration to biodegradation, it was ubiquitous in different environment. This review summarized EE2 concentration levels in surface waters among 32 countries across seven continents. EE2 concentrations varied greatly in different surface waters, which ranged from not detected to 17,112 ng/L. The top 10 countries ranked in the order of high to low average EE2 concentration in surface water, were Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Laos, Brazil, Argentina, Kuwait, Thailand, Indonesia and Portugal, with the respective mean concentrations of 27.7, 22.1, 21.5, 21.1, 13.6, 9.6, 9.5, 8.8, 7.6 and 6.6 ng/L. Generally speaking, the EE2 concentration levels in surface waters in developing countries were much higher than those in developed countries. EE2 in effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was the dominant source to most countries, which suggested that improving the EE2 removal performance of municipal WWTP is the key to mitigate EE2 contamination to surface water body. Livestock, hospital, pharmacy factory and aquaculture wastewaters were also the important sources, but further work should be performed to elucidate their contribution. Evaluation based on estrogenic effects, the EE2-derived estrogen equivalence in surface waters ranged from 0 to 33 ng E2/L, among which about 65% of surface waters among 32 countries were at risk or high risk, indicating global serious EE2 contamination. MAIN FINDING: EE2 concentration in surface waters across 32 countries were summarized, along which its potential estrogenic effects were evaluated.
