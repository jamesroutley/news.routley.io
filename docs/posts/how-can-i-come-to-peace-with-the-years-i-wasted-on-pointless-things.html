    <h1>Ask HN: How can I come to peace with the years I wasted on pointless things?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I started listening the five hours (!) interview of John Carmack on Lex fridman&#39;s podcast, and he was talking about, among other things, about the fact that he&#39;s coding since he was a kid and spent hours upon hours in front of a screen and keyboard writing code. I find Carmack&#39;s, Romero&#39;s and the Id software folks work very fascinating and at some point i would like to dive more in depth on the history of their work and analyze their code to learn hopefully new things.<p>But that interview also strucked something that i&#39;m battling with myself. I&#39;m 23 and I spent my entire childhood wasting my time on Social media, World Of Warcraft, and other pointless stuff. Literally 10-14 hours a day. I don&#39;t regret my gaming interests, but i do regret the fact that i wasted so much of my life on games like World of Warcraft (I started playing when i was 10 years old) instead of finding and developing my future interests and «passions». I&#39;ve always knew i wanted to study Computer Science but due to my life circumstances(mental health problems, serious financial hardships, etc.)  i sacrificed a lot to get into university which i did and i hope i can finish it.</p><p>Over the last couple years i started thinking, how would my life be if i spent that time coding/reverse engineering/learning the internals of OS, reading books, or generally developing my interests instead of playing wow and mindlessly scrolling on SM? Would i still be in the same position in my life, the same person, as i am now? Honestly i can only guess but i don&#39;t know how to handle that i lost so much viable time. Time which could had invested on my future and develop my skills as a computer scientist.</p></td></div></div>
