He had a brief Hollywood career that included a role in the 2008 rom-com “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” but he has lately pivoted to making online videos, running wellness events and touring comedy shows.</p><p>While Mr. Brand’s earlier stand-up routines had a broadly left-wing focus, skewering the British establishment and examining subjects like social inequality, he has recently shifted to content more aligned with conservative talking points, often seeming to target an American audience. On YouTube, recent videos have included Mr. Brand discussing his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbGrMJgFpbI&amp;ab_channel=RussellBrand" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">skepticism toward Covid-19 vaccines</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu99k7f5y-g&amp;t=921s&amp;ab_channel=RussellBrand" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dissecting his own appearances on Fox News</a>.</p><p>Mr. Brand also hosts a show on Rumble, a social media network associated with conservative voices, but he did not appear for a scheduled broadcast on Monday.</p></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>
