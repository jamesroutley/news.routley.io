The model, which Meta said requires &#34;far less&#34; computing power, is trained on 20 languages with a focus on those with Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.</p><div data-testid="Latest Updates" data-variant-id="article-latest-updates"><div><h3 data-testid="Heading">Latest Updates</h3><p data-testid="Body">View 2 more stories<!-- --> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11 7" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10.413.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0L5.5 4.474 1.613.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0 .709.709 0 0 0 0 1.027l4.4 4.4c.147.147.367.22.513.22a.79.79 0 0 0 .513-.22l4.4-4.4a.71.71 0 0 0 0-1.027h.001Z"></path></svg></p></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;Meta&#39;s announcement today appears to be a step in testing their generative AI capabilities so they can implement them into their products in the future,&#34; said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A.

Microsoft Corp <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O" target="_blank">(MSFT.O)</a>, Baidu and Alphabet&#39;s Google, meanwhile, are incorporating their respective advanced AI language engines into more mass products like search.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Meta in May last year released large language model OPT-175B, also aimed at researchers, which formed the basis of a new iteration of its chatbot BlenderBot.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">It later launched a model called Galactica, which it said could write scientific articles and solve math problems, but its demo was later pulled down because it repeatedly generated authoritative-sounding content.</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Eva Mathews in Bengaluru and Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
