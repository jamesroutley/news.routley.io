    <h2 id="post-title"> First Steps with OCaml </h2>

    <article>
      <p>After years of hemming and hawing, I have decided to learn OCaml. This post is a quick summary of two things: how I landed on OCaml and what my very first steps have been. The former topic is going to be a vibes-first explanation of my past experience and why I chose OCaml. The latter section is going to be a relatively straightforward account of how I&#39;ve set up my environment so I can learn OCaml in a way that feels familiar to me.</p>
<h2>how I settled on OCaml</h2>
<p>The &#34;why a new language&#34; part: I like learning new programming languages, and I&#39;ve wanted to dive into ML languages for years. My only exposure to this group of languages has been a few school assignments and the first two or three chapters of many programming books. The takeaways from these experiences have been understanding basic syntax and configuring my text editor. There&#39;s a level of growth that I think just doesn&#39;t come without day-to-day experience, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m after.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent years going over the introductory material for Idris, Haskell, and OCaml. Each language has its own specific appeal: I want to write Idris and use dependent types; I want to write Haskell to make up for the Ph.D. I never pursued; I want to write OCaml because there are good reasons I never pursued that Ph.D. I had to use Standard ML for a class once, but as a Philadelphian from the Pennsylvania side I must reject New Jersey.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I picked OCaml. If there is any one thing that swayed me to this, it&#39;s a line from the end of this <a href="https://borretti.me/article/two-years-ocaml">post about OCaml</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Particularly if you what you want is “garbage collected Rust that’s not Go”, OCaml is a good choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like Rust, I don&#39;t really like Go. I like Python, and I&#39;m kind of hoping OCaml will feel to me like typed, compiled Python.</p>
<h2>my actual first steps with the language and its tooling</h2>
<p>Eventually, I&#39;ll use OCaml for a project I would normally use Python for: parsing CSVs and printing some summary statistics about the data therein. This is a &#34;first steps&#34; post though. If using <code>utop</code> to get some experience with syntax is crawling, my project is probably closer to walking. I&#39;m just trying to stand on my own right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/index.html">Real World OCaml</a>, the seemingly-standard guide for new OCaml programmers, has been extremely helpful, though I&#39;ve found it a better fit as a reference rather than a book through which one works linearly. Similarly, this <a href="https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html">Cornell class</a> seems to be a pretty standard introduction to the language. It seems to cover similar ground as Real World OCaml, but it&#39;s always nice to have things worded and presented a little differently.</p>
<p>I like looking to <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/ocaml">Exercism</a> for practical examples, and this time was no exception. Exercism gave me enough of an example of <a href="https://ocaml.org/p/ounit2/latest"><code>OUnit</code></a> to let me write some tests. <code>dune</code>, a (the?) build system for OCaml, seems to fill the role that <code>cargo</code> has in Rust. With dune&#39;s command to set up a new project and Exercism&#39;s tests as an example, I started working on the <a href="https://ocaml.org/problems">exercises</a> referenced on the OCaml homepage. With these resources, I&#39;ve been able to get into the write-compile-run (or just write-test) loop with which I&#39;m familiar.</p>
<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>That&#39;s it. I still can&#39;t take more than a few steps at a time before stumbling, but I can get to walking from here.</p>
