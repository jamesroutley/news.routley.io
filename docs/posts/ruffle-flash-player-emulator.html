			<div>

				</p>
				<div>
					<p>
						Ruffle is a Flash Player emulator written in Rust. Ruffle runs natively on all modern operating
						systems as a standalone application, and on all modern browsers through the use of WebAssembly.
						Leveraging the safety of the modern browser sandbox and the memory safety guarantees of Rust,
						we can confidently avoid all the security pitfalls that Flash had a reputation for.
						Ruffle puts Flash back on the web, where it belongs - including browsers on iOS and Android!
					</p>
					<p>
						Designed to be easy to use and install, users or website owners may install the web version
						of Ruffle and existing flash content will &#34;just work&#34;, with no extra configuration required.
						Ruffle will detect all existing Flash content on a website and automatically &#34;polyfill&#34;
						it into a Ruffle player, allowing seamless and transparent upgrading of websites that still
						rely on Flash content.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ruffle is an entirely open source project maintained by volunteers. We&#39;re all passionate
						about the preservation of internet history, and we were drawn to working on this project to help
						preserve the many websites and plethora of content that will no longer be accessible when
						users can no longer run the official Flash Player. If you would like to help support this
						project, we welcome all contributions of any kind - even if it&#39;s just playing some old games
						and seeing how well they run.

			<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
			<div>
				<p><img src="https://ruffle.rs/assets/undraw_design_components.svg" alt="Usage"/>
				</p>
				<div>
					<h3>Installing on a website you own</h3>
					<p>
						Use an official Ruffle CDN, or download the &#39;standalone&#39; version of Ruffle from <a href="#downloads">our downloads</a>,
						and include the following JavaScript on any page with Flash content:
						
						
						</p><pre>&lt;script src=&#34;https://unpkg.com/@ruffle-rs/ruffle&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
						<p><b><i>OR</i></b></p>
						<pre>&lt;script src=&#34;path/to/ruffle/ruffle.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
					
					<p>
						If you&#39;re using a local installation, you&#39;ll need to make sure your web server is configured to serve <code>.wasm</code> files
						correctly, so please visit
						<a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle#configure-wasm-mime-type" target="_blank">our wiki</a>
						if you need help with that.
					</p>
					<p>
						For advanced usage, consult
						<a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle#javascript-api" target="_blank">our documentation</a>
						for our JavaScript API and installation options.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Installing the browser extension</h3>
					<p>
						If you visit websites that have Flash content but aren&#39;t using Ruffle, or you want to ensure
						you&#39;re using the latest and greatest version of Ruffle on every website, then our browser
						extension is the perfect thing for you!
					</p>
					<p>
						The easiest way to install Ruffle on Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Opera, and Brave is through the
						<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ruffle/donbcfbmhbcapadipfkeojnmajbakjdc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chrome Web Store</a>.
						The easiest way to install Ruffle on Firefox is through <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ruffle_rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">addons.mozilla.org</a>.
						Ruffle is also available on the <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ruffle/pipjjbgofgieknlpefmcckdmgaaegban" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Edge Addons</a> store if you prefer.
					</p>

					</p>
					<p>
						These update whenever new
						builds release. We also offer unsigned nightly extensions, but most people won&#39;t need them. If you do, download the appropriate one for your
						browser from <a href="#downloads">our downloads</a>, and then install it manually. Instructions for installation of nightly Chrome/Firefox
						extensions available on <a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Using-Ruffle#browser-extension" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
						our wiki</a>. Safari instructions below.
					</p>
					<div>
						<div>
						<h4>Safari</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>Click the &#34;Safari&#34; link.</li>
						<li>Extract the downloaded tar.gz file somewhere.</li>
						<li>Open the extracted file and confirm the popup dialog box.</li>
						<li>Enable <code>Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Show Develop menu in menu bar</code>.</li>
						<li>Enable <code>Develop &gt; Allow Unsigned Extensions</code>.</li>
						<li>Enable the extension by checking the box in <code>Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Extensions</code>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Note: Safari 14+ is required</p>
					</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Using the desktop application</h3>
					<p>
						If you want to run Flash content on your computer without a browser in-between, we have native
						applications that will take full advantage of your GPU and system resources to get those extra
						frames when playing the original Meat Boy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently most options are accessed via the command line, but we intend to develop a GUI soon
						for ease of use. First, download the appropriate executable for your operating system from
						<a href="#downloads">our downloads</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use Ruffle, simply double-click the executable and select the SWF file you wish to play.
						Alternatively, type a command such as 
						<code>ruffle filename.swf</code> or <code>ruffle https://example.com/filename.swf</code>.
						We also provide more advanced options if you wish to control how this file is played.
						To view the full options available, run
						<code>ruffle --help</code>.

					<h3>ActionScript</h3>
					<p>
						ActionScript is the language which Flash uses to make interactive content.
						It is primarily split into two groups:
						&#34;AVM 1&#34; (ActionScript 1 &amp; 2)
						and
						&#34;AVM 2&#34; (ActionScript 3).
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<h4>AVM 1</h4>
					<p>
						AVM 1 is ActionScript 1 and ActionScript 2.
						All movies made before Flash Player 9 (June 2006) will be made with AVM 1,
						and it remained supported &amp; available to authors until the release of
						Flash Professional CC (2013).
					</p>

					<p>
						We believe that most AVM 1 content will work, but we are aware of some graphical inaccuracies
						and smaller bugs here and there. Please feel free to report any issues you find that are not
						present in the original Flash Player!
					</p>

					<p>
						For in-depth details, please follow our
						<a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues/310" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AVM 1 tracking issue on GitHub</a>.
					</p>
					<h5>ActionScript 1 &amp; 2 Language <code>95%</code></h5>
					
					

					<h5>ActionScript 1 &amp; 2 API <code>75%</code></h5>
					
					
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>AVM 2</h4>
					<p>
						AVM2 is ActionScript 3, which was introduced with Flash Player 9 (June 2006).
						After the release of Flash Professional CC (2013), authors are required to use
						ActionScript 3 - making any movie made after that date very likely to fall under
						this category.
					</p>

					<p>
						Ruffle now has decent support for AVM 2, and it&#39;s our experience that most games will work
						well enough to be played. We&#39;re still rapidly improving in this area though, so bug reports
						about any broken content are always welcome!
					</p>

					<p>
						For in-depth details, please see our
						<a href="https://ruffle.rs/avm2.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">page outlining full AVM2 implementation details</a>.
					</p>

					<h5>ActionScript 3 Language <code>70%</code></h5>
					
					

					<h5>ActionScript 3 API <code>66%</code></h5>

					<h3>♥️ How to help the project</h3>
					<p>
						We are an entirely open source project and do this for the sake of preserving history,
						and we are not a large team at that.
						We absolutely welcome and request your help if you are willing to provide it.
						There are 4 main ways to help this project, and we will be extremely grateful for any help provided.
					</p>

				</div>
				
			</div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<h3>🕹️ Testing content</h3>
					<p>
						Arguably more important than contributing code is testing Ruffle out.
						Go install Ruffle and try out your favourite games and animations.
						Look for any difference from the official Flash Player, and report your findings to us.
						If you find any bugs, changes of behaviour, performance issues or any visual differences then
						please report those to
						<a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues" target="_blank">our bug tracker</a>.
						If it runs flawlessly, come
						<a href="https://discord.gg/ruffle" target="_blank">share the good news on our Discord</a>!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>💲 Sponsor the project</h3>
					<p>
						If you are able and willing to, we welcome any financial support to help us fund the project
						going
						forward. With your help, we can afford to spend more time dedicated to Ruffle, and pay for
						expenses
						such as build servers and hosting.
						We accept donations and sponsorships through Open Source Collective 501(c)(6). For more
						information,
						or to view the options available for sponsoring the project, please visit
						<a href="https://opencollective.com/ruffle" target="_blank">our Open Collective page</a>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>💬 Spread the word!</h3>
					<p>
						Is your favourite Flash-based site shutting down? Let them know they can add one JavaScript
						file
						and keep it running!
						Feeling nostalgic for some old Flash games? Go play some on Newgrounds with Ruffle
						installed, and
						tell your friends about it!
						Maybe you&#39;re a streamer and looking for some silly content? There&#39;s literally decades&#39; worth,
						now
						unlocked and accessible once more.
