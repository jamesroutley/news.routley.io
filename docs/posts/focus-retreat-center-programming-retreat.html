  <p>We over at my new project Focus Retreat Center have announced the dates for our inaugural <a href="https://focusretreatcenter.com/2022/programming/">Programming Retreat</a>. We are so excited for this event! We have interesting applications rolling in and have already awarded several Residencies.</p>
<p>If you are at all curious, please get in touch with us at <strong>team@focusretreatcenter.com</strong> or <a href="https://focusretreatcenter.com/contact">our contact form here</a>. We are happy to answer any questions you may have about what a retreat experience is like. If you have a friend who might be a good fit, you can nominate them for a Residency as well.</p>
