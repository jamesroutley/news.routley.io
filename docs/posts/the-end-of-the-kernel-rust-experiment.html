The topic of the Rust experiment was just discussed at the annual
Maintainers Summit.  The consensus among the assembled developers is that
Rust in the kernel is no longer experimental — it is now a core part of the
kernel and is here to stay.  So the &#34;experimental&#34; tag will be coming off.
Congratulations are in order for all of the Rust for Linux team.
