    <h1>Plausible Analytics: GDPR Compliance w/o Cookie Consent Banner</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div> <div> <h2>It&#39;s time to ditch Google Analytics</h2> <p> Google Analytics is frustrating to use, difficult to understand, slow to load and privacy-invasive. That&#39;s why we built Plausible Analytics, a simple but powerful, lightweight (&lt; 1 KB), open source and privacy-friendly alternative. </p> <p> Here&#39;s what makes Plausible a great <a href="https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics">Google Analytics alternative</a> and why over 12,000 paying subscribers trust us with their website and business insights: </p> <h3>Simple analytics at a glance</h3> <p> Plausible is <a href="https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics">simple analytics</a>.
