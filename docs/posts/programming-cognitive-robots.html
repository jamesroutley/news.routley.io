<h2>Programming Cognitive Robots</h2>

<p> A cognitive robot is one that uses explicitly represented knowledge to
make decisions about what to do.  Programming a cognitive robot is about
giving it enough knowledge about its world, its actions, and what needs to be
done for it to be able to calculate in a practical way the actions it should
take.  This book presents a new programming language for this purpose, and
illustrates its use on a number of examples.  It then follows with three case
studies that can form the basis for term projects in cognitive robotics: one
in a simulated world of squirrels, one for a LEGO robot, and one in a
real-time video game environment.  While the book is intended primarily for
undergraduate computer science students, it also includes three chapters on
more advanced topics in cognitive robotics.

</p><p> More details about the intent and scope can be found
in the book Preface.

</p><p> The book and all the necessary software described in it can be downloaded
below, though without support or warranty of any kind.  (See the copyright
notice with the software.)  A LEGO kit must be purchased separately for the
LEGO project.

<li> <b>The book</b>:  
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hector/pcr.pdf"> Programming Cognitive Robots</a>, as a PDF file (203 pages).

</li><li><p> <b>The software and documentation</b>: 
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hector/ergo-archive.zip"> ergo-archive</a>, as a ZIP file (182119
bytes).</p></li></ul>

<p> There is currently no plan to have this book printed by a publisher.  (The
market for such a product would indeed be small.)  So please consider the PDF
file here as the definitive version.  On the negative side, the book has not
been copy-edited or typeset by a professional, has never been used in an
actual course, and has no answers for the exercises; on the positive side, all
the material is free!

</p><p> Best of luck!
