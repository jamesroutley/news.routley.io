          Hello. You’ve reached the end of the webpage and there is nothing beyond this point.
          Except for these words, of course. We (the good folks at
          <a href="https://goodenough.us/" target="_blank">Good Enough LLC</a>)
          hope you have a pleasant day.
          And if you’d like to continue this conversation you can maybe
          <a href="https://letterbird.co/goodenough" target="_blank">write us an email</a>.
