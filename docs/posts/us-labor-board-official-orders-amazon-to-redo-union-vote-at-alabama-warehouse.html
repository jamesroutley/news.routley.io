In August, an NLRB hearing officer said the company&#39;s conduct around the previous vote had interfered with the election.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">The decision for a redo adds pressure on Amazon, which has recently faced union campaigns in New York and Canada. Worker groups view organizing the company as a landmark goal that would invigorate the U.S. labor movement.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">“Today’s decision confirms what we were saying all along – that Amazon’s intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace,&#34; Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said in a statement.</p><div data-testid="gallery-0" domain="https://www.reuters.com" article_url="/business/amazon-alabama-facility-ordered-re-run-union-election-us-labor-board-2021-11-29/"><div><div><p>Banners are placed at the Amazon facility as members of a congressional delegation arrive to show their support for workers who will vote on whether to unionize, in Bessemer, Alabama, U.S. March 5, 2021.

The company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-takes-another-swipe-union-alabama-rematch-looms-2021-11-04" target="_blank">has forced thousands of employees</a> to attend meetings about unions and posted signs critical of unions in bathrooms.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">In Monday&#39;s decision, the NLRB regional director said that Amazon &#34;engaged in objectionable conduct that warrants setting aside the election.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">The decision pointed to moves by the company encouraging staff to vote via a mailbox it had the Postal Service install at its warehouse, surrounding the mailbox with its campaign slogan and locating it where workers may have thought Amazon was surveilling them.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The NLRB decision did not specify the second election&#39;s date or whether the vote will take place by mail or in person.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Julia Love and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco
