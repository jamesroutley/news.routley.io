<p><span data-contrast="none">Now we have the first evidence that our concerns have become reality.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address,” </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">404 Media reports today</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. “ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.”</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="0}">The tool – dubbed Enhanced Leads Identification &amp; Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) – receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services (which includes Medicaid) and other sources, 404 Media reports based on court testimony in Oregon by law enforcement agents, among other sources.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="0}">This revelation comes as ICE – which has gone on </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/ice-going-surveillance-shopping-spree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">a surveillance technology shopping spree</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> – floods Minneapolis with agents, violently running roughshod over the civil rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens alike; President Trump has </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/insurrection-act.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">threatened to use the Insurrection Act of 1807</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> to deploy military troops against protestors there. Other localities are preparing for the possibility of similar surges.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="0}">Different government agencies necessarily collect information to provide essential services or collect taxes, but the danger comes when the government begins pooling that data and using it for reasons unrelated to the purpose it was collected.</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="0}">This kind of consolidation of government records provides enormous government power that can be abused. Different government agencies necessarily collect information to provide essential services or collect taxes, but the danger comes when the government begins pooling that data and using it for reasons unrelated to the purpose it was collected.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn wrote in </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/23/opinion-trumps-plan-for-one-interface-to-rule-them-all-risks-our-privacy-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">a Mercury News op-ed last August</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, “While couched in the benign language of eliminating government ‘data silos,’ this plan runs roughshod over your privacy and security. It’s a throwback to the rightly mocked ‘Total Information Awareness’ plans of the early 2000s that were, at least publicly, stopped after massive outcry from the public and from key members of Congress. It’s time to cry out again.”</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="0}">In addition to the amicus brief we co-authored challenging ICE’s grab for Medicaid data, EFF has successfully </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/american-federation-government-employees-v-us-office-personnel-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">sued over DOGE agents grabbing personal data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, filed </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/trabajadores-v-bessent-amicus-brief" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">an amicus brief</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> in a suit challenging ICE’s grab for </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/irs-ice-immigrant-data-sharing-agreement-betrays-data-privacy-and-taxpayers-trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">taxpayer data</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/united-auto-workers-v-us-department-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-contrast="none">sued the departments of State and Homeland Security</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> to halt a mass surveillance program to monitor constitutionally protected speech by noncitizens lawfully present in the U.S.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="0}">But litigation isn’t enough. People need to keep raising concerns via public discourse and Congress should act immediately to put brakes on this runaway train that threatens to crush the privacy and security of each and every person in America. </span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
