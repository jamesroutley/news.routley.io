The company made $90.1 billion in total sales for the three months that ended in September and Iphone sales contributed $42.6 billion (47%) to this figure. September also marks the fiscal year end for Apple. For FY2022, the company sold a remarkable $205,4 billion of Iphones but at what cost? </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png" width="658" height="292.3942307692308" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:647,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:658,&#34;bytes&#34;:792987,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f0726b0-8ce2-4b35-bc46-6b76bcef015a_2048x910.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>“Let’s start charging for the chargers”</figcaption></figure></div><p>Something that I realized a long time ago is that I am terrible at using my hands. Any artisanship that requires some minimal amount of manual shaping/steering/handling is a no go for me. As I write these words, I look at the bluetooth keyboard I’m using to type these letters and say “holy technology, from the press on the key to the screen, what a magic“. It might be only me but even though mankind has successfully invented millions of widgets over thousands of years, the ones that never stop amazing me are always the chip-based ones. Ones and zeros, talk to each other and display a picture of Mr Cook next to a cool picture of me, please. What a time!</p><p>Due to the fatal flaw I mentioned above, I’ve always thought that the factories that build these tools/toys must be fascinating places that take materials, humans and magic in and push amazement out. Giant robotic arms moving around in a never-ending sync, working their magic, in harmony, producing our toys. My Alice in Wonderland image of a technology factory was until I saw the news on Foxconn Zhengzhou (1) and that was probably also the moment when I was sure that I would never look at a small rectangular box with a bitten Apple logo or any other mysterious work of magic with fascination again.  </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png" width="568" height="320.6703296703297" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:822,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:568,&#34;bytes&#34;:1690587,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b097d07-85cb-4868-9cb6-5f36bd5199f0_1580x892.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>The “magic” behind my precious toys</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>“Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves.”</p><p>Abraham Lincoln</p></div><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://gouldasks.substack.com/p/the-2054-billion-gulag?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}"><a href="https://gouldasks.substack.com/p/the-2054-billion-gulag?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Foxconn, or in its birth name Hon Hai Technology Group, is a multinational electronics contract manufacturer established in 1974 in Taiwan. In 2021, they made over $175 billion in revenues and as of today, they are the world’s largest technology manufacturer and service provider, China’s largest private employer and one of the largest employers worldwide with a total of 1.3 million workers taking paychecks back home every month. Foxconn produces electronic products for companies like Sony (Playstation 3 &amp; 4 consoles), Nokia, Google (Pixel), Microsoft (Xbox consoles), Nintendo and Apple (Iphones). Foxconn is Apple&#39;s biggest iPhone maker, producing 70% of iPhone shipments globally, which in turn makes up 45% of the Taiwanese firm&#39;s revenue according to analysts. (2)</p><p>This week,  social media and news outlets shared numerous footage of hundreds of workers protesting at Foxconn&#39;s flagship iPhone plant in China, with some men smashing surveillance cameras and windows. The reason for the protests was a plan to delay bonus payments, as shared by some demonstrators on livestream feeds. As a contamination measure, the Zhengzhou police force was involved and that left us with the images above, a policeman raising his baton to hurt one of the 1.3M. As serious as this news were reported, it still doesn’t change the fact that to the average circus attendee like myself a week ago, 1 in a 1.3M is just a ratio. It’s not a real thing. “It’s a wazi, it’s a woozi, a fugazi.” It’s not worse than not being able to upload the latest summer selfies due to a bug in iOS 16. And the worst part is; it will never be as long as the contractee with the cool CEO isn’t held accountable. </p><p>You are as clean as your supply chain. Remember that.
