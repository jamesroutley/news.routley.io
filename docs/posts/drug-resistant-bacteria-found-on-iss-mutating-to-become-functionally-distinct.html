<p>In a new scientific paper funded by an Ames Space Biology grant, Principal Investigator Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory strains of the bacterial species <em>Enterobacter bugandensis</em> isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were studied. Thirteen strains of <em>E. bugandensis, </em>a bacterium notorious for being multi-drug resistant, were isolated from the ISS. Study findings indicate under stress, the ISS isolated strains were mutated and became genetically and functionally distinct compared to their Earth counterparts. The strains were able to viably persist in the ISS over time with a significant abundance. <em>E. bugandensis </em>coexisted with multiple other microorganisms, and in some cases could have helped those organisms survive.  </p>
<p><strong>Publication Impact: </strong>Closed human-built environments, such as the ISS, are unique areas that provide an extreme environment subject to microgravity, radiation, and elevated carbon dioxide levels. Any microorganisms introduced to these areas must adapt to thrive. By delving into microbial dynamics in extreme environments, this research opens doors to effective preventative measure for astronaut health.</p>
