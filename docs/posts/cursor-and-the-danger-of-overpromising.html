    <h1>Cursor and the danger of overpromising</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>A couple weeks ago, I temporarily switched to using GPT-5 as my exclusive coding assistant model, via Cursor.
This was prompted by two developments:</p>
<p>First of all, I was curious to try GPT-5, which had
some buzz as a new contender the latest state of the art coding model.
But I haven&#39;t wanted to go through openAI&#39;s API license verification process,
because I <strong>really</strong> don&#39;t like an AI startup asking to see my driver&#39;s
license. Using it through my Cursor subscription seems to be an end-run around that, for now?</p>
<p>But that only explains the specific choice of model. If GPT-5 hadn&#39;t recently
been released I probably would have done the same with my daily go-to model
(Sonnet 4), or tried out Gemini some more, or whatever.</p>
<p>The urgency came from this: My $20 pro plan Cursor usage was about to reset, and I hadn&#39;t run out of monthly
credits yet.
And the Cursor user forums were exploding with people outraged that their
previous normal usage was suddenly hitting new limits.</p>
<p>So I really wanted to get some  clarity about exactly what &#34;at least $20 of included usage per month&#34; might currently mean to Cursor.</p>
<p>So: I took the opportunity to try to make some headway on some thorny parts of
a personal project.</p>

<p>First I pushed GPT-5 to clean up as much as it
could of some horrific mess that had accumulated in my frontend test suite,
then I threw some feature requests at it.</p>
<p>Anecdotally so far, GPT-5 seems quite good at adding features, following (and
helping me revise) plans; fixing bugs.  At least on par with
sonnet 4, my go-to for the past few months; I think it&#39;s making fewer mistakes and getting
stuck less often than anything else I&#39;ve tried. It is rather chatty though.</p>
<p>This was not a clean experiment though, as the very first thing I asked GPT-5
to do was streamline my Cursor rules, which had gotten very bulky and verbose.)</p>

<p>For anyone not aware of the kerfuffle around Cursor&#39;s recent subscription plan
 changes, here&#39;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/cursor-apologizes-for-unclear-pricing-changes-that-upset-users/" rel="nofollow">one of many articles</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR from my POV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cursor used to give you seemingly endless amounts of LLM usage
  for the $20/month &#34;pro&#34; flat rate , AND a discount for people
  who paid for a year up front;
 -Cursor recently made a series of confusing subscription plan changes that appear to walk
  that back;</li>
<li>Anecdotally, a lot of heavy &#34;Pro&#34; users suddenly started hitting their monthly quota within a few days
  of their monthly reset. And they were PISSED.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#39;s a screenshot from the user forum digest in my inbox circa August 20th 2025:</p>

</p>

<p>Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, was probably bleeding money at a
prodigious rate prior to the announced changes. I haven&#39;t followed the details
closely, but apparently they are the single largest user of Anthropic&#39;s models
as of now (summer 2025), and I&#39;ve read that 
<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/anthropic-is-bleeding-out/" rel="nofollow">Anthropic raised the prices they were charging
Anysphere</a>.</p>
<p>(Search for news with both Anthropic and
Anysphere and you&#39;ll find there&#39;s other wild stuff going on. I guess that&#39;s
inevitable when your biggest supplier becomes your biggest direct competitor
overnight.)</p>
<p>I would guess that both companies probably saw little choice but to change <em>something</em> to staunch
the bleeding.
I&#39;ve long heard commentary that there&#39;s an AI bubble built on unsustainable
pricing, losing billions to gain market share, etc. It&#39;s pretty clear that&#39;s
what is playing out here.</p>
<p>But regardless of necessity, it&#39;s clear that Anysphere fumbled the communication to their customers
badly, and are now finding out the hard way that when you change what people
think they have paid in advance for ... well, you can say whatever you like about
how you never actually promised unlimited usage, but you will <a href="https://mbird.com/theology/the-perils-of-bait-and-switch-or-why-do-wwii-veterans-still-hate-the-red-cross/" rel="nofollow">forever be seen
as the jerk who took away the free
doughnuts</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not much invested in how Anthropic vs Cursor plays out from a horse
race perspective, but as a user of these tools, I don&#39;t have unlimited funds to
throw at them, and I wanted a plan B in case it does turn out that
Cursor gets prohibitively expensive for me.</p>
<p>This <em>did</em> prompt me to start exploring <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/tag/ai-coding.html" rel="nofollow">other ai coding
tools</a> (Aider, Crush, Claude Code...), which is probably a
good thing for me regardless. I have drafts in progress about some of this
and need to get more posts live!</p>
<p>So. Anecdotally my $20 monthly fee bought about $60 worth of usage before my
last monthly reset, and I didn&#39;t hit any limits. Can I rely on that going
forward? I have no idea, and I&#39;m still using Cursor productively, but I&#39;m keeping an eye on the exits.</p>
