<p>In March 1974, Australian arachnologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_York_Main" title="Barbara York Main">Barbara York Main</a> began a long-term study of spider families. She marked off ten spiders and returned the following year to find new spiderlings, including Number 16, that had likely been born after the first autumn rain of 1974.<sup id="cite_ref-2018paper_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-2018paper-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[A]</a></sup> Main returned to the site annually, sometimes more frequently, for more than four decades. 
</p><p>Like other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_trapdoor_spider" title="Armored trapdoor spider">trapdoor spiders</a>, Number 16 spent her entire life in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrow" title="Burrow">burrow</a>, subsisting off the edible insects that walked on her burrow&#39;s trapdoor-like silk roof.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2018paper_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-2018paper-1">[1]</a></sup> As Number 16 became older, Main and her researchers developed a tradition of always checking her burrow first.<sup id="cite_ref-WP_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-WP-5">[4]</a></sup> For her 40th birthday, research assistant Leanda Mason wanted to give the spider a mealworm, but Main denied the request since it would interfere with the study.<sup id="cite_ref-WP_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-WP-5">[4]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Because of Number 16, Main&#39;s project took far longer than she had expected. She continued to work into her late 80s, but she &#34;began to look forward to the project&#39;s end,&#34; <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> reported.

<p>On 31 October 2016, researcher Leanda Mason discovered Number 16&#39;s burrow in disrepair. The spider was gone.
