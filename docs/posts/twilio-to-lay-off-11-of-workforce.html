He said the decision was &#34;extremely difficult,&#34; but also &#34;wise and necessary.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Twilio has grown at an astonishing rate over the past couple years. It was too fast, and without enough focus on our most important company priorities,&#34; Lawson said in the letter. &#34;I take responsibility for those decisions, as well as the difficult decision to do this layoff.&#34;</p><p>Lawson said the employees impacted are in areas of the company that can operate more efficiently and where customers can &#34;succeed without as much human intervention.&#34;</p><p>Twilio said it expects to incur between $70 million and $90 million in charges related to the restructuring plan.</p><p>Shares of Twilio closed up 10% on Wednesday.</p></div></div></div>
