<div><p><span>Eisenstein&#39;s last, epic and incomplete venture into movie-making was his attempted trilogy about the life of the </span>psychopathic  medieval Russian ruler known as Ivan the Terrible. Part one (1944) met with Stalin&#39;s warm approval, but the dictator was deeply offended by Part Two , with its depictions of a  demented ruler, secret police and conspiracies and dissension. It was never allowed to be screened until several years after Stalin&#39;s death. Eisenstein had filmed a few scenes for his intended third episode, but the project was halted, footage destroyed and  the director forced to apologise for his cultural and ideological misdeeds. He had to declare that his film was &#34;ideologically defective&#34; and that it did not  &#34;serve socialism&#34;, the Communist Party&#39;s declared object of all art forms. Within a few months Eisenstein was dead of a heart attack.</p></div>

<div><p><span>For decades most Western intellectuals with an interest in cinema (generally regarded by academics as an inferior art-form) praised the movies of Eisenstein as daring and  innovative , while rejecting the animated work of his near-contemporary Walt Disney as puerile, commercial and superficial. But the Russian director idolised the movies of Disney, whose style and technique can be seen especially clearly in Part Two of</span><em> Ivan the Terrible, </em><span>for which</span><em> Snow White and the Seven Dwarves </em><span>served as inspiration for some of its imagery.</span></p></div>
