    <h1>Making crochet cacti</h1>
    
    

<p>I noticed some tech bloggers I follow have been making <a href="https://www.aprilcools.club/">April Cools Day</a> posts about topics they don&rsquo;t normally write
about (like <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/decaf-is-good-actually/">decaf</a> or <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/microscopy/">microscopes</a>). The goal isn&rsquo;t to
trick anyone, just to write about something different for a day.</p>

<p>I thought those posts were fun so here is a post with some notes on learning to crochet tiny cacti.</p>

<h3 id="first-the-cacti">first, the cacti</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to do some non-computer hobbies, without putting a lot of
pressure on myself to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; at them. Here are some cacti I crocheted:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/cacti.png"></p>

<p>They are a little wonky and I like them.</p>

<h3 id="a-couple-of-other-critters">a couple of other critters</h3>

<p>Here are a couple of other things I made: an elephant, an orange guy, a
much earlier attempt at a cactus, and an in-progress cactus</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/elephant.png" width="200px">

<p>Some of these are also pretty wonky, but sometimes it adds to the charm: for
example the elephant&rsquo;s head is attached at an angle which was not on purpose
but I think adds to the effect. (<a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/789349199/mr-orange-monster-amigurumi-crochet">orange guy pattern</a>, <a href="https://hellostitchesxo.com.au/amigurumi-elephant-crochet-free-pattern/">elephant pattern</a>)</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t really been making clothing: I like working in a pretty chaotic way
and I think you need to be a lot more careful when you make clothing so that it
will actually fit.</p>

<h3 id="buying-patterns-is-great">buying patterns is great</h3>

<p>Originally I started out using free patterns, but I found some cacti patterns I really liked in an ebook called <a href="https://knotmonsters.com/products/12-crochet-mini-cactus-garden-patterns-ebook-pdf-knotmonsters-amigurumi-crochet-patterns-beginner-easy-simple-basic-plant-cacti-project-lot">Knotmonsters: Cactus Gardens Edition</a>, so I bought it.</p>

<p>I like the patterns in that book and also buying patterns seems like a nice way
to support people who are making fun patterns. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTvHB9HTPQI">this guide to designing your own patterns</a> through
searching on Ravelry and it seems like a lot of work! Maybe I will do it one
day but for now I appreciate the
work of other people who make the patterns.</p>

<h3 id="modifying-patterns-chaotically-is-great-too">modifying patterns chaotically is great too</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been modifying all of the patterns I make in a somewhat chaotic way, often
just because I made a mistake somewhere along the way and then decide to move
forward and change the pattern to adjust for the mistake instead of undoing my
work. Some of of the changes I&rsquo;ve made are:</p>

<ul>
<li>remove rows</li>
<li>put fewer stitches in a row</li>
<li>use a different stitch</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t always work but often it works well enough, and I think all of the
mistakes help me learn.</p>

<h3 id="no-safety-eyes">no safety eyes</h3>

<p>A lot of the patterns I&rsquo;ve been seeing for animals suggest using &ldquo;safety eyes&rdquo;
(plastic eyes). I didn&rsquo;t really feel like buying those , so I&rsquo;ve been
embroidering eyes on instead. &ldquo;Embroidering&rdquo; might not be accurate, really I
just sew some black yarn on in a haphazard way and hope it doesn&rsquo;t come out
looking too weird.</p>

<p>My crochet kit came with a big plastic yarn needle that I&rsquo;ve been using to
embroider and also</p>

<h3 id="no-stitch-markers">no stitch markers</h3>

<p>My crochet kit came with some plastic &ldquo;stitch markers&rdquo; which you can use to
figure out where the beginning of your row is, so you know when you&rsquo;re done.
I&rsquo;ve been finding it easier to just use a short piece of scrap yarn instead.</p>

<h3 id="on-dealing-with-all-the-counting">on dealing with all the counting</h3>

<p>In crochet there is a LOT of counting. Like &ldquo;single crochet 3 times, then
double crochet 1 time, then repeat that 6 times&rdquo;. I find it hard to do that
accurately without making mistakes, and all of the counting is not that fun! A
few things that have helped:</p>

<ul>
<li>go back and look at my stitches to see what I did (&ldquo;have I done 1 single
crochet, or 2?&ldquo;). I&rsquo;m not actually very good at doing this, but I find it
easier to see my stitches with wool/cotton yarn than with acrylic yarn for
some reason.</li>
<li>count how many stitches in total I&rsquo;ve done since the last row, and make sure
it seems approximately right (&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m supposed to have 20 stitches and I
have 19, that&rsquo;s pretty close!&ldquo;). Then I&rsquo;ll maybe just add an extra stitch in
the wrong place to adjust, or maybe just leave it the way it is.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes-on-yarn">notes on yarn</h3>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve tried three kinds of yarn: merino (for the elephant), cotton (for
the cacti), and acrylic (for the orange dude). I still don&rsquo;t know
which one I like best, but since I&rsquo;m doing small projects it feels like the
right move is still to just buy small amounts of yarn and experiment. I think I
like the cotton and merino more than the acrylic.</p>

<p>For the cacti I used <a href="https://www.artisanthropy.ca/products/rico-ricorumi-dk">Ricorumi</a> cotton yarn,
which comes in tiny balls (which is good for me because if I don&rsquo;t end up
liking it, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of extra!) and in a lot of different colours.</p>

<p>There are a lot of yarn weights (lace! sock! sport! DK! worsted! bulky! and
more!). I don&rsquo;t really underestand them yet but I think so far I&rsquo;ve been mostly
using DK and worsted yarn.</p>

<h3 id="hook-size-who-knows">hook size? who knows!</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mostly been using a 3.5mm hook, probably because I read a tutorial that
said to use a 3.5mm hook. It seems to work fine! I used a larger hook size when
making a hat, and that also worked.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t really know how to choose hook sizes but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to
have a lot of consequences when making cacti.</p>

<h3 id="every-stitch-i-ve-learned">every stitch I&rsquo;ve learned</h3>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve probably only learned how to do 5 things in crochet so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>magic ring (mr)</li>
<li>single crochet (sc)</li>
<li>half double crochet (hdc)</li>
<li>front post half double crochet (fphdc)</li>
<li>double crochet (dc)</li>
<li>back loops only/front loops only (flo/blo)</li>
<li>increase/decrease</li>
</ul>

<p>The way I&rsquo;ve been approaching learning new crochet stitches is:</p>

<ol>
<li>find a pattern I want to make</li>
<li>start it without reviewing it very much at all</li>
<li>when I get to a stitch I don&rsquo;t know, watch youtube videos</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t watch it very carefully and get it wrong</li>
<li>eventually realize that it doesn&rsquo;t look right at all, rewatch the video, and continue</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://sarahmaker.com/half-double-crochet/">Sarah Maker</a>&rsquo;s pages a lot, except for the magic ring where I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p298HxgsO1s">this 3-minute youtube video</a>.</p>

<p>The magic ring took me a very long time to learn to do correctly, I didn&rsquo;t pay
attention very closely to the 3-minute youtube video so I did it wrong in maybe
4 projects before I figured out how to do it right.</p>

<h3 id="every-single-thing-i-ve-bought">every single thing I&rsquo;ve bought</h3>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve only needed:</p>

<ol>
<li>a crochet kit (which I got as a gift). it came with yarn, a bunch of crochet needles in different sizes, big sewing needles, and some other things I haven&rsquo;t needed yet.</li>
<li>some Ricorumi cotton (for the cacti)</li>
<li>1 ball of gray yarn (for the elephant)</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to not buy too much stuff, because I never know if I&rsquo;ll get
bored with a new hobby, and if I get bored it&rsquo;s annoying to have a bunch of
stuff lying around. Some examples of things I&rsquo;ve avoided buying so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of buying polyester fiberfill, to fill all of the critters I&rsquo;ve just
been cutting up an old sweater I have that was falling apart.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been embroidering the eyes instead of buying safety eyes</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything I have right now fits in a the box the crochet kit came in (which is
about the size of a large shoebox), and my plan is to keep it that way for a
while.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that&rsquo;s all!</h3>

<p>Mainly what I like about crochet so far is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s a way to not be on the computer, and you can chat with people while doing it</li>
<li>you can do it without buying too much stuff, it&rsquo;s pretty compact</li>
<li>I end up with cacti in our living room which is great (I also have a bunch of real succulents, so they go with those)</li>
<li>it seems extremely forgiving of mistakes and experimentation</li>
</ul>

<p>There are definitely still a lot of things I&rsquo;m doing &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s fun to
learn through trial and error.</p>
