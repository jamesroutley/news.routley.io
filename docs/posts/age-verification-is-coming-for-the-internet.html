    <h1>Age verification is coming for the internet</h1>

    <div><div><div><p>Age verification laws are proliferating fast across the United States and around the world, creating a dangerous and confusing tangle of rules about what we’re all allowed to see and do online. Though these mandates claim to <a href="http://eff.org/pages/age-verification-wont-protect-children#main-content">protect children</a>, in practice they create harmful censorship and surveillance regimes that put <a href="http://eff.org/pages/whos-harmed-age-verification-mandates#main-content">everyone</a>—adults and young people alike—at risk.</p>
<p>The term “age verification” is colloquially used to describe a <a href="http://eff.org/pages/age-verification-estimation-assurance-oh-my-guide-terminology#main-content">wide range</a> of age assurance technologies, from age verification systems that force you to upload government ID, to age estimation tools that scan your face, to systems that infer your age by making you share personal data. While different laws call for <a href="http://eff.org/pages/does-tech-even-work#main-content">different methods</a>, one thing remains constant: <em>every method</em> <em>out there </em>collects your sensitive, personal information and creates barriers to accessing the internet. We refer to all of these requirements as age verification, age assurance, or age-gating.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed by this onslaught of laws and the invasive technologies behind them, you’re not alone. It’s a <em>lot.</em> But understanding how these mandates work and who they harm is critical to keeping yourself and your loved ones safe online. Age verification is lurking around every corner these days, so we must fight back to protect the internet that we know and love. </p>
<p><strong>That’s why today, we’re launching EFF’s <a href="http://www.eff.org/age">Age Verification Resource Hub (EFF.org/Age</a>)</strong>: a one-stop shop to understand what these laws actually do, what’s at stake, why EFF opposes all forms of age verification, how to protect yourself, and how to join the fight for a free, open, private, and yes—safe—internet. </p>
<h3><strong>Why Age Verification Mandates Are a Problem</strong></h3>
<p>In the U.S., more than <a href="https://www.404media.co/missouri-age-verification-law-porn-id-check-vpns/">half of all states</a> have now passed laws imposing age-verification requirements on online platforms. Congress is considering even more at the federal level, with a recent House hearing weighing <a href="https://reason.com/2025/12/01/lawmakers-to-consider-19-bills-for-childproofing-the-internet/">nineteen distinct proposals</a> relating to young people’s online safety—some sweeping, some contradictory, and each one more drastic and draconian than the last.</p>
<p>We all want young people to be safe online. However, age verification is not the silver bullet that lawmakers want you to think it is.</p>
<p>The rest of the world is moving in the same direction. We <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/americans-be-warned-lessons-reddits-chaotic-uk-age-verification-rollout">saw</a> the UK’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/no-uks-online-safety-act-doesnt-make-children-safer-online">Online Safety Act</a> go into effect this summer, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/australia-banning-kids-social-media-does-more-harm-good">Australia’s new law</a> barring access to social media for anyone under 16 goes live today, and a slew of other countries are currently considering similar restrictions.</p>
<p>We all want young people to be safe online. However, age verification is not the silver bullet that lawmakers want you to think it is. In fact, age-gating mandates <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/10-not-so-hidden-dangers-age-verification">will do more harm than good</a>—<em>especially</em> for the young people they claim to protect. They undermine the fundamental speech rights of adults and young people alike; create new barriers to accessing vibrant, lawful, even life-saving content; and needlessly jeopardize all internet users’ privacy, anonymity, and security.</p>
<p>If legislators want to meaningfully improve online safety, they should pass <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms">a strong, comprehensive federal privacy law</a> instead of building new systems of surveillance, censorship, and exclusion.  </p>
<h3>What’s Inside the Resource Hub</h3>
