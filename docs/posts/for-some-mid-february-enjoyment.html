    <h1>For some mid-February enjoyment</h1>
    
    <img src="https://www.alisoneroman.com/content/images/2026/02/ossobucopasta.JPG" alt="For some mid-February enjoyment"><p>When I was in my youth with fewer responsibilities and approximately zero babies or businesses to tend to, I enjoyed going to a warm-weather place for an extended period of time in February or March. Traveling in December felt silly and expensive&#x2013; far too early in the season to be so done with the cold. As a California native, I was just getting acquainted with the frustrations of winter, even finding some of it charming. But by the end of February, even I had&#x2026;simply had it.&#xA0;</p><p>And today, right on cue, February 19th, I have&#x2026;simply had it. I just saw Doritos is launching a protein chip. I HAVE HAD IT. But I&#x2019;m not going anywhere. There is no warm weather trip in my immediate future, and finally, 16 years in New York, I&#x2019;m &#x201C;leaning in&#x201D; to the idea that maybe &#x201C;wintering&#x201D; can be as fun as &#x201C;summering.&#x201D; I am, after all, a person who truly loves to be at home, and what better time to be at home than during the coldest winter in years, with a 13-month old who&#x2019;s just learned to walk (this is a joke, it is a bad time to be only in the home).&#xA0;</p><p>BUT, I am learning, I am leaning, and some things are true about me loving being at home in the winter. I love making coffee in my little Mocamaster, I love working on the couch next to my cat, in soft clothes without makeup or washed hair. I love to make lunch in my kitchen (that <a href="https://www.alisoneroman.com/recipes/brothy-chili-with-tomatillo-and-greens/" rel="noreferrer">brothy chili</a> isn&#x2019;t going to make itself) and I love turning the thermostat up after my husband has turned it down (back and forth, forever and ever). I also love cooking something for a very long time, giving me the illusion of productivity, knowing I&#x2019;m doing something without having to do much at all.&#xA0;</p><p>That, to me, is the joy of winter cooking. Something we really look forward to in, say, November or immediately post-holiday. But by mid-February, we&#x2019;ve all but forsaken the happiness a low and slow rich braise and comfy cozy pot of br*thy b**ns brings us. Because&#x2026;.we&#x2019;ve had it!</p><p>So I guess I&#x2019;m here to say, it&#x2019;s February 19th and you have a few choices. You can, of course, fly to a warm weather place (but just know, that is only temporary). Or, you can buckle down, lean in, find happiness in a thermostat set at 72&#xB0;F (even if that, too, is only temporary) and decide that you&#x2019;re going to find someone to sell you three pounds of osso buco so you can spend several hours of your precious life making this beautiful ragu.</p><p>Yes, I am presenting you with the opportunity to sear thick slabs of meat till they&#x2019;re impossibly browned, making sure to turn on the fan above your stove so you don&#x2019;t set off a smoke detector. To chop an onion finer than you usually do, meditating on the concept of &#x201C;good knifework&#x201D; and if you have it and what that even means. To caramelize a whole can of tomato paste without worrying about how to store the leftovers, and the rare and satisfying chance to dump a whole bottle of wine into a pot, swirling it as it exits to make that cool little vortex. And then, the greatest gift of all: The gift of walking away to do something else&#x2013; literally anything else&#x2013; for three hours, only to come back to a pot of marvelous braised beef, a sauce slick with fat, sticky with beef tendon and rich with bone marrow. The choice is clear. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWWrgaEanJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Alison Makes Osso Buco Ragu at Home"></iframe><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Something happening while I&#x2019;m doing something else?
