<p>It&#39;s unclear if anyone was injured during the incident.</p><p>ABC15 reached out to Amazon which provided the following statement: <i>“We’re aware of an incident involving two Prime Air drones in Tolleson, Arizona. We’re currently working with the relevant authorities to investigate.”</i></p><p>On Thursday, Amazon told ABC15 operations are set to resume on Friday: </p><p><i>“We&#39;ll resume drone delivery in Tolleson tomorrow while continuing to support ongoing reviews by relevant agencies. Safety is our top priority, and we&#39;ve completed our own internal review of this incident and are confident that there wasn&#39;t an issue with the drones or the technology that supports them. Nonetheless, we&#39;ve introduced additional processes like enhanced visual landscape inspections to better monitor for moving obstructions such as cranes.”</i></p><p><b><i>This is a developing story and will be updated once new information becomes available.</i></b></p><div>
