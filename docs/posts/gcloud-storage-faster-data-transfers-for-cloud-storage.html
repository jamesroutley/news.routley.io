    <h1>Gcloud storage: Faster data transfers for Cloud Storage</h1>

When transferring 100 files that were 100MB in size, gcloud storage is 79% faster than gsutil on download and 33% faster on upload using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/parallel-composite-uploads&#34;&gt;parallel composite upload&lt;/a&gt; strategy. See Figure 1. With a 10GB file, gcloud storage is 94% faster than gsutil on download and 57% faster on upload. See Figure 2. These tests have been performed on Google Cloud Platform using n2d-standard-16 (8 vCPUs, 32 GB memory) and 1x375GB NVME in RAID0 in us-east4.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faster transfer rates are a result of two primary innovations in gcloud storage. First, gcloud storage uses faster hashing tools for CRC32C data integrity checking that skip the complicated setup required for gsutil. Second, it utilizes a new parallelization strategy that treats task management as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;graph problem&lt;/a&gt;, which allows more work to be done in parallel with far less overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improved usability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the performance improvements gcloud CLI provides, it also provides a consistent way to manage all Google Cloud resources like Cloud Storage buckets, Compute Engine VMs, and Google Kubernetes Engine clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;gcloud storage automatically detects optimal settings and speeds up transfers without requiring any flags from the users. In gcloud storage, all operations happen in parallel. As an example, parallel composite uploads are enabled automatically based on bucket configuration. This is a vast improvement compared to gsutil, which requires the -m (parallel operations) flag to improve the performance for uploads and downloads. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;gcloud storage significantly reduces the number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/storage&#34;&gt;top level commands&lt;/a&gt; that users have to manage their Cloud Storage resources. This is achieved by grouping commands under common headers - all bucket operations are grouped under gcloud storage buckets &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; and all object ops are grouped under gcloud storage objects &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition to gcloud storage CLI is simple because we have introduced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/ShimforRunninggcloudstorage&#34;&gt;shim&lt;/a&gt; that enables existing gsutil scripts to be executed as gcloud storage. This allows you to get all the performance benefits of the new CLI without having to rewrite any existing gsutil scripts for Cloud Storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enabling gcloud storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;gcloud storage CLI is currently available and you can use it without any additional charges. You may install or upgrade to the latest version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install#sdk-install&#34;&gt;Google Cloud SDK&lt;/a&gt; to get the new CLI.
