    <h1>Microserfs ordered back to the office, given 10 days to appeal</h1>

<p>Microsoft is rolling out a new return-to-office policy that will see first Redmond, then US, and then global staff getting back on-prem at least three days a week.</p>
<p>&#34;How we work has forever changed,&#34; Microsoft&#39;s Chief People Officer Amy Coleman told staff in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/09/flexible-work-update/">blog post</a>. And that change will start in Redmond by the end of February. If you work within a 50-mile radius of the office, Microsoft has already emailed you if it expects your attendance, she said.</p>
<p>The changes will spread across the rest of America and then internationally on an unspecified timescale. We&#39;ve asked for clarification and will update this article if it comes in.</p>

    

<p>Coleman&#39;s note looked to get ahead of possible criticisms that mandatory RTO policies serve as a backdoor way to reduce headcount, as employees who&#39;d moved far away from offices to take advantage of companies&#39; remote work policies may find it difficult or unpalatable to uproot again.</p>

        


        

<p>&#34;Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount,&#34; she wrote. &#34;It’s about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers’ needs.&#34;</p>
<p>If Microsofties want an exemption from the new rules, they must file a request by September 19, Coleman said. She told staff to ask their EVPs or &#34;organizational leadership&#34; how this would work in practice and what conditions they would require.</p>

<p>Seattle-area workers are still getting a good deal compared to the peons at Amazon. They&#39;ve been under a five-day office regime since this year and some staff are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/amazon_staff_return_office/">peeved</a> at the change.</p>
<p>Just three years ago, Microsoft was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/23/microsoft_highlights_productivity_paranoia/">touting</a> research about how working from home was just fine. Recent evidence also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/27/office_workers_ignore_rto_mandate/">shows</a> RTO mandates can discourage staff. But that was then and this is now, and most of the big tech firms are now requiring a three-office-day week at least.</p>

        

<p>Intel&#39;s already on a three-day in policy, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/24/intel_jobs_cuts/">rising</a> to four as the struggling chip biz tries to correct decades of failures. IBM is cracking the whip on not only hours in, but also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/18/ibm_orders_us_sales_staff/">forcing</a> staff to move location to be closer to the office for three-days of office work. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/31/dell_ends_hybrid_work_policy/">Dell</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/08/google_three_day_week_enforcement/">Google</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/02/meta_return_to_office_mandate/">Meta</a>, and others are also enforcing the three-office-day week.</p>
<p>Irony of ironies, Zoom has also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/11/zoom_london_office/">enforced</a> a similar 50-mile commuting mandate to Microsoft. Talk about not eating your own dogfood! ®</p>
