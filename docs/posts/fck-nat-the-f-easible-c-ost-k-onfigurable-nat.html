<p>Welcome to fck-nat. The (f)easible (c)ost (k)onfigurable NAT!</p>
<ul>
<li>Overpaying for AWS Managed NAT Gateways? fck-nat.</li>
<li>Want to use NAT instances and stay up-to-date with the latest security patches? fck-nat.</li>
<li>Want to reuse your Bastion hosts as a NAT? fck-nat.</li>
</ul>
<p>fck-nat offers a ready-to-use ARM and x86 based AMIs built on Amazon Linux 2023 which can support up to 5Gbps burst NAT
traffic on a t4g.nano instance. How does that compare to a Managed NAT Gateway?</p>
<p>Hourly rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed NAT Gateway hourly: $0.045</li>
<li>t4g.nano hourly: $0.0042</li>
</ul>
<p>Per GB rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed NAT Gateway per GB: $0.045</li>
<li>fck-nat per GB: $0.00</li>
</ul>
<p>Sitting idle, fck-nat costs 10% of a Managed NAT Gateway. In practice, the savings are even greater.</p>
<p><em>&#34;But what about AWS&#39; NAT Instance AMI?&#34;</em></p>
<p>The official AWS supported NAT Instance AMI hasn&#39;t been updates since 2018, is still running Amazon Linux 1 which is
now EOL, and has no ARM support, meaning it can&#39;t be deployed on EC2&#39;s most cost effective instance types. fck-nat.</p>
<p><em>&#34;When would I want to use a Managed NAT Gateway instead of fck-nat?&#34;</em></p>
<p>AWS limits outgoing internet bandwidth on EC2 instances to 5Gbps. This means that the highest bandwidth that fck-nat
can support (while remaining cost-effective) is 5Gbps. This is enough to cover a very broad set of use cases, but if
you need additional bandwidth, you should use Managed NAT Gateway. If AWS were to lift the limit on internet egress
bandwidth from EC2, you could cost-effectively operate fck-nat at speeds up to 25Gbps, but you wouldn&#39;t need Managed
NAT Gateway then would you? fck-nat.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-network-bandwidth.html">Read more about EC2 bandwidth limits here</a></p>
<p>Additionally, if you have an allergy to non-managed services, fck-nat may not be for you. Although fck-nat supports a
high-availability mode, it is not completely immune to outages (albeit very rare). If your workload requires five 9s of
uptime, then Managed NAT Gateway is likely a better option for you.</p>
<h2 id="using-fck-nat">Using fck-nat</h2>
<p>The primary objective of fck-nat is to make deploying your own NAT instances as easy, secure, and configurable as
possible. While fck-nat strives to provide out-of-the-box options and guides that work for most people, everyone&#39;s
requirements are different. Where fck-nat can&#39;t provide a ready-to-use solution, we try to offer you all the toggles
you need to get up and running yourself with as little headache as possible. We follow the &#34;batteries included, but
swappable&#34; philosophy.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-fck-nat-ami">Getting a fck-nat AMI</h3>
<p>fck-nat provides public AMIs in both arm64 and x86_64 flavors built on top of Amazon Linux 2023. If you would rather use a
different base image or host the AMI yourself, you can build your own AMI.</p>
<h4 id="the-public-fck-nat-amis">The public fck-nat AMIs</h4>
<p>fck-nat currently provides public AMIs in most regions. You can see the full list in
<a href="https://github.com/AndrewGuenther/fck-nat/blob/main/packer/fck-nat-public-all-regions.pkrvars.hcl"><code>packer/fck-nat-public-all-regions.pkrvars.hcl</code></a>.
While arm64 images are the most cost effective, x86_64 images are also
available. You can get view the available fck-nat AMIs with the following query:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a># Amazon Linux 2023 based AMIs
<a id="__codelineno-0-2" name="__codelineno-0-2" href="#__codelineno-0-2"></a>aws ec2 describe-images --owners 568608671756 --filters &#39;Name=name,Values=fck-nat-al2023-*&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="building-your-own-fck-nat-ami">Building your own fck-nat AMI</h4>
<p>fck-nat images are built using <a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a>. You can find the Packer files we use to build the
public images inside the <code>packer</code> folder. Our Packer configuration uses variables extensively, allowing you to
customize your base image, build region, architecture, etc. If the publicly available AMIs don&#39;t suit your needs, or
you would prefer to host the AMIs yourself, you can create your own <code>pkrvars.hcl</code> file and build your own AMI.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>packer<span> </span>build<span> </span>-var-file<span>=</span><span>&#34;your-var-file.pkrvars.hcl&#34;</span><span> </span>./packer/fck-nat.pkr.hcl
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="installing-fck-nat-from-the-rpm">Installing fck-nat from the RPM</h3>
<p>If you have an existing AMI and you want to install fck-nat on it, you can get the <code>.rpm</code> build of fck-nat
from the <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGuenther/fck-nat/releases">Releases</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="using-your-fck-nat-ami">Using your fck-nat AMI</h3>
<p>An AMI isn&#39;t the only thing you&#39;ll need to get up and running with fck-nat. There&#39;s a few options which need to be
configured in order to route traffic to your NAT. Namely, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure a security group for your fck-nat instance</li>
<li>Disable source/destination checks</li>
<li>Update your VPC route table</li>
</ol>
<p>Some tools can accomplish this for you, others cannot. Check the <a href="https://fck-nat.dev/v1.3.0/deploying/">Deployment page</a> for more
information about deploying fck-nat with your favorite infrastructure-as-code tool.</p>
