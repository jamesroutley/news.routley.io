    <h1>Secure boot certificate rollover is real but probably won&#39;t hurt you</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LWN wrote <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1029767/">an article</a> which opens with the assertion &#34;Linux users who have Secure Boot enabled on their systems knowingly or unknowingly rely on a key from Microsoft that is set to expire in September&#34;. This is, depending on interpretation, either misleading or just plain wrong, but also there&#39;s not a good source of truth here, so.</p></div></div>
