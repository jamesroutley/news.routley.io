<p><em>Daemon</em> has an interesting usage in computing. From my local dictionary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a background process that handles requests for services such as print spooling and file transfers, and is dormant when not required</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does anyone know where this came from? I assume its relation to the word <em>demon</em> is notable. My dictionary also lists <em>daemon</em> as an archaic form of <em>demon</em>. Why did computing use <em>daemon</em> instead of <em>demon</em>?</p>

<p>In this <a href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/%7Ehistory/Daemon.html" rel="noreferrer">interesting history</a>, which is the actual description of the origin of this use from Professor Corbato, he explains that <em>daemon</em> originally had the connotation of &#34;<em>an attendant ... or indwelling spirit</em>&#34; and that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the late 16th century, the general supernatural meaning was being distinguished with the spelling daemon, while the evil meaning remained with demon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to share the story of Maxwell&#39;s daemon.  Maxwell was a 19th century scientist who&#39;d posed a physics problem in which a tiny daemon was the attendant at a gate between two chambers that was large enough for a single molecule to enter.  The daemon observed the molecules and chose which ones to allow to pass through the gate.</p>
<p>So now we come to the crux of it. We have established a daemon as an attendant, and a scientist used a hypothetical daemon in a famous problem in which the daemon&#39;s job was to monitor molecular movement.  Professor Corbato wraps up his explanation with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you probably know, the &#34;system processes&#34; called daemons monitor other tasks and perform predetermined actions depending on their behavior. This is so reminiscent of Maxwell&#39;s daemon watching his molecules that we can only assume that whoever dubbed these &#34;system processes&#34; had Maxwell&#39;s daemon in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history also notes that Professor Saltzer, who also worked on Project MAC with Professor Corbato at the time &#34;daemon&#34; came into use for this purpose, confirms that this is the origin of <em>daemon</em> as it is used in computing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Fernando J. Corbato who
  worked on Project MAC in 1963 his team
  is the first to use the term daemon.
  The use of the term daemon was
  inspired by Maxwell&#39;s daemon, in
  physics and thermodynamics as an
  imaginary agent which helped to sort
  molecules.</p>
  
  <p>&#34;We fancifully began to use the word
  daemon to describe background
  processes which worked tirelessly to
  perform system chores.&#34;</p>
  
  <p>(...)</p>
  
  <p>In the Unix System Administration
  Handbook, Evi Nemeth states the
  following about daemons:</p>
  
  <p>&#34;Many people equate the word &#34;daemon&#34; with the word &#34;demon&#34;,
  implying some kind of satanic
  connection between UNIX and the
  underworld. This is an egregious
  misunderstanding. &#34;Daemon&#34; is actually
  a much older form of &#34;demon&#34;; daemons
  have no particular bias towards good
  or evil, but rather serve to help
  define a person&#39;s character or
  personality. The ancient Greeks&#39;
  concept of a &#34;personal daemon&#34; was
  similar to the modern concept of a
  &#34;guardian angel&#34;—eudaemonia is the
  state of being helped or protected by
  a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX
  systems seem to be infested with both
  daemons and demons.&#34;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiau" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://kb.iu.edu/d/aiau</a>, &#34;Daemon&#34; stands for Disk and Execution Monitor.</p>
<p>More information on this meaning here:
<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3347/disk-and-execution-monitor-daemon" rel="nofollow noreferrer">www.techopedia.com: Disk and Execution Monitor (Daemon)</a></p>
<p>Extract:</p>
<p>A disk and execution monitor (daemon) is a background process run in computer multitasking operating systems, usually at bootstrap time, to perform administrative changes or monitor services.</p>
<p>Common daemon processes include email handlers, print spoolers and other programs that perform OS administrative tasks. Daemons also perform specified operations at predefined times in response to events.</p>
