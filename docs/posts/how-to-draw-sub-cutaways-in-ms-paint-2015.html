<p><em>Apparently I am crazy to draw with these outdated tools but I like the hand-drawn look and feel. I don&#39;t think that I can do a streaming any time soon, but I can share how I draw the illustrations old-school in MS Paint and shade in GIMP.</em> I finished illustrating my special forces subs book (see link below - check it out on Amazon) so I have a bit of time to indulge on other types of sub illustration. <br/></p>
<p>The end result will be the Soviet P-2 super-sub design which incorporated ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and midget subs. More here: <a href="http://mattambrogi.bearblog.dev/Stalins%20Super%20Sub%20-%20Project%20P-2.html" target="_blank">Stalin&#39;s Super Sub, Project P-2</a> </p>

<p>To start I create a MASSIVE canvas (e.g. 7000 px wide) so that I can draw it big and then scale it <em>down</em> to just 4000 px or thereabouts. That still seems massive compared to most of what&#39;s on the internet but it&#39;ll look crisper when scaled down. I paste in photos and schematics or other reference notes around the edges of where I&#39;m drawing. I then sketch the overall submarine. This step is important and takes 1-2 hours with lots of rework to get it looking right. </p>
<p>Now I am ready to start fleshing it out. I generally start at one end and work from there but you can draw in any order. I have already decided in my head which bits will be cut away. Generally the end of the submarine nearest the viewer needs to be in more detail than the other end. <br/></p>

<p>Zooming in, I get to work adding the details. Note how rough the underlying construction lines are. I have filled them in gray so that any pixels I miss with my  over-sketching will blend into the background and not stand out. I use the polygon tool with a dark near-black outline and gray fill (set as background color). Note that I do not use black, but a wide range of near-blacks. MS Paint&#39;s fill tool only fills the exact same color so using a range of near-same colors allows you to use the fill function to erase errors without impacting other parts of the drawing. If you don&#39;t get what I mean, draw two overlapping circles in different dark grays - then fill one with one of those two colors. Next fill that same circle with the background color, and you will find that one of the circles disappears but the other does not. This is often easier tan using the Eraser tool. </p>

<p>Three hours later and I have a sizeable chunk of the illustration constructed. The little struts on the outer hull bulkheads and frames took ages and a lot of googling of submarine scrapping and construction images. They are not exact, but a fair representation. </p>

<p>Another four hours and it&#39;s starting to look like the submarine. I switched it left-right in order to show certain details on the port (left) side of the sub:</p>
<p>And that, is how to draw a cutaway in MS Paint + GIMP. From here on it was just repeat, polish, adjust the image size and contrast, and export from GIMP as a jpeg. </p>
