<p>This is a brief blog post to highlight the growth of the Servo community in recent years, particularly since <a href="https://igalia.com">Igalia</a> took over the project maintenance in 2023.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn’t talk about the technical achievements, though there have been tons of them in the last years. <em>A picture is worth a thousand words</em> so just take a look at <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-a-new-web-engine-written-in-rust/">this slide from my latest Servo talk</a> which shows how <a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a> was rendered with Servo at the beginning of 2023 vs September 2025.</p>

<p>So like <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-revival-2023-2024/">we did last year</a>, let’s take a look at the PRs merged on the main <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo repository on GitHub</a> since 2018.</p>
<div>

<ul>
<li><strong>PRs</strong>: total number of PRs merged.</li>
<li><strong>Contributors</strong>: average number of contributors per month.</li>
<li><strong>Contributors ≥ 10</strong>: average number of contributors that have merged more than 10 PRs per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a clarification, these numbers don’t include PRs from bots (<code>dependabot</code> and <code>Servo WPT Sync</code>).</p>
<p>Checking this we can see we are close to <strong>double the numbers from last year</strong>! The numbers in 2025 are way bigger than in the previous years (even checking the numbers from 2018-2019), showing a healthy community working on Servo.</p>



<p>The next chart is a different view of the same data but split per month, with the number of PRs landed every month, the number of contributors and the number of contributors with more than 10 patches. It shows the evolution over the years and the high activity last year.</p>


<h2 id="number-of-contributors" tabindex="-1">Number of contributors <a href="#number-of-contributors">#</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s focus on the last 3 years, since the project reactivation, and the numbers of contributors to the Servo project.</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>2023</th>
        <th>2024</th>
        <th>2025</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Contributors</strong></td>
        <td>54</td>
        <td>129</td>
        <td>146</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>≥ 100 PRs</strong></td>
        <td>1 (2%)</td>
        <td>3 (2%)</td>
        <td>8 (5%)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>≥ 10 PRs</strong></td>
        <td>8 (15%)</td>
        <td>29 (22%)</td>
        <td>43 (29%)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Only 1 PR</strong></td>
        <td>31 (57%)</td>
        <td>53 (41%)</td>
        <td>55 (38%)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p>The number of contributors to Servo has tripled since 2023, reaching <strong>146 different contributors in 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If we analyze the rest of the data in this table, we can see that the percentage of contributors that do a single PR to Servo in a year has been reduced, meaning that Servo contributors are now usually doing more than one PR to the project.</p>
<p>If we check the number of contributors that have done more than 10 PRs in a year, we see the percentage almost doubling from 15% to 29% in the last 3 years.</p>
<p>And for the top contributors doing more than 100 PRs in a year, we have gone from 1 in 2023 and 3 in 2024 to 8 last year, which represent the 5% of the Servo contributors, showing a good team of very active contributors to the project.</p>
<h2 id="wpt-pass-rate" tabindex="-1">WPT pass-rate <a href="#wpt-pass-rate">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">WPT</a> evolution in 2025.</p>

  <figcaption>Evolution of WPT pass rates for Servo in 2025</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can check more information about WPT pass-rates at <a href="https://servo.org/wpt/">Servo’s website</a> (where you can also find an explanation of the <em>Score</em> number).</p>
<p>Note that these numbers differ from <a href="https://wpt.fyi/">wpt.fyi</a> because we’re still not running all the WPT tests in Servo, so the total numbers here are smaller.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to extract conclusions from this data, but it shows the Servo project keeps progressing and supporting more web platform features as time passes.</p>
<p>Sometimes these numbers grow artificially as new tests are added to WPT for features that Servo already supports (for example, the biggest jump last year was in October getting 188,281 new subtests passing without any change in Servo, just because new tests were added to WPT).</p>

</figure>
<p>We are about to reach <strong>35,000 stars on GitHub</strong>. It’s good to see the project has not stopped growing since the beginning, and the curve has become steeper in recent years.</p>
<h2 id="other" tabindex="-1">Other <a href="#other">#</a></h2>
<p>If we check to the <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/governance/README.md">official project roles</a>, we have now:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 administrators</li>
<li>17 TSC members</li>
<li>25 maintainers</li>
<li>18 contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also started doing <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/10/20/servo-0.0.1-release/"><strong>Servo releases</strong></a>, we have done <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/releases">3 so far</a>.</p>
<p>Also the TSC has setup <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/11/21/sponsorship-tiers/">sponsorship tiers</a> for donations. We got <a href="https://servo.org/#acknowledgements"><strong>4 bronze sponsors</strong></a> in 2025 and we hope to increase the number of sponsorships in 2026.</p>
<p>Regarding donations, we have defined a <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/FUNDING_REQUEST.md"><strong>funding process</strong></a> to request usage of that money. We are currently using it to sponsor <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/09/17/your-donations-at-work-funding-jdm/">Josh Matthews’ contributions</a>, and <a href="https://www.azabani.com/2025/12/18/shoestring-web-engine-ci.html">pay for self-hosted runners to speed up CI times</a>.</p>
<p>Servo has been present in several events last year, we ended up giving <a href="https://servo.org/about/"><strong>10 talks</strong></a> all around the globe.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up" tabindex="-1">Wrap-up <a href="#wrap-up">#</a></h2>
<p>The idea here was to do a quick recap of the Servo stats in 2025. Taking a look at these numbers every now and then is useful, and gives you a different perspective about the status of the project, that one can easily ignore during the day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>In general things have grown a lot in 2025, who knows what would happen in 2026, but we hope we can at least keep similar numbers or maybe even keep growing them further. That would be really great news for the Servo project.</p>
<p>Igalia is really proud of what the whole Servo community has achieved together in the recent years, and we hope for a bright future for the project going forward.</p>
<p>As an aside note, by the end of the month I’ll be at <a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/talk/review/PQPRDZ8DM7L8SYHBKGNZUJZUWGEXQTTP">FOSDEM talking about Servo</a>, other Servo folks like <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/dazabani">Delan Azabani</a> and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/mrobinson">Martin Robinson</a> will also be there. If you are around, don’t hesitate to say hi and ask anything about the project.</p>
