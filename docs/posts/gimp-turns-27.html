    <h1>GIMP Turns 27</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Today, on 21<sup>st</sup> of November 2022, the <strong><span>GNU</span> Image Manipulation Program
turned 27</strong> (cf. the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/about/prehistory.html#november-1995-an-announcement">first release announcement on
1995-11-21</a>).</p>
<p>To celebrate, <a href="https://film.zemarmot.net/">Aryeom (<em>ZeMarmot</em>‘s director)</a> drew
this nice birthday illustration (fully drawn within <span>GIMP</span>, and under Creative
Commons by-sa 4.0 license, of course!):</p>

<p>For both Aryeom and I (Jehan), this is our tenth year of continued contribution,
since a first <em>commit</em> in September 2012 (basic icon-changing patch in the
animation playback plug-in, soon followed by more… many more patches…). Back
then, never would we have imagined sticking for so long around this nice core
community (regarding this point, we thank the other contributors for their
welcomeness, and in particular the wonderful
<a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2017/03/01/an-interview-with-michael-natterer-gimp-maintainer/">mitch</a>)
and contributing litterally thousands of patches in <span>GIMP</span>! So it’s also a pretty
big personal milestone.</p>
<p>It is also my second year maintaining <span>GIMP</span>. And to be fair, Aryeom has a huge
role in my maintenance with constant reviewing, testing my code (and other
contributor’s code), following up with feedback, specifying behaviors (while
always caring about others’ usage! One of her main rule when she helps designing
changes is researching and wondering what worflows others have). So much is
being done in the shadow to keep it all together.</p>
<p>But <span>GIMP</span> is not only us. What would we do without Øyvind Kolås in particular?
Nowadays he is carrying most of our core flow-based graphics engine maintenance,
<a href="https://gegl.org/"><span>GEGL</span></a>, and its sister projects (<a href="https://gegl.org/babl/">babl</a>
and <a href="https://ctx.graphics/">ctx</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, I can’t forget all other awesome contributors: developers, packagers,
community support, translators (<span>GIMP</span> is more than 90% translated in <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/module/gimp/">27
languages</a> among 84 languages we currently
support!), documenters, website contributors, tutorial writers… We should also
thank the <span>GNOME</span> Infrastructure team for being so helpful of course. And many
many more! What would <span>GIMP</span> be without all of you? 💌</p>
<p>I will likely do a more detailed report later (like I did <a href="https://gimp.org/news/2021/12/31/gimp-2021-annual-report/">last
year</a>) to sum up 2022
events, so I’ll stay short in this news. For once!</p>
<p>All in all, we wish to remind that <strong><span>GIMP</span> is Community, Free Software</strong>. It
is what <a href="https://www.gimp.org/develop/">we make of it together</a>. We welcome
contributors very warmly 🤗!</p>
<p>Finally if you can’t contribute your time, in these year-end times of giving, don’t forget
that you may <a href="https://www.gimp.org/donating/"><strong>support financially <span>GIMP</span> developers</strong></a>.
<span>GIMP</span> project actively supports its contributors willing to make a living with
their Free Software contribution. Right now it means 3 people: Aryeom and myself
(through <em>ZeMarmot</em> project) as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/zemarmot"><span>GIMP</span> maintainers</a>
and Øyvind as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pippin"><span>GEGL</span> maintainer</a>. If you
appreciate what we do and wish to <strong>give back</strong>, funding us is an excellent way.
It is part of what makes <span>GIMP</span> development sustainable.</p>
<p>And for everyone who is really eager to see <strong><span>GIMP</span> 3.0</strong> out, it should go
without saying that funding developers is what accelerates the development of
<span>GIMP</span>.</p>
<p>🎁 <strong>So <span>GIMP</span>, and
<a href="https://www.gimp.org/about/linking.html#wilber-the-gimp-mascot">Wilber</a>, we wish you a very happy 27!</strong> 🎂</p>
<p>And to every member of the community: <strong>thank you all for sticking with this
project for all or part of these 27 years!</strong> <span>GIMP</span> would not be where it is today
without all of you! 💌</p>
