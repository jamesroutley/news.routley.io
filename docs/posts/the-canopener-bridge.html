							<p>Only the second crash this year at the 11foot8 bridge, but on July 6 a box truck driver ignored the warning signals and hit the crash beam of the Canopener bridge. Pieces of the roof were scattered all over the road! This was crash # 178 since 2008.</p>

							</h2>

							<p>After a veeery long dry spell, the canopener snagged some pieces off of a red-light running rental truck. The truck came down Gregson Street at a good clip, most likely faster than the 25MpH speed limit, ran the light by a solid 2 seconds and ended up leaving a couple of pounds of metal debris under the bridge. After a short break – presumably to assess the damage – the driver decided to continue, leaving the debris in the road […]</p>

							<p>The last 4 months were quiet at the canopener bridge – presumably due to construction and frequent road closures on Gregson St. right at the bridge and on the stretch south of the tracks. However yesterday, on April 26 – a camper trailer had some of its rooftop equipment removed at the canopener bridge. This was recorded as crash # 175 since April 2008.</p>

							<p>On December 6, 2021 a box truck made a left onto Gregson St and made contact with the canopener bridge. Trucks turning from Peabody St onto Gregson should be able to see the low-clearance sign at the stop light, but if the driver is not aware of the truck’s clearance requirements, that information might not help. This is crash #174 since 2008.</p>

							<p>On October 21, a semi truck damaged the faring and stacks when the driver pulled under the canopener bridge. When the driver then reflexively decided to just put it in reverse and back out, he REALLY messed up the fairing and lost one of the exhaust stacks. This was crash # 173 since 2008.</p>

The driver ignored low-clearance signage at 3 preceding intersections and a large flashing warning sign “OVERHEIGHT – MUST TURN” while standing at a red traffic light for a minute, only to floor it when the light tuned green and have the roof shaved clear off his truck.

							<p>On July 12, a boxtruck tried to old “be vewy vewy qwiet” approach to try to sneak under the canopener. It did not work for Elmer Fudd, and neither did it for this truck. But at least they were slow and just got a bit of a “love nibble” from our hungry beast. This was still recorded by your diligent observer as crash #169.</p>
