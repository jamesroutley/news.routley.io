    <h1>Devil Mode for Emacs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
Devil mode trades your comma key in exchange for a modifier-free
editing experience in Emacs.  Yes, the comma key!  The key you would
normally wield for punctuation in nearly every corner of text.  Yes,
this is twisted!  It would not be called the Devil otherwise, would
it?  If it were any more rational, we might call it something divine,
like, uh, the God mode?  But alas, there is nothing divine to be found
here.  Welcome, instead, to the realm of the Devil!  You will be
granted the occasional use of the comma key for punctuation, but only
if you can charm the Devil!  But beware, for in this sinister domain,
you must relinquish your comma key and embrace an editing experience
that whispers wicked secrets into your fingertips!

<div id="outline-container-introduction">
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<div id="text-introduction">
<p>
Devil mode intercepts our keystrokes and translates them to Emacs key
sequences according to a configurable set of translation rules.  For
example, with the default translation rules, when we type <code>, x , f</code>,
Devil translates it to <code>C-x C-f</code>.
</p>

<p>
The choice of the comma key (<code>,</code>) to mean the control modifier key
(<code>C-</code>) may seem outrageous.  After all, the comma is a very important
punctuation both in prose as well as in code.  Can we really get away
with using <code>,</code> to mean the <code>C-</code> modifier?  It turns out, this terrible
idea can be made to work without too much of a hassle.  At least it
works for me!  It might work for you too.  If it does not, Devil can
be configured to use another key instead of <code>,</code> to mean the <code>C-</code>
modifier.  See the section <a href="#custom-devil-key">Custom Devil Key</a> for an example.
</p>

<p>
A sceptical reader may rightfully ask: If <code>,</code> is translated to <code>C-</code>,
how on earth are we going to insert a literal <code>,</code> into the text when
we need to?  The section <a href="#typing-commas">Typing Commas</a> answers this.  But before we
get there, we have some fundamentals to cover.  Take the plunge and
see what unfolds!  Maybe you will like this!  Maybe you will not!  If
you do not like this, you can always retreat to God mode, Evil mode,
the vanilla key bindings, or whatever piques your fancy!

<div id="outline-container-notation">
<h2 id="notation">Notation<a href="#notation"></a></h2>
<p>
A quick note about the notation used in the document: The previous
example shows that <code>, x , f</code> is translated to <code>C-x C-f</code>.  What this
really means is that the keystrokes <code>,x,f</code> is translated to <code>ctrl+x
ctrl+f</code>.  We do not really type any space after the commas.  The key
<code>,</code> is directly followed by the key <code>x</code>.  However, the key sequence
notation used in this document contains spaces between each keystroke.
This is consistent with how key sequences are represented in Emacs in
general and how Emacs functions like <code>key-description</code>,
<code>describe-key</code>, etc.  represent key sequences.  When we really need to
type a space, it is represented as <code>SPC</code>.

Devil is available via <a href="https://melpa.org/">MELPA</a>.  You may already have a preferred way of
installing packages from MELPA.  If so, install the package named
<code>devil</code> to get Devil.  For the sake of completeness, here is a very
basic way of installing Devil from MELPA:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Add the following to the Emacs initialization file (i.e.,
<code>~/.emacs</code> or <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> or <code>~/.config/emacs/init.el</code>):
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require &#39;package)
(add-to-list &#39;package-archives &#39;(&#34;melpa&#34; . &#34;https://melpa.org/packages/&#34;) t)
(package-initialize)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Start Emacs with the updated initialization file and then type
these commands:
</p>

<pre id="org995f9b5">M-x package-refresh-contents RET
M-x package-install RET devil RET
</pre></li>

<li><p>
Confirm that Devil is installed successfully with this command:
</p>

<pre id="org100b80f">C-h f devil RET
</pre></li>

<li><p>
Enable Devil mode with this command:
</p>

<pre id="org4929823">M-x global-devil-mode RET
</pre></li>

<li>Type <code>, x , f</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-x C-f</code> and invoke
the corresponding command.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org46d49c6">
<h3 id="org46d49c6">Install Automatically from MELPA<a href="#org46d49c6"></a></h3>
<div id="text-org46d49c6">
<p>
Here is yet another basic way to install and enable Devil using Elisp:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require &#39;package)
(add-to-list &#39;package-archives &#39;(&#34;melpa&#34; . &#34;https://melpa.org/packages/&#34;) t)
(package-initialize)
(unless package-archive-contents
  (package-refresh-contents))
(unless (package-installed-p &#39;devil)
  (package-install &#39;devil))
(global-devil-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd &#34;C-,&#34;) &#39;global-devil-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now type <code>, x , f</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-x C-f</code> and
invoke the corresponding command.  Type <code>C-,</code> to disable Devil mode.
Type <code>C-,</code> again to enable it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-install-from-git-source">
<h3 id="install-from-git-source">Install from Git Source<a href="#install-from-git-source"></a></h3>
<div id="text-install-from-git-source">
<p>
If you prefer obtaining Devil from its Git repository, follow these
steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Clone Devil to your system:
</p>

<div>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/susam/devil.git
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Add the following to your Emacs initialization:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(add-to-list &#39;load-path &#34;/path/to/devil/&#34;)
(require &#39;devil)
(global-devil-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd &#34;C-,&#34;) &#39;global-devil-mode)
</pre>
</div></li>

<li>Start the Emacs editor.  Devil mode should now be enabled in all
buffers.  The modeline of each buffer should show the <code>Devil</code>
lighter.</li>

<li>Type <code>, x , f</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-x C-f</code> and invoke
the corresponding command.  Type <code>C-,</code> to disable Devil mode.  Type
<code>C-,</code> again to enable it.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-use-devil">
<h2 id="use-devil">Use Devil<a href="#use-devil"></a></h2>
<div id="text-use-devil">
<p>
Assuming vanilla Emacs key bindings have not been changed and Devil
has not been customised, here are some examples that demonstrate how
Devil may be used:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Type <code>, x , f</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-x C-f</code> and invoke
the <code>find-file</code> command.</li>

<li>Type <code>, p</code> to move up one line.</li>

<li>To move up multiple lines, type <code>, p p p</code> and so on.  Some Devil
key sequences are repeatable keys by default.  The repeatable Devil
key sequences can be repeated by typing the last key of the Devil
key sequence over and over again.</li>

<li>Another example of a repeatable Devil key sequence is <code>, f f f</code>
which moves the cursor word by multiple characters.  A few other
examples of repeatable keys are <code>, k k k</code> to kill lines, <code>, / / /</code>
to undo changs, etc.  Type <code>C-h v devil-repeatable-keys RET</code> to see
the complete list of repeatable keys.</li>

<li>Type <code>, s</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-s</code> and invoke
incremental search.</li>

<li>Type <code>, m s</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-M-s</code> and invoke
regular-expression-based incremental search.  Yes, <code>m</code> is
translated to <code>M-</code>.</li>

<li>Type <code>, m m x</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>M-x</code> and invoke the
corresponding command.</li>

<li>Type <code>, u , f</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-u C-f</code> and move
the cursor forward by 4 characters.</li>

<li>Type <code>, u u , f</code> and the cursor moves forward by 16 characters.
Devil uses its translation rules and an additional keymap to make
the input key sequence behave like <code>C-u C-u C-f</code> which moves the
cursor forward by 16 characters.</li>

<li>Type <code>, SPC</code> to type a comma followed by space.  This is a special
key sequence to make it convenient to type a comma in the text.
Note that this sacrifices the use of <code>, SPC</code> to mean <code>C-SPC</code> which
could have been a convenient way to set a mark.</li>

<li>Type <code>, z SPC</code> and watch Devil translate it to <code>C-SPC</code> and set a
mark.  Yes, <code>, z</code> is translated to <code>C-</code> too.</li>

<li>Similarly, type <code>, RET</code> to type a comma followed by the <code>enter</code>
key.  This is another special key.</li>

<li>Type <code>, ,</code> to type a single comma.  This special key is useful for
cases when you really need to type a single literal comma.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-typing-commas">
<h2 id="typing-commas">Typing Commas<a href="#typing-commas"></a></h2>
<div id="text-typing-commas">
<p>
Devil makes the questionable choice of using the comma as its
activation key.  As illustrated in the previous section, typing <code>, x ,
f</code> produces the same effect as typing <code>C-x C-f</code>.  One might naturally
wonder how then we are supposed to type literal commas.
</p>

<p>
Most often when we edit text, we do not really type a comma in
isolation.  Often we immediately follow the comma with a space or a
newline.  This assumption usually holds good while editing regular
text.  However, this assumption may not hold in some situations, like
while working with code when we need to add a single comma at the end
of an existing line.
</p>

<p>
In scenarios where the above assumption holds good, typing <code>, SPC</code>
inserts a comma and a space.  Similarly, typing <code>, RET</code> inserts a
comma and a newline.
</p>

<p>
In scenarios, when we do need to type a single comma, type <code>, ,</code>
instead.
</p>

<p>
Also, it is worth mentioning here that if all this fiddling with the
comma key feels clumsy, we could always customise the Devil key to
something else that feels better.  We could also disable Devil mode
temporarily and enable it again later with <code>C-,</code> as explained in
section <a href="#install">Install</a>.

<div id="outline-container-devil-reader">
<h2 id="devil-reader">Devil Reader<a href="#devil-reader"></a></h2>
<div id="text-devil-reader">
<p>
The following points briefly describe how Devil reads Devil key
sequences, translates them to Emacs key sequences, and runs commands
bound to the key sequences:
</p>

<ol>
<li>As soon as the Devil key is typed (which is <code>,</code> by default), Devil
wakes up and starts reading Devil key sequences.  Type <code>C-h v
   devil-key RET</code> to see the current Devil key.</li>

<li>After each keystroke is read, Devil checks if the key sequence
accumulated is a special key.  If it is, then the special command
bound to the special key is executed immediately.  Note that this
step is performed before any translation rules are applied to the
input key sequence.  This is how the Devil special key sequence <code>,
   SPC</code> inserts a comma and a space.  Type <code>C-h v devil-special-keys
   RET</code> to see the list of special keys and the commands bound to
them.</li>

<li>If the key sequence accumulated so far is not a special key, then
Devil translates the Devil key sequence to a regular Emacs key
sequence.  If the regular Emacs key sequence turns out to be a
complete key sequence and some command is found to be bound to it,
then that command is executed immediately.  This is how the Devil
key sequence <code>, x , f</code> is translated to <code>C-x C-f</code> and the
corresponding binding is executed.  If the translated key sequence
is a complete key sequence but no command is bound to it, then
Devil displays a message that the key sequence is undefined.  Type
<code>C-h v devil-translations RET</code> to see the list of translation
rules.</li>

<li>After successfully translating a Devil key sequence to an Emacs key
sequence and executing the command bound to it, Devil checks if the
key sequence is a repeatable key sequence.  If it is found to be a
repeatable key sequence, then Devil sets a transient map so that
the command can be repeated merely by typing the last keystroke of
the input key sequence.  This is how <code>, p p p</code> moves the cursor up
by three lines.  Type <code>C-h v devil-repeatable-keys RET</code> to see the
list of repeatable Devil key sequences.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The variables <code>devil-special-keys</code>, <code>devil-translations</code>, and
<code>devil-repeatable-keys</code> may contain keys or values with the string
<code>%k</code> in them.  This is a placeholder for <code>devil-key</code>.  While applying
the special keys, translation rules, or repeat rules, each <code>%k</code> is
replaced with the actual value of <code>devil-key</code> before applying the
rules.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-translation-rules">
<h2 id="translation-rules">Translation Rules<a href="#translation-rules"></a></h2>
<div id="text-translation-rules">
<p>
The following points provide an account of the translation rules that
Devil follows in order to convert a Devil key sequence entered by the
user to an Emacs key sequence:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The input key vector read from the user is converted to a key
description (i.e., the string functions like <code>describe-key</code>,
<code>key-description</code>, produce).  For example, if the user types ,x,f,
it is converted to <code>, x , f</code>.</li>

<li>Now the resulting key description is translated with simple string
replacements.  If any part of the string matches a key in
<code>devil-translations</code>, then it is replaced with the corresponding
value.  For example, <code>, x , f</code> is translated to <code>C- x C- f</code>.  Then
Devil normalises the result to <code>C-x C-f</code> by removing superfluous
spaces after the modifier keys.</li>

<li>However, if the simple string based replacement leads to an invalid
Emacs key sequence, it skips the replacement that causes the
resulting Emacs key sequence to become invalid.  For example <code>, m
   ,</code> results in <code>C-M-C-</code> after the simple string replacement because
the default translation rules replace <code>,</code> with <code>C-</code> and <code>m</code> with
<code>M-</code>.  However, <code>C-M-C-</code> is an invalid key sequence, so the
replacement of the second <code>,</code> to <code>C-</code> is skipped.  Therefore, the
input <code>, m ,</code> is translated to <code>C-M-,</code> instead.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-translation-examples">
<h2 id="translation-examples">Translation Examples<a href="#translation-examples"></a></h2>
<div id="text-translation-examples">
<p>
By default, Devil supports a small but peculiar set of translation
rules that can be used to avoid modifier keys while typing various
types of key sequences.  See <code>C-h v devil-translations RET</code> for the
translation rules.  Here are some examples that demonstrate the
default translation rules.  The obvious ones are shown first first.
The more peculiar translations come later in the table.

<p>
Note how we cannot use <code>, SPC</code> to set a mark because that key sequence
is already reserved as a special key sequence in <code>devil-special-keys</code>,
so Devil translates <code>, z</code> to <code>C-</code> too, so that we can still type
<code>C-SPC</code> using <code>, z s</code> and set a mark.
</p>

<p>
Also, note how the translation of <code>, m m</code> to <code>M-</code> allows us to enter a
key sequence that begins with the <code>M-</code> modifier key.

Devil adds the following additional key bindings only when Devil is

</p>

<ul>
<li>Adds the Devil key to <code>isearch-mode-map</code>, so that Devil key
sequences work in incremental search too.</li>

<li>Adds <code>u</code> to <code>universal-argument-more</code> to allow repeating the

<div id="outline-container-custom-configuration-examples">

<p>
In the examples presented below, the <code>(require &#39;devil)</code> calls may be
omitted if Devil has been installed from MELPA.  There are appropriate
autoloads in place in the Devil package that would ensure that it is
loaded automatically on enabling Devil mode.  However, the <code>require</code>
calls have been included in the examples below for the sake of
completeness.

<div id="text-local-mode">
<p>
While the section <a href="#install">Install</a> shows how we enable Devil mode globally,
this section shows how we can enable it locally.  Here is an example
initialization code that enables Devil locally only in text buffers.

<div>

(add-hook &#39;text-mode-hook &#39;devil-mode)

<p>
This is not recommended though because this does not provide a
seamless Devil experience.  For example, with Devil enabled locally in
a text buffer like this, although we can type <code>, x , f</code> to launch the
find-file minibuffer, we cannot use Devil key sequences in the
minibuffer.  Further the special keymaps described in the previous
section work only when Devil is enabled globally.

<div id="text-reclaim-comma-spc-to-set-mark">
<p>
The default configuration for special keys reserves <code>, SPC</code> to insert
a literal comma followed by space.  This default makes it easy to type
space in various contexts.  However, this means that <code>, SPC</code> does not
translate to <code>C-SPC</code>.  Therefore <code>, SPC</code> cannot be used to set mark.
Instead, the default translation rules offer <code>, z SPC</code> as a way to set
mark.
</p>

<p>
If you would rather set mark using <code>, SPC</code> and you are happy with the
special key <code>, ,</code> alone to insert a literal comma and you are okay
with typing comma twice everytime you want to insert a literal comma,
then the special keys

(setq devil-special-keys &#39;((&#34;%k %k&#34; . (lambda () (interactive) (devil-run-key &#34;%k&#34;)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This reduces the number of special keys so that only <code>, ,</code> is treated
as special.  All the other special key definitions (<code>, SPC</code> was one of
them) are removed.  As a result, <code>, SPC</code> is now translated to <code>C-SPC</code>.

another dubious choice for the Devil key.  With this configuration, we
can use <code>&lt;left&gt; x &lt;left&gt; f</code> and have Devil translate it to <code>C-x C-f</code>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the above example defines the <code>devil-special-keys</code>
variable to have a single entry that allows typing <code>&lt;left&gt; &lt;left&gt;</code> to
produce the same effect as the original <code>&lt;left&gt;</code>.  It removes the
other entries, so that <code>&lt;left&gt; SPC</code> is no longer reserved as a special

While this package provides the comma (<code>,</code>) as the default and the
only Devil key, nothing stops you from extending the mode map to
support multiple Devil keys.  Say, you decide that in addition to
activating Devil with <code>,</code> which also plays the role of <code>C-</code>, you also
want to activate Devil with <code>.</code> which must now play the role of <code>M-</code>.
To achieve such a result, you could use this initialization code as a
starting point and then customise it further based on your
requirements:

<p>
With this configuration, we can type <code>, x , f</code> for <code>C-x C-f</code> like
before.  But now we can also type <code>. x</code> for <code>M-x</code>.  Similarly, we can
type <code>, . s</code> for <code>C-M-s</code> and so on.  Further, <code>, ,</code> inserts a literal
comma and <code>. .</code> inserts a literal dot.

Note that by default Devil configures only one activation key (<code>,</code>)
because the more activation keys we add, the more intrusive Devil
becomes during regular editing tasks.  Every key that we reserve for
activating Devil loses its default function and then we need
workarounds to somehow invoke the default function associated with
that key (like repeating <code>.</code> twice to insert a single <code>.</code> in the above
example).  Therefore, it is a good idea to keep the number of Devil
keys as small as possible.

By default Devil has a small list of key sequences that are considered
repeatable.  This list is defined in the variable
<code>devil-repeatable-keys</code>.  Type <code>C-h v devil-repeatable-keys RET</code> to
view this list.  For example, consider the repeatable key sequence <code>%k
p</code> in this list.  Assuming that the default Devil and Emacs key
bindings have not been changed, this means that after we type <code>C-p</code>
and move the cursor to the previous line, we can repeat this operation
by typing <code>p</code> over and over again.  The repetition occurs as long as
the last character of the repeatable key sequence is typed over and
over again.  Typing any other key stops the repetition and the default
behaviour of the other key is then observed.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to make all key sequences repeatable by setting the
variable <code>devil-all-keys-repeatable</code> to <code>t</code>.  Here is an example
configuration:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require &#39;devil)
(setq devil-all-keys-repeatable t)
(global-devil-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now all every Devil key sequence that ends up executing an Emacs
command can be repeated by merely repeating the last character of the
key sequence.  The list in <code>devil-repeatable-keys</code> is ignored.
</p>

<p>
Note that only Devil key sequences that get translated to a regular
Emacs key sequence and result in the execution of an Emacs command can
be repeatable.  The special keys defined in <code>devil-special-keys</code> are
never repeatable.

<div id="outline-container-why">
<h2 id="why">Why?<a href="#why"></a></h2>
<div id="text-why">
<p>
Why go to the trouble of creating and using something like this?  Why
not just remap <code>caps lock</code> to <code>ctrl</code> like every other sane person
does?  Or if it is so important to avoid modifier keys, why not use
something like God mode or Evil mode?
</p>

<p>
Well, for one, both God mode and Evil mode are modal editing modes.
Devil, on the other hand, provides a modeless editing experience of
Emacs as possible.
</p>

<p>
Devil mode began as a fun little tiny experiment.  From the outset, it
was clear that using something as crucial as the comma for specifying
the modifier key is asking for trouble.  However, I still wanted to
see how far I could go with it.  It turned out that in a matter of
days, I was using it full-time for all of my Emacs usage.
</p>

<p>
This experiment was partly motivated by Macbook keyboards which do not
have a right <code>ctrl</code> key.  Being a touch-typist myself, I found it
inconvenient to type key combinations like <code>C-x</code>, <code>C-a</code>, <code>C-w</code>, <code>C-s</code>,
etc.  where both the modifier key and the modified key need to be
pressed with the left hand fingers.  I am not particularly fond of
remapping caps lock to behave like <code>ctrl</code> because that still suffers
from the problem that key combinations like <code>C-x</code>, <code>C-a</code> require
pressing both the modifier key and the modified key with the left hand
fingers.  I know many people remap both their <code>caps lock</code> and <code>enter</code>
to behave like <code>ctrl</code>.  While I think that is a fine solution, I was
not willing to put up with the work required to make that work
seamlessly across all the various operating systems I work on.
</p>

<p>
What began as a tiny whimsical experiment a few years ago turned out
to be quite effective, at least to me.  I like that this solution is
implemented purely as Elisp and therefore does not have any external
dependency.  I am sharing this solution here in the form of a minor
mode, just in case, there is someone out there who might find this
useful too.

<div id="outline-container-comparison-with-god-mode">
<h2 id="comparison-with-god-mode">Comparison with God Mode<a href="#comparison-with-god-mode"></a></h2>
<div id="text-comparison-with-god-mode">
<p>
God mode provides a modal editing experience but Devil does not.
Devil has the same underlying philosophy as that of God mode, i.e.,
the user should not have to learn new key bindings.  However, Devil
does not have a hard separation between insert mode and command mode
like God mode has.  Instead, Devil waits for an activation key (<code>,</code> by
default) and as soon as it is activated, it intercepts and translates
keys, runs the corresponding command, and then gets out of the way.
So Devil tries to retain the modeless editing experience of vanilla
Emacs as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
Now it is worth mentioning that some of this modeless editing
experience can be reproduced in god-mode too using its
<code>god-execute-with-current-bindings</code> function.  Here is an example:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(global-set-key (kbd &#34;,&#34;) #&#39;god-execute-with-current-bindings)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With this configuration, God mode translates <code>, x f</code> to <code>C-x C-f</code>.
Similarly <code>, g x</code> invokes <code>M-x</code> and <code>, G s</code> invokes <code>C-M-x</code>.  This
provides a modeless editing experience in God mode too.  However, this
experience does not extend seamlessly to minibuffers.  Devil does
extend its Devil key translation to minibuffers.
</p>

<p>
Further note that in God mode the <code>ctrl</code> modifier has sticky
behaviour, i.e., the modifier remains active automatically for the
entire key sequence.  Therefore in the above example, we type <code>,</code> only
once while typing <code>, x f</code> to invoke <code>C-x C-f</code>.  However, this sticky
behaviour implies that we need some way to disambiguate between key
sequences like <code>C-x C-f</code> (find-file) and <code>C-x o</code> (set-fill-column).
God mode solves this by introducing <code>SPC</code> to deactivate the modifier,
e.g., <code>x f</code> translates to <code>C-x C-f</code> but <code>x SPC o</code> translates to <code>C-x
o</code>.  Devil does not treat the modifier key as sticky which leads to
simpler key sequences at the cost of a little additional typing, i.e.,
<code>, x , o</code> translates to <code>C-x C-o</code> and <code>, x o</code> translates to <code>C-x o</code>.
</p>

<p>
To summarize, there are primarily three things that Devil does
differently:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a modeless editing experience from the outset.</li>
<li>Seamlessly extend the same editing experience to minibuffer,
incremental search, etc.</li>
<li>Translate key sequences using string replacements.  This allows for
arbitrary and sophisticated key translations for the adventurous.</li>
<li>Choose non-sticky behaviour for the modifier keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These differences could make Devil easier to use than God mode for
some people but clumsy for other people.  It depends on one&#39;s tastes
and preferences.
