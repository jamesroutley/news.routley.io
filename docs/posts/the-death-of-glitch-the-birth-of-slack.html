    <h1>The death of Glitch, the birth of Slack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><em>[This post is about the day that Glitch failed, and how that failure created the opportunity to make Slack. We&#39;re sharing it here (out of chronological order) to mark 12 years since the famous pivot.]</em></p><p>“We have to shut down the game.” Stewart Butterfield said. </p><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/571/i/88b0402b9e319f66832463ebd4ad6f4a38d73e4dce768b56534076a592d13cef/sad_glitch_girl.v1520324239.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="571" height="355"/></figure><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/191/i/6800e2388f5cff5cf265c8421b59967eed56a567af17f6cccf30f259d6cbb26e/npc_forehorseman__x1_idle_quality10_positioned_loop_1354918064.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="191" height="202"/><figcaption><span>The Town Crier</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/58/i/08872de3412f62c7b6cf8f149f82aff5f3b4267c0a21da346838dfe524343584/npc_squid_variant_squidBlue_x1_move_quality10_loop_1355429392.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="58" height="71"/><figcaption><b><strong>Zzybzfrx.</strong></b><span> A creature as mysterious as it is legless, Zzybzfrx knows what you have seen, and where you have been, and will never tell a soul.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/155/i/8c862443f3f244ab1348285f5a5f985fe019cb6bf14a44f03a5f854e4ba78ddc/npc_cooking_vendor__x1_walk_right_quality10_loop_1355206864.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="155" height="211"/><figcaption><b><strong>Meal Vendor.</strong></b><span> A friend indeed to a miner in need, Monsieur de Nomdenoms is a purveyor of high-end food for those in the deeps who need energy fast - and are willing to pay handsomely for it.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vuDYhczbqEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Glitch: Game of Giant Imagination"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Glitch: A Game of Giant Imagination</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It also meant a great deal to those who discovered and adopted it. It was an online place with a unique community. Glitch’s players identified with the game’s pervasive sense of humour, its gentle pace, and its weirdness. Mostly, they identified with each other and came to pass the time and make something new together. There was no way to win the game. And because of that, you couldn’t lose.<br/></p><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/105/i/cabad164a7ceaa8ed45ae46b4b2ba2a7d5da8efcef92c5a359f865c5dfcfee2d/npc_crab__x1_like_off_quality10_loop_1354830394.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="105" height="110"/><figcaption><b><strong>Crab.</strong></b><span> Anyone knows music makes crabs happy, but it takes an expert DJ to satiate both the appetite for variety and yen for classic tunes it desires.

He only suffers two flaws: fear of noodles (apparently he doesn&#39;t like the way they slither), and a tendency to get trapped in caves.</span></figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>“I don’t know what you and the other executives have planned for this company, but I know that my ability to contribute has dwindled to near-nothing, and not entirely because of my advancing age,” </em>Butterfield wrote. <em>“I will be spending more time with my family, tending to my small but growing alpaca herd and, of course, getting back to working with tin, my first love.”</em><br/></blockquote><p>Five years after launching Flickr, Butterfield found himself back in Vancouver. Shortly thereafter, his co-founders Cal Henderson, Eric Costello, and Serguei Mourachov would leave Yahoo to join him in his new venture: the humbly named Tiny Speck. This time, he thought, they would make the game work.</p><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/1388/i/2a849885af0ad0f34995b6aa66c7aac58ec0f39399225717efa27a9597898f6e/Screen-Shot-2022-11-17-at-1.06.37-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1388" height="632"/><figcaption><span>The Rook</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Stewart and I arrived back in the office that November morning in 2012, I looked around at my colleagues as they drifted in. As a gaming startup, hours were characteristically shifted. Many folks preferred to work late and sleep in, nursing productivity out of the creative hours after sunset. I hung my rain-beaded jacket beside the enormous amethyst geode that stood by the front door.</p><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/76/i/041733c9564cf7e127b396677b671494c934bdf0c3ddc9404ecb7b9fcc3699a6/npc_dustbunny__x1_walk_quality10_loop_1355342894.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="76" height="56"/><figcaption><span>Dust Bunny.

We ordered pizza. Everybody stayed at the office. People hugged and cried and shared stories. Someone suggested releasing all of our half-baked experiments and unfinished features to our players. This idea took hold and the creative wheels started spinning. The afternoon and evening had the mood of a family wake for a lost loved one.</p><figure><img src="https://cortex.persona.co/w/640/i/b033431caa2e7f00e4bb6f50cd9172a7cd87d1b1af70b06b21954b1528d9d4e4/994_01b251aab6_s.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="640" height="431"/><figcaption><span>Stoot Barfield watches the sun set on Ur.</span></figcaption></figure><hr/><p><em>A version of this post was originally published on </em><a href="https://www.johnnyrodgers.is/?ref=buildingslack.com"><em>https://www.johnnyrodgers.is/</em></a><em>.</em></p>
