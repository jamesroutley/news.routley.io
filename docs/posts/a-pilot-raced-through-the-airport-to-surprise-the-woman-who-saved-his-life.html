            It had been four years since they’d last visited in person. And eight years, almost exactly, since the budding scientist – on the darkest day of the year – had given the commercial airline pilot a gift that would link the two for life.

            Back then, United Airlines Capt. David Whitson had been facing a devastating diagnosis: acute myeloid leukemia. Healthy blood could bring the husband and father back from the brink. But even his brother’s didn’t match closely enough.

            Since then, Allie and David had met in person. They’d linked up on social media. And in gratitude for her priceless gift, David had added Allie to his United Airlines travel benefits so she “travels like my children or my family do,” the pilot told CNN.

            Advancements in acute myeloid leukemia treatment have significantly improved remission rates, according to the National Cancer Institute. Nowadays, most transplants use stem cells from donor blood – rather than bone marrow – in a much less complicated process, according to the <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22567-stem-cell-transplants" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a>.

            But finding a donor match can be challenging: Only about 30% of patients have a relative who can donate; for the rest, doctors search national and international donor registries<strong>,</strong> according to the <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24387-bone-marrow-donation" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a>.

            Four years earlier, as an 18-year-old behavioral sciences undergrad, she had helped organize the Purdue University Dance Marathon to raise money for an Indiana children’s hospital.

            When Allie learned her blood matched someone in need, she was excited. “I really wanted to be able to help someone in this type of way,” she told CNN, “and I think that’s also because of my interest in public health and my interest in medicine.”

            The two eventually were introduced to each other by the donor program in March 2018. And in August 2018, David and Allie finally met in person for the first time at an event hosted by Baylor Medical Center. After an onstage Q&amp;A session for patients and staff, Allie and her parents and David and his family went out to lunch.

            David still gets emotional about it. “It’s still overwhelming to me that a stranger would take the time to save my life,” he said. “It just gave me hope.”

            The pair would catch up every year on the anniversary of David’s transplant, said Allie, who donated peripheral blood stem cells again in 2018 to a different recipient and has encouraged others to consider joining the bone marrow registry.

            Beyond that, as a small token of his thanks, David shared his travel benefits with Allie. “It’s the least that I could do,” he explained. “She saved my life.”

            Owing to account notifications, David from time to time surprises Allie at an airport where they both happen to be, he said. She’s now 30, with a Ph.D. and a job as a cancer prevention public health researcher at the University of California, Davis, emphasizing the importance of preventive health care, including regular doctor visits, stress management and a healthy lifestyle, she said.
