            <p>A Development Container (or Dev Container for short) allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud.</p>

            <p>The Development Containers Specification seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option â€“ so that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and testing. Beyond the specification&#39;s core metadata, the spec also enables developers to quickly share and reuse container setup steps through <a href="https://containers.dev/features" aria-label="See the Dev Container Features spec">Dev Container Features</a> and <a href="https://containers.dev/templates" aria-label="See the Dev Container Templates spec">Templates</a>. </p>
