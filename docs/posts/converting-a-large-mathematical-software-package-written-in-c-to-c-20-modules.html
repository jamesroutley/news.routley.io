            <span>Abstract:</span>Mathematical software has traditionally been built in the form of &#34;packages&#34; that build on each other. A substantial fraction of these packages is written in C++ and, as a consequence, the interface of a package is described in the form of header files that downstream packages and applications can then #include. C++ has inherited this approach towards exporting interfaces from C, but the approach is clunky, unreliable, and slow. As a consequence, C++20 has introduced a &#34;module&#34; system in which packages explicitly export declarations and code that compilers then store in machine-readable form and that downstream users can &#34;import&#34; -- a system in line with what many other programming languages have used for decades.
