    <h1>Meta&#39;s Mandatory Return to Office Is &#39;A Mess&#39;</h1>

                                  <ul><li>The company formerly known as Facebook is now enforcing an RTO mandate of 3 days a week.</li><li>Workers said there&#39;s not enough office space or privacy. They must comply or be fired.</li><li>Many have applied to be remote. Until OKd, office work is required, even when teams are elsewhere.</li></ul><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-rehiring-workers-from-layoffs-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Meta</a>&#39;s return to office mandate has gone about as well as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-losses-top-40-billion-suddenly-ok-meta-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">metaverse</a> so far.</p><p>As of September 5, effectively all of the roughly 65,000 workers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-layoffs-second-round-job-cuts-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>still employed</u></a> by the company are required to be in an office at least three days a week. Attendance is tracked daily and failure to comply could lead to an employee <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/all-rules-of-metas-new-aggressive-strict-rto-mandate-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>being fired</u></a>.</p><p>So, thousands of Meta employees have trekked back to offices. They&#39;ve been met a lack of space and privacy, along with productivity challenges, after a sudden shift away from what were very pro-remote work policies.</p><p><span></span><span><p>&#34;It&#39;s a mess,&#34; one current employee said of Meta&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-forced-rto-tracking-employee-office-attendance-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">RTO</a> so far. &#34;And all of this because it&#39;s difficult to remote onboard new hires. Instead of solving that problem, they just decided let&#39;s go back to exactly how it was before.&#34;</p><h2>Sitting on the floor</h2><p>One consistent problem is a lack of conference rooms to have team meetings, according to three employees. Sources asked not to be identified because they&#39;re not authorized to speak to the press.</p><p>All noted that this was also an issue at Meta in 2019, prior to the pandemic ushering in a wave of white collar jobs being done from home. But the company had fewer employees then.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s a challenge to get a conference room at all, the people said, much less one large enough for an entire team to meet for an hour or two.</p><p>One person noted that, after days of trying to get a room for a meeting at Meta&#39;s campus in Menlo Park, a small room became available. The person jumped on it, although most of the team ended up sitting on the floor as they worked through an issue during the meeting, given a lack of chairs and table space.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve worked to address this with more collaborative spaces and workstations that allow for video calls and focused work,&#34; a Meta spokesman said. &#34;It&#39;s important to note that we have roughly 80 offices around the world and our working to make sure our teams have the best experience possible as we welcome people back to the office.&#34;</p><h2>Hot desks</h2><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

                          </figure><p>&#34;We have not yet figured out hybrid work,&#34; Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote on Threads. &#34;Assigned desks mean lots of empty chairs. Hotel desks mean lots of unfamiliar faces. Pods are good for privacy but take up a ton of space. We have a lot to figure out.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Hot desks,&#34; as they&#39;re known, are unassigned desks that need to be booked in advance. Meta last year said it would move to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-offices-move-to-desk-sharing-as-closures-cost-cuts-mount-2022-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>partial desk sharing model</u></a> in its offices for people who continued to work from home a majority of the time.</p><p>With RTO, some people who were effectively working from home full-time and lost assigned desks, as well as those who officially became remote workers and gave them up, are struggling to get and keep desks when they do need to come into the office.</p><p>&#34;It seems impossible to get one desk for a long enough period,&#34; one employee said. The person noted one day having to go between hot desks at Menlo Park on different floors to get through a work day in which they&#39;d been required to come in for meetings. </p><p>The Meta spokesman said any issues with hot desking should be resolved if desks are booked properly through Meta&#39;s online desk reservation system, which lets a person book a desk a week in advance for up to three days in a row.</p><h2>&#34;No one is quitting&#34;</h2><p>Such frustrations are not leading to resignations, though.</p><p>&#34;No one is quitting,&#34; one employee said. Most people are trying to do what they can to stay employed, the person noted, especially given how tough half-year performance reviews were, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-doubles-target-lowest-performance-ratings-non-regrettable-attrition-2022-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>continued mandate</u></a> that team leaders decide that 14.5% to 16.5% of their workers are in the lower performance categories of &#34;meets most&#34; expectations and &#34;needs support.&#34; The other categories at Meta for performance expectations are &#34;redefines,&#34; &#34;greatly exceeds,&#34; &#34;exceeds,&#34; and &#34;meets all.&#34;</p><p>&#34;They made it almost impossible to get an &#39;exceeds,&#39;&#34; an employee said of half-year reviews that ended in early summer. &#34;The next round will be interesting.&#34;</p><h2>Applications to be permanently remote</h2><p>Meta lets anyone who has worked at the company for 18 months or more to apply to become a permanent remote worker, under the new RTO policy. Many employees have, although the approval process seems to be slow.</p><p>&#34;Hundreds of people have applied and not heard back yet,&#34; an employee said. They assume the backlog of remote work applications to be &#34;in the thousands.&#34;</p><p>According to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-rto-policy-updates-stricter-mandate-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""><u>note on RTO from Lori Goler</u></a>, Meta&#39;s head of HR, remote work applications received since the mandate was announced in late August will not be reviewed until the end of October. Then, applications will be reviewed monthly.</p><p>Until those applications are approved, everyone with an assigned office is required to appear three days a week, regardless of how their team is distributed.</p><h2>Coming in to be on Zoom</h2><p>One employee noted their team is mostly in other offices. That effectively means their mandatory in-office work is the same as working from home. Except with a commute.</p><p>Others are in the same boat, at least for several more weeks, as they wait for remote work applications to be approved.</p><p>&#34;People are just coming into the office to be on Zoom,&#34; the employee said. &#34;Why?&#34;</p><p><em>Are you a Meta employee or someone else with insight to share?
