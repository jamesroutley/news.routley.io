<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/07/comma-ai-launches-an-88-universal-car-interface-called-panda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched</a> our first product, the panda, in 2017. Initial sales were great, then quickly trailed off.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and we have a <a href="https://comma.ai/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">real product</a> that users love, built in our own factory, with great unit economics, and a real supply chain. (Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFjssb7r_uU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">factory tour</a> if you haven’t seen it.)</p>

<p>As I write this, we’re finalizing construction plans to max out our office’s datacenter and manufacturing capacity next month.</p>
<p>I’m optimistic 2025 will be comma’s biggest year yet. We’ve had the second largest fleet after Tesla for a while now, and with a <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/autonomy/#world-model-as-a-simulator">training architecture able to take advantage of it</a>, we’re leveraging that fleet to massively scale up data ingestion, processing, and training compute.</p>

<p><em>PS: autonomy, product, and operations are all <a href="https://comma.ai/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hiring</a>, including interns.</em></p></section>
