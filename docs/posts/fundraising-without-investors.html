    <h1>Fundraising Without Investors</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/08/fundraising_without_investors.jpg" alt="Fundraising Without Investors"><p><em>This is Part 3 in a <a href="https://commoncog.com/capital-expertise-in-business-series/">series on the expertise of capital in business</a>. You may read the previous part <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-skill-of-capital/">here</a>.</em></p><p>Many of the stories we&#x2019;ll examine in the Capital series will focus on business &#x2018;in the large&#x2019; &#x2014; stories like Dell, fighting courtroom battles against intransigent activist investors or executing complicated financial moves in liquid capital markets. But today&#x2019;s essay is different. I want to tell two stories about Capital expertise in the small. Both stories are personal, but help explain why I found DiBello&#x2019;s triad model of business expertise so compelling when I first discovered it.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve not told them before because both stories involved competitive advantages that we used in my previous company. But I think enough time has passed now (and things have changed sufficiently) that it&#x2019;s ok to tell these stories today.</p><p>Generic business advice is often generic because you can&#x2019;t ground it in the gritty details of a real world story. So &#x2014; as with most useful business stories, the set up for this one is a little involved. But I think you&#x2019;ll see why this is relevant in a short bit.</p><h2 id="a-distorted-market">A Distorted Market</h2><p>Over the course of late 2014 to the end of 2017, I helped my old boss bootstrap a Point of Sales company from nothing to S$4.5 million in annual revenue. I&#x2019;ve referenced this story in multiple essays on this blog over the years. What I never explained was how we did it.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s back up a little. When I first joined my boss&#x2019;s company, we didn&#x2019;t make Point of Sales systems. We didn&#x2019;t make anything, in fact; no: we were a dev shop. We charged clients in Singapore slightly below market rates for iOS and Android apps, and we did that because we could afford to &#x2014; our software engineers were, after all, based out of Vietnam. I was hired to help my boss shift the company from consulting to product.</p><p>I failed. That I failed isn&#x2019;t really a surprise &#x2014; as anyone who&#x2019;s attempted should know, trying to switch from services to product is a terribly difficult thing to do. There are nearly no overlap in skills. We built three &#x2018;products&#x2019; in three months &#x2014; all of which got little to no traction &#x2014; and then we ran out of buffer money. We switched back to app development to keep the lights on.</p>
