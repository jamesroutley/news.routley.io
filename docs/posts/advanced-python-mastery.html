            <p>Hola! Welcome back to my journey at Recurse Center as I recount the ups and downs of Week 3. This week was a rollercoaster ride of challenges, self-reflection, and unexpected detours. So grab a cup of your favorite cafecito and join me as I share my experiences and lessons learned.</p>



<p>Week 3 presented me with its fair share of obstacles, leaving me feeling like I had accomplished almost nothing. Each day brought new challenges that seemed to grow increasingly difficult to overcome. Time management became a significant struggle, and I found myself unsure of where my time was disappearing. Despite my efforts, my goals remained elusive, and I felt a sense of frustration.</p>



<p>Amidst the challenges, there were still moments of personal success worth celebrating. I prioritized my health and that of my family by visiting the doctor together. It&#39;s crucial to acknowledge the importance of self-care and supporting loved ones during such times. Additionally, I had an engaging meeting with fellow artists to discuss dancing and explore the creation of our customized chatbots. These moments of connection and collaboration remind me of the power of combining passions and creativity.</p>



<p>This week, I made time to enjoy the rich tapestry of my local culture. I went out multiple nights, including two special outings with my mom to the theater for the Bienal of Sound. It was a delightful experience that allowed me to immerse myself in the arts and savor the beauty of our local traditions. Additionally, I had the pleasure of finishing a book called &#34;Love in Color,&#34; adding a literary escape to my week&#39;s adventures.</p>



<p>Amidst my journey, I had the opportunity to connect with a fellow Recurser who is working on creating her own LLMs. Our coffee chat provided a sense of solidarity as we discussed the overwhelming nature of working with AI and the constant influx of information. It was a comforting reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that finding a starting point can be a challenge in itself.</p>



<p>Looking back on this not-so-productive week, I&#39;ve gained valuable insights. It became evident that a lack of organization, my ADHD, a dip in motivation, and some skill gaps acted as blockers. Additionally, external factors such as hospital visits further complicated matters. However, these challenges have provided clarity on the importance of self-care and setting realistic expectations. Resting on weekends, free from responsibilities, and indulging in personal enjoyment will be key to maintaining balance.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I am determined to plan my weeks ahead, setting both weekly and daily goals. I also recognize the need to track my time better, as it seemed to slip away unnoticed. While I missed participating in the &#34;Impossible Day&#34; event, I&#39;ve come to understand that many aspects of coding, although not impossible, require time, patience, and perseverance to master.</p>

<p>As Week 3 comes to a close, I find solace in knowing that a fresh start awaits in Week 4, brimming with new possibilities and opportunities.</p>

<p>Join me next time as I embark on a renewed journey, determined to overcome challenges, seize opportunities, and continue embracing the beautiful chaos of Recurse Center.</p>

<p>¡Hasta la próxima!</p>
