    <h1>Ask HN: Stubhub buying their own tickets under fake names?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I just sold three tickets on Stubhub for a concert I won&#39;t be able to make this weekend.</p><p>When I went to transfer them on Ticketmaster I noticed that the domain the email address was at for all of them appeared to be the names of businesses, but none of them had websites or any presence in google when I searched for them.</p><p>Being the curious person I am, I then went and looked up the WHOIS for the domain. They all were registered in the last six months, supposedly by Stubhub itself (nobody actually verifies the accuracy of WHOIS data though, its all an honor system)</p><p>It seems to me like there is probably a hustle going on, where someone is buying tickets under fake names and flipping them. Is this something Stubhub is known to do (SeatGeek pretty openly does it with their return program). Or is lying on the whois part of a larger scheme someone runs?</p><p>P.S.</p><p>If anyone is curious, the email domains were crimsonhillpartners.com , oneclassic.org , and ambercovecapital.com</p></div></div></div>
