As population growth surged and people moved to urban areas en masse, American cities began to dump sewage in the same rivers that provided their drinking water. After epidemiologists linked typhoid outbreaks to water cleanliness, cities began building large-scale sand filtration systems in the 1890s, and in 1908, Jersey City pioneered the first continuous chlorination of a public water supply. By the 1920s, typhoid deaths had fallen by two-thirds, and waterborne diseases were in retreat across the country.</p><p>While typhoid and other waterborne diseases triggered vast engineering and regulatory responses, the equivalent airborne threats have not. Tuberculosis alone kills more than a million people every year around the world, yet the air in schools, clinics, and public buildings remains largely unfiltered and unmonitored. Covid-19, which killed over seven million people, demonstrated how rapidly airborne pathogens can spread in poorly ventilated spaces.</p><p>Just as filtration and chlorination made drinking water safe at scale, we now have the tools to do the same for indoor air: ventilation, high-quality filters, and germicidal light. A century ago, germicidal light at 254 nanometers seemed to be a promising way of controlling pathogens by killing them in the air, but it turned out to cause irritation and cancer in the skin, and it was largely dropped when antibiotics became widespread.</p><p>But today there is an update that has none of these drawbacks. We now know that wavelengths under 230 nanometers, especially 222 nanometer light, are harmless to humans, but can still disable microscopic pathogens. We know how to filter out all wavelengths except the ones we want, and how to direct them away from humans, cycling the air through them to clean it without exposing people to it, just in case it carries unknown risks. This far-UVC light, as it is called, may be how we can make the air we breathe as safe as the water we drink.</p><p><span>Until the mid-nineteenth century, most physicians believed that disease spread through </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/miasma-theory" rel="">miasmas</a><span>, poisonous vapors rising from filth and decay. Contemporaries were obsessed with air: moving to the countryside for the air, taking the air at the seaside. Bad air was blamed for sickness. Herbs were burned to purify the air to fight the plague. But because they didn’t understand what made the air dirty, they were not very good at cleaning it. This began to change only when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch provided the first definitive proof that microscopic organisms were responsible for infectious disease.</span></p><p>Cleaning air relies on the same fundamental techniques as cleaning water: replacement, filtration, and disinfection. Pathogens replicate inside people, who then expel them into the air by breathing, talking, or coughing, where they can remain suspended and infect new individuals. The relative contributions of aerosol transmission, droplet transmission, and fomite (surface) transmission vary between diseases. Certain diseases, such as Covid-19, are driven by a small number of highly infectious individuals (‘superspreaders’) that account for a disproportionate number of cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalhealthdelivery.org/files/ghd_dubai/files/history_of_uvg_radiation_reed.pdf" rel="">In 1877</a><span>, British researchers Arthur Downes and Thomas Blunt stumbled upon a discovery that would lay the groundwork for modern disinfection. In </span><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rspl.1877.0068" rel="">a paper</a><span> submitted to the Royal Society of London, they described how over the course of six months they had used sunlight to prevent bacteria from growing in a tube.</span></p><p><span>Follow-up research by Robert Koch demonstrated that sunlight could kill </span><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em><span>, but the early experiments lacked precision.

In 1901, American electrical engineer Peter Cooper Hewitt </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US682692" rel="">patented</a><span> the first mercury-vapor lamp to achieve widespread commercial success. Hewitt created a voltage difference across electrodes in a glass tube, with mercury vapor causing electrons to separate from mercury atoms and collide with other atoms, exciting them to higher energy states. When these excited atoms return to their ground state, they release energy as photons, primarily at a wavelength of 254 nanometers.</span></p><p><span>Nucleic acids absorb this 254-nanometer light and produce new bonds between bases, preventing DNA/RNA replication.

Today’s systems do this by projecting beams across the upper level of a room, above the heads of occupants. Natural circulation patterns move air to the ceiling, where it is cleaned, before it falls back down. But even reflected beams can cause irritation, meaning that each installation has to be calibrated carefully for the specifics of the room. Even repainting or shifting furniture can change the reflection of the beams, meaning that the UV beams would need to be recalibrated.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png" width="1024" height="716" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:716,&#34;width&#34;:1024,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Shorter-wavelength light </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39828932/" rel="">works</a><span> just as </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-57441-z" rel="">effectively, without many of the downsides. </a><span>Light with a wavelength of 230 nanometers or lower, known as ‘far-UVC’, disables pathogens without hurting humans, but mercury lamps cannot produce it.</span></p><p><span>Unlike longer wavelengths, far-UVC penetrates weakly, meaning it is only absorbed by the uppermost layers of the skin and eye, tissues which slough off frequently and do not divide.

Consumer far-UVC systems are often considerably more expensive – a </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technologies-Krypton-36-222nm-Ceiling-Cleaner/dp/B0CPNJBNNL" rel="">typical example</a><span> costs $2,500 for a lamp covering 1,000 square feet, although a </span><a href="https://aerolamp.net/" rel="">newer model</a><span> has recently come to market at $600, and </span><a href="https://cybernightmarket.com/" rel="">less expensive lamps</a><span> with lower output can be added together to cover a similar floorspace.</span></p><p>The drawbacks of ventilation-based air filtration methods are similar to the drawbacks of ventilation itself. Moving air from place to place and forcing it through a fine filter requires energy, and fresh air from outdoors is often at the wrong temperature, requiring extra heating or cooling. Meanwhile, the constant air movement can also chill the air to the point of discomfort, requiring indoor heating. This has obvious impacts on the costs and environmental footprint of buildings.</p><p><span>Doubling the ventilation rate from the US standard minimum in offices could add </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/11/14709#B10-ijerph-12-14709" rel="">up to $40 per person per year</a><span> to building running costs.

Energy recovery units help equalize the temperatures between intake and exhaust air, and can </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/11/14709" rel="">lower these figures by about 60 percent</a><span> (or even more), depending on local climate and system type. However, in Europe, the hurdle is even higher: most buildings have no mechanical ventilation at all, so adapting existing ventilation systems is out of the question. For example, in the UK, </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1019896/cooling-in-uk.pdf" rel="">an engineering review</a><span> found that only five percent of residential buildings were likely to have air conditioning (a proxy for mechanical ventilation) by 2019. By contrast, in the US, </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/air-conditioning-use-emerges-as-one-of-the-key-drivers-of-global-electricity-demand-growth" rel="">about 90 percent</a><span> of residences have air conditioning.</span></p><p>Ventilation comes with another tradeoff: noise. The more air you filter, the harder your fan has to work, the faster it spins, and the louder it gets. Free-standing filtration units can be powerful, quiet, or affordable – but rarely all three at once. Purpose-built ventilation can be made quieter, but quiet movement of a large volume of air requires wide, leak-free ducting, which can increase installation complexity. Real world studies have shown that the noise and discomfort created by even relatively modest free-standing units mean that they are frequently turned down or switched off.</p><p><span>These drawbacks mean that ventilation-based methods lack the power to effectively block transmission of highly infectious pathogens or prevent pandemics. Without UV light, public buildings will require air handling systems akin to those in hospital isolation rooms to comply with current </span><a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/bookstore/ashrae-standard-241-control-of-infectious-aerosols" rel="">infection control </a><span>guidelines. While circumstances vary from place to place, ventilation-based air quality measures quickly become impractical beyond around five air changes per hour, while upper-room UV light can achieve the equivalent of 35 air changes per hour, and far-UVC has the potential to reach well over 100.</span></p><p><span>Despite this, both ventilation and filtration need to be kept in mind as new buildings replace the old. If nothing else, ventilation design is an important </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021850202001179" rel="">factor</a><span> in determining the effectiveness of UV systems; how well air is mixed and how quickly it moves </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670722003663?casa_token=I1CkXXNQmOMAAAAA:ZM2DxrbHI07-zr9Ssqg2LwdcKWFNxncDpbtKiNw8LNx6I4BSlAbSncOlrGnEc7rxEnwEWlDxAQ" rel="">affects the degree</a><span> to which pathogens are exposed to UV light.

It does not alter pathogens in a way that allows resistance to emerge, a serious problem for antibiotics. Instead, it thoroughly damages microbial genomes at random, destroying bacteria and viruses alike, whether they are drug-resistant, vaccine-evasive, or indeed newly emerged.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png" width="1024" height="654" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:654,&#34;width&#34;:1024,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IQbl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb69e24cc-4ea8-49a7-a4b5-dd8f75969d10_1024x654.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The most widely used commercial far-UVC source is a krypton-chloride excimer lamp. ‘Excimer’ is a contraction of ‘excited dimer’,</span><strong> </strong><span>a short-lived, high-energy molecule formed when the krypton and chlorine temporarily bond in an excited state as an electric current is passed through the gas mixture.</span></p><p>Krypton chloride lamps emit mostly 222-nanometer light, produced by the excited dimer decaying to its ground state and releasing the excess energy as a photon. Light at this wavelength is safe for human eyes and skin at doses that efficiently kill germs, but about 10–20 percent of the output consists of longer wavelengths with much lower maximum exposures. To use the lamps in occupied spaces, a filter with multiple layers of quartz and hafnium oxide is used to reflect unwanted wavelengths while allowing 222-nanometer light through.</p><p>Despite its potential, far-UVC has yet to achieve widespread use.</p><p>The very best krypton chloride emitters on the market are reliable, long-lasting, powerful, use little energy, and come with effective optical filters. But the state of the art is not representative. The krypton-chloride lamp industry is plagued by low-quality products with short lifespans that may not even produce any far-UVC light, and could even emit dangerous longer wavelengths. There is no product standard certification for UV lamps.</p><p><span>Top-tier excimer lamps, from reputable manufacturers, are expensive. This is partly due to their inherent complexity but largely from sluggish demand. The key reason is that, notwithstanding their successes in the 1930s, a </span><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/flipping-the-switch-on-far-uvc" rel="">certification vacuum denies buyers an authoritative seal of efficacy</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In part, this is because some of the studies establishing far-UVC’s efficacy aren’t as definitive as they need to be to really move the dial. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MefmQL0fY3o" rel="">One study</a><span> on the impact of germicidal UV installations on tuberculosis transmission in homeless shelters was unsuccessful when the national rate of tuberculosis declined, which meant that the study ended up being too small to detect an effect even in principle.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MefmQL0fY3o" rel="">In another study</a><span>, germicidal UV was installed in hospitals to assess the impact of germicidal UV on flu transmission, but during the course of that study, the hospitals stopped routine flu testing. In a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uadVLEAfjt8" rel="">classroom study</a><span>, not all classrooms had enough electrical sockets to plug in the portable air cleaners required for the study, some teachers turned off the air filters because they were too loud, and some schools didn’t install the germicidal UV devices they were supposed to because there were no legal protections for them for doing so.</span></p><p><span>But there are many other factors as well. Measuring infection control is challenging and seldom undertaken, particularly in public spaces. Epidemiological data is expensive and difficult to gather, and there is currently no way to measure the amount of viable, infectious pathogens in the air in real time. Office attendance can be tracked, but controlling for how users mix outside the office space is immensely difficult, and measuring the real-world effect of small-scale deployments in public areas is almost impossible. Studies aiming to cause deliberate disease transmission in controlled environments have </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32658939/" rel="">failed to work</a><span> in </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.28.25326458v1.full" rel="">practice</a><span> because they have been too small to generate enough infections.</span></p><p>Pathogen-free air and the research that goes into getting it are both, to some extent, public goods: the beneficiaries will mostly be people who haven’t paid for them. Even if a business reduces pathogens in its offices’ air, the biggest upside goes to other people who share spaces with its employees. This could be commuters on the same train, people in shops, or parents whose children attend the same school.</p><p>Despite the lack of clear economic upside, we are already seeing some early adoption among respected institutions: Mount Sinai Hospital, for example, has far-UVC lamps installed in its Cohen Center for Recovery from Complex Chronic Illnesses. Ideally, others would emulate this example, creating a stronger basis for research.</p><p>If one part of the knot were cut, then one of the most promising disease-fighting technologies of our time could finally be employed en masse.</p><p>In the early 1900s, a public health official in Jersey City, John Leal, lost his father to illness likely caused by contaminated drinking water.</p><p>But Leal had an opportunity to prevent such a loss for others: he quietly directed the addition of chlorine to the drinking water supply in Jersey City, hiring engineer George Fuller to design and build a system for dripping a diluted bleach solution into Boonton Reservoir.
