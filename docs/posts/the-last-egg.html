            <p>On June 6, 2023, at 7:13am, we fried our last whole egg on station (over medium, salt and pepper):</p>

            <p>And that’s it until November! Another milestone, another reminder of the unique circumstances of
              South Pole Winter.</p>
            <p>As I talked about in <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/frost">Frost</a>, we have a <em>huge</em> amount of cold storage, and a smaller but still
              significant amount of DNF (Do Not Freeze) storage. The majority of our food is ordered years in advance,
              shipped here in bulk, and deep-frozen until needed.</p>

            <p>Fun fact – when we bring up a tub of ice cream from storage,
              it takes <em>multiple days</em> to carefully warm it to “normal” freezer temperature, so it can be served.
              If you’ve ever tried to serve ice cream that has been stored on dry ice or in a misconfigured
              freezer, you’ll understand the struggle.</p>

            <p>Fresh food (fruit, vegetables, eggs, meat, dairy) does wonders for morale, but unfortunately it has a limited shelf life.
              Over the past few months, we’ve celebrated a number of “lasts”, as our supply continues to
              dwindle. We order enough “freshies” to ensure we can use it all before it goes bad. We won’t have a resupply
              plane until November, and unfortunately there just aren’t a lot of “fresh” foods that will survive the
              interim 8 months.</p>
            <p>The most impactful for me was the end of fresh milk – powdered milk makes for
              disappointing lattes, but I’m doing my best:</p>

            <p>Our galley staff does an amazing job creating delicious meals under challenging circumstances. Even in the
              dead of winter, great food is a consistent highlight of this place. That being said – the difference between
              early-winter and mid-winter meals clearly reflects the difference in availability of fresh ingredients.</p>
            <p>Here’s dinner from February 23. Take note of the fresh ingredients! (Yes I’m eating at my desk, don’t judge,
              we all do it from time to time).</p>

            <p>Compare that with dinner from April 25. Delicious, world-class, created by experts in their field…
              out of ingredients that may have been sitting in cold storage for literally <strong>years</strong>.</p>

            <p>The greenhouse is a volunteer affair, and it yields enough for herbs and the occasional salad! It’s also
              the only place on station with humidity! Since the rest of the station has near-zero humidity, it’s a treat to
              spend time in here.</p>

            <p>Food sustains us, and it’s fascinating to temporarily live in a place that reminds us every day how much
              we take for granted back home.</p>
            <p>We do very well for ourselves, given the circumstances, but the stark
              reality is: we won’t see fresh eggs for another <em>five full months</em>.
              Another facet of this weird, weird adventure at the bottom of the world.</p>
            <p>Until next time!</p>
