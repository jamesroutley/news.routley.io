    <h1>Show HN: My Child&#39;s First Program</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Last night, I introduced my kid to programming. We&#39;d done some stuff with Mindstorms before, but she never really caught the bug for it. But for some reason, last night when I showed her some simple Python scripting to solve math problems and write to the console, she was enthralled.</p><p>After guiding her through a few things, she took the laptop off for a while and then came back with her first program, giggling like a maniac</p><pre><code>    you=&#39;WOW!!!&#39;
    fart=&#39;So many poops!&#39;
    print(you,fart)
</code></pre><p>
I&#39;m pretty proud :D</p></div></div></div>
