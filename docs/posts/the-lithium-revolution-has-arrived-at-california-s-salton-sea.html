    <h1>The lithium revolution has arrived at California&#39;s Salton Sea</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>I’m finally convinced: California’s Imperial Valley will be a major player in the clean energy transition.</p><p>After a dozen years of engineering, permitting and financing, the Australian firm Controlled Thermal Resources is ready to start building a lithium extraction and geothermal power plant at the southern end of the Salton Sea, more than 150 miles southeast of Los Angeles. A groundbreaking ceremony is planned for Friday near the shore of the shrinking desert lake.</p><p>John Podesta, who once served as President Clinton’s chief of staff and is now President Biden’s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-09-02/biden-picks-white-house-veteran-to-run-revived-climate-drive">clean energy advisor</a>, will be at the groundbreaking. When I talked with him ahead of the event, he stressed the importance of the U.S. lessening its reliance on China and other countries for critical minerals such as lithium — and the particular benefits for Imperial County, an agricultural mecca that sits along the U.S.-Mexico border and has some of California’s lowest incomes.</p><p>“The work is going to be done by union labor. These are going to be good jobs,” Podesta said.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-right=""> <ps-newsletter-module data-id="1245" data-module-id="0000018c-173d-d235-a9fe-5fbda0a50003"><div>  <p>You&#39;re reading Boiling Point</p>  </div>  <p>Sammy Roth gets you up to speed on climate change, energy and the environment.

For a bunch of reasons.</b></p><p>Unlike solar panels and wind turbines, geothermal plants can generate pollution-free electricity 24 hours a day by tapping into a powerful pocket of underground heat thousands of feet below the Salton Sea. If we want to transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels and power our homes and businesses with 100% climate-friendly energy, geothermal can help.</p><p><b>Lithium, meanwhile, is a key ingredient in the batteries that power electric cars — and also store solar and wind energy for times when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.</b> And unlike many other lithium mines, Controlled Thermal’s “Hell’s Kitchen” project — and others planned for the Salton Sea region — would do <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-15/drilling-for-white-gold-is-happening-right-now-at-the-salton-sea">little environmental damage</a>.</p><p>But until now, I wasn’t sure whether Hell’s Kitchen would move forward.</p><p>Companies have been trying to resolve the economic and technical barriers to Imperial Valley lithium extraction for years. Some of my first stories for the Desert Sun newspaper, nearly a decade ago, were about Simbol Materials, a startup that claimed it had cracked the code. In 2015, I <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2015/01/11/lithium-plant-bring-jobs-imperial-valley/21612193/" target="_blank">wrote about Simbol’s plans</a> for a lithium plant that would employ 400 construction workers.</p><p>Less than a month later, the company <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2015/02/03/lithium-plans-doubt-simbol-materials-fires-dozens/22828207/" target="_blank">fired most of its staff</a>.</p><p><b>So when I first wrote about Controlled Thermal’s plans </b><a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2016/05/05/salton-sea-dreaming-big-geothermal/83845318/" target="_blank"><b>eight years ago</b></a><b>, I was skeptical.</b> </p><p>Would the company bring down the high up-front costs that had stymied other developers looking to add to the Imperial Valley’s aging fleet of geothermal power plants? And would Controlled Thermal’s lithium extraction plans be foiled by the highly corrosive, superheated underground fluid in which the valuable metal is dissolved, which can degrade equipment?</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c966232/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1749323/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8f2ece/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/33ee509/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8eea78/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"/>     <img alt="Jim Turner, Controlled Thermal&#39;s president, at the company&#39;s drilling site near the Salton Sea in 2022." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60d9094/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b69bfe7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f6f6aab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abb3ee5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c6adfc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" width="1200" height="800" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c6adfc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3648+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F22%2F18%2Fdcac44464217a6d38d068f79a37b%2F1209918-na-0830-repowering-rcg-168.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>  </picture>  <div>   <p>Jim Turner, Controlled Thermal’s president, at the company’s drilling site near the Salton Sea in 2022.</p>   <p>(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)</p>   </div>  </figure></div><p>I kept asking those questions when the company <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-03-18/the-companies-racing-strike-white-gold-california-salton-sea-boiling-point">started moving dirt around</a>, and when it actually <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-15/drilling-for-white-gold-is-happening-right-now-at-the-salton-sea">drilled its first wells</a>. I remained skeptical when General Motors <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2021/07/02/general-motors-partners-salton-sea-lithium-production-electric-vehicles/7841300002/" target="_blank">invested in Hell’s Kitchen</a>, and when auto giant Stellantis agreed to <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2022/06/02/stellantis-buy-lithium-produced-salton-sea-controlled-thermal-resources/7483424001/" target="_blank">buy some of the lithium</a>.</p><p><b>Now, though? With a groundbreaking ceremony on the docket for Hell’s Kitchen and one of the president’s top advisors planning to attend, I’m finally feeling confident that the lithium revolution has arrived at the Salton Sea.</b></p><p>“It’s been a journey, as you know,” Controlled Thermal Chief Executive Rod Colwell told me.</p><p><b>Colwell and his collaborators still have big plans in the works.</b> They envision the project that breaks ground Friday as the first of seven phases, with the potential to eventually produce 175,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide and 350 megawatts of round-the-clock geothermal power. Other companies could add to the haul, with federal researchers estimating last year that the superheated brine deep beneath the Salton Sea contains enough lithium to fuel <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2023-11-28/the-salton-sea-has-even-more-lithium-than-previously-thought-new-report-finds-boiling-point">382 million electric-vehicle batteries</a>.</p><p>But for now, Phase One of Hell’s Kitchen is a long-awaited win. </p><p>The project will produce about 50 megawatts of geothermal power, with the Imperial Irrigation District, the area’s publicly owned electric utility, buying most of it. The rest of the power will fuel on-site operations, helping Controlled Thermal become one of the first major domestic sources of “white gold.” The facility will churn out 25,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually.</p><p>“This is a one-way ticket. It’s official,” Colwell said. “This is full commercial construction.”</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70f4026/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2956x1971+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2F3a%2Fd1733062447d81544c473cf6f349%2Fcalifornia-governor-21254.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2c16c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2956x1971+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2F3a%2Fd1733062447d81544c473cf6f349%2Fcalifornia-governor-21254.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b692bea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2956x1971+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2F3a%2Fd1733062447d81544c473cf6f349%2Fcalifornia-governor-21254.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13fc731/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2956x1971+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2F3a%2Fd1733062447d81544c473cf6f349%2Fcalifornia-governor-21254.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a912f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2956x1971+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2F3a%2Fd1733062447d81544c473cf6f349%2Fcalifornia-governor-21254.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"/>     <img alt="California Gov.

The company has a project labor agreement with organized labor, meaning those jobs will be filled by unionized workers.</p><p>With those jobs in mind, Chris Hannan — president of the politically influential State Building and Construction Trades Council — also plans to attend the Friday groundbreaking. He told me many of the jobs will go to Imperial County residents, some of whom will learn valuable skills through apprenticeship programs and go on to do similar work by the Salton Sea and elsewhere.</p><p><b>“Controlled Thermal Resources is sending a strong signal about doing it the right way,” Hannan said.</b></p><p>All that said, there’s no such thing as a clean energy project without controversy. And Hell’s Kitchen is no exception.</p><p>Before the Imperial County supervisors voted this week to approve the construction permits, they heard from a lawyer for Comite Civico del Valle, an environmental justice group that has raised concerns about potential air and water contamination.</p><p>“The Imperial Valley has a proud tradition of growing the food that feeds America and contributing to the economic growth of the Golden State,” Luis Olmedo, the group’s executive director, <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/opinion/contributors/valley-voice/2023/12/22/imperial-valley-shouldnt-be-a-sacrificial-zone-for-the-clean-energy-revolution/71965748007/" target="_blank">wrote last month</a>. “But that tradition has already come at a cost to the local health and natural environment.
