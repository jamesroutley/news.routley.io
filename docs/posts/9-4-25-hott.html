    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="E-Paper Display Reaches the Realm of LCD Screens"><div><p><a data-linked-post="2656435247" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-e-ink-developed-full-color-epaper" target="_blank">E-paper displays</a> are prized for their readability and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/low-power">low power</a> use, but they’ve long been dismissed as too slow for everyday computing. </p><p>Modos, a two-person startup with open-hardware roots, thinks it has cracked part of that problem with a development kit capable of driving an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-paper">e-paper</a> display at refresh rates up to a record 75 hertz.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/modos-tech/modos-paper-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit</a>, now available for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> on Crowd Supply, combines standard e-paper panels with an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/open-source">open source</a> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fpga" target="_self">FPGA</a>-based display controller. While the kit provides enthusiasts and developers a complete package (with e-paper display, display driver, and hardware adapter), it’s also an entry point for experimenting with different e-paper displays.</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-e-ink-developed-full-color-epaper" target="_blank">How E Ink Developed Full-Color E-paper</a></p><p><span>“I would say instead of our secret sauce, </span><span>we have</span> open sauce<span>,” </span><span>says</span> cofounder <a href="https://alexsoto.dev/" target="_blank">Alexander Soto</a>. “<span>You</span> don’t even need to use the panel <span>we’re</span> offering. You could use a different panel and still get <span>[75 Hz]</span><span>.”</span></p><h2>E-paper at 75 Hz</h2><p>Most e-paper panels update at a refresh rate of around 10 Hz or less. (E-paper is the generic term for screens that mimic the appearance of ink on paper—the most well-known brand being that made by the company E Ink.) Some displays don’t even quote a refresh rate and may require up to a full second to refresh. </p><p>A better refresh rate means a display can show more frames each second, which in turn provides smoother, more lifelike motion. Modern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-video">digital video</a> is usually delivered at 30 or 60 frames per second, which until recently was well beyond the reach of an e-paper display. This is an area where e-paper clearly lags <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lcd">LCD</a> displays, which start at 60 Hz <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computer-display-500-hertz" target="_self">and go up from there</a>.</p><p>Modos is able to hit refresh rates of up to 75 Hz on a 13-inch e-paper panel with a 1,600 by 1,200 resolution. (a 6-inch e-paper panel with 1,448 by 1,072 resolution and the same refresh rate is available, too.) <span>Bumping the refresh rate also reduces latency. That’s a key point, as it allows an e-paper display to be used in situations where latency matters, such as a computer or tablet display.</span></p><p>“A lot of people default to thinking that with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-readers">e-readers</a> or e-paper, it’s slow, it’s going to be flashing all the time,” says Soto. “Our challenge has been going to conferences, going to events, and showing people…e-paper can be very fast.” </p><h2>Open Source E-Paper Display Controller</h2><p>Modos’s quoted 75-Hz refresh rate is the highest yet for an e-paper display, but it’s arguably not the key innovation. Several competitors already <a href="https://shop.dasung.com/products/dasung-paperlike-103-the-worlds-first-60hz-e-ink-monitor?srsltid=AfmBOorlsMmiegZ0giXwX251IS66vU2ndubmx7sO-in0dfuYmove1fdS" target="_blank">offer e-paper displays with refresh rates up to 60 Hz which</a>, though lower, is close. </p><p>But Modos has a not-so-secret weapon: Caster, an open-source e-paper display controller that’s compatible with a wide variety of e-paper panels. The display controller, which is based on the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amd">AMD</a> Spartan-6 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fpga">FPGA</a>, departs from typical e-paper controllers with pixel-level display management. </p><p>“Traditionally, the [e-paper display] controller used a single-state machine to control the entire panel, with only two states: static and updating,” says Modos cofounder <a href="https://github.com/zephray" target="_blank">Wenting Zhang</a>. “Caster treats each pixel individually rather than as a whole panel, which allows localized control on the pixels.”</p><p>The FPGA display controller is paired with Modos’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/glider">Glider</a> Mega Adapter, which includes four different display connectors compatible with several dozen e-paper displays ranging in size from 4.3 to 13 inches. Soto says the adapter can be used to repurpose displays salvaged from older e-readers, like Amazon’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kindle">Kindle</a>.</p><p> <span data-rm-shortcode-id="82b00cdb83e4c7253acea47ddb69f8b5"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_Lqa1FMtpw?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span> <small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A 75-Hz refresh rate allows for smoother scrolling.</small> <small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Modos</small> </p><p>Modos also provides an application <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> interface (API), written in the C programming language, that lets applications select display-driving modes dynamically. As the video above shows, a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/linux">Linux</a> window manager can be used to render text in a low-latency binary color mode, display maps in more detailed yet responsive gray scale, and display video with maximum-fidelity gray scale—all simultaneously on the same screen. </p><p>The code and schematics for Caster, Glider, and the API are open source <a href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs" target="_blank">and available on Github</a>. </p><h2>Crowdfunding for E-paper Innovation</h2><p>Modos’s crowdfunding campaign is set to conclude on <span>18 September. </span>Orders are expected to ship in January of 2026, although (as is often the case for crowdfunded projects) the shipping window is not guaranteed. </p><p>Getting to this stage has taken several years. The company’s founders initially hoped to build an e-paper laptop, the <a href="https://www.modos.tech/blog/modos-paper-laptop" target="_blank">Modos Paper Laptop</a>, which was announced in January of 2022. However, the realities of electronics manufacturing complicated that project early in its life and the laptop was never made available to order. </p><p>“Part of it was that the primary aspect ratio for the majority of [laptop] chassises are for 16:9 and 16:10. And when you look at e-paper displays, it was an aspect ratio of 4:3. So, we either had to make a custom chassis, or a custom panel, both of them being prohibitively expensive,” says Soto.</p><p>Panel sourcing also remains a hurdle. E-paper’s production is geared toward e-readers and signage, which means most panels aren’t the right size for a computer. However, the Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit found a practical compromise in recently introduced 13-inch e-paper displays, many of which provide a resolution similar to LCD and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/oled">OLED</a> panels developed for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/laptops">laptops</a>. </p><p>In this way, the Dev Kit is a continuation of Modos’s original goal. While building a full-fledged e-paper laptop was impractical, the Dev Kit’s high refresh rate, open-source display controller, and API give ambitious users the opportunity to implement their own low-latency e-paper computer display—or anything else they put their mind to.</p><p><em>This article was updated on 8 September 2025 to replace mentions of “E Ink” (the specific e-paper technology developed by the company of the same name) with “e-paper.”</em><br/></p></div></div></div>
