            <span>Abstract:</span>This work focuses on reducing neural network size, which is a major driver of neural network execution time, power consumption, bandwidth, and memory footprint. A key challenge is to reduce size in a manner that can be exploited readily for efficient training and inference without the need for specialized hardware. We propose Self-Compression: a simple, general method that simultaneously achieves two goals: (1) removing redundant weights, and (2) reducing the number of bits required to represent the remaining weights. This is achieved using a generalized loss function to minimize overall network size. In our experiments we demonstrate floating point accuracy with as few as 3% of the bits and 18% of the weights remaining in the network.
