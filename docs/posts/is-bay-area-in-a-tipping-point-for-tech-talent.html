      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Some younger companies like Coinbase[2] and Stripe[1] are sharing numbers that they are not hiring much in the Bay Area anymore.<p>I am assuming that many positions that require the candidate to (eventually) relocate to the Bay Area are not getting a lot of traction. A fried of mine refused to interview for position like that despite being very junior! She decided the cost of living is not worth it.</p><p>What all of this means for the Bay Area talent pool and job market? Talent in the Bay Area are fetching astonishing pay ($600k for L6)[3] which I believe contributed to the out of the ordinary housing market in the Bay Area when you compare it to other cities in CA like San Diego and Los Angeles. I know many older talent have grown roots in the area. They have kids and friends which means they can&#39;t easily move. What if with this new wave of remote work acceptance, Bay Area pay won&#39;t match the expenses? Companies can hire everywhere in the U.S. for arguably the same talent quality. Some companies are even expanding to Mexico City[4] and other countries which might put even more pressure on Bay Area salaries.</p><p>Are we at an end of decades of continues growth and competition in the Bay Area? Will there be big pay adjustments?</p><p>[1] <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1481129589761998857" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/14811295897619988...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1480647701221896195" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1480647701221896195</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://levels.fyi" rel="nofollow">https://levels.fyi</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.lyft.com/careers#openings?location=mexico%2520city%252C%2520mexico" rel="nofollow">https://www.lyft.com/careers#openings?location=mexico%2520ci...</a></p></td></tr>
