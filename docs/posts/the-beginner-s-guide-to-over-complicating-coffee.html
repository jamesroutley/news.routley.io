<p>There’s a scene in AMC’s “<a href="https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Breaking_Bad_Wiki">Breaking
Bad</a>” where Gail Boetticher explains to Walter White <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ83kt4a2-A">how to make the
perfect cup of coffee</a>. And it all sounds so plausible—there’s a
perfect coffee, and science will magic it for us.</p>
<p>That whole idea, scene, and contraption are, of course, <a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/7439/chemistry-behind-gales-coffee-maker-in-breaking-bad">wrong</a>.</p>
<p>But there are real ways to experiment your way towards a more perfect
cup.</p>
<section id="the-quest-for-good-coffee">
<h2>🗺️ The quest for good coffee</h2>
<p>In 1957, a professor of food science at MIT forever changed what we
think of as good coffee.</p>
<p>E.E. Lockhart <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/soluble-solids-in-beverage-coffee-as-an-index-to-cup-quality/oclc/40651254">posited</a>
that coffee flavor is the result of two variables:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How much coffee you use</li>
<li>How much of that coffee dissolves into the final cup (total
dissolved solids—TDS%)</li>
</ol>
<p>Lockhart surveyed a bunch of people to suss out the ideal range for
these values, creating the “Coffee Brewing Control Chart,”—which is
still in use today.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>And you can use Lockhart’s data to better your own brew.</p>

<p>When he was developing the Aeropress, Alan Adler was a frequent
poster on the coffeegeek forums. There he shared the results of his
experiments measuring coffee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190810050548/https://www.coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/machines/203992">using
a simple brix refractometer</a>.</p>
<p>And, unfortunately for everyone in my immediate family—I own one of
those, too!</p>

<h2>🧪 An experiment: finding the ideal grind for the Hario v60</h2>
<p>Over Christmas, I got a Hario v60 pour-over brewer. And I used
science to zero-in on what I think is the perfect grind size.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Methods and Results</strong></p>
<p>I tried to brew two cups of coffee the exact. same. way. Except for
one variable: <strong>the grind</strong>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Variable</th>
<th>Course grind</th>
<th>Fine grind</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Grinder dial setting</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>17</td>

</figure>
<p>This measured difference is obvious, but can I taste a
difference?</p>
<p><strong>Taste and preference</strong></p>
<p>A widely used protocol for figuring out if you can discern a
difference between two products is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_testing#Triangle">triangle
test</a>.</p>
<p>In a triangle test, you present three cups of coffee: two are
identical, one is different. The goal is to pick out the odd cup
consistently (better than random change; i.e., 1/3).</p>
<p>So, I took my two coffees and split them into 3 cups:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 cups: A, B, and C</li>
<li>Cups A &amp; C – <strong>fine grind</strong> (“17”)</li>
<li>Cup B – <strong>course grind</strong> (“22”)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, then I mixed up the cups and tried to pick the odd one out:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Result</th>
<th>Trial</th>
<th>Different cup</th>
<th>Cup I picked</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>❌</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>❌</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✅</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As dramatic as the chart above looks, picking the “different” cup was
tricky. I encourage you to try it—it was a fun experiment.</p>
<p>In the end, I preferred the course grind—it seemed sweeter and fuller
vs. the fine grind. The fine grind coffee was astringent: sharp and
tannic.</p>

<section id="coffee-cognition-theory">
<h2>🍕 Coffee cognition theory</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The theory of pizza cognition tells us that an individual’s first and
primary source of pizza … will become the pizza against which all others
are judged.</p>
<p>– Sam Sifton, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/dining/your-new-favorite-pizza-is-french.html">The
New York Times</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I prefer strong coffee.</p>
<p>But I also prefer a light roast, single-origin coffee.</p>
<p>Much of the science of coffee is about extraction. <strong>But the
art of coffee is hundreds of other choices</strong>: light roast, dark
roast, Ethiopian, Sumatran, dry process, honey process, “<a href="https://briping.com/">briping</a>,” and any other outre preference
folks would find criminal to omit.</p>
<p>So far there have been three waves of coffee in the United
States:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First wave</strong> – Instant coffee. Diner coffee.
Folgers.</li>
<li><strong>Second wave</strong> – Dark roast. Peet’s/Starbucks.</li>
<li><strong>Third wave</strong> – light roast, single origin: Blue
bottle/Stumptown.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I consider “good coffee” is a product of when I started drinking
coffee—smack in the middle of the third wave.</p>
<p>But there’s no perfect coffee, no matter what Gail Boetticher
says.</p>
