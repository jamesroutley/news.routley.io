    <p><SPAN size="2">The leaders of every nation involved in 
    World War II were aware of how crucial oil supplies were to their war plans. 
    The importance of oil had become apparent during the First World War. As 
    armies became more mechanized, the need for secure sources of fuel and 
    lubricants became the <i>sine qua non</i> for military operations. French 
    diplomat Henri Berenger was right when as early as 1921 he explained that, 
    in the next war: &#34;He who owns the oil will own the world, for he will rule 
    the sea by means of the heavy oils, the air by means of the ultra-refined

    </span><b><i>The European Theater: Pre-war Indicators</i></b></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2"><i>&#34;To fight, we must have oil for our 
    machine.&#34;</i> - Adolf Hitler</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">For all his faults as a military 
    strategist, Adolf Hitler must be credited with having as good an 
    understanding of the economic underpinnings of large-scale warfare as anyone 
    in the Nazi high command. Upon his accession to power in 1933, he 
    immediately began a search for methods to increase oil exploration and 
    production.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Between 1933 and 1939, German domestic 
    crude oil production nearly tripled to 4.5 million barrels per year. As was 
    true</SPAN><span> of most countries in western 
    Europe, Germany was rich in coal, but poor in petroleum. Under Hitler&#39;s 
    orders, German engineers began working to produce synthetic fuels, mostly 
    from coal and lignite, at an unprecedented pace. By 1941, synthetic fuel 
    production had reached a level of 31 million barrels per year. Austerity 
    programs were instituted long before the beginning of the war, and fuel 
    bought from the Soviet Union and Romania was stockpiled against future 
    needs.</span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Despite all those measures, though, 
    there simply was not enough oil available in Europe to satisfy the huge 
    requirements of a mechanized force in the service of a country with 
    expansionist aims. A panzer division typically consumed 1,000 gallons 
    (approx. 30 barrels) of fuel per mile traveled. Thus, despite the Draconian 
    measures practiced by the <i>Wehrmacht</i>, it </SPAN><span>
    quickly became clear that optimum German tactics would have to be modified 
    to operate within the limits of available resources. That, as much as any 
    other practical or theoretical factors, led to the conception and practice 
    of the <i>Blitzkrieg</i>.</span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">In fact, it is difficult to really 
    overstate the gap that existed between German army fuel needs and the 
    available supplies. The images of panzers rolling across Poland, the Low 
    Countries and France are etched in our minds as characteristics of the new 
    style of warfare Nazi Germany had created. It is easy to forget those 
    panzers made up only a small part of the entire force, and that the German 
    army was far from fully mechanized.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Though it varied from campaign to 
    campaign and unit to unit, as much as 70 percent of German supply transport 
    remained horse-drawn throughout the war. There were 5,375 horses assigned to 
    each infantry division. In fact, as the war dragged on and petroleum became 
    even more critical, horses became more important to the German war effort 
    rather than less.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Even with only its spearhead forces 
    completely motor-driven, Germany could not wage a long mobile war. Germany 
    needed more oil than it had to power its industries as well as the war 
    machines at the front. Thus, at the strategic level, too, necessity became 
    the mother of invention - the <i>Blitzkrieg</i> was seen as the solution, 
    whereby enemies could be decisively defeated before fuel supplies dried up.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">In 1938, Hitler accomplished the <i>
    Anschluss</i> of Austria with two mobile divisions: the 2nd Panzer Division 
    from Wurzburg, and the S.S. <i>Leibstandarte</i> Division from Berlin. Both 
    units were to drive triumphantly through Austria to Vienna. An omen of what 
    was ahead occurred about halfway through the operation when both columns ran 
    out of gas. Only frantic phone calls to civilian service stations along the 
    route averted what otherwise would have become a public relations disaster 
    for the regime.</SPAN></p>
    <p><b><i>Oil Commandos</i></b></p>
    <p><span>Even before the actual 
    shooting started, therefore, the German high command realized merely 
    conquering </span><SPAN size="2">territory would not be enough to win the 
    war. The fuel supplies of the newly conquered had to be appropriated for 
    German use. The intact capture of enemy oil fields became a primary (and 
    often herculean) task in all their invasions. The opponent could be expected 
    to defend them vigorously, and to attempt to destroy them if forced to 
    retreat.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">It would take a skilled group of 
    engineers and technicians to restore a war-ravaged oil field or refinery. 
    The army high command&#39;s Economics Section prepared for those eventualities 
    by commissioning Maj. Erich Will to form a unit of &#34;oil commandos,&#34; whose 
    mission would be the technical occupation and repair of captured enemy oil 
    facilities.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The first test of the Oil Commandos came 
    in the Polish campaign. A plainclothes team of 50 specialists in petroleum 
    exploration and production accompanied the XXII Corps in its dash across 
    southeastern Poland, with the aim of seizing the oil fields and refineries 
    of Galicia. The blitz began on 1 September 1939, and by the next day one 
    panzer division of XIX Corps had already temporarily run out of gas once, 
    due to a shortage of trucks to carry fuel forward.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The Oil Commandos, however, ran into 
    difficulties of their own. They arrived at the outskirts of the Galician oil 
    fields on 15 September, and set up an office at Jaslo. But by the time the 
    XXII Corps moved ahead to Winniki, the Soviets had entered the picture and 
    occupied the fields ahead of them. Germany ended up capturing only 30 
    percent of Poland&#39;s oil, and had to negotiate with Stalin for an annual sale 
    of oil equivalent to the other 70 percent.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Still, Hitler was well enough pleased 
    with the efforts of his Oil Commandos to expand their numbers&#39; he created 
    the &#34;Technical Oil Brigade,&#34; under Maj. Gen. Erich Homburg. At its peak, the 
    brigade consisted of almost 15,000 men, but smaller groups (called &#34;Kommandos,&#34; 
    or detachments) were sent to the field for specific tasks.</SPAN></p>
    <p><b><i>The War in the West, 1940-41</i></b></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">From a purely fuel standpoint, the fall 
    of France has to be considered the greatest victory of the war for Germany. 
    That is, for the first and only time, Hitler ended a campaign with more oil 
    than he had when he started.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The German army and air force had 
    learned enough from the Polish campaign to build up significant reserves for 
    the war in the West. When that blitz was over, the <i>Wehrmacht</i> had 
    captured more than 20 million barrels of oil from the French,Â  Belgians 
    and Dutch. Since the invaders had used only 12 million barrels through the 
    campaign, the conquests represented a net gain of 8 million barrels. (For 
    reference, though, and to show how precarious the Germans&#39; situation 
    remained, the United States in 1940 produced an average of 4 million barrels
    <i>per day</i>.)</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">During the campaign, the Oil Commandos 
    were deployed to seize the French oil wells at Pechelbronn, in Alsace. On 21 
    June, with the help of French collaborators, they succeeded in doing so 
    without firing a shot. The French demolition squads charged with destroying 
    the machinery were entirely unsuccessful. Not only did the Oil Commandos get 
    the 1.5 million gallons of petroleum in storage there, they returned 
    production to full capacity in a few months.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The same operation yielded an added 
    bonus in the form of economic intelligence. The Technical Oil Brigade&#39;s 
    specialists were able to rifle through the French files for data kept on oil 
    operations and geological surveys in the other countries of Europe. The 
    files on the Soviet Union were of special interest. They were bundled up and 
    sent to Berlin.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Meanwhile, oil also helped decide the 
    Battle of Britain. The Royal Air Force, with access to America&#39;s oil, was 
    able to utilize 100-octane aviation gasoline n its Spitfires and Hurricanes. 
    That improved engine performance, allowing faster takeoffs, quicker bursts 
    of speed, and larger payloads.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The Germans had to choose quantity over 
    quality. Since producing the higher octane aviation gas would necessarily 
    have meant lower output, the <i>Luftwaffe</i> command had 87-octane fuel 
    used in their planes. The resultant deficiencies were most keenly felt in 
    decreased &#34;loiter time.&#34; With reduced engine performance, German aircraft 
    could only remain in British airspace for 15-20 minutes if they were to have 
    enough fuel to return to base. Considering how close a fight the Battle of 
    Britain turned out to be, any increased performance by the <i>Luftwaffe</i> 
    might well have proven critical to the battle&#39;s course.</SPAN></p>
    <p><b><i>A Paradox Arises</i></b></p>
    </SPAN><p><SPAN face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times"><SPAN size="2">Early in 1941, with the formation of the 
    Afrika Korps to save the Italians from defeat in North Africa, the first of 
    many paradoxes to occur in their quest for oil fell upon the Nazis. As they 
    conquered territory after territory they accumulated more oil, but they also 
    took on the responsibility for the oil needs of the new acquisitions. Since 
    each state taken had been a net oil importer, Hitler found the gap between 
    oil supply and demand widening, even while his nation was seemingly winning 
    the war. Nowhere was that dilemma more evident than in the Mediterranean.</SPAN><!--mstheme--></SPAN></p></td>

    <p><b><i>Oil and Barbarossa</i></b></p>
    <p><span>By the end of 1940, 
    Hitler stood astride western Europe, with only Great Britain still actively 
    opposing his designs. The reasons for his turning against the Soviet Union 
    are still debated by scholars today, but clearly oil concerns played at 
    least a part in that decision.</span></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The Soviets had sent over 4.5 million 
    barrels of oil to Hitler before he sent his armies east in Operation 
    Barbarossa. The Soviet Union was at the time the world&#39;s second largest oil 
    producer. Despite strict rationing, however, it still had to import oil from 
    the United States to meet its own needs. It was with a view to securing more 
    oil supplies for himself that Stalin forced Hitler&#39;s acquiescence to his 
    territorial demands in Romania. That was an ill-considered move, however, in 
    that it certainly doomed the Soviet Union to German attack.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Most of Hitler&#39;s crude oil came from the 
    Romanian fields at Ploesti, and Stalin&#39;s border land grab on that nation 
    thus put the Red Army uncomfortably close to critical German supply lines. 
    It was at that point Hitler irreversibly committed his nation to an 
    invasion.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">In a postwar interrogation, Hans Kolbe, 
    a U.S. spy in the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin, offered this 
    assessment: &#34;The German need to obtain Soviet oil was deemed the primary 
    reason for the attack. Since the Soviet deliveries were insufficient to 
    satisfy German needs for bringing the war [in the west] to a conclusion, the 
    only recourse appeared to be the seizure and exploitation by the Germans of 
    the oil resources of the Soviet Union.&#34;</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Of course, Hitler had political and 
    military objectives in his invasion as well, namely the destruction of the 
    Soviet regime and the Red Army. Those objectives came into conflict with the 
    need for oil once the attack began. In his directive of 21 August 1941, 
    Hitler showed clearly what he saw as the critical goal of the invasion: &#34;The 
    most important aim to be reached before the onset of winter is not to 
    capture Moscow, but to seize the Crimea and the industrial and coal region 
    on the Donets, and cut off the Russian oil supply from the Caucasus area.&#34;</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">That latter area was the one from which 
    flowed 84 percent of the oil produced in the entire Soviet Union. An amazing 
    72 percent flowed from around Baku alone, the rest from the smaller 
    complexes at Maikop and Grozny. During the second year of operations in the 
    east, those fields became the primary targets of the German army and the 
    greatly expanded Technical Oil Brigade.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">That still was not the limit of Hitler&#39;s 
    ambitions. Had he won the war on the eastern front, his next big operation 
    would undoubtedly have been one aimed at gaining the oil of the Middle East 
    through pincer attacks launched from the Caucasus and the Balkans, then 
    linking up with the Afrika Korps driving up through Palestine. It was a 
    grandiose scheme, but with the Soviets out of the way it might well have 
    succeeded. Fortunately, though, the next Axis oil paradox came into play 
    before Hitler had any chance to begin such a move.</SPAN></p>
    <p><b><i>The &#39;42 Campaign to the Caucasus</i></b></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Capturing the Caucasus oil fields would 
    require draining dry the accumulated German oil reserves. German planners 
    for the operation concluded that even under the most optimistic projections 
    there was only enough fuel for 60 days of full-on campaigning deeper into 
    the Soviet Union. As with the earlier campaigns against Poland and the West, 
    the 1942 operation had to be a <i>Blitzkreig</i> victory, or else the move 
    would suffer slow oil starvation and eventual defeat. Hitler took the 
    gamble.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Army Group A, along with 6,000 members 
    of the Technical Oil Brigade, was sent crashing toward Baku in July 1942. 
    Army Group B was assigned to protect the flank by crossing the Don River and 
    taking (or at least masking) the city of Stalingrad.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">From the very beginning, the omens were 
    not good. Unlike the earlier situation in the west, capturing Soviet fuel 
    turned out to be useless to the panzers because the Communists ran their 
    tanks on diesel, while the German machines ran on regular gasoline. 
    Therefore Baku had to be not only quickly captured, but its facilities then 
    had to just as quickly be put to use before the <i>Wehrmacht</i> ran dry.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">By the early fall, Maikop was in German 
    hands, and by December oil was once again flowing from it, despite vigorous 
    efforts by Soviet partisans and saboteurs. But Army Group A never reached 
    Grozny or Baku. Hitler lost sight of his material goal and instead fastened 
    on one of only symbolic importance - Stalingrad. He transferred eight 
    divisions from Army Group A to B, and with its drive thus weakened, A was 
    unable to break into the mountains. Neither could it resist the Soviet 
    counterattack when it came, and Maikop had to be given up on 18 January 
    1943.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">A campaign that was supposed to have 
    lasted only weeks had stretched into months, then years. Fully half of 
    Germany&#39;s oil reserves were poured into the eastern front. At the start of 
    the 1942 drive, Hitler said, &#34;If I do not get the oil of Maikop and Grozny, 
    then I must end the war.&#34; He should have taken his own advice.</SPAN></p>
    <p><b><i>The Allies Strike Back</i></b></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The Allies were fully aware of the power 
    of the oil weapon. They kept a close watch on German oil production, even 
    sending teams of experts to examine the crankcase oil of downed <i>Luftwaffe</i> 
    planes to determine the quality of their lubricants. They were also 
    fortunate in having control of a large percentage of the world&#39;s known oil 
    reserves in America, Russia and the Middle East. Yet even they suffered 
    shortages, mostly due to devastating U-boat attacks on Allied tankers.</SPAN></p>
    </SPAN><p><SPAN face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times"><SPAN size="2">By the second half of 1944, once the 
    advancing Red Army had torn Ploesti and its oil fields back out of the Third 
    Reich, Hitler&#39;s forces had become almost entirely dependent on synthetic 
    fuel production. The synthetic fuel facilities became primary Allied bombing 
    targets.</SPAN><span></span><!--mstheme--></SPAN></p></td>

    <p><SPAN size="2">Between May and September 1944, Allied

    in armaments and communications.&#34; By shortly before V-E Day, Germany had

    <p><b><i>The Pacific Theater</i></b></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2"><i>&#34;God was on the side of the 
    nation that had the oil.&#34;</i> - Prof. Wakimura, Tokyo Imperial 
    University</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Halfway around the world from Berlin, 
    another Axis partner initiated a war with the United States for the sake of 
    oil. Japanese imperial ambitions had run headlong into its dependency on the 
    United States for petroleum.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Policymakers in America balked at 
    continuing to sell fuel to the Japanese so the Imperial Army could run 
    roughshod over the Asian mainland. Yet America remained cautious for a time. 
    A pre-war U.S. Navy analysis concluded: &#34;An [oil] embargo would probably 
    result in an early attack by Japan on Malaya and the Netherlands East 
    Indies, and possibly would involve the United States in an early war in the 
    Pacific.&#34;</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The Japanese, meanwhile, stockpiled as 
    much Californian and Mexican crude as possible, even offering to buy 
    outright one potentially oil-rich area of Mexico.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The drive for oil led Japan into the 
    first oil paradox of the Pacific War. The Japanese, fearful of a U.S. oil 
    embargo, sought to diversify their sources by gaining control of 
    oil-producing territories, but it was precisely that policy which eventually 
    led to the embargo.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Like the Germans, the Japanese were 
    aware of their petroleum vulnerability. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, architect 
    of the Pearl Harbor attack, was so concerned about his nation&#39;s lack of 
    crude that at one point he personally sponsored experiments by a &#34;scientist&#34; 
    who claimed to be working on a method to transform water into oil.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">When the trade embargo against Japan was 
    put in place in October 1941, U.S. military planners realized war in the 
    Pacific had become inevitable. But intercepted and deciphered radio traffic 
    led the Americans to believe the Japanese would head straight for the 
    sources of oil in Indonesia and Malaya. The fields in the East Indies 
    yielded 170,000 barrels of crude a day and were only lightly defended. The 
    idea the Japanese might first make a major effort to put the U.S. Navy out 
    of action did not enter most analysts&#39; minds.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">For all their preoccupation with oil, 
    the Japanese overlooked its significance in the one battle where it 
    certainly could have had a decisive impact of the entire war - at Pearl 
    Harbor itself. Fixated on American warships and harbor facilities, the 
    planners never thought to strike the storage tanks that held the fuel supply 
    of the entire U.S. Pacific Fleet.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">After their second wave of attack planes 
    returned to the Japanese carriers, some of the pilots tried to convince 
    their on-site commander, Adm. Nagano, to send a third strike against the 
    base&#39;s repair and oil facilities. But the admiral, who had at times doubted 
    the feasibility of the entire operation, was unwilling to risk another 
    attack. He gathered his winnings and went home; it was a grave error.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Every drop of oil on Oahu had been 
    transported there from California. Adm. Chester Nimitz, later 
    commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet, recalled: &#34;All of the oil for the 
    fleet was in surface tanks at the time of Pearl Harbor. We had about 4.5 
    million barrels of oil out there and all of it was vulnerable to .50 caliber 
    bullets. Had the Japanese destroyed that oil, it would have prolonged the 
    war another two years.&#34;</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Adm. Husband E. Kimmel, who was relieved 
    of his command of the Pacific Fleet after the attack, agreed: &#34;Had [the 
    Japanese] destroyed the oil which was all above ground at the time... it 
    would have forced the withdrawal of the fleet to the [U.S. west] coast 
    because there wasn&#39;t any oil anywhere else out there to keep the fleet 
    operating.&#34;</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">With the Pacific Fleet basing from 
    California, there could have been no Battle of Midway the next spring, and 
    the whole complexion of the war in the Pacific would have changed.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">As it was, the Japanese had their way in 
    the Pacific for a short time, and grabbed most of the oil of the East 
    Indies, despite Allied attempts to destroy those facilities. For a time, the 
    Imperial Navy and Army achieved what Hitler never did - oil independence.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Then they ran into another problem that 
    rendered their possession of the oil fields meaningless - the second oil 
    paradox of the war in the Pacific. The Japanese had an insufficient number 
    of tankers to haul the needed oil to their industrial plants in the home 
    islands and the many outposts spread across their vast empire. For the 
    tankers they did have, they demonstrated an increasing inability to protect 
    them from the attacks of Allied submarines, surface ships and aircraft. Oil 
    had to travel thousands of miles to get from the fields of Balikpapan in 
    Borneo to home ports in Japan. The Allies were lying in wait all along the 
    route.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Immediately after taking command of the 
    Pacific Fleet, Adm. Nimitz came to an agreement with Adm. Ernest King, the 
    Chief of Naval Operations, that &#34;the primary objectives of the Allied armed 
    forces were to safeguard their own supply lines and then drive westward in 
    order to capture bases from which Japan&#39;s indispensable &#39;oil line&#39; might be 
    blocked.&#34;</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">One of the most important ship sinkings 
    of the war occurred when the U.S. submarine <i>Grenadier</i> sank the <i>
    Taiyo Maru</i> in the summer of 1942. Over 1,000 Japanese petroleum experts 
    and technicians were on board, heading for the Indies to spur oil 
    production. A total of 780 of them perished in the attack. By the end of the 
    war, 110 Japanese tankers had been made victims of American submarines, and 
    joined the <i>Taiyo Maru</i> on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The protective measures the Japanese did 
    attempt to take proved to be of little help. U.S. cryptanalysts had broken 
    the Japanese naval code and were fully informed of tanker schedules and 
    cargoes. The Imperial Navy was slow to respond; it did not establish convoys 
    for the precious tankers until 1943.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Soon the Imperial Navy itself began to 
    feel the fuel pinch. Training cruises were first shortened, then eliminated. 
    Strategic decisions were made based on fuel requirements rather than 
    political or military reasoning. In the Marianas campaign of 1944, for 
    instance, the Japanese battle fleet made no attempt to hinder the Americans&#39; 
    advance because its fuel supply was too low. The Japanese were willing to 
    risk everything to defend the Philippines because those islands&#39; location 
    made them critical for defending the long imperial shipping lanes running 
    from Borneo and Sumatra to Tokyo. But at Leyte Gulf, with Gen. MacArthur&#39;s 
    invasion force still vulnerable to counterattack, the Japanese 2nd Fleet, 
    under Adm. Takeo Kurita, turned tail only 40 miles from the beaches. He felt 
    he was too short on fuel to risk an attack.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">There were no half-measures during the 
    great Allied counteroffensive in the Pacific War. Gen. Curtis LeMay assigned 
    the entire Guam-based 315th Bombardment Wing to strike at Japanese fuel 
    facilities. By the end of the war, Japanese refinery output was down to six 
    percent of normal, and the civilians in the homeland were reduced to such 
    things as attempting to brew fuel from pine roots.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The futility of that approach was 
    apparent even in Japanese government reports at the time, which disclosed 
    that to meet the target of 12,00 barrels of pine root fuel per day would 
    have required the full-time efforts of 1.25 million workers. Besides, the 
    pine root fuel gummed up engines beyond repair after only a short running 
    time.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">The saddest facet of the Pacific oil 
    situation, however, is that the use of <i>kamikaze</i> suicide planes was 
    developed partly as a means to conserve fuel. Though low on aviation 
    gasoline, Japan had an abundance of pilots. According to theory, three 
    suicide planes would be sufficient to sink an American warship, whereas 
    conventional attack required between 15 and 20 Japanese fighter-bombers to 
    do the job. More fuel was saved because those three planes would not require 
    any fuel to return to base.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">Some historians, caught up in 
    conventional analysis of Japan&#39;s military predicament, have suggested they 
    should have pulled their naval and air forces back to the home area instead 
    of spending lives and materiél fighting in far off places. But an 
    understanding of the oil situation wipes that speculation away. An aircraft 
    carrier does no good in Okinawa or Tokyo Bay if the only fuel available for 
    it is in Sumatra. Thus the final Pacific War oil paradox: just at the time a 
    concentrated Imperial Fleet was needed to repel Allied attacks, it was 
    forced to scatter to maintain proximity to fuel sources.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2">An appropriate postscript to Japan&#39;s 
    defeated drive for oil occurred shortly after its surrender, when a 
    detachment of U.S. sailors went to arrest Gen. Hideki Tojo for war crimes. 
    He attempted suicide, and it took two hours to find an ambulance with enough 
    fuel to take him t a hospital. Thomas Moorer, who later became Chief of 
    Naval Operations, was witness to the scene, and he reflected: &#34;What I 
    learned then was never lose a war, and the way to lose a war is to run out 
    of oil.&#34;</SPAN></p>

    <SPAN size="2">With 50 years and a million pages of analysis between us and 
    the events of World War II, it is easy to forget the lessons learned at that 
    time. Today, with armed forces that are truly and fully mechanized, the 
    nations of the world are more dependent than ever on secure lines of oil 
    supplies to keep their armed forces operating. We would do well to remember 
    that the best tanks and warships money and technology can create are nothing 
    but inviting targets if they can&#39;t move, and oil is still the only substance 
    that can move them.</SPAN><span>.</span><!--mstheme--></SPAN></p></td>
