<p>The team and I are pumped to be back at <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/">Build</a> with the developer community this year.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Windows has continued to see incredible growth fueled by Windows 11 adoption. In fact, one of the most exciting areas driving that growth for Windows has been developers themselves, with a 24% YoY increase in monthly devices used for development.</p>
<p>AI is the defining technology of our time and developers are at the forefront of this transformation. With the right tools we can empower developers and our shared customers to shape the future and leave their mark on the world. We are just starting to see the incredible impact AI is having across industries and in our own daily lives. Today, the team and I are excited to share the next steps we are taking on our journey with Windows 11, to meet this new age of AI.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are <strong>introducing Windows Copilot</strong>, making Windows 11 the first PC platform to announce centralized AI assistance to help people easily take action and get things done.</li>
<li>We are extending <strong>Bing Chat plugins to Windows, </strong>enabling developers to integrate their apps within Windows Copilot to better serve their customers and increase engagement on native Windows applications.</li>
<li>We are introducing new <strong>Hybrid AI loop</strong> to support AI development <strong>across platform, and </strong><strong>across Azure to client with new </strong><strong>silicon support</strong> from AMD, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm.</li>
<li><strong>We are introducing Dev Home</strong> designed to help every developer become more productive on Windows.</li>
<li><strong>We are introducing new AI features</strong> and experiences in the Microsoft Store on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can’t wait to share more with you tomorrow during our Windows keynote, <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/sessions/8aab36d1-d27d-46dd-81ec-eb3f49cfee6a?source=sessions">be sure to register for Build and tune in</a>!</p>
<h4><strong>Introducing Windows Copilot for Windows 11</strong></h4>

<p>We’re thrilled to introduce Windows Copilot. Windows is the first PC platform to provide centralized AI assistance for customers. Together, with Bing Chat and first- and third-party plugins, you can focus on bringing your ideas to life, completing complex projects and collaborating instead of spending energy finding, launching and working across multiple applications.</p>
<figure><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/Windows-Dev-Blog_Windows-Copilot-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576"/></p></figure>
<p>Invoking Windows Copilot is familiar and easy – the button is front and center on your taskbar – simple to find and use. Once open, the Windows Copilot side bar stays consistent across your apps, programs and windows, always available to act as your personal assistant. It makes every user a power user, helping you take action, customize your settings and seamlessly connect across your favorite apps. The things you love about Windows – copy/paste, Snap Assist, Snipping Tool, personalization – they are all right there for you, along with every other feature on the platform, and they only get better with Windows Copilot. For example, you can not only copy and paste, but also ask Windows Copilot to rewrite, summarize or explain your content.</p>
<p>Just like you would with Bing Chat, you can ask Windows Copilot a range of questions from simple to complex. If I want to call my family in Cyprus, I can quickly check the local time to make sure I’m not waking them up in the middle of the night. If I want to plan a trip to visit them in Cyprus, I can ask Windows Copilot to find my family flights and accommodations for mid-winter break.</p>
<p>With Bing and ChatGPT plugins in Windows Copilot, people will not only have access to augmented AI capabilities and experiences, but you as developers will also have new ways to reach and innovate for our shared customers. We welcome you to be part of the Windows Copilot journey by continuing to invest in Bing and ChatGPT plugins so your investments will carry forward to Windows Copilot.</p>
<p>Windows Copilot will start to become available in preview for Windows 11 in June, stay tuned <a href="https://aka.ms/PluginsForWindows">and <u>sign up here</u></a> to get updates from the team.</p>
<h4><strong>Empowering every Windows 11 developer to be an AI developer  </strong></h4>
<p>We continue to invest in important tools to democratize how apps will be built for the new era of AI; whether you’re developing on x86/x64 or Arm64 we want to make it easy for you to bring AI powered experiences in Windows apps across cloud and edge.</p>
<figure><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/3/2023/05/ONNX-Runtime-Build-2023-final-1-1024x539.png" alt="" width="1024" height="539"/></p></figure>
<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2022/05/24/create-next-generation-experiences-at-scale-with-windows/">Last year at Build</a>, we announced Hybrid Loop, a new development pattern that enables hybrid AI scenarios across Azure and client devices. Today, we are excited to share that our vision has become a reality using ONNX Runtime as the gateway to Windows AI and Olive, a toolchain we created to ease the burden on you when optimizing models for varied Windows and other devices. With ONNX Runtime, third-party developers have access to the same tools we use internally to run AI models on Windows or other devices across CPU, GPU, NPU, or hybrid with Azure.</p>
<p>ONNX Runtime now supports the same API for running models on the device or in the cloud, enabling hybrid inferencing scenarios where your app can use local resources when possible and switch to the cloud when needed. With the new Azure EP preview, you can connect to models deployed in AzureML or even to the Azure OpenAI service. With just a few lines of code you can specify the cloud endpoint and define your criteria for when to use the cloud. This gives you more control over costs and user experience, as Azure EP gives you the flexibility to choose between using the larger model in the cloud or the smaller local model at runtime.</p>
<p>You can also optimize your models for different hardware targets with Olive, an extensible toolchain that combines cutting edge techniques for model compression, optimization and compilation. And you can use ONNX Runtime across platforms like Windows, iOS, Android and Linux, so your Windows AI investment can extend to all your app platforms.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/?p=56722">ONNX Runtime and Olive</a> contribute to the velocity of getting your AI models deployed into apps. ONNX Runtime makes it easier for you to create amazing AI experiences on Windows and other platforms, with less engineering effort and better performance.</p>
<p><strong>Extending our vision for an AI powered future in collaboration with our partners</strong></p>
<p>Windows 11 has the largest and most powerful ecosystem of GPUs in the world with more than 200M+ AI capable discrete GPUs. Windows PCs like Surface Studio 2+, and PCs built by partners such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung are powered by <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/05/23/microsoft-build-nvidia-ai-windows-rtx">NVIDIA</a> GPUs. Developers can leverage these GPUs today to run cutting-edge transformer models like Dolly 2.0, Stable Diffusion and NVIDIA’s NeMo that are pre-optimized for Windows.</p>
<p>NPUs (Neural Processing Units) are purpose-built accelerators to run AI models efficiently. Our partners are continuing to innovate and deliver – like <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/05/qualcomm-and-microsoft-align-efforts-to-scale-on-device-ai-at-bu">Qualcomm</a> with the Snapdragon 8cx Gen3 Compute Platform which today enables Windows devices including the Surface Pro 9 5G and the Windows Dev Kit 2023. With Olive &amp; ONNX Runtime you can target Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDK to run AI models on the 8cx Gen 3 compute platform NPU.</p>
<p>We are excited to see all our silicon partners bring more Windows devices with NPUs to the market later this year.  <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/corporate/amd-accelerates-ai-adoption-on-windows-11-with-new-developer/ba-p/607847">AMD</a> recently made early access of Ryzen™ AI software available to developers to run AI models on AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series processors with Ryzen™ AI. Intel previewed their new Meteor Lake product, an all-new chiplet SoC architecture that will feature Intel’s first integrated AI engine which will scale across the Windows ecosystem starting later this year and will also make available developer tools, including ONNX Runtime support enabled through OpenVino-EP and DirectML-EP.</p>
<p>Partners such as WhatsApp, Luminar Neo and Camo are achieving incredible leaps in performance and unlocking new end-user experiences by leveraging NPUs to run their AI models.  Bring your apps to the Windows platform and leverage ONNX Runtime to deliver AI experiences like Camo.  We can’t wait to see what the Windows developer community will create with these new AI toolchains and NPU hardware advancements.</p>
<h4><strong>New experiences designed to help every developer become more productive on Windows 11</strong></h4>
<p>Life as a developer involves constantly juggling manual dev machine set up with too many clicks, multiple tool sign-ins, navigating sub-optimal filesystem performance and context switching, and we know that these disruptions can significantly impact your productivity. Today, we’re excited to announce new features and improvements across all stages of the development cycle on Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing Dev Home: Your new productivity companion</strong></p>

<p>With a renewed focus on your productivity, we are announcing a new home for developers on Windows  – Dev Home. Dev Home is a new experience in Windows 11, now available in preview, that gets you back in the zone and streamlines your workflow with features such as WinGet configuration for easier and faster setup, Dev Drive for enhanced filesystem performance and a new customizable dashboard to track all your workflows and tasks in one place. Dev Home makes it easy to connect to GitHub and set up your machine to code for the repos you care about, easily installing the tools and packages you need. Dev Home can also configure your coding environments in the cloud using Microsoft Dev Box and GitHub Codespaces. With Dev Home, designed by and for developers, you now have your ultimate productivity companion so you can focus on what you do best – writing code. <a href="https://aka.ms/installdevhome"><strong>Download</strong></a><strong> the preview of the Dev Home in the Microsoft Store today. </strong><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-home">Learn more about Dev Home</a></p>
