    <h1>Building an efficient hash table in Java</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>One day, I ran into SwissTable—the kind of design that makes you squint, grin, and immediately regret every naive linear-probing table you’ve ever shipped.</p><p>This post is the story of how I tried to bring that same “why is this so fast?” feeling into Java. It’s part deep dive, part engineering diary, and part cautionary tale about performance work.</p><h2 id="1-the-swisstable-project-explained-the-way-it-feels-when-you-first-understand-it">1) The SwissTable project, explained the way it <em>feels</em> when you first understand it</h2><p>SwissTable is an open-addressing hash table design that came out of Google’s work and was famously presented as a new C++ hash table approach (and later shipped in Abseil).</p><p>At a high level, it still does the usual hash-table thing: compute <code>hash(key)</code>, pick a starting slot, and probe until you find your key or an empty slot.</p><p>The twist is that SwissTable separates <em>metadata</em> (tiny “control bytes”) from the actual key/value storage, and it uses those control bytes to avoid expensive key comparisons most of the time. Instead of immediately touching a bunch of keys (which are cold in cache and often pointer-heavy), it first scans a compact control bytes that is dense, cache-friendly, and easy to compare in bulk. If this feels like a tiny Bloom filter, you’re on the right track: the control bytes act as a cheap “maybe” gate before we pay for real key comparisons.</p><p>To make probing cheap, SwissTable effectively splits the hash into two parts: <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code>. Think of <code>h1</code> as the part that chooses where to start probing (which group to look at first), and <code>h2</code> as a tiny fingerprint stored in the control bytes to quickly rule slots in or out. It’s not a full hash—just enough bits to filter candidates before we pay the cost of touching real keys.</p><p>So on lookup, you compute a hash, derive <code>(h1, h2)</code>, jump to the group from <code>h1</code>, and compare <code>h2</code> against all control bytes in that group before you even look at any keys. That means most misses (and many hits) avoid touching key memory entirely until the metadata says “there’s a plausible candidate here.”</p><p>Because probing stays cheap, SwissTable can tolerate higher load factors—up to about 87.5% (7/8) in implementations like Abseil’s <code>flat_hash_map</code>—without falling off a performance cliff, which directly improves memory efficiency.</p><h2 id="2-watching-swisstable-become-the-default-vibe-in-multiple-languages-go-rust">2) Watching SwissTable become the “default vibe” in multiple languages (Go, Rust)</h2><p>The first sign you’re looking at a generational design is when it stops being a cool library trick and starts showing up in standard libraries.</p><p>Starting in Rust 1.36.0, <code>std::collections::HashMap</code> switched to the SwissTable-based <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown">hashbrown</a> implementation. It’s described as using <strong>quadratic probing and SIMD lookup</strong>, which is basically SwissTable territory in spirit and technique. That was my “okay, this isn’t niche” moment.</p><p>Then Go joined the party: Go 1.24 ships a new built-in map implementation based on the Swiss Table design, straight from the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/swisstable">Go team’s own blog post</a>. In their microbenchmarks, map operations are reported to be <strong>up to 60% faster</strong> than Go 1.23, and in full application benchmarks they saw about a <strong>1.5% geometric-mean CPU time improvement</strong>. And if you want a very practical “this matters in real systems” story, <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/go-swiss-tables/">Datadog</a> wrote about Go 1.24’s SwissTable-based maps and how the new layout and growth strategy can translate into serious memory improvements at scale.</p><p>At that point, SwissTable stopped feeling like “a clever C++ trick” and started feeling like <em>the modern baseline</em>. I couldn’t shake the thought: Rust did it, Go shipped it… so why not Java? And with modern CPUs, a strong JIT, and the Vector API finally within reach, it felt less like a technical impossibility and more like an itch I had to scratch.</p><p>That’s how I fell into the rabbit hole.</p><h2 id="3-swisstables-secret-sauce-meets-the-java-vector-api">3) SwissTable’s secret sauce meets the Java Vector API</h2><p>A big part of SwissTable’s speed comes from doing comparisons <em>wide</em>: checking many control bytes in one go instead of looping byte-by-byte and branching constantly. That’s exactly the kind of workload SIMD is great at: load a small block, compare against a broadcasted value, get a bitmask of matches, and only then branch into “slow path” key comparisons. In other words, SwissTable is not just “open addressing done well”—it’s “open addressing shaped to fit modern CPUs.”</p><p>Historically, doing this portably in Java was awkward: you either trusted auto-vectorization, used <code>Unsafe</code>, wrote JNI, or accepted the scalar loop. But the <strong>Vector API</strong> has been incubating specifically to let Java express vector computations that reliably compile down to good SIMD instructions on supported CPUs.</p><p>In Java 25, the Vector API is still incubating and lives in <code>jdk.incubator.vector</code>. The important part for me wasn’t “is it final?&#34;—it was “is it usable enough to express the SwissTable control-byte scan cleanly?” Because if I can write “compare 16 bytes, produce a mask, act on set bits” in plain Java, the rest of SwissTable becomes mostly careful data layout and resizing logic. And once you see the control-byte scan as <em>the</em> hot path, you start designing everything else to make that scan cheap and predictable.</p><p>So yes: the Vector API was the permission slip I needed to try something I’d normally dismiss as “too low-level for Java.”</p><p>I began with the core SwissTable separation: a compact <strong>control array</strong> plus separate <strong>key/value storage</strong>. The control bytes are the main character—if those stay hot in cache and the scan stays branch-light, the table feels fast even before micro-optimizations.</p><p>I used the familiar <code>h1/h2</code> split idea: <code>h1</code> selects the initial group, while <code>h2</code> is the small fingerprint stored in the control byte to filter candidates. Lookup became a two-stage pipeline: (1) vector-scan the control bytes for <code>h2</code> matches, (2) for each match, compare the actual key to confirm. Insertion reused the same scan, but with an extra “find first empty slot” path once we know the key doesn’t already exist.</p><p>Where Java started pushing back was <em>layout realism</em>.</p><p>In C++ you can pack keys/values tightly; in Java, object references mean the “key array” is still an array of pointers, and touching keys can still be a cache-miss parade. So the design goal became: <strong>touch keys as late as possible</strong>, and when you must touch them, touch as few as possible—again, the SwissTable worldview.</p><p>Deletion required tombstones (a “deleted but not empty” marker) so probing doesn’t break, but tombstones also accumulate and can quietly degrade performance if you never clean them up.</p><p>Resizing was its own mini-project: doing a full rehash is expensive, but clever growth strategies (like Go’s use of table splitting/extendible hashing) show how far you can take this if you’re willing to complicate the design.</p><p>I also had to treat the Vector API as an optimization tool, not a magic wand. Vector code is sensitive to how you load bytes, how you handle tails, and whether the JIT can keep the loop structure stable. I ended up writing the control-byte scan as a very explicit “<code>load</code> → <code>compare</code> → <code>mask</code> → <code>iterate matches</code>” loop.</p><p>At this stage, the prototype already <em>worked</em>, but it wasn’t yet “SwissTable fast”—it was “promising, and now the real work begins.”</p><h2 id="5-the-pieces-of-swissmap-that-actually-mattered">5) The pieces of SwissMap that actually mattered</h2><p>Here’s what survived the usual round of “this feels clever but isn’t fast” refactors.</p><h3 id="control-bytes--layout">Control bytes &amp; layout</h3><p>With non-primitive keys, the real cost is rarely “a few extra byte reads” — it’s pointer chasing. Even one <code>equals()</code> can walk cold objects and pay cache-miss latency. So SwissMap treats the ctrl array as the first line of defense: scan a tight, cache-friendly byte array to narrow the search to a handful of plausible slots <em>before</em> touching any keys/values.</p><p>This matters even more in Java because “keys/values” usually means arrays of references. On 64-bit JVMs, <strong>compressed oops</strong> (often enabled up to ~32GB depending on alignment/JVM flags) packs references into 32 bits, making the reference arrays denser. When compressed oops is off, references widen to 64 bits and the same number of key touches can spill across more cache lines.</p><p>Either way, the ctrl array does most of the work: most misses die in metadata. Compressed oops just makes the unavoidable key touches cheaper when they do happen.</p><h3 id="load-factor">Load factor</h3><p>In classic open addressing, pushing load factor up usually means the average probe chain gets longer fast — more branches, more random memory touches, and a steep cliff in miss cost. That’s why many general-purpose hash maps pick conservative defaults. Java’s <code>HashMap</code>, for example, defaults to a 0.75 load factor to keep miss costs from ballooning as the table fills.</p><p>SwissTable flips the cost model: probing is dominated by scanning the ctrl bytes first, which are dense, cache-friendly, and cheap to compare in bulk. That means “one more probe group” is often just one more ctrl-vector load + compare, <em>not</em> a bunch of key <code>equals()</code> calls. With SwissTable-style probing, the table can run denser without falling off a cliff. Abseil’s SwissTable-family maps are well known for targeting a ~7/8 (0.875) maximum load factor; even when the table is crowded, most probes are still “just metadata work.”</p><p>That trade-off is exactly what I wanted in Java too: higher load factor → fewer slots → smaller key/value arrays → fewer cache lines touched per operation, as long as the ctrl scan stays the fast path.</p><h3 id="sentinel-padding">Sentinel padding</h3><p>SIMD wants fixed-width loads: 16 or 32 control bytes at a time. The annoying part is the tail — the last group near the end of the ctrl array. In native code you might “over-read” a few bytes and rely on adjacent memory being harmless. In Java you don’t get that luxury: out-of-bounds is a hard stop.</p><p>Without padding, the probe loop picks up tail handling: extra bounds checks, masked loads, or end-of-array branches — exactly the kind of bookkeeping you don’t want in the hottest path. A small sentinel padding region at the end of <strong>the</strong> array lets every probe issue the same vector load, keeping the loop predictable and JIT-friendly.</p><h3 id="h1h2-split">H1/H2 split</h3><p>Split the hash into <code>h1</code> (which selects the starting group) and <code>h2</code> (a small fingerprint stored per slot in the ctrl byte). <code>h1</code> drives the probe sequence (usually via a power-of-two mask), while <code>h2</code> is a cheap first-stage filter: SIMD-compare <code>h2</code> against an entire group of control bytes and only touch keys for the matching lanes.</p><p>SwissMap uses 7 bits for <code>h2</code>, leaving the remaining ctrl-byte values for special states like <code>EMPTY</code> and <code>DELETED</code>. That’s the neat trick: one byte answers both:</p><ul><li>“Is this slot full/empty/deleted?”</li><li>“Is this slot even worth a key compare?”</li></ul><p>Most lookups reject non-matches in the control plane. And if a probed group contains an <code>EMPTY</code>, that’s a definitive stop signal: the probe chain was never continued past that point, so the key can’t exist “later.”</p><h3 id="reusing-the-loaded-control-vector">Reusing the loaded control vector</h3><p>A <code>ByteVector</code> load isn’t free — it’s a real SIMD-width memory load of control bytes. On my test box, that load alone was ~6ns per probed group. In a hash table where a <code>get()</code> might be only a few dozen nanoseconds, that’s a meaningful tax.</p><p>So SwissMap tries hard to load the ctrl vector exactly once per group and reuse it:</p><ul><li>use the same loaded vector for the <code>h2</code> equality mask (candidate lanes)</li><li>and again for the <code>EMPTY</code>/<code>DELETED</code> masks (stop/continue decisions)</li></ul><p>No extra passes, no “just load it again,” no duplicate work.</p><h3 id="tombstones">Tombstones</h3><p>Deletion in open addressing is where correctness bites: if you mark a removed slot as <code>EMPTY</code>, you can break the probe chain. Keys inserted later in that chain would become “invisible” because lookups stop at the first empty.</p><p>Tombstones solve that by marking the slot as <code>DELETED</code> (“deleted but not empty”), so lookups keep probing past it.</p><h3 id="reusing-tombstones-on-put">Reusing tombstones on put</h3><p>On <code>put</code>, tombstones are not just a correctness hack — they’re also reusable space. The common pattern is:</p><ul><li>during probing, remember the first <code>DELETED</code> slot you see</li><li>keep probing until you either find the key (update) or hit an <code>EMPTY</code> (definitive miss)</li><li>if the key wasn’t found, insert into the remembered tombstone rather than the later empty slot</li></ul><p>That tends to keep probe chains from getting longer over time, reduces resize pressure, and prevents workloads with lots of remove/put cycles from slowly poisoning performance.</p><h3 id="when-tombstones-force-a-same-capacity-rehash">When tombstones force a same-capacity rehash</h3><p>Tombstones preserve correctness, but they dilute the strongest early-exit signal: <code>EMPTY</code>. A table with lots of <code>DELETED</code> tends to probe farther on misses and inserts — more ctrl scans, more vector loads, and more chances to touch cold keys.</p><p>So SwissMap tracks tombstones and triggers a <strong>same-capacity rehash</strong> when they cross a threshold (as a fraction of capacity or relative to live entries). This rebuilds the ctrl array, turning <code>DELETED</code> back into <code>EMPTY</code> and restoring short probe chains — basically compaction without changing logical contents.</p><h3 id="a-resize-rehash-without-redundant-checks">A resize rehash without redundant checks</h3><p>Resizing forces a rehash because <code>h1</code> depends on capacity. The obvious approach is “iterate old entries and call <code>put</code> into the new table,” but that pays for work you don’t need: duplicate checks, extra branching, and unnecessary key equality calls.</p><p>The faster path treats resize as a pure <em>move</em>:</p><ul><li>allocate fresh ctrl/key/value arrays</li><li>reset counters</li><li>scan the old table once, and for each <code>FULL</code> slot:<ul><li>recompute <code>(h1, h2)</code> for the new capacity</li><li>insert into the first available slot found by the same ctrl-byte probe loop</li><li><strong>without</strong> checking “does this key already exist?” (it can’t: you’re moving unique keys)</li></ul></li></ul><p>This makes resizing a predictable linear pass over memory rather than a branchy series of full <code>put()</code> operations.</p><p>Iteration is another place where “simple” becomes surprisingly expensive. You can scan linearly and yield <code>FULL</code> slots, but many designs want a stable-ish visit pattern without allocating a separate dense list. And some reinsertion/rehash interactions can even go accidentally quadratic (see the <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/post/153545455987/rust-hash-iteration-reinsertion">Rust iteration write-up</a>).</p><p>SwissMap avoids extra buffers by iterating with a modular stepping permutation:
pick a <code>start</code> and an odd <code>step</code> (with power-of-two capacity, any odd step is coprime), then visit indices via repeated <code>idx = (idx + step) &amp; mask</code>. This hits every slot exactly once, spreads accesses across the table, and keeps iteration as a tight loop over the same ctrl-byte state machine used elsewhere.</p><p>Here’s a trimmed version of the lookup to show how the probe loop hangs together around the control bytes:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>protected</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>findIndex</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
