    <h1>Ask HN: Are there any websites for SQL puzzle games?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As a Python programmer, I often use Django or SQLAlchemy ORM and as a consequence, my proficiency in raw SQL remains at a basic level. However, I am keen on improving my raw SQL skills, given it&#39;s sometimes superior to ORM, and because I find SQL and relational algebra surprisingly fun to think about.</p><p>Does anyone know of websites that provide SQL puzzle games that allow users to solve problems by writing SQL and validating them? I believe this would be an engaging way to enhance my SQL skills. Your suggestions are appreciated!</p></div></div></div>
