    <h1>How Sber Built ruDALL-E</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, I interview Sergei Markov, the chief of the SberDevices experimental machine learning systems department.</p>
<p>We talk about one of Sber’s latest projects in machine learning – <a href="https://rudalle.ru/">ruDALL-E</a>, an image generation model. We also discuss the open-source culture at Sber and how machine learning models like ruDALL-E can be used for design and art.</p>

<h3 id="could-you-please-describe-the-rudall-e-project-for-our-readers%3F"><p>Could you please describe the ruDALL-E project for our readers?</p></h3>
<p>ruDALL-E is an open-source neural network that can generate images from texts. It can create infinitely many original images from text prompts, and it also can continue drawing existing images. You can try it yourself – the demo is available at <a href="https://rudalle.ru/">rudalle.ru</a>.</p>
<p>The demo works with automatic translation to Russian since the model is originally trained on Russian language data. The model is considered the greatest computational project in Russia for now, totaling 24,256 GPU days to train the models.</p>
<p>Of course, the model inherits some things specific to Russian: for example, common phrases and associations. But in general, it can generate any concept, for example, draw landscapes, art concepts, common objects.</p>
