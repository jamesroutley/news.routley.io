              <p>AUSTIN, TX 10/17/24 – In 1982, British game designers Sir Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson
                introduced <b><i>Fighting Fantasy</i></b>, a revolutionary set of solo adventure books that combined
                nonlinear narratives with dice-rolling tabletop RPG mechanics. Now, this fantastical,
                multi-million-selling book series returns to the United States thanks to an historic 50-book publishing
                collaboration with Steve Jackson Games. The first books in the series will be available in early 2025.
              </p>

              <p><b><i>Fighting Fantasy</i></b> debuted with <b><i>The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</i></b> in 1982.
                Since then, over 20 million copies of the exciting series have been sold worldwide. In <b><i>Fighting
                    Fantasy</i></b>, players embark on a solo adventure where their decisions – and dice rolls
                – determine the outcome of the story. This combination of nonlinear narrative and classic tabletop
                action sets the series apart from other gamebook franchises.</p>

              <p><b><i>Fighting Fantasy</i></b> co-creators Sir Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson (UK) stated how
                thrilled they were to sign a US publishing agreement for <b><i>Fighting Fantasy</i></b> with Steve
                Jackson Games. Sir Ian says: </p>

              <p><i>&#34;To have a new publisher in the USA is a special moment in the history of <b><i>Fighting
                      Fantasy</i></b>. We have known Steve Jackson (US) for more than 40 years, having distributed Steve
                  Jackson Games in the 1980s when we owned Games Workshop. Steve also wrote three fantastic
                  <b><i>Fighting Fantasy</i></b> books which caused a lot of confusion at the time when people didn&#39;t
                  realize there were two Steve Jacksons! We look forward to exciting times ahead in the USA for new and
                  existing <b><i>Fighting Fantasy</i></b> fans.&#34; </i></p>

              <p> The first five books will be released in early 2025, with an additional five volumes later that year. <a href="http://eepurl.com/i1pTxA">SIGN UP</a> for the latest news about Fighting Fantasy from Steve Jackson Games!
