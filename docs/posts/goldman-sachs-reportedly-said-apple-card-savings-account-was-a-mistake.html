<p>A Goldman Sachs exec reportedly responded to the announcement of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Card</a> savings account by immediately declaring it a mistake.</p>



<p>According to the report, the unnamed Goldman partner said: “We should have never done this f—ing thing” … </p>



<h2 id="h-goldman-has-lost-big-on-the-apple-card">Goldman has lost big on the Apple Card</h2>



<p>Goldman has long been reported to regret the entire Apple Card partnership, after notching up <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/13/apple-card-billion-dollars-plus-loss/">more than a billion dollars in losses</a> by January of this year, and more recently <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/19/apple-card-contributes-667-million-loss-for-goldman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headed toward losing its second billion</a>.</p>



<p>The bank has historically made its money through serving the financial needs of corporations, financial institutions, and governments. Its move into consumer lending is a relatively recent development, and a massively unsuccessful one. Goldman has spent much of this year <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-ceo-says-firm-is-considering-strategic-alternatives-for-consumer-platforms-5775e5e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to exit the consumer finance business</a>.</p>



<p>The bank sold most of its personal loans, along with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/goldman-sachs-passed-on-a-higher-offer-for-greensky-23f3699?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its main consumer lending business</a>, GreenSky – taking a big financial hit in the process.</p>



<p>It has for some time been trying to offload the Apple Card partnership, so far without success. It has reportedly <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/30/amex-apple-card-goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been in discussions with Amex</a> for some time, but it’s unclear why the card company would be interested in picking up a loss-making business. Amex also has a strong brand of its own, so is likely to kick back on an Apple branded product.</p>



<h2 id="h-savings-account-was-a-ing-mistake">Savings account was ‘a ****ing mistake’</h2>



<p>A new <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/goldman-sachs-wants-out-of-consumer-lending-employees-say-it-cant-happen-fast-enough-17e98a30?mod=followamazon&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WSJ</a></em> report says that one exec was unimpressed by the bank deepening its relationship with Apple through the launch of an Apple Card savings account.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When Goldman Sachs and Apple launched their joint savings account in April, Goldman held a town hall at its headquarters, where bank executives talked it up. One executive had a different message shortly afterward. “We should have never done this f—ing thing,” the Goldman partner told colleagues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The likely reason for this is that the many millions of dollars in savings accounts make it much harder to Goldman to offload the Apple Card business – as that money will have been invested, and the bank would have to raise it in cash in order to hand over the deal to someone else.</p>



<h2 id="h-some-at-goldman-want-apple-to-lend-its-own-money">Some at Goldman want Apple to lend its own money</h2>




	<p>Another potential exit plan put forward by some within Goldman is that Apple could lend its own money in future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Goldman employees working on the Apple partnership have floated other options, including letting Apple take over a bigger piece of the partnership, according to people familiar with the matter. For example, one idea proposed that Apple could become the lender for new credit-card spending and issuance, with Goldman continuing to manage the existing loans. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, that idea doesn’t seem to have gained any traction in either company, the report saying that it’s not under active consideration, and hasn’t been discussed at a senior level within either Goldman or Apple.</p>



<p>Adding to the bank’s headaches with the Apple Card is that it’s under investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for failing to promptly address errors and refund cardholders.</p>



<p>In what seems like something straight out of a farce, Goldman apparently blames Apple, as all cardholders get their bills on the same date, giving customer service reps a huge peak in workload. Why the bank agreed this arrangement in the first place – instead of the usual practice of having different dates for different customers, to even out the support requirement – is unclear, but points to another sign of the bank having too little experience in consumer lending to know what it is doing.</p>
