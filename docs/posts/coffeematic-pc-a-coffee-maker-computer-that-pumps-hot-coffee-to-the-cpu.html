        <p>
          Sometime during winter 2024, I found myself at a thrift store. I was
          staring at rows of appliances, wrapped in plastic and clinging to
          life, trying to answer one question: which of these is the right
          chassis for a retro gaming computer?

          Profound and poetically articulated. Elegant and assertive. Highly
          scaleable with dynamic acceleration. No. These do not describe
          Coffeematic PC or its peers (one of those phrases describes a bottle
          of wine.) A custom built computer can be basic and functional, or an
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJMYik2ptvJ/">elaborate, absurd, spinning piece of art.</a>
          <span>Coffeematic PC falls somewhere in that spectrum while also being
            nearly self-destructive.</span>
