        <p>1 There’re only three entities: <code>log</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>structure</code>.</p>

<p>1.1 Everything goes into the <code>log</code> chronologically. It is the source of truth.</p>

<p>1.11 We refer to the smallest unit of content in <code>log</code> as <code>entry</code>.</p>

<p>1.111 <code>entry</code> can be anything really: an idea, a memory, a piece of information, a progress update of a task, a TODO item, a reference to another <code>entry</code>…</p>

<p>1.12 Immediacy and immutability matters. <code>entry</code>s are captured as they happen, never modified.</p>

<p>1.121 There’s no room for auditing or forgetting. <code>entry</code>s are an authentic reflection of reality.</p>

<p>1.122 Efforts should be put to optimize the latency of the capture.</p>

<p>1.1221 Sometimes the primary tool is not available. An “always-on” secondary should take its place.</p>

<p>1.1222 Sometimes <code>log</code> from different tools or locations need to be “merged”, “persisted”. The general principle is to reduce manual steps (e.g. use a Web App that merges automatically), and do them daily at a fixed time and place (e.g. push to a git repository before going to bed).</p>

<p>1.123 In this sense, <code>log</code> is very similar to <a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/lab-notebooks.html">Lab Notebooks</a> (Sam Bleckley, 2020)</p>

<p>1.13 External context (if any) is part of the <code>entry</code>.</p>

<p>1.131 At the minimum, the title, author, and year of publish should be cited.</p>

<p>1.132 Better yet, use a personal URI system to reference local copies of the context, e.g. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero#saving_webpages">Zotero snapshot</a>, image, book.</p>

<p>1.14 There can be different types of <code>log</code>s. Different <code>log</code>s should represent completely different domains. Thoughts in these domains usually happen at different times and places.</p>

<p>1.142 I currently have three types of <code>log</code>s: journal, reading, worklog.</p>

<p>1.2 <code>list</code> and <code>structure</code> are derived from the <code>log</code>s.</p>

<p>1.21 A <code>list</code> references multiple <code>entry</code>s in the <code>log</code>.</p>

<p>1.211 <code>list</code> is a flat collection of <code>entry</code>s, contains nothing else.</p>

<p>1.212 The order of <code>entry</code>s in a <code>list</code> may be important, may be not. This is to say, you can treat the <code>list</code> either as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)"><code>Array</code></a>, or as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"><code>Set</code></a>.</p>

<p>1.213 I have some <code>list</code>s <a href="https://tabokie.github.io/collection.html">here</a>, if you want to see.</p>

<p>1.22 A <code>structure</code> references multiple <code>entry</code>s in the <code>log</code>, in a hierarchical way.</p>

<p>1.221 The construction of a <code>structure</code> involves many thoughts that function as “glue”. They can exist outside the <code>log</code>s.</p>

<p>1.2211 Think of the “glue” thoughts as the data member names when programming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)"><code>struct</code></a>. A name represents a particular angle to view an <code>entry</code>, an incomplete slice of an <code>entry</code>’s whole.</p>

<p>1.23 <code>list</code> and <code>structure</code> don’t need to be exaustive in what they are trying to collect. Unlike <code>log</code>s, the creation and maintenance of <code>list</code> and <code>structure</code> are performed asynchronously.</p>

<p>1.24 It is idiomatic to create <code>list</code>s using automation. For example, use a search and de-duplication script to create a <code>list</code> of all unfinished TODO items.</p>

<p>1.3 Yes, it’s like a data lakehouse. <code>list</code> and <code>structure</code> are materialized views over the unstructured data stored in <code>log</code>s.</p>

<p>2 Reference to an internal <code>entry</code> is simply a pair of content and date.</p>

<p>2.1 The content is a copy or a paraphrase of the original <code>entry</code>.</p>

<p>2.11 Do repeat yourself, as contrary to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. Think of the content as a cache of the full <code>entry</code>.</p>

<p>2.2 The date is the creation time of the original <code>entry</code>.</p>

<p>2.21 The fact that unpacking a reference requires the reader to examine all <code>log</code>s from that entire day, facilitates re-discovery of old ideas.</p>

<p>2.22 References to an <code>entry</code> can be found easily with a search of that date. These references are commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">backlinks</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">webmention</a> in the context of netpages.</p>

<p>2.221 For <code>log</code>s that are not searchable (e.g. paper notebook), a searchable <code>list</code> needs to be created to bookkeep all references in them. It contains a set of <code>date1 (date2)</code>, where <code>date1</code> is the day being referenced, and <code>date2</code> is the day this reference is created. By searching for <code>date1</code>, we know <code>date2</code> is its backlink.</p>

<p>3 All <code>log</code>s are to be reviewed regularly, and randomly.</p>

<p>3.1 Through the course of re-reading, learn to remember past ambititions and melancholies. Learn to disagree with them, and in disagreement find a way forward.</p>

<p>3.2 Digital <code>log</code>s should be printed to physical books for the sake of reviewing.</p>

<p>3.21 Nothing compares to the feel of a physical book, especially when the purpose of reading is not to consume and complete.</p>
