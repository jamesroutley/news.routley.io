But the risk of <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21689">damaging or deadly side effects<!-- --></a> is still present.<!-- --></p><p>Vozenin cites the example of paediatric brain tumours, which can often be cured by blasting the brain with radiotherapy, but at a great cost. &#34;The survivors are often left with lifelong anxiety and depression, while the impact of the radiation affects brain development, causing significant loss of IQ,&#34; she says. &#34;We&#39;re [sometimes] able to cure these kids but the price they pay is high.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Billy Loo, a professor of radiation oncology who runs the Flash sciences lab at Stanford University School of Medicine in the US, explains that tumours, especially those of larger volume, are rarely neatly segregated from the surrounding tissue. This means it&#39;s often next to impossible to avoid harming healthy cells, so oncologists are often unable to use as high a dose as they would like, says Loo.<!-- --></p><p>Cancer specialists have long believed that being able to boost the radiation dose would greatly enhance their ability to cure patients with difficult-to-treat cancers, according to Vozenin. For example, research has previously indicated that being able to <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.576700/full">increase the radiation dose<!-- --></a> in lung cancer patients with tumours that have metastasised to the brain could improve survival.<!-- --></p><p>In recent years, animal studies have repeatedly shown that Flash makes it possible to markedly increase the amount of radiation delivered to the body while minimising the impact that it has on surrounding healthy tissue. In one experiment, healthy lab mice <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.08.602528v1.abstract">which were given two rounds of radiation via Flash<!-- --></a> did not develop the typical side effects which would be expected during the second round. In another study, animals <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article/23/6/877/745462">treated with<!-- --></a> Flash for head and neck cancers experienced fewer side effects, such as reduced saliva production or difficulty swallowing.<!-- --></p><p>Loo is cautiously optimistic that going forwards, such benefits may also translate to human patients. &#34;Flash produces less normal tissue injury than conventional irradiation, without compromising anti-tumour efficacy – which could be game-changing,&#34; he says. An additional hope is that this could then <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://onkder.org/pdf/pdf_TOD_1443.pdf">reduce the risk of secondary cancers<!-- --></a>, resulting from radiation-induced damage later in life, although it is still too early to know if that will be the case.<!-- --></p><p>Now, increasing numbers of human trials are beginning to take place around the world. Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital in Ohio, US, is <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05524064?intr=FLASH%20Radiotherapy&amp;rank=1">planning an early stage trial<!-- --></a> in children with metastatic cancer that has spread to their chest bones.

It&#39;s also about identifying which <!-- --><i id="kind">kind<!-- --></i> of radiation is the best one to use.<!-- --></p><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2><span id="a-choice-of-particles"><b id="a-choice-of-particles">A choice of particles<!-- --></b></span></h2></p><p>From carbon ions to protons and electrons, there are many ways of delivering radiotherapy, each with different applications and challenges. One of the most precise forms of radiotherapy is hadron therapy, delivered with carbon ions.

Instead of needing to repeatedly travel long distances over the course of many days and weeks to receive multiple radiotherapy sessions, Flash could enable them to receive it all in either a single session or a small handful of sessions. Because each treatment takes less than a second, it would also enable doctors to treat many more patients in a single day.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;If we can get a normal sized machine that fits in all the hospital bunkers in the world and can administer Flash, that can allow countries to treat many more patients,&#34; says Durham Faivre. &#34;If instead of treating 50 patients a day, you can treat 150, you&#39;re massively increasing your capacity, and your ability to handle the public health need.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Many experts feel that this would also yield substantial cost savings benefits for high-income countries, as well as having a potentially enormous improvement for patients&#39; quality of life. <!-- --></p><p>&#34;It should be a more cost-effective treatment once the initial investment is made, since much fewer treatments are needed,&#34; says Constantinos Koumenis, professor of radiation oncology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in the US. Savings to the health system could also come due to fewer hospitalisations due to complications, he adds.<!-- --></p><p>The first step, Koumenis explains, is investigating just how good Flash is – and whether it’s actually better than standard radiotherapy.<!-- --></p><p>--<!-- --></p><p><i id="for-trusted-insights-into-better-health-and-wellbeing-rooted-in-science,-sign-up-to-the">For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/HealthFix_Newsletter_Signup?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=emails&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_type=&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_format=Module&amp;at_link_origin=featurescallout&amp;at_campaign=healthfix&amp;at_campaign_type=owned"><b id="health-fix-newsletter"><i id="health-fix-newsletter">Health Fix newsletter<!-- --></i></b></a><i id=",-while">, while <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;at_campaign_type=owned"><b id="the-essential-list"><i id="the-essential-list">The Essential List<!-- --></i></b></a><i id="delivers-a-handpicked-selection-of-features-and-insights."> delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.<!-- --></i></p><div data-component="text-block"><p><i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on">For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/"><b id="facebook"><i id="facebook">Facebook<!-- --></i></b></a><i id=",">, <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future"><b id="x"><i id="x">X<!-- --></i></b></a> <!-- --><i id="and">and <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/"><b id="instagram"><i id="instagram">Instagram<!-- --></i></b></a><b id="."><i id=".">.<!-- --></i></b><i id=""> <!-- --></i></p></div></article></div>
