    <h1>Ask HN: Concepts that clicked only years after you first encountered them?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m reading Petzold&#39;s <i>Code</i> [1], and it dawned on me that I didn&#39;t understand logic gates intuitively until now. I took a Computer Architecture course back in college, and I understood what logic gates meant in boolean algebra but not empirically. Petzold clarified this for me by going from the empirical to the theoretical using a lightbulb, a battery, wires, and relays (which he introduces when he talks about the telegraph as a way to amplify a signal).</p><p>Another concept is the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. For example, I always failed to understand why longer wires mean more resistance while thicker wires mean less resistance.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/</a></p></div></div></div>
