    <h1>Show HN: Wadzilla. Play DOOM in Zork</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Welcome to the wadzilla wiki!</p>

<p>Wadzilla is a tool used to convert DOOM WAD files to ZIL text output to facilitate playing DOOM on an Infocom Z-Machine. That is, to play DOOM in Zork.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scottvr/wadzilla/wiki/Current-status-and-FAQ">Important update: current status and FAQ</a></p>

<p>That seems a silly question, doesnâ€™t it? I mean, because as I understand it, our goal is to have Doom run on every machine.</p>

<p>This tool does not need any explanation to certain nerds above a certain age, but I realize now that it was a myopic viewpoint from which I incorrectly assumed that the necessity, utility, and purpose of Wadzilla was obvious.</p>
<p>The first person I told what I was up to  would have thought me completely insane did she not understand my love for creating ludicrous things precisely because they are ludicrous, but as such she chalked it up to that.</p>
<p>This caused me to understand that not everyone will know why the goal this project sets out to achieve so obviously needs to be achieved. So.. Here I will attempt to explain some things,so that the non-nerdy masses and younguns might understand the why and wherefore.</p>

<p>Both Zork and Doom stand as towering landmarks in the evolution of computer gaming, each leaving an indelible mark on the industry. Beyond their individual achievements, these games share similarities in their hackability, design principles, and the  communities that have continued to celebrate and expand upon their legacies.</p>

<p>The first version of Zork, known as MDL Zork, was developed by MIT hackers Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling between 1977 and 1979. Written in MDL (MIT Design Language), a Lisp-like functional language created at MIT, MDL Zork ran on the PDP-10. Zork&#39;s transition from MDL to other programming languages (Fortran and later C) by Bob Supnik in 1980 enabled it to spread widely among DEC user groups as &#34;mainframe Zork&#34; or &#34;Dungeon&#34;. This portability and the game&#39;s engaging nature led to widespread hacking and modification by users, laying the groundwork for interactive fiction as a genre.</p>
<p>As Infocom transitioned Zork to home computers, they faced significant technical challenges. MDL programs couldn&#39;t run on early home computers like the Apple II or TRS-80. Thus, the Infocom team designed the Z-machine, a virtual machine for which they wrote a high-level language called ZIL (Zork Implementation Language). Games written in ZIL were compiled into Z-code, which could be interpreted by the Z-machine emulator, ZIP, on 16-bit home computers. This clever use of a virtual machine allowed Zork and other Infocom games to be highly portable and easily modifiable.</p>
<p><strong>The author of Zilch has a terrific and detailed technical write up on ZIL and the Infocom compiler and Z-machine architecture here: <a href="https://github.com/ZoBoRf/ZILCH-How-to">https://github.com/ZoBoRf/ZILCH-How-to</a></strong></p>
<p>Released in 1993 by id Software, Doom revolutionized the gaming world with its fast-paced, first-person shooter gameplay. The game&#39;s modular architecture, separating the core engine from the game data stored in WAD files, made it easy for players to modify levels, textures, and gameplay mechanics. Doom&#39;s source code was eventually released, cementing its status as a platform for endless experimentation and customization.</p>

<p><strong>Additionally, id eventually released the full source code to the Doom engine: <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM</a></strong></p>
<p>Doom&#39;s design focused on visceral, fast-paced action and atmospheric environments. Its use of 3D graphics (albeit with 2D sprites) and dynamic lighting set new standards for immersion. The simplicity and flexibility of Doom&#39;s level design tools empowered a generation of players to create custom maps and mods, leading to a thriving ecosystem of user-generated content that extended the game&#39;s lifespan far beyond its initial release.</p>

<p>The communities that developed around Zork and Doom have played a crucial role in keeping these games relevant and beloved even decades after their release.</p>
<p>The interactive fiction community, inspired by Zork and its contemporaries, has remained active and vibrant. Enthusiasts and hobbyists continue to create new text adventures, often using tools like Inform and TADS. Annual competitions like the Interactive Fiction Competition (IFComp) showcase the ongoing creativity and innovation within this niche yet passionate community.</p>
<p>Doom&#39;s community is legendary for its dedication and productivity. From the early days of modding tools like DEU and DCK to modern editors like GZDoom Builder, the tools for creating custom content have evolved alongside the community&#39;s skills. The release of source ports and continuous development of mods, total conversions, and even entirely new games built on the Doom engine are testaments to the game&#39;s enduring appeal. Events like Doomworld&#39;s Cacowards celebrate the best of community-created content each year.</p>

<p>Modern interpreters and emulators make it possible to play Zork on contemporary devices. The game&#39;s influence is seen in modern interactive fiction and narrative-driven games, where the emphasis on storytelling and player choice remains paramount.</p>
<p>Doom is famously ported to every conceivable platform, from smartwatches to thermostats, showcasing the game&#39;s flexibility and the community&#39;s ingenuity. This &#34;Doom on everything&#34; ethos highlights both a technical challenge and a cultural phenomenon, celebrating the game&#39;s legacy in a playful, accessible way.</p>

<p>Zork and Doom, while vastly different in gameplay and era, share a profound legacy of hackability, innovative design, and community-driven evolution. As milestones of gaming history, they continue to inspire and engage, proving that the spirit of exploration and creativity they embodied is as relevant today as it was at their inception.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit of Exploration, Hacking, and Community that Wadzilla was created.</p>
