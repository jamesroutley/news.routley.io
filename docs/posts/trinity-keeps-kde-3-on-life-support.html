<p>As the shiny new <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/963851/">KDE Plasma 6</a> desktop makes its way into distribution
releases, a <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/apt-listchanges/apt-listchanges.1.en.html">small group</a> of developers is still trying to preserve the
KDE experience circa 2008. The <a href="https://trinitydesktop.org/">Trinity Desktop Environment</a>
(TDE), is a continuation of KDE 3 that has maintained the
old-school desktop with semi-regular releases since 2010. The most
recent release, <a href="https://wiki.trinitydesktop.org/Release_Notes_For_R14.1.2">R14.1.2</a>,
was <a href="https://trinitydesktop.org/newsentry.php?entry=2024.04.28">announced</a>
on April 28. TDE does deliver a usable retro desktop, but with
some limitations that hamper its usability on modern systems.</p>

<p>TDE got its start in the wake of the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/316827/">rocky launch</a> of
KDE 4.0 in 2008. The final KDE 3 release was 3.5.10 in
August 2008. That final release was followed up in April 2010 by <a href="https://wiki.trinitydesktop.org/Release_Notes_For_3.5.11">TDE 3.5.11</a>,
which brought modest improvements, bug fixes, and made it possible to
install TDE alongside KDE 4. The project broke from the 3.5.x versioning with <a href="https://wiki.trinitydesktop.org/Release_Notes_For_R14.0.0">R14.0.0</a>,
announced in December 2014. (&#34;R&#34; stands for &#34;release&#34;.) One of the
highlights of that release was an upgrade to TDE&#39;s fork of Qt 3,
<a href="https://scm.trinitydesktop.org/gitea/TDE/tqt3">TQt3</a>,
which added multi-threading support.</p>

<p>Since then, the project has not had another major release, but has
continued with incremental updates with bug fixes, small feature
enhancements, and work to keep the desktop
up-to-date with mainstream Linux distribution releases. None of the
major Linux distributions have an official TDE
spin or include its packages in their official repositories, so a
large part of the project&#39;s work is creating packages for popular
distributions. TDE packages are available for Arch, Debian, Devuan, Fedora,
Mageia, openSUSE, PCLinuxOS, Raspbian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and
Ubuntu. Instructions are also available to <a href="https://wiki.trinitydesktop.org/FreeBSD_Trinity_Installation_Instructions">build
TDE for FreeBSD</a> from source. R14.1.2 comes with a handful of new themes, minor feature
enhancements for TDE applications, and a number of bug fixes. It also
adds support for Fedora 40 and Ubuntu 24.04, and drops support for
several distributions that are at end-of-life.</p>

<p>Obviously, the target audience is the user who loved
KDE 3 and has no desire to switch to later KDE releases or
alternate desktops. What might make it compelling for other users is
its low resource usage, themes, and extensive configurability. The desktop and
its applications were snappy even in a virtual machine configured with only 2GB of
RAM and two vCPUs. Users can tweak the user interface and behavior of
TDE down to the most minute details. Want Windows 95-ish buttons
and title-bars, a purple and gray color scheme, and drop-shadows
for windows? All of that is possible. A violation of good taste,
perhaps, but possible. TDE also works nicely with other old-school applications that have
tray icons, like Claws Mail, that don&#39;t integrate quite so well with recent desktops
like GNOME 46.</p>

<h4>Applications</h4>

<p>TDE comes with a full suite of classic KDE <a href="https://trinitydesktop.org/applications.php">applications</a>,
including the Konqueror double-duty file manager and web browser,
Konsole terminal emulator, Okular document viewer, Kontact
&#34;personal information manager&#34; (PIM) suite, DigiKam photo manager,
and others. These applications are, with a few enhancements and
bug fixes aside, largely as they were when KDE 3 was current. 
Most of these  applications have continued to evolve within the KDE
project, and have more modern counterparts as part of the KDE Gear set of
applications that work on Plasma. <em>Most</em>, but not all. In some cases, TDE
resurrects applications that would otherwise be lost to the dustbin
of history, though the relevance of some of those programs today is
questionable.</p>

<p>For example, the collection includes <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/KPilot">KPilot</a>, an open source
 replacement for the Palm Desktop software for Palm Pilot devices. KPilot
 has long since been dropped from KDE as unmaintained software, but if
 any users are still depending on a Palm Pilot to organize their
 affairs, they can rely on TDE.</p>

<p>The Knmap front-end for nmap might be more relevant to a wider
 audience. That application seems to have disappeared from the KDE
 library of software, but it&#39;s still <a href="https://mirror.git.trinitydesktop.org/gitea/TDE/knmap">chugging along</a> in the Trinity
 collection. One of my old favorite applications, the <a href="https://basket-notepads.github.io/">Basket</a> free-form note-taking
 tool, is also available and works well with other TDE applications.</p>

<h4>Showing its age</h4>

<p>For the most part, TDE is a usable desktop, but it does
show its age beyond its retro look-and-feel. Though the
Trinity web site claims compatibility with newer hardware, it had some
significant issues with a high-resolution (HiDPI) laptop display and external monitors
over Thunderbolt connections. For example, on a 13&#34; laptop display
with 2256x1504 resolution, TDE&#39;s user-interface elements were too
small to use comfortably. Current GNOME and KDE releases can be scaled
up on HiDPI displays to provide a more usable interface, but TDE
lacks this feature. Trying to change the display to use a lower
resolution caused things to go haywire, with inverted colors and
artifacts that made the desktop completely unusable.</p>

<p>TDE&#39;s System Settings application is outdated in some areas, or
missing functionality entirely. Trying to use the network settings
utility pops up an &#34;unsupported platform&#34; warning, and provides a list
of supported distributions: the most recent of which is from 2015. The
backend for the network settings is the <tt>knetworkconf</tt> package,
a collection of Perl scripts that are far out of date for managing
networking on current Linux systems. Network configuration is still
possible with NetworkManager, but it isn&#39;t integrated into TDE. Users
have plenty of configuration options for mice, but no trackpad options at all.</p>

<p>Some of the applications are in need of modernization or
replacement to be useful in 2024. Konqueror is still a decent file
manager, but it doesn&#39;t handle modern web sites well at all. 
The Kopete instant-messaging application offers to connect
users to networks and protocols that are either dead and gone (AIM,
Yahoo, Windows WinPopup) or well out of mainstream use (Novell GroupWise, Lotus
Sametime). Support for more recent protocols, such as Matrix instant
messaging, is not to be found. The vintage version of Amarok that is
included still lists internet radio services that are defunct, and it
immediately crashes when trying to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding">AAC</a>
files.</p>

<p>While on the topic of modernization, it is worth noting that TDE
only has support for X11. Porting to Wayland seems to be <a href="http://mail.trinitydesktop.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/devels@trinitydesktop.org/thread/23BG2YMFHEW5I7O7WN7FY5H7OVUJF6IJ/">considered</a>
a problem for the distant future.</p>

<p>With the exception of hardware support, however, these problems are
not show-stoppers. Most users will simply choose Firefox or another
browser, which works just fine along with TDE. It would be interesting to be able to use Kopete with Matrix,
but there are plenty of Matrix clients available. Likewise, users have
no shortage of music players to choose from.</p>

<p>In some ways, running TDE is like driving a lovingly restored
classic car from the 1950s or 1960s. The commitment and effort toward
preserving a cultural artifact is impressive. Its visual appeal and handling are
satisfying for a specific audience, and it can be a lot of fun to
take out for a weekend spin. It may not be a suitable option,
though, for most users who want a desktop that will keep pace with the times.
It is perfect for stalwart KDE 3 fans, making use of aging
hardware, or for users who want to
spend a little time reliving an earlier era of the Linux desktop.</p>
