    <h1>When hardware goes end-of-life, companies need to open-source the software</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><section></section><div id="home"><section><p><small>January 13, 2026<!-- --> ·<!-- --> 2 min read</small></p></section></div><div><section><p>When hardware products reach end-of-life (EOL), companies should be forced to open-source the software.</p><br/></section></div><div><section><p>I think we&#39;ve made strides in this area with the &#34;<a href="https://repair.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Right to Repair</a>&#34;-movement, but let&#39;s go one step further. Preferably with the power of the European Commission: enforce that when something goes end-of-life, companies need to open-source the software.</p><br/></section></div><div><section><p>I have a &#34;smart&#34; weight scale. It still connects via Bluetooth just fine (meaning: I see it connect on my phone) but because the app is no longer in development, it&#39;s essentially useless. A perfect piece of hardware, &#34;dead&#34; because the company behind it stopped supporting it. (I&#39;m exaggerating a bit; it shows the weight on its display, but the app used to store data for up to 5 users to keep track over time. I miss that!) It&#39;s infuriating that we allow this to happen with all the wasteful electronics already lying around. We deserve better.</p><br/></section></div><div><section><p>I thought of this while reading <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/bose-open-sources-its-soundtouch-home-theater-smart-speakers-ahead-of-eol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article.</a> It&#39;s great that Bose does this, but it&#39;s rare. When <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotifys-car-thing-officially-non-operational-less-than-three-years-after-it-rolled-out-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify killed off its $200 Car Thing</a> at the end of 2024, we just accepted it and moved on, even though that&#39;s $200 of hardware turned into e-waste overnight. Out of sustainability concerns, but also just out of doing what&#39;s right: this should not be able to happen.</p><br/></section></div><div><section><p>Now, I&#39;m not asking companies to open-source their entire codebase. That&#39;s unrealistic when an app is tied to a larger platform. What I am asking for: publish a basic GitHub repo with the hardware specs and connection protocols. Let the community build their own apps on top of it.</p><br/></section></div><div><section><p>And here&#39;s the thing: with vibe-coding making development more accessible than ever, this isn&#39;t just for hardcore developers anymore. Regular users can actually tinker with this stuff now.</p><br/></section></div><div><section><p>The worst you can do is break the software. But the hardware was bricked already anyway :-)</p></section></div><div><div><h4>Can I keep you updated?</h4><p>Starting in 2026, I&#39;ll share more focused notes on product design, technology, and business.
