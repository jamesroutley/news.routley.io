       <p>You told us one of the primary reasons to adopt Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the broad choice of services we offer, enabling you to innovate, build, deploy, and monitor your workloads. AWS has continuously expanded its services to support virtually any cloud workload. It now offers over 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), and many more. For example, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> offers over 750 generally available instances—more than any other major cloud provider—and you can choose from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/decision-guides/databases-on-aws-how-to-choose/">numerous relational, analytics, key-value, document, or graph databases</a>.</p> 
       <p>We believe this choice must include the one to migrate your data to another cloud provider or on-premises. That’s why, starting today, we’re waiving data transfer out to the internet (DTO) charges when you want to move outside of AWS.</p> 
       <p>Over 90 percent of our customers already incur no data transfer expenses out of AWS because <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-free-tier-data-transfer-expansion-100-gb-from-regions-and-1-tb-from-amazon-cloudfront-per-month/">we provide 100 gigabytes per month free from AWS Regions to the internet</a>. This includes traffic from Amazon EC2, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html">Application Load Balancer</a>, among others. In addition, we offer one terabyte of free data transfer out of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> every month.</p> 
       <p>If you need more than 100 gigabytes of data transfer out per month while transitioning, you can contact <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">AWS Support</a> to ask for free DTO rates for the additional data. It’s necessary to go through support because you make hundreds of millions of data transfers each day, and we generally do not know if the data transferred out to the internet is a normal part of your business or a one-time transfer as part of a switch to another cloud provider or on premises.</p> 
       <p>We will review requests at the AWS account level. Once approved, we will provide credits for the data being migrated. We don’t require you to close your account or change your relationship with AWS in any way. You’re welcome to come back at any time. We will, of course, apply additional scrutiny if the same AWS account applies multiple times for free DTO.</p> 
       <p>We believe in customer choice, including the choice to move your data out of AWS. The waiver on data transfer out to the internet charges also follows the direction set by the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/european-data-act-enters-force-putting-place-new-rules-fair-and-innovative-data-economy">European Data Act</a> and is available to all AWS customers around the world and from any AWS Region.</p> 
       <p>Freedom of choice is not limited to data transfer rates. AWS also supports <a href="https://www.fairsoftware.cloud/principles/">Fair Software Licensing Principles</a>, which make it easy to use software with other IT providers of your choice. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/promoting-customer-choice-aws-takes-another-step-to-lower-costs-for-customers-changing-it-providers/">You can read this blog post for more details.</a></p> 
       <p>You can check the<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#Data_transfer_fees_when_moving_all_data_off_AWS"> FAQ for more information</a>, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">you can contact AWS Customer Support</a> to request credits for DTO while switching.</p> 
       <p>But I sincerely hope you will not.</p>
