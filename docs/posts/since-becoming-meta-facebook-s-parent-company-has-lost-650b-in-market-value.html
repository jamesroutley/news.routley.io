    <h1>Since becoming Meta, Facebook’s parent company has lost $650B in market value</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Article text">
					<p>It has been exactly one year to the day since <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s</a> parent company rebranded as <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a>, and in that time the company has entered <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-in-freefall-5-charts-that-show-metas-financial-collapse-11666957691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial free-fall</a>, analysts say.</p><img src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"/>
<p>Comparing the market values of Meta when it was first announced on Oct 28, 2021 to today, the company has shrunk by an astonishing US$650 billion.</p><p>Shares in Meta crashed 24 per cent on Thursday, to $97.94, sinking its stock to the lowest it’s been in nearly four years. <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9230262/metas-facebook-stock-whats-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The event cost Meta about US$67 billion</a>, adding to the more than half a trillion dollars in value lost in 2022 alone. Meta’s market cap now stands at $263 billion. They are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/meta-is-no-longer-one-of-the-20-biggest-us-companies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued lowered than Home Depot</a> and have been forced out of the ranks of the top 20 companies.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, saw his own personal fortune <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2022/10/27/mark-zuckerbergs-fortune-dropped-11-billion-todayand-is-down-100-billion-since-metas-stock-peaked/?sh=559c711e3abb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drop US$11 billion</a> after the stock plummet, according to Forbes, who downgraded him from 25th richest person in the world to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#127503003d78" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29th richest</a> at the market close on Thursday.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>

		</div><p>The incident echoes a previous crash in February which saw about <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8591438/facebook-meta-stock-plunge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 billion in Meta’s market value erased</a> — the biggest loss in market value ever recorded for a U.S. company.</p><p>Since changing its name to Meta and investing heavily to create the “metaverse,” a virtual reality world, Facebook’s parent company has been plagued with woes. From the start of 2022 to now, the company has shed 70 per cent of its value.</p><p>At this time last year, on the day that Facebook rebranded as Meta, the company’s market cap was just over $900 billion. Just weeks before it had reached its peak value of over $1 trillion, joining an exclusive club consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. The company was riding high.</p><p>Now, one year on, Meta is hopping from crisis to crisis.</p><div data-shortcode="readmore">		<p>

	<p>Later in July, Meta reported its <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9021208/facebook-parent-company-meta-first-revenue-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first ever revenue decline</a>, brought down by a drop in ad spending as the economy began to drag. Competition for ad revenue has also been heating up with Meta’s largest competitor in the social media space, TikTok.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
			
			
			

					
		</div>	<p>Another problem: recent privacy changes by Apple are making it harder for companies like Meta to track people for advertising purposes. Forbes reported that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2022/02/10/apple-meta-and-the-ten-billion-dollar-impact-of-privacy-changes/?sh=35e9f74972ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple’s changes cost Meta around $10 billion in ad revenue</a>.</p><div data-shortcode="readmore">		<p>

			</div><p>All of these factors have been working together to slow Meta’s earnings and they also lead us to this week, when Meta’s stock came crashing down again.</p><p>Similar to the massive one-day loss seen on Feb. 2, Meta’s stock crash on Thursday was <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9230262/metas-facebook-stock-whats-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triggered by a weak revenue report</a>, predicting a 50-per cent decline in profits, with plans to maintain their high spending on building out the metaverse — to the sum of around $87 billion, that will increase to around $100 billion next year.</p><p>There seems to be conflict between Meta and its investors, who see the metaverse as a money pit and are calling for the company to cut costs as the economy slows, while Zuckerberg bets it all on his virtual reality tech.</p><div data-shortcode="readmore">		<p>

		</div>	<p>Meta set a goal of having 500,000 monthly active users for Horizon Worlds, its virtual reality platform, but a leaked report found that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-zuckerberg-facebook-internal-documents-11665778961?mod=hp_lead_pos1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company achieved less than half that</a>, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The report also found that most metaverse users didn’t return to the program again after the first month.</p><p>“An empty world is a sad world,” one person noted, according to the report.</p><p>It seems that if Meta wants to become a leader in the next generation of tech, they’re going to have to work to convince both investors and consumers.</p><div data-shortcode="tp_video_miniplayer">		<section id="miniplayer_635d1cf88235e-carousel" data-video-carousel-play-inline="true" data-video-carousel-init="false" aria-label="Video carousel contains 3 videos.
