    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/11/what_is_power_in_business.jpg" alt="What is Power?"><p><em>This is Part One in a short series on Power in Business.</em></p><p>We&#x2019;re about to start on a series on Asian conglomerates here on Commoncog. If you&#x2019;ve been following along, you should be familiar with the concept of <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/concepts/capital-allocation/">Capital Allocation</a>, which we first talked about in the <a href="https://commoncog.com/capital-expertise-in-business-series/">Capital Expertise series</a> with <a href="https://commoncog.com/build-valuable-business-how-you-spend-it/">Building a Valuable Business? It&#x2019;s How You Spend It That Matters</a>. We&#x2019;ve just concluded an entire sequence of cases on (mostly Western) businesspeople who are very good at capital allocation; this sets us up for comparisons to Asian conglomerators who do &#x2026; different things.</p><p>Before we start with our series, however, we need to talk about one last concept, which is necessary to understand the Asian business context.</p><p>We need to talk about power.</p><h2 id="a-simple-definition-of-power">A Simple Definition of Power</h2><p>What is power? Here is my definition, one that we&#x2019;re going to use for the rest of the Asian conglomerate series: <strong>power is controlling something people want</strong>. If you control something that someone else wants, you have power over that person. If that person controls something you want, they have power over you.</p>
