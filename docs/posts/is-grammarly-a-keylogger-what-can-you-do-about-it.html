    <h1>Is Grammarly a keylogger? What can you do about it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Sometimes when I sit down and try to write, the words don&#39;t flow. The sentences
are clumsy, the words bump into each other, and I always have the sneaking
suspicion that there is a more straightforward way to get my point across. I
just can&#39;t always get there on my own.</p>

<p>Enter Grammarly.</p>

<p>Their pitch? Forget that D+ you got in 9th Grade English 20
years ago; we will make you sound compelling, concise, —and let&#39;s face it— <em>smarter</em>.
Their cheerful videos provide persuasive examples of this value proposition in
action, as pithy phrases (which all too closely resemble my writing skills) are
transformed like Cinderella into glamourous ball-room dancing maxims for the
ages.</p>

<p>But just like Cinderella, there&#39;s always a catch. The problem, it seems, is that
Grammarly is only willing to perform this magic trick on <em>their</em> cloud.
That means, every. single. bit. of. text. you want improved is sent to them.
As an individual, you may be all too willing to agree to that bargain. But
what about businesses and IT teams? How do they evaluate Grammarly? On the one
hand, it&#39;s a tool potentially beloved by your users, but on the other, it&#39;s a
potential nightmare for keeping your secrets, well... secret! Is this any
different than the same bargain offered by other cloud-based word processors or
chat tools?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s figure it out.</p>



<p>No one wants their product to be called a keylogger. The term evokes images of
creeps installing malware on devices for the express purpose of surveillance
and password harvesting. Yet, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging">explicit definition</a>, any tool that logs a user&#39;s
keystrokes and sends them to a third party <em>is technically</em> a keylogger.</p>

<p>This must come up a lot for Grammarly <a href="https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003816032-Is-Grammarly-a-keylogger">because they have an official response
to the question right on their support page</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a direct quote (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grammarly does not record every keystroke you make on your device. Grammarly
<strong>accesses only the text you write when you are actively using a Grammarly
product offering</strong>: The product <strong>checks only the text you want it to</strong>
and provides writing suggestions. Additionally, <strong>Grammarly&#39;s product is blocked
from accessing text in fields marked &#34;sensitive.&#34;</strong> This means that
Grammarly&#39;s desktop applications and mobile keyboards do not see anything
typed in credit card forms, password fields, URL fields, email address
fields, or fields where similar private information is provided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, this is <em>an</em> answer, but as we will see later, it vastly
oversimplifies how Grammarly captures text in practice. Grammarly is
essentially saying that it is not a keylogger because the user
chooses when Grammarly can receive text, and Grammarly provides value. It&#39;s an
answer carefully built around a technicality.</p>

<p>Sebastian breaks it down much better:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grammarly *IS* a keylogger. They try to dodge it by
  saying &#34;Grammarly accesses only the text you write while using our product&#34; <a href="https://t.co/50BXX9r6uu">https://t.co/50BXX9r6uu</a></p>— Sebastian (@sebmck) <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck/status/1104132995026317312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a>
</blockquote>



<p>Here&#39;s the problem: Grammarly&#39;s framing of the question isn&#39;t helpful.
When people ask, &#34;Is Grammarly a keylogger?&#34; they are really asking,
&#34;Am I going to regret using this service?&#34; To answer that question as a
security practitioner, here are some things I would want to know:</p>

<ol>
<li>What methods does Grammarly use to capture text I write?</li>
<li>What sensitive data could be captured inadvertently?</li>
<li>What is Grammarly allowed to do with the text that they capture?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s find out.</p>



<p>Grammarly offers a variety of products under their
branding. If I want to use Grammarly, the options include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A web-based document editor</li>
<li>A web-browser extension</li>
<li>An app-specific add-in (ex: Microsoft Word)</li>
<li>A custom installable keyboard (for mobile devices)</li>
<li><strong>An app running on your OS</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Each one of these methods comes with different risks and tradeoffs. Today
I want to focus on what is likely the most popular method of utilizing
Grammarly, running it as an app on your device. Since I run macOS, let&#39;s
dig into that one.</p>

<p>On macOS, when you install Grammarly, you are first presented with a screen
that looks like this:</p>

<p><img lazy="true" alt="A screenshot of the installation screen for the macOS version of the Grammarly app. The screenshot asks the user to add Grammarly to the list of apps with accessibility permissions and offers a button to kick off that process." srcset="https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMm5BQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--421504eb58f1dbda58d22be8161c5a8d2caf9ac8/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCem9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLOEFqQT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--343c432766cf7fb7124a97b71f7dcb67600f4230/grammarly-install-start.png 350w, https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMm5BQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--421504eb58f1dbda58d22be8161c5a8d2caf9ac8/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCem9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFMSUJUQT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--5705461acfe83bab09b919f3e8eb190969e95f72/grammarly-install-start.png 740w, https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMm5BQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--421504eb58f1dbda58d22be8161c5a8d2caf9ac8/grammarly-install-start.png " src="https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMm5BQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--421504eb58f1dbda58d22be8161c5a8d2caf9ac8/grammarly-install-start.png" data-zoomable="true"/></p>

<p>And then helpfully pops up the following screen:</p>

<p><img lazy="true" alt="A screenshot of the System Preferences app showing the Security pane. On the bottom of the app Grammarly has anchored its own window with arrows that direct the user to unlock the pane and check the box next to Grammarly which will instantly grant it the accessibility permissions." srcset="https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnJBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7867f474b29293226f875515464cda0dd6df2f3b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCem9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLOEFqQT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--343c432766cf7fb7124a97b71f7dcb67600f4230/grammarly-permissions-ask.png 350w, https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnJBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7867f474b29293226f875515464cda0dd6df2f3b/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCem9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFMSUJUQT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--5705461acfe83bab09b919f3e8eb190969e95f72/grammarly-permissions-ask.png 740w, https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnJBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7867f474b29293226f875515464cda0dd6df2f3b/grammarly-permissions-ask.png " src="https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnJBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7867f474b29293226f875515464cda0dd6df2f3b/grammarly-permissions-ask.png" data-zoomable="true"/></p>

<p>Grammarly is briskly moving you through this process because their
app cannot function as designed unless it has these specific accessibility
permissions.</p>

<p>But why would a grammar app need accessibility permissions? It turns out that
accessibility permissions are like the Holy Grail of permission entitlements.
Accessibility permissions allow approved apps to fully control the entire
computer as if they were sitting next to you, watching your screen, and holding
their hand on top of yours while you typed on the keyboard and moved the mouse.</p>

<p>Based on my brief usage of the app, in practice, this means:</p>

<ol>
<li>Capturing all of the text inside any application used by the user.</li>
<li>Capturing new keystrokes entered into any other app.</li>
<li>Augmenting/Manipulating the UI of other apps in focus.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once this permission is granted, Grammarly can now capture text and send it
back to its servers without <em>any further user interaction</em>. No other permissions
or extensions are needed.</p>

<p>Revisiting <a href="https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003816032-Is-Grammarly-a-keylogger">the keylogger answer</a>
from earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#34;...Grammarly accesses only the text you write when you are actively using a
Grammarly product offering.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my reading, Grammarly heavily implies that users have a fair degree of
control over what Grammarly can access. But in practice, <strong>this is very
misleading</strong>. Let me show you why.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Below, I have composed a new note in Notes.app riddled with grammatical errors.
I did not have Grammarly running while writing the document, so
there isn&#39;t any possibility that keystrokes have been sent to them.</p>

<p><img lazy="true" alt="The Notes.app with various grammatically incorrect sentences." srcset="https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnZBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2b846578bdd0d3a32e05ef9677364477429afe5d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCem9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLOEFqQT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--343c432766cf7fb7124a97b71f7dcb67600f4230/grammarly-notes-pre-run.png 350w, https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnZBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2b846578bdd0d3a32e05ef9677364477429afe5d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCem9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFMSUJUQT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--5705461acfe83bab09b919f3e8eb190969e95f72/grammarly-notes-pre-run.png 740w, https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnZBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2b846578bdd0d3a32e05ef9677364477429afe5d/grammarly-notes-pre-run.png " src="https://www-assets.kolide.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnZBQ0E9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2b846578bdd0d3a32e05ef9677364477429afe5d/grammarly-notes-pre-run.png" data-zoomable="true"/></p>

<p>After running the Grammarly app, re-granting the accessibility permission,
and then putting the app in focus, the screen looks like the following:</p>

<figcaption>Grammarly processes text that was already entered in the window</figcaption>

<p>Grammarly parsed and marked up my document without me typing a single
keystroke. All I needed to do was bring the window into the foreground.
This makes sense; Grammarly would not be easy to use if it could only provide
grammar advice on the documents and words you typed when it was running. I&#39;m
not even sure how much Grammarly even cares about the keystrokes you&#39;re typing;
if it can read what was written previously, it does not need to.</p>

<p>That being said, I believe it is stretching credulity when they
say, &#34;Grammarly accesses only the text you write when you are actively using a
Grammarly product offering.&#34;</p>

<p>This is a big problem when it comes to claims that users have control. As a
user, I had no way to know that the instant I opened the Notes.app Grammarly
would swoop in, scrape all the text, and send it to their servers. Now that I
know a document was scraped, I can tell Grammarly to stop doing that in the
future, but the cat is already out of the bag. As far as I can tell, there is
no easy way to preemptively block Grammarly from accessing apps without you
first allowing it to activate in the app and performing the block in-situ.</p>

<p>How do I know when and where Grammarly will even activate? It&#39;s  impracticable
(perhaps impossible?) to tell until it&#39;s already happened. This lack of consent
is fundamentally dishonest.</p>



<p>Now that we know Grammarly can capture text by reading the content of the apps
in focus, how do we know it won&#39;t collect sensitive information? <a href="https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003835311-Does-Grammarly-s-product-read-everything-I-write-">From their
support page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...Grammarly is blocked from accessing anything you type in text fields marked
&#34;sensitive,&#34; such as credit card forms or password fields. You can deactivate
Grammarly at any time if you don&#39;t want it to check a particular piece of text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds great on the surface, but let&#39;s dig in. First, what in practice
constitutes a sensitive field? Their support only offers two obvious examples
password fields and credit cards, but what about Social Security Numbers?</p>

<p>Here I&#39;ve constructed a simple form with the following markup:</p>
<div><pre data-controller="blog--copy-code"><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>&#34;input text optional marketing_sales_contact_request_ssn&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;label</span> <span>class=</span><span>&#34;text optional&#34;</span> <span>for=</span><span>&#34;marketing_sales_contact_request_ssn&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
    Please enter Social Security Number (SSN)
  <span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;textarea</span> <span>class=</span><span>&#34;text optional&#34;</span> <span>name=</span><span>&#34;marketing_sales_contact_request[ssn]&#34;</span> <span>id=</span><span>&#34;marketing_sales_contact_request_ssn&#34;</span><span>&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here is what happens when I click into the resulting form in my browser
with the Grammarly app installed on macOS:</p>

<p>See that Grammarly widget? That means despite the words &#34;Social Security Number&#34;
and &#34;SSN&#34; appearing multiple times in the markup, Grammarly instantly activates
as soon as I put focus into the text area. It seems as long as something is a
<code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> and not a single-line input field, Grammarly is all too eager to
activate and pull down something potentially sensitive.</p>

<p>The above example may be contrived
(unless you use many poorly programmed sites from local governments),
but it demonstrates a more significant point. <strong>There is no way to know
when and why Grammarly will activate</strong>. And when it does, it&#39;s already
too late.</p>



<p>Grammarly&#39;s support page Q&amp;A is helpful, but there are no guarantees (or likely even
consequences) if it&#39;s inaccurate. That&#39;s not true in the
<a href="https://www.grammarly.com/privacy-policy#does-grammarly-review-user-content">Privacy Policy</a>,
a legal document that they enter with each user of their service.
Because of this, we are far more likely to get an accurate picture.</p>

<p>Here are some salient excerpts (emphasis mine)</p>

<h2 id="user-content-is-collected">User Content <em>Is</em> Collected</h2>

</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s clear that once Grammarly has its hands-on &#34;User Content,&#34; it stores it,
makes it accessible to certain privileged employees, and can share that
information with others (like law enforcement) if compelled via legal means.
Also, interestingly, since they claim they may need to access &#34;User Content&#34;
during support interactions, it heavily implies that this data is associated
with your account.</p>

<p>Putting my Corporate Governance cap on, imagine a competitor suing you. They
ask the judge to subpoena all available information related to
conversations about them and your resulting strategy. Even if you only
retain logs/emails for a short period, if the opposing counsel believed a few
key employees had Grammarly, they could produce copies of documents
(conversations, emails, papers) that were not accessible through any other
means. That&#39;s a huge deal.</p>



<p>There are many ways to use Grammarly, the browser extension, the app, and
even a web-based tool. Except for the web-based tool, they all
suffer from the same underlying problem, lack of ongoing consent to collect
the data they need to perform their service.</p>

<figcaption>The web-editor is the safest bet because you can control what is entered.</figcaption>

<p>As a result, any company with users who use Grammarly should react swiftly
to educate users about the above risks. If users don&#39;t want to lose
the benefit, the web editor is your safest bet because they can ensure that the
program can&#39;t access any data or content except what the user types or pastes
onto the web pages. This method gives you the most control over what the
application can record.</p>



<p>As I imply as part of my <a href="https://honest.security">Honest Security</a> guide,
banning employees from using tools that can help them do their job better is
not an approach that works in practice.</p>

<p>If you ban popular tools like Grammarly, people could be moving their work to
personal devices. Then, you&#39;ll have less visibility into what&#39;s happening within
your fleet, which can quickly turn into an IT nightmare.</p>

<p>Shedding the security role for a moment, let&#39;s think empathetically. For some,
a tool like Grammarly is just a nice-to-have capability that allows them to
write more professionally. Still, for others, it&#39;s an essential tool that will
enable them to do something they could not do by themselves. Grammarly
<a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/five-tools-dyslexic-people-can-use-to-improve-their-writing/">has a great guest blog article about this</a>
by Nelson Lauver, who is diagnosed with dyslexia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my twenty-one years as a writer, <strong>I have found Grammarly to be the single
most valuable tool</strong> for making me a better writer. I recognized its benefits
instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is genuine praise that should not go ignored. Imagine what could happen
if the IT team blocks access to this essential tool. Now we have an employee
who cannot do their job and perhaps feels much less confident
communicating. This could be the push they need to start looking for a new job
or, worse, drive them to start using a personal laptop without this restriction.</p>

<p>This is why IT leaders in charge of these decisions need to think
in shades of gray. Instead of using automated blocking software to enforce
these decisions (and falling into <a href="https://www.kolide.com/blog/end-security-obstructionism-with-security-automation-orchestration">the Security Obstructionism trap</a>),
we need to find a way to have conversations with end-users
about these policies. We should allow them to provide input back to us and find
compromises so that people like Nelson can have access to the valuable parts
of the tools they rely on.</p>

<p>Grammarly and tools like it can make a world of
difference for users with disabilities. Dismissing these uses cases means
failing to show end-users empathy. This doesn&#39;t mean making decisions that
compromise security in a way the IT team is uncomfortable with--instead
having a conversation with users that shows genuine interest in finding a
solution that works for all sides.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons we built Kolide for IT teams to message end-users
directly on Slack. This allows IT teams to communicate to an end-user running
a tool like Grammarly <em>why</em> it may be an issue, tell them how to remove it,
and more importantly, offer a reasonable alternative solution so they can
still enjoy a significant portion of the benefits.</p>

<p>We think this is a much better, honest, and user-first approach than
barring the use of a potentially practical application like Grammarly.</p>
