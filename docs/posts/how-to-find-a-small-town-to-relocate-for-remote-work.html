    <h1>Ask HN: How to find a small town to relocate for remote work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Curious to hear the community’s perspective on where our next move should be.<p>I’m an engineering manager at a fully remote US company with long-term plans to stay (and even if not, no desire to return to the office regularly). I don’t drive but like to walk to the supermarket and restaurants. My wife doesn’t like living in a big city, so we’re in the burbs within walking distance of a little “downtown” area.</p><p>It’s a bit of an unhappy medium because the homes we want still cost $1M, yet it’s a long and limited walk. Plus we’re ready for something new. We’d likely both be happier in a town, living just off some Main Street with 20 or so shops. The city is great but honestly I don’t need more than a good diner, a supermarket, and a friendly bar. Nice to haves are a pleasant climate (not too cold), an airport within an hour or so, and decent public schools.</p><p>I’m asking here because I hear so much about NYC/SF tech workers being set loose by remote work and leaving. I’ve experienced this with colleagues relocating to SC, Lancaster PA, small towns in Maryland… etc.</p><p>Any ideas on whether this mid-sized town dream exists, ideas for cities, and/or how we’d go about finding it?</p></td></div></div>
