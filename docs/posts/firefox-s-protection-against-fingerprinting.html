    <h1>Firefox&#39;s protection against fingerprinting</h1>

      <p>Like other browsers, Firefox’s functionality is influenced by your operating system, hardware, graphics cards, additional software, and even the fonts you install. Some website technologies, like HTML5 Canvas, can even uniquely identify you based on how your computer draws images.
</p><p>Some websites, particularly those using HTML5 Canvas, look at this unique combination of factors and assign you a number, or a “fingerprint”, which makes you identifiable across the Web. This “fingerprint” is potentially used to profile you for targeted content without the use of cookies.
</p><p>
Firefox already has <span data-for="fx70">an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a></span><span data-for="not fx70">a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/en-US/kb/content-blocking">Content Blocking</a></span> feature that blocks a list of known &#34;fingerprinters&#34; when your privacy settings are set to <span data-for="fx72">Standard (the default) or </span>Strict. <strong>Fingerprinting Protection</strong> is a different, experimental feature under heavy development in Firefox. It is likely that it may degrade your Web experience so we recommend it only for those willing to test experimental features.
</p>

<p>If a website tries to extract your data, Firefox will warn you with a prompt in the address bar. You can choose whether to allow the website to extract your data. This is the most common way to observe this protection.

<p>However, the Canvas Permission Prompt is not the only thing that Fingerprinting Protection is doing. Fingerprinting Detection changes how you are detected online:
</p>
<ul><li>Your timezone is reported to be UTC 
</li><li>Not all fonts installed on your computer are available to webpages
</li><li>The browser window prefers to be set to a specific size
</li><li>Your browser reports a specific, common version number and operating system
</li><li>Your keyboard layout and language is disguised
</li><li>Your webcam and microphone capabilities are disguised
</li><li>The Media Statistics Web API reports misleading information
</li><li>Any Site-Specific Zoom settings are not applied
</li><li>The WebSpeech, Gamepad, Sensors, and Performance Web APIs are disabled
</li></ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list - other features may be altered or disabled.</p>

<p>Currently, Fingerprinting Protection is an experimental feature enabled by a confirmation flag set in about:config. It can also be enabled by Web Extensions.
</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Changing advanced preferences can affect Firefox&#39;s stability and security. This is recommended for <strong>advanced users only</strong>.</p>

<ol><li>Type <strong>about:config</strong> in the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar">address bar</a> and press <span data-for="win,linux"><span>Enter</span></span><span data-for="mac"><span>Return</span></span>.</li><li>Search for <span>privacy.resistFingerprinting</span> and see if it is bolded and set to <span>true</span>. If so, you, or an extension you installed, has enabled this preference. You can double-click the preference<span data-for="fx71"> or click the <em>Toggle</em> <img alt="Fx71aboutconfig-ToggleButton" data-original-src="https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/gallery/images/2019-10-29-08-56-36-b0ab10.png" src="https://static-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/static/placeholder.688345f843bb37ed.gif" title=""/> button</span> to toggle the setting.
</li></ol>
<p>If you discover the setting has become re-enabled, it is likely a Web Extension you have installed is setting it for you.
