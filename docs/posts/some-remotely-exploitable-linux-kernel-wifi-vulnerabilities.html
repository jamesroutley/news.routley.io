It would appear that there is <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/oss-security/20221013101046.GB20615@suse.de/">a set of
memory-related vulnerabilities</a> in the kernel&#39;s WiFi stack that can be
exploited over the air via malicious packets; five CVE numbers have been
assigned to the set.  Fixes are headed toward the
mainline and should show up in stable updates before too long; anybody who
uses WiFi on untrusted networks should probably keep an eye out for the
relevant updates.</p></div> <!-- ArticleText -->

Doing a quick look (the last commit in the series is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wireless/wireless.git/commit/?h=wireless-2022-10-13&amp;id=c90b93b5b782891ebfda49d4e5da36632fefd5d1">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wireless/...</a> and you can follow the &#34;parent&#34; links for the rest), and looking at the Fixes: lines for them, it seems the commits being fixed are from the first quarter of 2019. So yeah, unfortunately old enough.<br/>

It&#39;s going to be fun watching all of the Android OEMs who never update anything try to get their shit together for this.<br/>

Excellent! This should help with installing libre distros on non-GPL-compliant devices. Of course there are lots of other Linux kernel and firmware exploits for that too.</p></div>

I found a bug like this in MacOS years ago, where the device would get into a reboot loop and couldnâ€™t even make it to recovery mode due to parsing a particular WiFi probe response, but I had to go through a backchannel due to my employer. Apple security stonewalled me so I just kept checking to see if a new release fixed the issue and four years later it finally did.<br/>
