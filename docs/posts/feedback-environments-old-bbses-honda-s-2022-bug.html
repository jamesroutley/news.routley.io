    <h1>Feedback: environments, old BBSes, Honda&#39;s 2022 bug</h1>
    
    
<p>
Yep, it's time for another round of reader feedback.
</p><p>
An anonymous reader writes in response to the
<a href="/w/2022/02/09/nice/">"process infection" story:</a>
</p><p>
<blockquote>
comment: Hi! Loved your recent post on environment inheritence, and the 
note about system's approach reminded me of something relevant that 
Pottering recently wrote aboit the on the Fedora mailing list 
(highlighted in LWN's article on Fedora and pkexec @ 
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/">https://lwn.net/Articles/883547/</a>):
</p><p>
<blockquote>
The thing with setuid/setgid is that the invoked privileged process 
inherits a lot of implicit state and context that people aren't really 
aware of or fully understand. i.e. it's not just env vars and argv[], 
it's cgroup memberships, audit fields, security contexts, open fds, 
child pids, parent pids, cpu masks, IO/CPU scheduling priorities, 
various prctl() settings, tty control, signal masks + handlers, … and so 
on. And it's not even clear what gets inherited as many of these process 
properties are added all the time.
</p><p>
If you do privileged execution of specific operations via IPC you get 
the guarantee that whatever is done, is done from a well-defined, 
pristine execution environment, without leaking context implicitly. The 
IPC message is the *full* vulnerable surface, and that's as minimal as 
it can get. And that's great.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p><p>
[Yep, that's a nested blockquote.  Because why not.]
</p><p>
Oh wow, thank you for mentioning that, unnamed reader!  I definitely 
read that post on LWN at some point in the past couple of days when the 
pkexec thing started going around.  It must have really worked its way 
into my head, and then eventually stirred up the memory of everything 
getting "nicely infected" at $OLD_JOB.
</p><p>
It's really a nasty situation if you think about it.  There is a 
ridiculous amount of state out there, and nobody really knows what all 
of it is.  We try to fool ourselves with these namespace hacks on Linux 
that some people call "containers", but they aren't the full story and 
probably never will be.
</p><p>
Every time I talk about trying to partition a machine at this level, I 
can hear my dad the retired mainframe programmer laughing at us all.  
Those machines knew a thing or two about actually dividing themselves 
into useful smaller pieces.  Right now, on these dumb little (x86[_64]) 
boxes, we're still just playing with toys by comparison.
</p><p>
Imagine how nasty it is to have to fork + exec to start a subprocess 
just so you can run something and find out how it turns out.  It runs 
afoul of multi-threaded locking and all kinds of other things that you 
aren't "allowed" to run post-fork and pre-exec, lest you trip over one 
of the many, many potholes and bear traps we've left behind.
</p><p>
Just think if you could say "something, please run X for me, and let me 
poke it with long sticks over stdin/stdout, and let me know when it 
finishes, and how it finished".  Kind of like inetd, but for purely 
local invocations of various things, right?
</p><p>
At that point, would you even need to run everything as the same uid?  I 
bet you wouldn't.  You could wall off your web browser from your mail 
client from your music player from your USB-powered mug warmer 
controlled  from... you get the idea.
</p><p>
Anyway, it just goes to show that sometimes it takes a good LWN post to 
trigger a memory to get me to post about something myself.
</p><p>
...
</p><p>
Regarding the 
<a href="/w/2022/01/26/swcbbs/">SWC BBS picture,</a>
another reader had this to say:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
That picture of the BBS that ran on all those PCs just reminded 
that in the same period, the well BBS ran 64 phone lines off of one 
sequent with 1.6 GB of RAM.  Sure, it cost 25,000 1990 dollars, and they 
used it as their primary heat source for their office in Sausalito, but 
it strikes me as a much better setup than a bunch of PCs running DOS.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
That brings back some memories.  Now, I never called it, but even I had 
somehow managed to hear about it through the grapevine of what passed 
for a social environment back then in those dialup days.  For those 
who haven't crossed paths with this thing, it stood for (stands for?)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL">"Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link"</a>.
</p><p>
So at a glance, $25K of 1990 dollars sounds crazy high, right?  You 
could buy a really nice car for that much money back then.  For
reference purposes, apparently that translates to about $53-54K here 32 
years later.
</p><p>
Anyway, it sounds like a lot, but would it have been, really?  All of 
those PCs in there must have cost a pretty penny too.  Unless they were 
buying the absolute cheapest crap at wholesale prices, I have to imagine 
that having that many computers around would have cost a similar amount.  
</p><p>
Maybe what happened is that it crept up on them.  Maybe they had four or 
five, then five or ten... then a dozen... then two... then thirty... 
fifty... and the next thing you know, you are wrangling a "cluster" of 
MS-DOS machines.  THE HORROR!
</p><p>
I'd have to dig around old magazines to get a feel for how much this 
stuff cost back in the day.  I mean, I know what my family's machine 
cost, and it was not cheap.  In the fall of 1989, we got a 386DX-25 with 
4 MB of memory (expandable to 8), an 80 MB SCSI (!) drive, both sorts of 
high-density floppy (5.25", 3.5"), a VGA card and matching monitor, and 
a keyboard.  It came out to an astonishing four thousand dollars... and 
32 cents.
</p><p>
I actually kept the details from that original order form, so here's how 
it broke out.
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>386-25: $1649
<li>80 MB (disk + SCSI controller): $519
<li>1.44 MB FDD: $89 (assuming the other one was in the base price)
<li>VGA (assuming board + monitor): $569
<li>Math coprocessor (20 MHz): $479
<li>4 MB memory: $399
</ul>
</p><p>
That's $3704, and if you multiply that by 1.08, you get $4000.32 on the 
nose.  I guess the local tax rate was 8% back then.  (My dad picked it 
out, and he apparently spared no expense.  Wild.)
</p><p>
Now, for a node of a BBS, you could skip the fancypants display, and go 
with the absolute cheapest POS you could get which would still let the 
machine boot.  (It has to have SOME video card to placate the BIOS.)  
Grab some garbage CGA or MDA card from a machine that's going to be 
scrapped.  It's not going to be hooked to a monitor for very long so who 
cares?
</p><p>
You wouldn't need either sort of floppy drive, so drop those from the 
bill of materials.  (Yeah, the "BOM".  You pick up some interesting 
terms when working at some of these places.  Don't say this one out loud 
in an airport or on a plane, okay?)
</p><p>
I'd hope that you wouldn't need a math coprocessor to run a BBS, even if 
it had some nutty door games, so drop that right there.
</p><p>
If it was netbooting, then maybe you could do without a hard drive too?
Those Netware-friendly NICs could have PROMs put on them to boot 
straight off the network, so no hard drive and no SCSI controller.
</p><p>
At this point you basically have a motherboard, a processor, some 
amount of memory, a really crappy video card, and a serial port, 
right?  Maybe you could go really cheap on those?  Maybe you don't 
need a 386, and can use a 286 or even an 8088.  How much would it cost, 
anyway?
</p><p>
Here's the catch: to come in under $25K (the cost of the WELL mentioned 
above) with the 64 machines shown in the picture, each one would have to 
cost no more than $390 each.  (390 x 64 ~= 25000).  Could you get below 
that? 
</p><p>
Then you find out that they either had twice as many machines, or were 
doubling up on some with multitasking.  That either means now you have 
to make 128+ lines in that $25K (so about $195 per node), or you have to 
somehow get enough CPU + RAM to make the multitasking "work" on them.
</p><p>
All of this is just me guessing out loud, because feedback posts are 
entirely off the cuff with no real planning.  This is as close as you'll 
get to me doing improv for you here, I guess.
</p><p>
I wonder how much money actually went into some of this stuff.
</p><p>
Oh, before I forget: that whole thing where it creeps up on you, and you 
go from having 5 of them, to 10, to 20, to 50...?  Yeah, that's pretty 
much what happens when you let your software people ship whatever they 
want to "THE CLOUD" and let it just autoscale forever.
</p><p>
If you don't have someone like
<a href="/w/2020/05/06/scale/">my friend the badass capacity engineer</a>
keeping people honest at your company, your laziest software people will 
bleed you to death, and the cloud vendors will love them for it.
</p><p>
...
</p><p>
Next up, a bit of older feedback that I'm only now getting around to, 
sorry about that.  In response to the New Year's Day post about
<a href="/w/2022/01/01/baddate/">2022 overflowing signed 32 bit integers,</a>
a reader says:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
comment: This could be another instance:
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.crvownersclub.com/threads/clock-fault-year-2022-note-this-is-not-a-gps-related-issue-merged-master-thread.224326/">(crvownersclub link)</a>
</p><p>
Although, on page six someone quotes Honda as saying “We have escalated 
the NAVI Clock Issue to our Engineering Team and they have informed us 
that you will experience issue from Jan 2022 thru August 2022 and then 
it will auto-correct.”, which doesn’t fit. Others 
however say that Honda told them that a fix would be available sometime 
before August. Game of telephone and all that.
</p><p>
Fun times!
</blockquote>
</p><p>
This one just blows my mind.  I read through the posts and tried to make 
sense of it and tried to figure out just what they could have possibly 
screwed up to make this happen, and how the "auto-correct" could 
possibly happen as well.  I still don't quite understand.
</p><p>
I'm hoping that someone will take this apart and will explain what's 
actually going on here.  I'm sure it'll be another tale of awful, awful 
things about timekeeping that leads a bunch of people to drink (as 
usual).  That's pretty much what you expect with that kind of story.
</p><p>
I hadn't heard about this one prior to this feedback, so thank you to 
that reader for mentioning it!
