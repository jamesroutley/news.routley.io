    <h1>Data-Driven Development Is a Lie</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>In the Clojure community, people often discuss such things as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming">data-driven
development</a>. It is like you don’t write any code or logic. Instead, you
declare data structures, primarily maps, and whoosh: there is a kind of Deus ex
Machina that evaluates these maps and does the stuff.</p>

<p>That’s OK when newcomers believe in such things. But I feel nervous when even
experienced programmers tell fairy tales about the miracle that DDD brings to
the scene. That’s a lie.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing Clojure for nine years, and DDD is useful in rare cases
only. Yes, in some circumstances, it saves one’s time indeed. But only
sometimes, not always! And it’s unfair: people give talks at conferences about
how successful they were with DDD in their project. But they would never give a
speech about how they messed up by describing everything with maps.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example. Imagine we’re implementing a restriction
system. There is a context, and we must decide whether to allow or prohibit the
incoming request. Obviously, every Clojure developer would do that with maps. We
declare a vector of maps where each map represents a subset of the
context. Should at least one rule match the context, we allow the request.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>RULES</span><span>
  </span><span>[{</span><span>:some-field</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>
    </span><span>:other-field</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>
    </span><span>:third-field</span><span> </span><span>&#34;foobar&#34;</span><span>}</span><span>
   </span><span>{</span><span>:some-field</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>
    </span><span>:other-field</span><span> </span><span>40</span><span>
    </span><span>:third-field</span><span> </span><span>&#34;sample&#34;</span><span>}])</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>matches?</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>select-keys</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>keys</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>))))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>allow?</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>ctx</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>rule</span><span>]</span><span>
          </span><span>(</span><span>matches?</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>))</span><span>
        </span><span>RULES</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Above, the <code>RULES</code> var is declared on top of the module, but ideally, it comes
from an EDN file.</p>

<p>It looks short and solid. Moreover, <a href="https://youtu.be/jlPaby7suOc?t=998">This! Is! Data!</a> The next time a
business wants us to add a new rule, we will extend the vector with a map. At
this point, a programmer who has implemented this gets a ticket to the nearest
conference and gives a speech about their success. This talk gets shared across
the community channels. This is how the cargo cult grows, in fact.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, none of the YouTube talks tells about what happens after the
developer returns from the conference. There are upcoming changes in the logic:
a certain field might have multiple allowed values. For example, the <code>:role</code> is
either an admin or a manager. The developer scratches his head but quickly
finds a solution: let some rule values be a set. If a value is a set, we process
it using the contains? function. Otherwise, the values get compared as usual.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>RULES</span><span>
  </span><span>[{</span><span>:some-field</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>
    </span><span>:other-field</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>
    </span><span>:role</span><span> </span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>&#34;admin&#34;</span><span> </span><span>&#34;manager&#34;</span><span>}}])</span><span>

</span><span>;;; when matching the fields</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>set?</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>contains?</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>k</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>:else</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>k</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good. But in a month, there is a new requirement: negation. Now we allow the
request if the <code>:role</code> field is of any value but not manager. Again, the
developer gets puzzled for a while, but then he finds the solution with the
<code>[:not ...]</code>  clause. If it’s a vector and the first item is <code>:not</code>, we use
<code>not=</code> instead of <code>=</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>RULES</span><span>
  </span><span>[{</span><span>:some-field</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>
    </span><span>:other-field</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>
    </span><span>:role</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>:not</span><span> </span><span>&#34;manager&#34;</span><span>]}])</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>set?</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>

    </span><span>(</span><span>vector?</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>)</span><span>

    </span><span>:else</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>k</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a month, the business asks to add ranges and comparisons. Say, to disallow
the request if the <code>:level</code> field is in range of 3 to 9 (inclusive and
exclusive, pay attention). Here come the <code>[:in :field [3 9]]</code> and <code>[:&lt; field 9]</code>
expressions in an EDN file. The developer gets angry as the house of cards he
has built has turned unstable.</p>

<p>One day, something that he’s been afraid of all this time has finally come. He’s
asked to introduce complex and/or/not logic. If <code>(foo and bar) or (foo and not
this)</code>, allow the request. If <code>(this and that) or (foo and bar)</code>, disallow
it. What is the outcome? Our developer <em>is smart</em> and has brief knowledge about
interpreters, so he considers this a challenge. First, he extends the maps using
<code>[:or ...]</code>, <code>[:and ...]</code> and <code>[:not ...]</code> notation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>:or</span><span>
 </span><span>[</span><span>:and</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>:role</span><span> </span><span>&#34;manager&#34;</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>:in</span><span> </span><span>:level</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>9</span><span>]]]</span><span>
 </span><span>[</span><span>:and</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>:name</span><span> </span><span>&#34;John Smith&#34;</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>:matches</span><span> </span><span>:email</span><span> </span><span>#</span><span>&#34;some@pattern&#34;</span><span>]]]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then he writes a primitive interpreter that walks a tree and processes it
correctly. Of course, he reckons himself a genius. Only he knows how this
interpreter works. There is no documentation; it’s like a meme: I’m the
documentation!</p>

<p>Sarcasm aside, the developer has ended up with a real mess. Although it’s still
a Data-Driven approach indeed, it’s awful. The rules are no longer data but a
poorly designed DSL. The logic used to scan a vector of maps has grown into a
poorly designed interpreter. Both are fragile, buggy, and uneasy to tweak.</p>

<p>Should the programmer really care about the quality of the code, he or she would
notice that the initial idea of relying on data didn’t pay off. At some point,
they should have stopped and said: <strong>we won’t go further with data</strong>. Complex
checks are easier to implement in pure Clojure than crafting an interpreter. But
they’ve committed way too far into this. They’re afraid for their reputation:
they think admitting their mistakes is a sign of weaknesses (although it’s a
sign of strength instead). They’ve watched too many YouTube videos about the
divinity of Data-Driven development, and they’re still looking for a mysterious
Graal.</p>

<p>Everyone who is praying for DDD must bear in mind the law of energy
conservation. Either express the logic in code or declare some data and a
framework that traverses the data and does something. In ordinary Clojure code,
the complexity is distributed evenly. The DDD approach shifts that
balance. Writing a vector of maps takes 5-10% of the total effort, but crafting
a framework that runs that vector is 90-95%. It’s not good for a project when
complexity differs dramatically. A new business requirement might easily hit the
most complex part of the project. Nothing prevents the business from asking to
check regular expressions; or if it’s a leap year; or if the client has a
birthday today; or if their last name is Smith, or similar.</p>

<p>Thus, don’t write DDD frameworks. Don’t grow the complexity of the project. Use
the standard Clojure facilities like functions and maps but not DSL and DDD.</p>

<p>By the way, do you know that DDD has been with us for years? It’s good old XML!
There have been times when developers were obsessed with XML. That markup
language was everywhere: to describe forms, settings, dependencies, workflow,
schemas and even data transformation and logic! Would you like to maintain a
project where every single bit is an XML file?</p>

<p>These days have passed, fortunately. But that weird willingness to describe
everything with EDN reminds me of XML. What is the difference, after all? Both
are definitions only, which is the top of an iceberg. Deep inside, there is a
framework that drives these definitions.</p>

<p>If asked to implement that restriction system, I would start with maps
too. But’d change something as soon as the rules get more complex. I’d make a
rule not map only but a function as well. Say, if it’s a map, I check if it’s a
subset of the context. But if it’s a function, I apply it to the context and
decide on the boolean result:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>RULES</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>;; a simple map case</span><span>
   </span><span>{</span><span>:some-field</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>
    </span><span>:other-field</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>
    </span><span>:third-field</span><span> </span><span>&#34;foobar&#34;</span><span>}</span><span>

   </span><span>;; something more complex</span><span>
   </span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>ctx</span><span>]</span><span>
     </span><span>(</span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>:foo</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>:something</span><span>))</span><span>
              </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>:bar</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>42</span><span>)))</span><span>
         </span><span>(</span><span>some-complex-check</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span>)))])</span><span>


</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>matches?</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>

    </span><span>(</span><span>map?</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>select-keys</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>keys</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>)))</span><span>

    </span><span>(</span><span>fn?</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>rule</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’d even do it in this way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>kv=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>k</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>ctx</span><span>]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>k</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span>)))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>rule</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>every-pred</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>kv=</span><span> </span><span>:foo</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>
              </span><span>(</span><span>kv=</span><span> </span><span>:role</span><span> </span><span>&#34;admin&#34;</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I’d add more primitives for regex, patterns, ranges, etc and compose what I
need from them. In Clojure, functions get composed great!</p>

<p>It’s no longer the data-driven approach, but I don’t care. A function is much
simpler than a map and an interpreter that processes it. With a function, I can
express any logic I want. There is no need to implement negation, <code>or</code>, <code>and</code>
operators and more. We’re already given a great language — Clojure — so why
would you stick with EDN and a poor interpreter?</p>

<p>One may say that DDD is great because it’s about the data. Adding a new rule
boils down to extending an EDN file but not writing code. But in fact, there is
no difference at all. Even if you edit an EDN file, you start a new Git branch,
edit a file, add a new test and create a pull request. The pipeline is the same
as it has to be for the ordinary code. When editing a .clj file, you create a
branch, add a new function, write a test and open a pull request. <strong>Both ways
involve the same steps.</strong></p>

<p>Data-driven development lacks debugging capabilities, and that’s really an
issue. Remember that vector of maps and functions which I proposed above:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>RULES</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>;; a simple map case</span><span>
   </span><span>{</span><span>:some-field</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>
    </span><span>:other-field</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>
    </span><span>:third-field</span><span> </span><span>&#34;foobar&#34;</span><span>}</span><span>

   </span><span>;; something more complex</span><span>
   </span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>ctx</span><span>]</span><span>
     </span><span>(</span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>:foo</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>:something</span><span>))</span><span>
              </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span> </span><span>:bar</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>42</span><span>)))</span><span>
         </span><span>(</span><span>some-complex-check</span><span> </span><span>ctx</span><span>)))])</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Should a function-driven rule behave weirdly, I’d put a debug tag, run a test
and easily debug it. I’d just hang in the middle of the execution of that
function and see all the local vars. I can even try some expressions in
REPL. But how in the world are you going to debug a map? It’s unthinkable
because it’s just data. You cannot blame a map! You need to debug your
framework, which is much harder than debugging a single function. Frameworks
operate on context and lambdas, and debugging them properly requires more
effort.</p>

<p>Talking about debugging, there is such a thing as stack trace. It’s extremely
important when dealing with logged exceptions. Now, if you have a function-based
rule that has failed due to an error, you’re good. You have a message, a file
and a line number pointing to the cause of an exception. But the stack trace
might be completely different if you have a framework that operates with maps
and lambdas. The framework tried to compare to maps, but it failed with
NPE. What were these maps? You’ll never know.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Did you watch Kung Fu Panda? <a href="https://youtu.be/K7DnFGdqT8c?t=10">There is no secret ingredient.</a> That ingredient
is you. I want you to stop looking for a magic trick that would make a job for
you. There is no trick or technique; it’s all about diligence and simplicity.</p>

<p>Keep your code simple, dull and clear. The complexity must be distributed evenly
across the codebase. Avoid various Somethig-Driven approaches and DSLs at all
costs. A series of simple functions is much better in terms of maintainability.</p>

<p>Don’t trust YouTube videos and talks. <strong>Every talk is a staged show</strong> where the
best parts are exposed to the viewer, and the failures are held back. No one
gets to the scene to tell us how they’ve messed up.</p>

<p><strong>Trust yourself only.</strong> If you are really interested in some idea or
technology, test it with your hands. Don’t blindly trust those videos where
speakers say it’s amazing. Instead of sharing such a video, say: I’ve checked
it, and it’s great. Or, I’ve checked it, and it’s not as great as it’s
said. Your own experience is much more valuable than modern trends awareness.</p>

<p>That’s all.</p>
