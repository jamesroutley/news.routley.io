<p>A meditation on humanity’s last edge over AI.</p>
<h2 id="taste-is-art">Taste is art</h2>
<p>Literally interpreted, taste is one of our five senses.</p>
<p>Taste is multidimensional: salty, sweet, savory, sour, fatty,
mouthfeel, trigeminal, aroma.</p>
<p>Taste is balance within dimensions: not too much nor too little.</p>
<p>Taste is balance between dimensions: sweet paired with sour, fat with
acidity.</p>
<p>Taste is necessarily subjective, as a visceral experience, yet also
objective, as people can generally agree which of two comparable dishes
is tastier.</p>
<p>Taste also extends to the other domains. Fine fragrance, painting,
sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, calligraphy, and Go all share
the multidimensional, balanced, subjective, and objective aspects of
taste.</p>
<p>We say someone has taste when they are capable of discerning options
that are more tasteful than others. All other things being equal, people
prefer more tasteful options to less tasteful options.</p>
<h2 id="taste-is-parsimony">Taste is parsimony</h2>
<p>Claude’s coding output is functional, but hardly tasteful. It’s full
of unnecessary comments, unnecessary features, unnecessary layers of
abstraction, lacks organizing philosophy, and generates rampant
conceptual debt.</p>
<p>Within mathematics, mathematicians share an understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s#:~:text=The%20Book">The
Book</a>: an imaginary collection of the simplest, most elegant, most
beautiful, most accessible, most tasteful proofs of every theorem.</p>
<p>Within engineering, engineers share an understanding of tasteful
engineering: systems that fulfill their stated goals, but exceed
expectations on resource efficiency, scalability, expediency, longevity,
versatility, or maintainability, due to a tasteful simplicity in
design.</p>
<p>These are just some of the fields I’m most familiar with.</p>
<p>Machine Learning brings us the concept of <em>regularization</em> - a
penalty applied to all solutions according to their complexity, allowing
us to tiebreak between otherwise equivalent solutions by choosing the
simpler one. (Unfortunately, machine learning fails to deliver any
deeper insight into “complexity” - “bigger numbers are worse” is the
best we can come up with.)</p>
<p>Taste is the regularization function of human endeavor.</p>
<h2 id="taste-is-the-field-behind-the-goalposts">Taste is the field
behind the goalposts</h2>
<p>Effectiveness is complementary to taste.</p>
<p>Options can be measurably compared among various axes. Once you
subtract these axes - taste is what remains.</p>
<p>The arts are unique in that there are virtually no measurable axes;
they are <em>entirely</em> taste-driven.</p>
<p>One fascinating case study is Go. Go is a game with a very simple
measuring stick for effectiveness: the player with more board area under
control wins the game. Yet, Go is simultaneously a game with no
discernible rules for good play. Go’s tastefulness is thus an emergent
property of its strategic depth; the pursuit of taste in Go is the
pursuit of victory. The measurable superiority of AlphaGo Zero has, in
my opinion, destroyed much of what used to be tasteful about Go. I
believe Lee Sedol’s rationale for retiring from Go is exactly this
sentiment.</p>
<p>This brings us to my core hypothesis: <strong>Taste is the field
behind the goalposts, into which the goalposts are constantly being
shifted.</strong></p>
<p>Humanity’s edge over AI is that we are constantly expanding the field
behind the goalposts.</p>
<p>In the second half of this essay, I want to discuss how humans create
taste.</p>
<h2 id="taste-is-cultural-distillation">Taste is cultural
distillation</h2>
<p>To develop taste, it helps to have a community of practitioners who
are united in purpose. Community accelerates the development of taste by
showcasing examples of good taste, by furnishing peers who can give
targeted feedback, and by distilling a raw stream of content into a
curated trickle of exemplars.</p>
<p>I’m a mostly self-taught software engineer and ML researcher, but I
couldn’t have pulled it off without community:</p>
<ul>
<li>I learned from the best resources, as per community consensus: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">SICP</a>,
<a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">Game Programming
Patterns</a>, <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/api">Stripe’s API</a>,
Linear Algebra Done Right, <a href="https://karpathy.ai/">Andrej
Karpathy</a>, <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Nielsen</a>, and
more.</li>
<li>I received and gave mentorship through Google’s <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/readability">Readability</a> program.</li>
<li>I’m a longtime follower of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, a community whose
collective taste creates a reliable filtering mechanism for content of
interest, and a forum to debate the merits of each post with subject
matter experts.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> is a community
of curious programmers pushing their abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the mechanisms by which a community distills good taste from
the collective efforts of its members?</p>
<p>Today, we are perhaps most familiar with The Algorithm: a class of
solutions that rely on making statistical inferences over user
interaction data, like upvotes/downvotes, dwell time, watch time,
clickthrough rates, links, shares, retweets, and more. These solutions
have the advantage of scalability – there’s far too much video on
YouTube for anyone to watch it all – but overall, tend to promote
tasteless, lowest-common-denominator content.</p>
<p>Of all of the mainstream content platforms, I think YouTube comes the
closest to algorithmically surfacing good content. Yet I find that it
<em>wants</em> to veer into the tasteless, and it’s only through my
application of taste in downvoting tasteless content that my YouTube
recommendation feed stays clean.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, I prefer curated channels over The Algorithm.
Channels – say, a newspaper, journal, magazine, blog, YouTube channel,
newsletter, mailing list, or even just shelf space in a retail
storefront – allow a curator to elevate content that they deem
tasteful.</p>
<p>The interactions between its members’ taste, curators’ taste, and
reputational effects are what drive communities forward. Members choose
which curators to trust, and curators themselves are members of the
community; if a niche channel is trusted by other curators, then that
channel has influence far beyond its raw readership.</p>
<p>Who and what determines whether a curator is trusted? Unfortunately,
taste is a self-referential problem: you need taste to pick the right
curators to trust. Curators are also not infallible. One failure mode is
“selling out” – trading your readers’ accumulated trust for money.
Another failure mode is simply not keeping ahead of the curve, as the
community collectively uplevels their taste.</p>
<p>It’s possible for communities to exist in high-taste and low-taste
equilibrium states - a high-taste community is one in which tasteful
curators are identified and elevated, and a low-taste community is one
in which sellouts prosper because nobody has enough taste to tell the
difference. The replacement of traditional curation with algorithmic
distillation is likely responsible for pushing many online and even
offline communities into low-taste equilibrium states.</p>
<h2 id="taste-is-governance">Taste is governance</h2>
<p>The collective taste of humans shapes our environment by determining
our leaders, our policies, our priorities, the set of goods and services
available for purchase.</p>
<p>What are democratic elections, but a measurement of the taste of the
population? What is the free market, but a measurement of consumer
taste? What is a conclave, but a measurement of Catholic cardinals’
taste? What is royal succession, but a measurement of the current King’s
taste?</p>
<p>Any attempt to measure collective taste runs afoul of politics. Whose
taste should be considered? Is it weighted, e.g. by headcount
(democracy), by money (capitalism), by insider status (elitism), by
bloodline (monarchy), by number of accounts (The Algorithm)? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness">Structurelessness
is also a type of governance</a>). What incentives are there to express
ones’ thoughtful opinion? What incentives are there to prefer the
collective good over personal greed?</p>
<p>Different systems of governance try to solve these problems, and all
have their problems. These systems exist at all scales, from your local
franchise restaurant, to entire institutions (e.g. “modern art” or
“academia”), to countries. Over time, systems of governance, and their
particular incarnations, prove their ability or inability to continually
elevate curators with good taste. Unfortunately, these dynamics play out
over the timescales of decades to millenia, making it hard to judge
which systems are the best.</p>
<p>I see competitive destruction – whether it be market competition,
war, or immigration – as the evolutionary force that selects for the
best governance.</p>
<h2 id="refining-your-taste">Refining your taste</h2>
<p>As individuals, how can we refine our tastes? Some general
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great artists have great taste. Being able to recognize good work is
a prerequisite to producing it.</li>
<li>You grow your taste by actively analyzing <em>why</em> one option is
more tasteful than another.</li>
<li>You develop taste by exposing yourself to more tasteful content.
Finding a community is a fast-track to finding tasteful content.</li>
<li>You also develop taste by creating. Creation highlights the inherent
limitations, constraints, and difficulties of the medium.</li>
<li>“What if” exercises – where you intentionally drop one ingredient
and see what happens – are a great way to understand <em>why</em>
something is necessary, if it is necessary at all!</li>
<li>Always be looking for more tasteful communities. The beginner
community is rarely the same as the advanced community, and both have a
place in your journey.</li>
<li>Not all “advanced” communities have taste. You need taste to judge
taste. (e.g. in software, many communities revolve around one flavor or
another of pedantry, which is not equivalent to taste.)</li>
<li>Taste is contextual. Yet, someone with taste in one domain can
weakly judge taste in a different domain. This video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99oj1r02hGA">Chef Wang, an
extremely tasteful Sichuan chef, trying a fine dining vegan
restaurant</a> is <em>fascinating</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having dissected the phenomenon of <em>taste</em> along many
dimensions, I think it’s appropriate to ask: what remains? The answer is
left as an exercise to the tasteful reader.</p>
