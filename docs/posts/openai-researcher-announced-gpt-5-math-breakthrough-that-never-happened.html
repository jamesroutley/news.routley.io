    <h1>OpenAI researcher announced GPT-5 math breakthrough that never happened</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
						<p><strong>OpenAI researchers recently claimed a major math breakthrough on X, but quickly walked it back after criticism from the community, including Deepmind CEO Demis Hassabis, who called out the sloppy communication.</strong></p>
<p>It started with a now-deleted tweet from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/StefanFSchubert/status/1979265669427306507" data-type="editable-link">OpenAI manager Kevin Weil</a>, who wrote that GPT-5 had &#34;found solutions to 10 (!) previously unsolved Erdős problems&#34; and made progress on eleven more. He described these problems as &#34;open for decades.&#34; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/SebastienBubeck/status/1979539604522127746" data-type="editable-link">Other OpenAI researchers</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/BorisMPower/status/1979247529276698683?t=MZfVx27rCHu7k8DfFdNfEQ&amp;s=19">echoed the claim</a>.</p>
<p>The wording made it sound like GPT-5 had independently produced mathematical proofs for tough number theory questions - a potential scientific breakthrough and a sign that generative AI could uncover unknown solutions, showing its ability to drive novel research and open the door to major advances.</p>

<p>Mathematician Thomas Bloom, who runs <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://erdosproblems.com" data-type="editable-link">erdosproblems.com</a>, pushed back right away. He called the statements &#34;a dramatic misinterpretation,&#34; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/thomasfbloom/status/1979254235075059732" data-type="editable-link">clarifying</a> that &#34;open&#34; on his site just means he personally doesn&#39;t know the solution - not that the problem is actually unsolved. GPT-5 had only surfaced existing research that Bloom had missed.</p><div><p>Ad</p>

<p>Deepmind-CEO <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1979417877590774063" data-type="editable-link">Demis Hassabis called the episode &#34;embarrassing&#34;</a>, and Meta AI chief Yann <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1979595060447416733" data-type="editable-link">LeCun pointed out</a> that OpenAI had basically bought into its own hype (&#34;Hoisted by their own GPTards&#34;).</p>
<p>The original tweets were mostly deleted, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/SebastienBubeck/status/1979539604522127746" data-type="editable-link">the researchers</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/BorisMPower/status/1979328512923439455?t=X5eXZIXKvpSf5ftkIGbRrw&amp;s=19">admitted</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/kevinweil/status/1979270343941591525" data-type="editable-link">their mistake</a>. Still, the incident adds to the perception that <a href="https://the-decoder.com/openai-has-reportedly-misjudged-its-cash-burn-by-80-billion/" data-type="editable-link">OpenAI is an organization under pressure</a> and <a href="https://the-decoder.com/openai-updates-sora-rules-after-offensive-martin-luther-king-jr-deepfakes-surfaced/" data-type="editable-link">careless in its approach</a>. It raises questions about why leading AI researchers would share such dramatic claims without verifying the facts, especially in a field already awash in hype, with billions at stake. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/SebastienBubeck/status/1977181716457701775" data-type="editable-link">Bubeck knew what GPT-5 actually contributed</a>, but still used the ambiguous phrase &#34;found solutions.&#34;</p>
<h2>GPT-5 is proving useful as a literature review assistant</h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/thomasfbloom/status/1979254675833549207" data-type="editable-link">real story here is getting overshadowed</a>: GPT-5 actually proved useful as a research tool for tracking down relevant academic papers. This is especially valuable for problems where the literature is scattered or the terminology isn&#39;t consistent.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115385022005130505" data-type="editable-link">Mathematician Terence Tao</a> sees this as the most immediate potential for AI in math—not solving the toughest open problems, but speeding up tedious tasks like literature searches. While there have been some <a href="https://the-decoder.com/agi-system-could-be-built-in-as-little-as-three-years-ex-openai-employee-warns-us-senate/">&#34;isolated examples of progress&#34; on difficult questions</a>, Tao says AI is most valuable as a time-saving assistant. He has also said that <a href="https://the-decoder.com/renowned-mathematician-terence-tao-envisions-ai-powered-industrial-scale-mathematics/" data-type="editable-link">generative AI could help &#34;industrialize&#34; mathematics</a> and accelerate progress in the field. Still, human expertise is crucial for reviewing, classifying, and safely integrating AI-generated results into real research.</p>
