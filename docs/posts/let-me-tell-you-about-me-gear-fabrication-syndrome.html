    <p>If you are reading these lines, you may be familiar with the concept of Gear
Acquisition Syndrome (GAS). A person’s insatiable urge to buy equipment for
their art or hobby, distracting them from actually practicing said art or
hobby.</p>

<p>It’s driven in part by the belief that new gear will improve one’s art or
performance, e.g. I don’t sound like Jimi Hendrix because I don’t have the same
effects pedal he used. Or the instant gratification of acquiring and
discovering new shiny equipment, in contrast to the stressing and frustrating
creation process.</p>

<p>Because of my background and education, the “guilt” of spending money on
frivolous equipment will, most of the time, allow me to overcome my Gear
Acquisition Syndrome. But I developed another mechanism: Gear Fabrication
Syndrome (GFS).</p>



<p>A few months ago, I was introduced to the wonderful world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_racing">sim
racing</a>. As teenagers my brothers and
I used to play car racing video games, but I didn’t know how advanced the field
is today. So I started to look into it, watched videos on YouTube, dug up the
old force feedback wheel controller from our parent’s attic, bought a game,
etc.</p>

<p>Sim racing tutorials will often explain how braking is the most important skill
to drive fast. And to break with consistency and precision you need a so-called
“load cell pedal”. Unlike the cheap pedal I am using, a load cell pedal
measures the pressure you are putting on the pedal and not the distance your
foot moves. That’s way closer to how real car brakes operate (pression in a
hydraulic system).</p>

<p>For sure, the reason I am not going as fast as the other drivers online is
because of my cheap brake pedal! Enter the Gear Acquisition Syndrome!</p>

<p>Entry level load cell pedals are not extremely expensive, I can afford it. But
they are not cheap either, am I wasting money here? Trying to reconcile my urge
to get new gear and my fear of wasting money, I looked for an escape. Quick
online search for DIY sim racing pedals reveals a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=C7pNnQlq8ro">different
designs</a>. For sure, I
can make one! Enter the Gear Fabrication Syndrome.</p>

<p>Cost saving is not always the motivation, one can try to make better gear than
what is available off the shelf, or just more adapted to personal taste. That’s
why I could also tell you about all the guitars,
<a href="https://fireverb.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/the-fireverb/">amplifiers</a> and
<a href="https://fireverb.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/leslievibratone-cabinet/">effects</a> I
made instead of practicing the instrument. Or my 6 years and going <a href="https://weenoisemaker.com/blog/2022/11/21/welcome.html">pocket
synthesizer project</a>.</p>

<p>That’s hard to tell. The cost effectiveness is often hard to reach, in
particular if you factor in the cost of tools. Not to mention a failed DIY
project will lead you to end up buying the off the shelf gear, making things
way worse in the end.</p>

<p>Software developers are familiar with this credo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were
going to be easy.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also time consuming, and the time spent on making gear is of course not
available for practicing art/hobby.</p>

<p>On the other hand GFS can become a deeply rewarding part of your journey,
allowing you to shape and personalize your tools in a way that GAS never can.
You can learn a lot from it, and in the end, designing and making can become
your main art/hobby.</p>



<p>There are many individuals online that seem to exhibit signs of Gear
Fabrication Syndrome. I picked two.</p>

<p>Let’s start with Adam Savage. Watching the Tested YouTube channel, it’s clear
that Adam loves gear and tools. You can tell by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8p0Bpbihw">8 minute video on hex
keys</a> for instance. He’s even
obsessed as some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNc8y7d7Tic">video title will tell
you</a>. To me it’s pretty clear that
Adam shows signs for GAS. But what about GFS? Well Tested YouTube channel is
also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJtitKU0CAej22ZWBqrimPkn0Bbo6ci-r">full of
videos</a>
where Adam makes custom equipment for his shop, or movie prop replicas, or any
other kind of gear. Things that he could either buy or have someone make for
him.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdjGxn97lgI"><img src="https://weenoisemaker.com/assets/adam_savage_tested_portable_soldering_station_rebuild_yt_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/></a></p>

<p>The second one is Sam Battle, known online as <a href="https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/">Look Mum No
Computer</a>. Sam is a musician, performer,
videographer, inventor, and director of his own museum. I highly recommend
having a look at his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LOOKMUMNOCOMPUTER/videos">YouTube
channel</a>.</p>

<p>Among many other things, Sam designed and built a big custom synthesizer called
Kosmo. Kosmo is tailored for live performance, rugged enough to sustain
transportation in a tour van, with big knobs and jacks so that Sam can use it
while singing and jumping around. Kosmo has become more than a tool, it’s a
musician on stage with Sam. You would never get that with off the shelf synths.</p>

<p>Here’s what my DIY pedals look like so far:</p>

<p>You are probably wondering if they allow me to drive faster in racing
simulators. Well, two months after the beginning of the project, they are still
not usable ^^ So this might be the topic for another post…</p>
