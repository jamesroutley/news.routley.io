<h2>About this document</h2>
<a name="toc2"></a>
<h3>Which m4?</h3>
<p>
This document describes GNU m4, as included with Linux;
areas of potential incompatibility of which I am aware
are mentioned as they arise and highlighted with a
boldface “<b>GNU</b>”.
</p>
<p>
This was originally based on GNU m4 version 1.4.5;
it has been updated for version 1.4.10.
</p>
<a name="toc3"></a>
<h3>Who should read this?</h3>
<p>
You may find this helpful if
</p>
<ul>
<li>you want to decide whether m4 is the tool you need
for some task (once you get a rough idea of what the
language is about, you might want to skip down to the
<a href="#assessment">comparative assessment</a>)
</li><li>you need to quickly get up to speed on m4, or revise
or (perhaps) learn more about the language
</li></ul>


<p>
You should already be familiar with fundamental
programming concepts (e.g., recursion).
</p>
<a name="toc4"></a>
<h3>How is this different from the manual?</h3>
<p>
There is a substantial overlap between the GNU m4 info pages
and this document.
The info pages are designed to be a comprehensive reference.
This document is a much shorter “m4 by example”
which is still “practically” complete –
that is, I have tried to include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>everything helpful in using m4 effectively
</li><li>anything that might cause a problem if you weren&#39;t aware of it
</li></ul>

<p>
Examples of the kind of details omitted are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>experimental features that may disappear in future versions
</li><li>the ways different versions of m4 handle the <code>changequote</code>
macro (in practice, all you need to know are the restrictions
to observe in order to ensure compatibility)
</li><li>details on the myriad debugging flags: effective debugging
is possible using just two or three flags and macros
</li></ul>

<p>
There is also some original material here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>tips, e.g., macros to protect unbalanced quote characters
inside quotes
</li><li>different examples
</li></ul>

<h2>What is m4?</h2>
<p>
M4 can be called a “template language”, a “macro language”
or a “preprocessor language”.
The name “m4” also refers to the program which processes
texts in this language:
this “preprocessor” or “macro processor” takes as input
an m4 template and sends this to the output,
after acting on any embedded directives, called macros.
</p>
<p>
At its most basic, it can be used for simple embedded text
replacement.
If m4 receives the input
</p>
<pre>  define(AUTHOR, William Shakespeare)
  A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream
  by AUTHOR
</pre>
<p>
then it outputs
</p>
<pre>  A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream
  by William Shakespeare
</pre>

<p>
While similar in principle to the better-known C preprocessor,
it is a far more powerful, general-purpose tool.
Some significant uses are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sendmail: sendmail&#39;s rather cryptic configuration file
(/etc/mail/sendmail.cf) is generated using m4 from a template
file that is much easier to read and edit (/etc/mail/sendmail.mc).
</li><li>GNU Autoconf: m4 macros are used to produce “configure”
scripts which make source code packages portable across different
Unix-like platforms.
</li><li>Security Enhanced Linux: SELinux policy files are 
(at time of writing) processed using m4.
(In fact, m4 is the source of some difficulties here because
its flexibility allows abuses
and makes automated policy analysis difficult to apply.)
</li></ul>


<a name="toc6"></a>
<h2>Basics: Simple macros, whitespace, quoting, comments</h2>
<p>
M4 is a <b>Unix filter program</b>.
Its arguments, if any, are the files it is to read;
if none is specified then it reads from stdin.
The resulting text is sent to stdout.
</p>
<p>
M4 comes with an initial set of built-in macros,
often simply called “<b>builtins</b>”.
The most basic of these,
<b><code>define</code></b>, is used to create new macros:
</p>
<pre>  define(AUTHOR, W. Shakespeare)
</pre>
<p>
After this definition, the word “AUTHOR” is recognized
as a macro that <b>expands</b> to “W. Shakespeare”.
</p>
<p>
The <code>define</code> macro itself – including its two
arguments – expands to an empty string, that is,
it produces no output.
However the <b>newline</b> at the end of the <code>AUTHOR</code> 
definition above would be echoed to the output.
If a blank line added to the output is a problem then
you can suppress it using the “<b>delete to newline</b>”
macro:
</p>
<pre>  define(AUTHOR, W. Shakespeare)dnl
</pre>
<p>
There is no space between the end of the macro and the <code>dnl</code>:
if there were then that space would be echoed to the output.
</p>
<p>
No <b>whitespace</b> is allowed between a macro name and the
opening parenthesis.
Any whitespace before the beginning of
a parameter is discarded.
Thus the following definition is equivalent to the
one above:
</p>
<pre>  define(
     AUTHOR,W. Shakespeare)dnl
</pre>

<p>
It&#39;s also possible to pass <b>definitions on the command line</b>
using the <code>-D</code> option, for example:
</p>
<pre>  m4 -DAUTHOR=&#34;W. Shakespeare&#34; -DYEAR=1587 input_file.m4
</pre>

<p>
<b>Quoting</b> a string suppresses macro expansion.
The default quote characters are the backtick (`)
and apostrophe (&#39;).
M4 strips off these delimiters before outputting
the string.
Thus
</p>
<pre>  define(AUTHOR, W. Shakespeare)dnl
  `AUTHOR&#39; is AUTHOR
</pre>
<p>
produces the output
</p>
<pre>  AUTHOR is W. Shakespeare
</pre>

<p>
For conciseness, most examples will show
m4&#39;s output in the following way:
</p>
<pre>  `AUTHOR&#39; is AUTHOR       # -&gt; AUTHOR is W. Shakespeare
</pre>
<p>
In m4, the hash character # is the default opening
delimiter of a <b>comment</b>.
A comment lasts up to and including the following
newline character.
The contents of a comment are not examined by m4;
however, contrary to what you might expect,
comments are echoed to the output.
Thus, the previous line, if entered in full, would
actually produce the output
</p>
<pre>  AUTHOR is W. Shakespeare       # -&gt; AUTHOR is W. Shakespeare
</pre>
<p>
Opening comment delimiters can be protected by quotes:
</p>
<pre>  `#&#39; AUTHOR              # -&gt; # W. Shakespeare
</pre>

<p>
<b>Nested quotes</b> are recognized as such:
</p>
<pre>  ``AUTHOR&#39;&#39; is AUTHOR     # -&gt; `AUTHOR&#39; is W. Shakespeare
</pre>

<p>
Quoted strings can include newlines:
</p>
<pre>  define(newline,`line
  break&#39;)
  a newline here
</pre>
<p>
outputs
</p>
<pre>  a line
  break here
</pre>

<p>
Without a matching opening quote character (`), a
closing quote (&#39;) is simply echoed to the output.
Thus
</p>
<pre>  `AUTHOR
   &#39; is AUTHOR.&#39;&#39;
</pre>
<p>
produces
</p>
<pre>  AUTHOR
    is W. Shakespeare.&#39;&#39;
</pre>

<p>
M4 also understands <b>nested parentheses</b> within
a macro&#39;s argument list:
</p>
<pre>  define(PARENS, ())
  brackets: PARENS         # -&gt; brackets: ()
</pre>
<p>
Unbalanced parentheses can be quoted to protect them:
</p>
<pre>  define(LPAREN,`(&#39;)
  define(RPAREN,`)&#39;)
  LPAREN bracketed RPAREN  # -&gt; ( bracketed )
</pre>
<p>
(Unbalanced quote characters are more problematic;
a solution is given <a href="#quotemacro">later</a>.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Pitfall</b>:
In fact, quoting of the macro name is also recommended.
Consider the following:
</p>
<pre>  define(LEFT, [)
  LEFT                     # -&gt; [
  define(LEFT, {)
  LEFT                     # -&gt; [
</pre>
<p>
Why didn&#39;t the second <code>define</code> work?
The problem is that, within the second <code>define</code>, the
macro <code>LEFT</code> was expanded before the define macro
itself took effect:
</p>
<pre>  define(LEFT, {)          # -&gt; define([, {) -&gt;
</pre>
<p>
That is, instead of redefining the macro <code>LEFT</code>,
a new macro named <code>[</code> was defined.
<b>GNU</b> m4 allows macros to have non-standard names,
including punctuation characters like <code>[</code>.
In fact, the new macro doesn&#39;t seem to work either:
</p>
<pre>  [                        # -&gt; [
</pre>
<p>
That&#39;s because GNU m4 doesn&#39;t ordinarily recognize a
macro as a macro unless it has a <b>valid name</b> – that is,
a sequence of ASCII letters, underscores, or digits,
beginning with an underscore or letter.
For example,
<code>my_macro1</code> and <code>_1stMacro</code> are both valid names;
<code>my.macro1</code> and <code>1stMacro</code> are not.
(We will see later how the ability to define
<a href="#unexpandingmacros">macros with invalid names can be useful</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Quoting the macro&#39;s arguments avoids this problem:
</p>
<pre>  define(`LEFT&#39;,`[&#39;)
  LEFT                     # -&gt; [
  define(`LEFT&#39;,`{&#39;)
  LEFT                     # -&gt; {
</pre>

<p>
For the same reason, the <b><code>undefine</code></b> macro will
normally work as expected only if its argument is quoted:
</p>
<pre>  define(`RIGHT&#39;, `]&#39;)
  undefine(RIGHT)          # -&gt; undefine(]) -&gt;
  RIGHT                    # -&gt; ]
  undefine(`RIGHT&#39;)
  RIGHT                    # -&gt; RIGHT
</pre>
<p>
(Note that <code>undefine</code> does not complain if it is
given the name of a non-existent macro, it simply
does nothing.)
</p>
<a name="toc7"></a>
<h2>How m4 works</h2>
<p>
M4&#39;s behaviour can be mystifying.
It is best to get an early understanding of how it works.
This should save you time figuring out what&#39;s going on
when it doesn&#39;t do what you expect.
</p>
<p>
First, m4 looks for <b>tokens</b> in its input – roughly speaking,
it divides it into quoted strings, macro arguments,
names (i.e., identifiers), numbers and other symbols
(punctuation characters).
Whitespace (including newlines), numbers and punctuation
usually mark token boundaries;
exceptions are when they appear within a quoted string
or a macro argument.
</p>
<pre>  define( `Version2&#39;, A – 1 )99Version2:Version2_   Version22
  # -&gt; 99A – 1 :Version2_   Version22
</pre>
<p>
Above, since a valid name can include digits but cannot
begin with one, the names seen after the definition are
<code>Version2</code>, <code>Version2_</code>, and <code>Version22</code>;
only the first of these corresponds to a defined macro.
</p>
<p>
Continuing:
</p>
<pre>  Version2(arg1, arg2) Version2 (junk) garbage(trash)Version2()
  # -&gt; A – 1  A – 1  (junk) garbage(trash)A – 1
</pre>
<p>
If the name of a macro is followed immediately by a
&#39;(&#39; then m4 reads in a list of arguments.
The <code>Version2</code> macro we have defined ignores
its arguments -- but that doesn&#39;t matter to m4:
it swallows up the arguments and outputs only
the macro&#39;s expansion “A – 1 ”.
</p>
<p>
In general, m4 passes input tokens and separators straight
through to the output, making no change except to remove
the quotes surrounding quoted string tokens.
When it encounters a macro name, however, it stops
echoing to the output.
Instead:
</p>
<ol>
<li>it reads in the macro&#39;s arguments (if any)
</li><li>it determines the expansion of the macro and inserts this
expansion at the beginning of its input
</li><li>m4 continues scanning the input, starting with the expansion
</li></ol>

<p>
If while reading in a macro&#39;s arguments, m4 encounters
another macro then it repeats this process for the
nested macro.
</p>
<p>
An example makes this clearer:
</p>
<pre>  define(`definenum&#39;, `define(`num&#39;, `99&#39;)&#39;)
  num                      # -&gt; num
  definenum num            # -&gt; define(`num&#39;, `99&#39;) num -&gt;  99
</pre>
<p>
As soon as m4 gets to the end of “definenum” on the 
last line above, it recognizes it as a macro and 
replaces it with “define(`num&#39;, 99)” --
however, instead of outputting this expansion,
it sticks it back on the beginning of its input buffer
and starts again from there.
Thus, the next thing it reads in is “define(`num&#39;, 99)”.
As the define macro expands to an empty string,
nothing is output; however, the new macro <code>num</code> is
now defined.
Then m4 reads in a space which it echoes to the output,
followed by the macro <code>num</code>, which it replaces with its
expansion.
The last line therefore results in the output “ 99”.
</p>
<p>
Unless a nested macro is quoted, it is expanded immediately:
</p>
<pre>  define(`definenum&#39;, define(`num&#39;, `99&#39;))
  num                      # -&gt; 99
  definenum                # -&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Here, when m4 reads in the nested <code>define</code> macro,
it immediately defines <code>num</code>; it also replaces the macro
“define(`num&#39;, `99&#39;)” with its expansion – an empty string.
Thus, “definenum” ends up being defined as an empty string.
</p>
<p>
Arbitrary nesting is possible -- with (ordinarily)
an extra layer of protective quotes at each level
of nesting:
</p>
<pre>  define(`definedefineX&#39;,`define(`defineX&#39;,`define(`X&#39;,`xxx&#39;)&#39;)&#39;)
  defineX X           # -&gt; defineX X
  definedefineX X     # -&gt;  X
  defineX X           # -&gt;  xxx
</pre>

<p>
If rescanning of a macro&#39;s expansion is not what you
want then just add more quotes:
</p>
<pre>  define(`stmt&#39;,``define(`Y&#39;,`yyy&#39;)&#39;&#39;)
  stmt                # -&gt; define(`Y&#39;,`yyy&#39;)
  Y                   # -&gt; Y
</pre>
<p>
Above, the outermost quotes are removed when the
nested macro is being read in – so <code>stmt</code> expands
first to <code>`define(`Y&#39;,`yyy&#39;)&#39;</code>; m4 then rescans
this as a string token and removes the second layer of
quotes before sending it to the output.
</p>
<p>
Now consider the definition
</p>
<pre>  define(`plus&#39;, `+&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
Suppose we want to use this <code>plus</code> macro twice
in succession with no intervening space.
Clearly, <code>plusplus</code> doesn&#39;t work – it is read as
a single token, <code>plusplus</code>, not two <code>plus</code> tokens:
</p>
<pre>  plusplus       # -&gt; plusplus
</pre>
<p>
We can use an argument list as a separator:
</p>
<pre>  plus()plus     # -&gt; ++
</pre>

<p>
But watch what happens with an extra level of indirection:
</p>
<pre>  define(`oper&#39;, `plus&#39;)
  oper()oper     # -&gt; plusoper
</pre>
<p>
Here, <code>oper()</code> expands to <code>plus</code>; but then rescanning of
the input starts from the beginning of the expansion.
Thus, the next thing read in is the token <code>plusoper</code>.
As it doesn&#39;t correspond to a macro, it is copied straight
to the output.
</p>
<p>
The problem can be solved by adding an
<b>empty quote as a separator</b>:
</p>
<pre>  oper`&#39;oper     # -&gt; plus`&#39;oper -&gt; +`&#39;oper -&gt; ... -&gt; ++
</pre>
<p>
It is a good idea to include such a separator in
macro definitions as a matter of policy:
</p>
<pre>  define(`oper&#39;,`plus`&#39;&#39;)
  oper()oper     # -&gt; plus`&#39;oper -&gt; +`&#39;oper -&gt; +oper -&gt; ... -&gt; ++
</pre>

<p>
If ever <b>m4 seems to hang or stop working</b>, it is probably
because a faulty macro has sent it into an infinite loop:
</p>
<pre>  define(`Bye&#39;, `Bye for now&#39;)
  Hello.         # -&gt; Hello.
  Bye.           # -&gt; Bye for now. -&gt; Bye for now for now. -&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>
Such an error is not always this obvious:
the cycle may involve more than one macro.
</p>
<p>
Finally, look at this example:
</p>
<pre>  define(`args&#39;, ``NAME&#39;, `Marie&#39;&#39;)
  define(args)                   # -&gt; define(`NAME&#39;, `Marie&#39;) -&gt;
  NAME                           # -&gt; Marie
  
  args(define(`args&#39;,`Rachel&#39;))  # -&gt; args() -&gt; `NAME&#39;, `Marie&#39; -&gt; NAME, Marie
  args                           # -&gt; Rachel
</pre>
<p>
In the second part of the example, although <code>args</code>
doesn&#39;t take an argument, we can still pass it one.
In this case the argument redefines the macro that&#39;s
currently being expanded.
However, it is the expansion that was in force when the
macro identifier was read in that is output.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, it is possible to define a <b>self-modifying macro</b>
or even a <b>self-destructing macro</b>:
</p>
<pre>  define(`msg&#39;, `undefine(`msg&#39;)Secret message.&#39;)
  msg            # -&gt; Secret message.
  msg            # -&gt; msg
</pre>

<p>
<b><a href="#recursion">Recursive macros</a></b> can also be defined.
</p>
<a name="quotes"></a>
<h2>Quotes, escaping and non-ASCII characters</h2>
<p>
A deficiency of m4 is that there is <b>no escape character</b>.
This means that if you want to use the backtick (`) for anything
other than an opening quote delimiter you need to take care.
Sometimes you can just add an extra layer of quotes:
</p>
<pre>  I said, ``Quote me.&#39;&#39;     # -&gt; I said, `Quote me.&#39;
</pre>
<p>
However, in other cases, you might need an opening quote
without m4 interpreting it as such.
</p>
<p>
The general way around this problem is to use the
<b><code>changequote</code></b> macro, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>  changequote(&lt;!,!&gt;)
  a `quo&lt;!ted str!&gt;ing&#39;
</pre>
<p>
outputs
</p>
<pre>  a `quoted string&#39;
</pre>
<p>
Without parameters, <code>changequote</code> restores the default
delimiters.
</p>
<p>
In general, it is best to <b>avoid using changequote</b>.
You can define
<a href="#quotemacro">macros to insert literal quotes</a>
should you need them.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, however, it is necessary to change the
quote character globally, e.g., because the backtick
character is not available on some keyboards or
because the text being processed makes extensive use
of the default quote characters.
If you do use <code>changequote</code> then be aware of the
pitfalls:
</p>
<p>
<b>GNU</b> m4&#39;s <code>changequote</code> can differ from other
implementations of m4 and from earlier versions of GNU m4.
For portability,
call <code>changequote</code> only with two arguments –
or with no arguments, i.e.,
</p>
<pre>  changequote`&#39;    # (trailing `&#39; is separator if needed)
</pre>

<p>
Note that <code>changequote</code> changes how existing macros are
interpreted, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>  define(x,``xyz&#39;&#39;)
  x                    # -&gt; xyz
  changequote({,})
  x                    # -&gt; `xyz&#39;
</pre>
<p>
Don&#39;t choose the same delimiter for the left and right quotes:
doing so makes it impossible to have nested quotes.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t change a quote delimiter to anything that
begins with a letter or underscore or a digit; m4 won&#39;t
complain but it only recognizes a delimiter if it starts
with a punctuation character.
A digit may be recognized as a delimiter but not if it
is scanned as part of the preceding token.
</p>
<p>
While later versions of <b>GNU</b> m4 have a greater
tolerance for <b>non-ASCII characters</b> (e.g., the
pound sign or an accented character) it is better
to avoid them, certainly in macro names and preferably
in delimiters too.
If you do use 8-bit characters and m4 is not behaving
quite as you expect, this may be the reason.
Where <b>multibyte character encoding</b> is used,
m4 should not be used at all.
</p>
<a name="toc9"></a>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
As mentioned above, <b>line comments</b> are echoed
to the output, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>  define(`VERSION&#39;,`A1&#39;)
  VERSION # VERSION `quote&#39; unmatched`
</pre>
<p>
expands to
</p>
<pre>  A1 # VERSION `quote&#39; unmatched`
</pre>

<p>
Comments are not very useful.
However, even if you don&#39;t use them you need to remember to
quote any hash character in order to prevent it being 
interpreted as the beginning of a comment:
</p>
<pre>  `#&#39; VERSION    -&gt; # A1
</pre>

<p>
You can change the opening comment delimiter, e.g.,
<b><code>changecom</code></b><code>(`@@&#39;)</code> – as with <code>changequote</code>,
the new delimiter should start with a punctuation character.
</p>
<p>
If you want <b>echoing block comments</b>,
you can also change the closing delimiter, e.g.,
for C-like comments,
</p>
<pre>  changecom(/*,*/)
  VERSION `quote&#39; /* VERSION
  `quote&#39; ` */ VERSION
  # -&gt;
  # A1 quote /* VERSION
  # `quote&#39; ` */ A1
</pre>
<p>
Without arguments, <code>changecom</code> restores the default
comment delimiters.
</p>
<a name="toc10"></a>
<h2>Alternatives to comments</h2>
<p>
For a comment that should not be echoed to the output,
use <code>dnl</code>: this macro not only prevents the following
newline from being output (as we saw above), it also
discards everything up to the newline.
</p>
<pre>  dnl These two lines will not result
  dnl in any output.
</pre>

<p>
<b>Non-echoing block comments</b>:
multiline comments that are not echoed to the output
can be written like this
</p>
<pre>  ifelse(`
  This is a comment
  spanning more than
  one line.
  &#39;)dnl
</pre>
<p>
This is a hack which takes advantage of the fact that the
<code>ifelse</code> macro (described below) has no effect if it is
passed only one argument.
Some versions of m4 may therefore issue a warning about
insufficient arguments; <b>GNU</b> m4 doesn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
Be sure there are no unmatched quotes in the comment text.
</p>
<a name="toc11"></a>
<h2>Conditionals</h2>
<p>
<b><code>ifdef</code></b><code>(`a&#39;,b)</code> outputs b if a is defined;
<code>ifdef(`a&#39;,b,c)</code> outputs c if a is not defined.
The definition being tested may be empty, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>  define(`def&#39;)
  `def&#39; is ifdef(`def&#39;, , not )defined.
  # -&gt; def is defined.
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>ifelse</code></b><code>(a,b,c,d)</code> compares the strings a and b.
If they match, the macro expands to string c;
if not, string d.
</p>
<p>
This can be extended to multiple else-ifs:
</p>
<pre>  ifelse(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)
</pre>
<p>
means that if a matches b, then
return (expand to) c; else if d matches e, then return f; 
else return g.
In other words, it&#39;s shorthand for
</p>
<pre>  ifelse(a,b,c,ifelse(d,e,f,g))
</pre>

<a name="toc12"></a>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>
<b>M4 normally treats numbers as strings.</b>
However, the <b><code>eval</code></b> macro allows access to
<b>integer arithmetic</b>;
expressions can include these operators (in order of precedence)
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>+ -</td>
<td>unary plus and minus</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>**</td>
<td>exponent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>* / %</td>
<td>multiplication, division, modulo (<code>eval(8/-5)</code> -&gt; <code>-1</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+ -</td>
<td>addition and subtraction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</td>
<td>shift up or down (<code>eval(-8&gt;&gt;1)</code> -&gt; <code>-4</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>== != &lt; &lt;= &gt;= &gt;</td>
<td>relational</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!</td>
<td>logical not (converts non-zero to 0, 0 to 1)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>~</td>
<td>bitwise not (<code>eval(~0)</code> -&gt; <code>-1</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&amp;</td>
<td>bitwise and (<code>eval(6&amp;5)</code> -&gt; <code>4</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^</td>
<td>bitwise exclusive or (<code>eval(3^2)</code> -&gt; <code>1</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>|</code></td>
<td>bitwise or (<code>eval(1|2)</code> -&gt; <code>3</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&amp;&amp;</td>
<td>logical and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>||</code></td>
<td>logical or</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The above table is for <b>GNU</b> m4; unfortunately,
the operators and precedence are <b>version-dependent</b>.
Some versions of m4 incorrectly treat <code>^</code> the same as <code>**</code>
(exponent).
For maximum compatibility, make liberal use of parentheses
to enforce precedence.
</p>
<p>
Should you need it, <b>octal</b>, <b>hexadecimal</b> and indeed
<b>arbitrary radix</b> arithmetic are available.
It&#39;s also possible to specify the width of <code>eval</code>&#39;s output.
(See the m4 info pages for details on these.)
</p>
<pre>  eval(7*6)        # -&gt; 42
  eval(7/3+100)    # -&gt; 102
</pre>

<p>
There are also <b><code>incr</code></b> and <b><code>decr</code></b> builtins as shortcuts
which expand to the argument plus or minus one, e.g.,
<code>incr(x)</code> is equivalent to <code>eval(x+1)</code>:
</p>
<pre>  define(`n&#39;, 0)
  n # -&gt; 0
  define(`n&#39;, incr(n))
  n # -&gt; 1
</pre>

<p>
Beware of silent <b>integer overflow</b>, e.g.,
on my machine, the integer range is <code>-2**31</code> ... <code>2**31-1</code>;
<code>eval(2**31)</code> erroneously expands to <code>-2147483648</code>.
</p>
<p>
Logical conditions can be checked like this:
</p>
<pre>  `n&#39; is ifelse(eval(n &lt; 2), 1, less than ,
     eval(n = 2), 1, , greater than )2
</pre>

<a name="strings"></a>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>
<b><code>len</code></b>:
</p>
<pre>  len(`hello&#39;)                     # -&gt; 5
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>substr</code></b>:
</p>
<pre>  substr(`hello&#39;, 1, 3)            # -&gt; ell
  substr(`hello&#39;, 2)               # -&gt; llo
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>index</code></b>:
</p>
<pre>  index(`hello&#39;,`llo&#39;)             # -&gt; 2
  index(`not in string&#39;, `xyz&#39;)    # -&gt; -1
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>translit</code></b>:
</p>
<pre>  define(`ALPHA&#39;, `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#39;)
  define(`ALPHA_UPR&#39;, `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&#39;)
  define(`ROT13&#39;, `nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm&#39;)
  
  translit(`abc ebg13&#39;, ALPHA, ALPHA_UPR)
  # -&gt; ABC EBG13
  
  translit(`abc ebg13&#39;, ALPHA, ROT13)
  # -&gt; nop rot13
</pre>

<p>
<b>GNU</b> m4 includes some additional string macros:
<b><code>regexp</code></b>, to search for a regular expression in a
string, and <b><code>patsubst</code></b>, to do find and replace.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, m4&#39;s usual approach of rescanning the
expansion of a macro can be a problem with macros that
operate on strings:
</p>
<pre>  define(`eng&#39;,`engineering&#39;)
  substr(`engineer&#39;,0,3)           # -&gt; eng -&gt; engineering
  translit(`rat&#39;, ALPHA, ROT13)    # -&gt; eng -&gt; engineering
</pre>
<p>
This is not normally the desired behaviour and is
arguably a <b>design bug</b> in m4:
the builtins should at least provide some way to allow us
to prevent the extracted or transformec substring from
being expanded.
A workaround is suggested <a href="#substrfix">below</a>.
</p>
<a name="recursion"></a>
<h2>Defining macros with arguments; a recursive macro</h2>
<p>
In standard m4 (Unix), a macro can have up to 9 <b>arguments</b>;
within the macro definition, these are referenced as
<code>$1</code> ... <code>$9</code>.
(<b>GNU</b> m4 has no fixed limit on the number of arguments.)
Arguments default to the empty string, e.g., if 2
arguments are passed then <code>$3</code> will be empty.
</p>
<p>
Going in at the deep end, here is a reimplementation of the 
<code>len</code> builtin (replacing it) as a <b>recursive</b> macro.
</p>
<pre>  define(`len&#39;,`ifelse($1,,0,`eval(1+len(substr($1,1)))&#39;)&#39;)
</pre>

<p>
In a macro definition, argument references like <code>$1</code>
expand immediately, regardless of surrounding quotes.
For example, <code>len(`xyz&#39;)</code> above would expand (at the
first step) to
</p>
<pre>  ifelse(xyz,,0,`eval(1+len(substr(xyz,1)))&#39;)&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
Where necessary, this immediate expansion can be prevented
by breaking up the reference with
<b>inside quotes</b>, e.g., <code>$`&#39;1</code>.
</p>
<p>
The name of the macro is given by <b><code>$0</code></b>;
<b><code>$#</code></b> expands to the number of arguments.
Note in the following example that
<b>empty parentheses are treated as delimiting a single argument</b>:
an empty string:
</p>
<pre>  define(`count&#39;, ``$0&#39;: $# args&#39;)
  count        # -&gt; count: 0 args
  count()      # -&gt; count: 1 args
  count(1)     # -&gt; count: 1 args
  count(1,)    # -&gt; count: 2 args
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>$*</code></b> expands to the list of arguments;
<b><code>$@</code></b> does the same but protects each one with quotes
to prevent them being expanded:
</p>
<pre>  define(`list&#39;,`$`&#39;*: $*; $`&#39;@: $@&#39;)
  list(len(`abc&#39;),`len(`abc&#39;)&#39;)
  # -&gt; $*: 3,3; $@: 3,len(`abc&#39;)
</pre>

<p>
A common requirement is to process a list of arguments where
we don&#39;t know in advance how long the list will be.
Here, the <b><code>shift</code></b> macro comes in useful – it expands
to the same list of arguments with the first one removed:
</p>
<pre>  shift(1,2, `abc&#39;, 4)       # -&gt; 2,abc,4
  shift(one)                 # -&gt;
  define(`echolast&#39;,`ifelse(eval($#&lt;2),1,`$1`&#39;&#39;,
    `echolast(shift($@))&#39;)&#39;)
  echolast(one,two,three)    # -&gt; three
</pre>

<a name="toc15"></a>
<h2>Scope of macros; local variables</h2>
<p>
<b>All macros have global scope</b>.
</p>
<p>
What if we want a “local variable” – a macro that
is used only within the definition of another macro?
In particular, suppose we want to avoid accidentally
redefining a macro used somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
One possibility is to prefix “local” macro names with the
name of the containing macro.
Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t entirely satisfactory – and
it won&#39;t work at all in a recursive macro.
A better approach is described in the <a href="#pushpop">next section</a>.
</p>
<a name="pushpop"></a>
<h2>Pushing and popping macro definitions</h2>
<p>
For each macro, m4 actually creates a stack of definitions –
the current definition is just the one on top of the stack.
It&#39;s possible to temporarily redefine a macro by using
<b><code>pushdef</code></b> to add a definition to the top of the stack
and, later, <b><code>popdef</code></b> to destroy only the topmost
definition:
</p>
<pre>  define(`USED&#39;,1)
  define(`proc&#39;,
    `pushdef(`USED&#39;,10)pushdef(`UNUSED&#39;,20)dnl
  `&#39;`USED&#39; = USED, `UNUSED&#39; = UNUSED`&#39;dnl
  `&#39;popdef(`USED&#39;,`UNUSED&#39;)&#39;)
  proc     # -&gt; USED = 10, UNUSED = 20
  USED     # -&gt; 1
</pre>
<p>
If the macro hasn&#39;t yet been defined then <code>pushdef</code> is
equivalent to <code>define</code>.
As with <code>undefine</code>, it is not an error to <code>popdef</code>
a macro which isn&#39;t currently defined; it simply has
no effect.
</p>
<p>
In <b>GNU</b> m4, <code>define(X,Y)</code> works like
<code>popdef(X)pushdef(X,Y)</code>, i.e., it replaces only the
topmost definition on the stack;
in some implementations, <code>define(X)</code> is equivalent to
<code>undefine(X)define(X,Y)</code>, i.e., the new definition
replaces the whole stack.
</p>
<a name="ignore_argless_macros"></a>
<h2>Macros that don&#39;t expand without arguments</h2>
<p>
When <b>GNU</b> m4 encounters a word such as “define” that
corresponds to a builtin that requires arguments,
it leaves the word unchanged unless it is immediately
followed by an opening parenthesis.
</p>
<pre>  define(`MYMACRO&#39;,`text&#39;)    # -&gt;
  define a macro              # -&gt; define a macro
</pre>
<p>
Actually, we can say that m4 <i>does</i> expand the macro –
but that it expands only to the same literal string.
We can make our own macros equally intelligent by adding an
<code>ifelse</code> – or an extra clause to an existing “ifelse”:
</p>
<pre>  define(`reverse&#39;,`ifelse($1,,,
   `reverse(substr($1,1))`&#39;substr($1,0,1)&#39;)&#39;)
  reverse drawer: reverse(`drawer&#39;)     # -&gt;  drawer: reward
  
  define(`reverse&#39;,`ifelse($#,0,``$0&#39;&#39;,$1,,,
   `reverse(substr($1,1))`&#39;substr($1,0,1)&#39;)&#39;)
  reverse drawer: reverse(`drawer&#39;)     # -&gt; reverse drawer: reward
</pre>

<a name="toc18"></a>
<h2>Name clashes: making macro names safe</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, some macros do not require arguments
and so m4 has no way of knowing whether a word corresponding
to a macro name is intended to be a macro call or just
accidentally present in the text being processed.
</p>
<p>
Also, other versions of m4, and older versions of
<b>GNU</b> m4, may expand macro names which are not followed
by arguments even where GNU m4 does not:
</p>
<pre>  # GNU m4 1.4.10
  we shift the responsibility    # -&gt; we shift the responsibility
  # GNU m4 1.4.5
  we shift the responsibility    # -&gt; we  the responsibility
</pre>

<p>
In general, the problem is dealt with by quoting any
word that corresponds to a macro name:
</p>
<pre>  we `shift&#39; the responsibility  # -&gt; we shift the responsibility
</pre>

<p>
However if you are not fully in control of the text
being passed to m4 this can be troublesome.
Many macro names, like “changequote”, are
unlikely to occur in ordinary text.
Potentially more problematic are dictionary words that
are recognized as macros even without arguments:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>divert</code>, <code>undivert</code> (covered <a href="#redir">below</a>)
</li><li><code>windows</code>
</li></ul>

<p>
(“windows” – as well as “unix” and “os2” – is defined
in some versions of m4 as a way of testing the platform on
which m4 is running; by default it is not defined in GNU m4.)
</p>
<p>
An alternative to quoting macro names is to change all
m4&#39;s macro names so that they won&#39;t clash with anything.
Invoking m4 with the <code>-P</code> command-line option prefixes
all builtins with “m4_”:
</p>
<pre>  define(`M1&#39;,`text1&#39;)M1          # -&gt; define(M1,text1)M1
  m4_define(`M1&#39;,`text1&#39;)M1       # -&gt; text1
</pre>

<p>
On the basis that unnecessary changes to a language are
generally undesirable, I suggest not using <code>-P</code> option
if you can comfortably avoid it.
</p>
<p>
However, if you are writing a set of m4 macros that may be
included by others as a module, do add some kind of prefix
to your own macros to reduce the possibility of clashes.
</p>
<a name="toc19"></a>
<h2>Loops</h2>
<p>
Although m4 provides no builtins for iteration, it is not
difficult to create macros which use recursion to do this.
Various implementations can be found on the web.
This author&#39;s “for” loop is:
</p>
<pre>  define(`for&#39;,`ifelse($#,0,``$0&#39;&#39;,`ifelse(eval($2&lt;=$3),1,
    `pushdef(`$1&#39;,$2)$4`&#39;popdef(`$1&#39;)$0(`$1&#39;,incr($2),$3,`$4&#39;)&#39;)&#39;)&#39;)
  
  for n = for(`x&#39;,1,5,`x,&#39;)...      # -&gt; for n = 1,2,3,4,5,...
  
  for(`x&#39;,1,3,`for(`x&#39;,0,4,`eval(5-x)&#39;) &#39;)
  # -&gt; 54321 54321 54321
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of <code>pushdef</code> and <code>popdef</code> to prevent
loop variables clobbering any existing variable;
in the nested <code>for</code> loop, this causes the second <code>x</code> to
hide (shadow) the first one during execution of the inner loop.
</p>
<p>
A “for each” macro might be written:
</p>
<pre>  define(`foreach&#39;,`ifelse(eval($#&gt;2),1,
    `pushdef(`$1&#39;,`$3&#39;)$2`&#39;popdef(`$1&#39;)dnl
  `&#39;ifelse(eval($#&gt;3),1,`$0(`$1&#39;,`$2&#39;,shift(shift(shift($@))))&#39;)&#39;)&#39;)
  
  foreach(`X&#39;,`Open the X. &#39;,`door&#39;,`window&#39;)
  # -&gt; Open the door. Open the window.
  
  foreach(`X&#39;,`foreach(`Y&#39;,`Y the X. &#39;,`Open&#39;,`Close&#39;)&#39;,`door&#39;,`window&#39;)
  # -&gt; Open the door. Close the door. Open the window. Close the window.
  
  define(`OPER&#39;,``$2 the $1&#39;&#39;)
  foreach(`XY&#39;,`OPER(XY). &#39;, ``window&#39;,`Open&#39;&#39;, ``door&#39;,`Close&#39;&#39;)
  # -&gt; Open the window. Close the door.
</pre>

<p>
In a “for” loop of either kind, it can be useful to know
when you&#39;ve reached the last item in the sequence:
</p>
<pre>  define(`foreach&#39;,`ifelse(eval($#&gt;2),1,
    `pushdef(`last_$1&#39;,eval($#==3))dnl
  `&#39;pushdef(`$1&#39;,`$3&#39;)$2`&#39;popdef(`$1&#39;)dnl
  `&#39;popdef(`last_$1&#39;)dnl
  `&#39;ifelse(eval($#&gt;3),1,`$0(`$1&#39;,`$2&#39;,shift(shift(shift($@))))&#39;)&#39;)&#39;)
  
  define(`everyone&#39;,``Tom&#39;,`Dick&#39;,`Harry&#39;&#39;)
  foreach(`one&#39;,`one`&#39;ifelse(last_one,0,` and &#39;)&#39;,everyone).
  # -&gt; Tom and Dick and Harry.
</pre>

<p>
Finally, a simple “while” loop macro:
</p>
<pre>  define(`while&#39;,`ifelse($#,0,``$0&#39;&#39;,eval($1+0),1,`$2`&#39;$0($@)&#39;)&#39;)
  
  define(`POW2&#39;,2)
  while(`POW2&lt;=1000&#39;,`define(`POW2&#39;,eval(POW2*2))&#39;)
  POW2                             # -&gt; 1024
</pre>
<p>
Here, the apparently redundant <code>+0</code> in <code>eval($1+0)</code> does
have a purpose: without it, a <code>while</code> without arguments
expands to
</p>
<pre>  ifelse(0,0,``while&#39;&#39;,eval() ...
</pre>
<p>
whereupon <code>eval()</code> produces an empty argument warning.
</p>
<a name="redir"></a>
<h2>Suspending and discarding output: Buffers and redirection</h2>
<p>
To discard output – in particular,
to prevent newlines in a set of definitions being output – use
<b><code>divert</code></b>:
</p>
<pre>  divert(-1)
  &lt;definitions...&gt;
  divert(0)dnl
</pre>
<p>
Unlike the contents of a comment, the definitions
(and any other macros) are still processed by m4;
<code>divert(-1)</code> merely causes m4 to do this silently,
without sending anything to the output.
</p>
<p>
The last line above, with its <code>dnl</code> to prevent
the following newline being echoed, could also have
been written:
</p>
<pre>  divert`&#39;dnl
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>divnum</code></b> expands to the number of the currently active
diversion; 0, the default, means standard output (stdout);
positive numbers are temporary buffers which are output in
numeric order at the end of processing.
Standard m4 has 9 buffers (1..9); in <b>GNU</b> m4 there is no
fixed limit.
</p>
<p>
<b><code>undivert</code></b><code>(num)</code> appends the contents of diversion <code>num</code>
to the current diversion (normally stdout), emptying it; without
arguments, <code>undivert</code> retrieves all diversions in numeric order.
<b>Note</b> that <code>undivert()</code> is the same as <code>undivert(0)</code> and
has no effect: diversion 0 is stdout which is effectively an
empty buffer.
</p>
<p>
The contents of the buffer are <b>not interpreted</b> when <code>undivert</code>
is run, they are simply output as raw text, e.g., the following
code results in <code>Z Z Z</code> being output (not <code>9 9 9</code>):
</p>
<pre>  divert(1)
  Z Z Z
  divert
  define(`Z&#39;,9)
  undivert(1)
</pre>

<p>
There is an <b>implicit <code>divert</code> and <code>undivert</code></b> when m4
reaches the end of the input, i.e., all buffers are flushed to
the standard output.
If you want to avoid this for any reason, you can of course
discard the contents of the buffers by putting the following
line at the end of your input
</p>
<pre>  divert(-1)undivert
</pre>
<p>
or by exiting using the <b><code>m4exit</code></b> builtin.
</p>
<a name="toc21"></a>
<h2>Including files</h2>
<p>
<b><code>include</code></b><code>(filename.m4)</code> causes the contents of the
named file to be read and interpreted as if it was part of
the current file (just like <code>#include</code> in the C preprocessor).
</p>
<p>
<b>GNU</b> m4 allows for an include file search path.
To specify directories to be searched for include files use the
<code>-I</code> option on the command line, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>  m4 -I ~/mydir -Ilocaldir/subdir
</pre>
<p>
or use the environment variable <code>M4PATH</code>, e.g. (bash shell)
</p>
<pre>  export M4PATH=~/mydir:localdir/subdir
  m4 test.m4
</pre>

<p>
<b><code>sinclude</code></b><code>(nonexistentfile)</code> (silent include) is a
version of <code>include</code> that doesn&#39;t complain if the file
doesn&#39;t exist.
</p>
<p>
To include a file uninterpreted, <b>GNU</b> m4 allows
<b><code>undivert</code></b> to be passed a filename argument.
If <code>inc.m4</code> contains
</p>
<pre>  define(`planet&#39;,`jupiter&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
then
</p>
<pre>  undivert(`inc.m4&#39;)       # -&gt; define(`planet&#39;,`jupiter&#39;)
  planet                   # -&gt; planet
  include(`inc.m4&#39;)planet  # -&gt; jupiter
</pre>

<a name="toc22"></a>
<h2>Accessing the shell; creating temporary files</h2>
<p>
A system command can be passed to the shell, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>  syscmd(`date --iso-8601|sed s/-/./g&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
outputs something like <code>2007.10.16</code>.
</p>
<p>
The output from the command sent to <b><code>syscmd</code></b> is not
interpreted:
</p>
<pre>  syscmd(`echo &#34;define(\`AUTHOR&#39;,\`Orwell&#39;)&#34;&#39;)
                          # -&gt; define(`AUTHOR&#39;,`Orwell&#39;)
  AUTHOR                  # -&gt; AUTHOR
</pre>
<p>
However <b>GNU</b> m4 provides another macro,
<b><code>esyscmd</code></b>, that does process the output of the
shell command:
</p>
<pre>  esyscmd(`echo &#34;define(\`AUTHOR&#39;,\`Orwell&#39;)&#34;&#39;)
                          # -&gt;
  AUTHOR                  # -&gt; Orwell
</pre>
<p>
The macro <b><code>sysval</code></b> expands to the exit status of the
last shell command issued (0 for success):
</p>
<pre>  sysval                  # -&gt; 0
  esyscmd(`ls /no-dir/&#39;)
  sysval                  # -&gt; 2
</pre>

<p>
Naturally, m4 can be used as a filter in shell scripts or
interactively:
</p>
<pre>  echo &#34;eval(98/3)&#34;|m4
</pre>
<p>
outputs 32.
</p>
<p>
<b>Temporary files</b> can be created to store the output of shell
commands:
<b><code>maketemp</code></b><code>(prefixXXXXXX)</code> creates a temporary file and
expands to the filename – this name will be the (optional) prefix
with the six X&#39;s replaced by six random letters and digits.
In older versions of <b>GNU</b> m4 and in other implementations
of m4, the X&#39;s are generated from the process ID.
In certain contexts, this may be a security hole.
Another macro, <b><code>mkstemp</code></b>, is available in newer m4&#39;s
which always generates a random filename extension.
</p>
<pre>  define(`FILENAME&#39;,mkstemp(`/tmp/myscriptXXXXXX&#39;))
</pre>

<p>
The temporary file can be read in using <code>include</code> (perhaps
in conjunction with <code>divert</code>).
</p>
<a name="toc23"></a>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>
Most bugs relate to problems with quoting so check that first.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see step-by-step what m4 is doing, either
invoke it with the <code>-dV</code> option or, to limit full debug output
to one part of the file,
</p>
<pre>  debugmode(V)
  ...problematic section...
  debugmode
</pre>
<p>
The <code>V</code> flag is for full debugging; other flags for finer
control are described in the info pages.
</p>
<p>
<b><code>dumpdef</code></b><code>(`macro&#39;, ...)</code> outputs to standard error
the formatted definition of each argument – or just <code>&lt;macro&gt;</code>
if <code>macro</code> is a builtin;
<code>dumpdef</code> without arguments dumps all definitions to stderr.
Nothing is sent to stdout.
</p>
<p>
For user-defined macros, <b><code>defn</code></b><code>(`macro&#39;)</code> expands
to the definition string (i.e., not prefixed by the macro name).
</p>
<p>
<b><code>errprint</code></b><code>(`this message goes to standard error (stderr)&#39;)</code>
</p>
<a name="renamingmacros"></a>
<h2>Aliasing and renaming macros (including builtins)</h2>
<p>
Suppose we want to allow <code>strlen</code> to be used instead of
<code>len</code>.
This won&#39;t work:
</p>
<pre>  define(`strlen&#39;,`len&#39;)
  strlen(`hello&#39;)           # -&gt; len
</pre>
<p>
because we forgot to relay the arguments:
</p>
<pre>  define(`strlen&#39;,`len($@)&#39;)
  strlen(`hello&#39;)           # -&gt; 5
</pre>
<p>
OK, but suppose we want to replace <code>len</code> altogether.
Clearly, this doesn&#39;t work:
</p>
<pre>  define(`strlen&#39;,`len($@)&#39;)undefine(`len&#39;)
  strlen(`hello&#39;)           # -&gt; len(hello)
</pre>
<p>
since expansion now stops at <code>len</code>.
</p>
<p>
However, using the builtin <b><code>defn</code></b> to access the definition
of a macro, it&#39;s possible to alias or rename macros quite simply.
For user-defined macros, <code>defn</code> expands to the text of the
macro (protected with quotes before being output).
The <code>defn</code> of a builtin expands in most contexts to the empty
string – but when passed as an argument to “define” it expands
to a special token that has the desired effect:
</p>
<pre>  define(`rename&#39;, `define(`$2&#39;,defn(`$1&#39;))undefine(`$1&#39;)&#39;)
  rename(`define&#39;,`create&#39;)
  create(`vehicle&#39;,`truck&#39;)
  vehicle                   # -&gt; truck
  define(`fuel&#39;,`diesel&#39;)   # -&gt; define(fuel,diesel)
  fuel                      # -&gt; fuel
</pre>
<p>
And, because the intelligence is built into the macro definition,
m4 is still smart enough not to expand the word “create” unless
it is followed by arguments – compare the indirect approach,
where <code>defn</code> is not used:
</p>
<pre>  create a macro            # -&gt; create a macro
  create(`new&#39;,`create($@)&#39;)
  new(`wheels&#39;, 6)
  new wheels                # -&gt;  6
</pre>

<a name="builtin"></a>
<h2>Accessing internal builtins</h2>
<p>
Even when you undefine a builtin or define another macro
with the same name, <b>GNU</b> m4 still keeps the internal
definition which can be called indirectly via the macro
<b><code>builtin</code></b>:
</p>
<pre>  define(`TREE&#39;,`maple&#39;)
  undefine(`define&#39;,`undefine&#39;)
  undefine(`TREE&#39;)             # -&gt; undefine(TREE)
  TREE                         # -&gt; maple
  builtin(`undefine&#39;,`TREE&#39;)
  TREE                         # -&gt; TREE
  builtin(`define&#39;,`create&#39;,`builtin&#39;(``define&#39;&#39;,$`&#39;@))
  create(`TREE&#39;,`ash&#39;)
  TREE                         # -&gt; ash
</pre>

<p>
(Note the judicious use of quotes for the last argument
to the call to <code>builtin</code> which defines the <code>create</code>
macro above.
Because of the use of inner quotes, the usual approach
of surrounding the whole argument with quotes, i.e.,
</p>
<pre>  builtin(`define&#39;,`create&#39;,`builtin(`define&#39;,$`&#39;@)&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
would not have worked as desired: instead, any
call to the create macro would have ended up
defining a macro called “$@”.)
</p>
<p>
Because they can be accessed only indirectly and so
don&#39;t need to be protected, the names of these 
internal macros are not changed by the <code>-P</code> flag.
</p>
<a name="quotemacro"></a>
<h2>Macros for literal quotes</h2>
<p>
The obvious way to prevent the characters ` and &#39; being
interpreted as quotes is to change m4&#39;s quote delimiters
as described <a href="#quotes">above</a>.
This has some drawbacks, for example, to ensure the
new delimiters don&#39;t accidentally occur anywhere else,
more than one character may be used for each delimiter –
and if there&#39;s a lot of quoting, the code will become more
verbose and perhaps more difficult to read.
</p>
<p>
Another approach is to keep m4&#39;s existing quote delimiters and
define macros which hide the backtick and apostrophe from m4.
The trick is to balance the quotes while m4 still sees them
as nested quotes, temporarily change the quoting, and then
prevent one of the quotes being output:
</p>
<pre>  define(`LQ&#39;,`changequote(&lt;,&gt;)`dnl&#39;
  changequote`&#39;&#39;)
  define(`RQ&#39;,`changequote(&lt;,&gt;)dnl`
  &#39;changequote`&#39;&#39;)
  
  define(myne, `It`&#39;RQ()s mine!&#39;)
  LQ()LQ()myne&#39;&#39;                 # -&gt; ``It&#39;s mine!&#39;&#39;
</pre>

<a name="indir"></a>
<h2>Indirect macro calls</h2>
<p>
<b>GNU</b> m4 allows any macro to be called indirectly 
using the macro <b><code>indir</code></b>:
</p>
<pre>  indir(`define&#39;,`SIZE&#39;,78)
  SIZE                           # -&gt; 78
  indir(`SIZE&#39;)                  # -&gt; 78
</pre>
<p>
This is useful where the name of the macro to be called
is derived dynamically or where it does not correspond
to a token (i.e., a macro name with spaces or punctuation).
</p>
<p>
Compared to an ordinary call, there are
two differences to be aware of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the called macro must exist, otherwise m4 issues an error
</li><li>the arguments are processed before the definition of
the macro being called is retrieved
</li></ul>

<pre>  indir(`define(`SIZE&#39;)&#39;,67)
  # -&gt; m4: undefined macro `define(`SIZE&#39;)&#39;
  indir(`SIZE&#39;, indir(`define&#39;,`SIZE&#39;,53))    # -&gt; 53
  indir(`SIZE&#39;, indir(`undefine&#39;,`SIZE&#39;))
  # -&gt; m4: undefined macro `SIZE&#39;
</pre>

<p>
We can of course define our own higher-order macros.
For example, here is a macro, <code>do</code>, roughly similar to
<code>indir</code> <a href="#indir">above</a>:
</p>
<pre>  define(do, $1($2, $3, $4, $5))
  do(`define&#39;, ``x&#39;&#39;, 4)
  x                              # -&gt; 4
</pre>
<p>
Since extra arguments are normally ignored, <code>do</code> works
for any macro taking up to 4 arguments.
Note however that the example here, which expands to
<code>define(`x&#39;, 4, , , )</code>,
does generate a warning:
“excess arguments to builtin `define&#39; ignored”.
</p>
<a name="toc28"></a>
<h2>Recursion pitfall: nesting limits</h2>
<p>
Pretend we don&#39;t know that the sum <code>n + (n-1) + ... + 1</code>
is given by <code>n*(n+1)/2</code> and so we define a recursive macro
to calculate it:
</p>
<pre>  define(`sigma&#39;,`ifelse(eval($1&lt;=1),1,$1,`eval($1+sigma(decr($1)))&#39;)&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
If too large a number is passed to this macro then
m4 may crash with a message like
</p>
<pre>  ERROR: recursion limit of 1024 exceeded
</pre>
<p>
(for GNU m4 1.4.10).
In fact, the problem is not that <code>sigma</code> is recursive,
it is the degree of nesting in the expansion,
e.g., <code>sigma(1000)</code> will expand to
</p>
<pre>  eval(1000 + eval(999 + eval(998 + eval(997 + ...
</pre>
<p>
The nesting limit could be increased using a command line
option (<code>-L</code>).
However, we do better to avoid the problem by performing
the calculation as we go using an extra parameter as an
accumulator:
</p>
<pre>  define(`sigma&#39;,`ifelse(eval($1&lt;1),1,$2,`sigma(decr($1),eval($2+$1))&#39;)&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
Now, no matter how many steps in the expansion, the amount of
nesting is limited at every step, e.g., <code>sigma(1000)</code>
becomes
</p>
<pre>  ifelse(eval(1000&lt;1),1,,`sigma(decr(1000),eval(+1000))&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
which becomes <code>sigma(999,1000)</code> which in turn expands to
</p>
<pre>  ifelse(eval(999&lt;1),1,1000,`sigma(decr(999),eval(1000+999))&#39;)
</pre>
<p>
and so on.
</p>
<p>
Here, the default value of the added parameter (an empty string)
worked OK.
In other cases, an auxiliary macro may be required:
the auxiliary macro will then be the recursive one; the main macro
will call it, passing the appropriate initial value for the
extra parameter.
</p>
<a name="unexpandingmacros"></a>
<h2>Using unexpanding macros for arrays and hashes</h2>
<p>
Although it is not standard, <b>GNU</b> m4 allows any text string
to be defined as a macro.
Since only valid identifiers are checked against macros,
macros whose names include spaces or punctuation characters
will not be expanded.
However, they can still be accessed as variables using the
<b><code>defn</code></b> macro:
</p>
<pre>  define(`my var&#39;, `a strange one&#39;)
  my var is defn(`my var&#39;).    # -&gt; my var is a strange one.
</pre>
<p>
This feature can be used to implement arrays and hashes
(associative arrays):
</p>
<pre>  define(`_set&#39;, `define(`$1[$2]&#39;, `$3&#39;)&#39;)
  define(`_get&#39;, `defn(`$1[$2]&#39;)&#39;)
  _set(`myarray&#39;, 1, `alpha&#39;)
  _get(`myarray&#39;, 1)                  # -&gt; alpha
  _set(`myarray&#39;, `alpha&#39;, `omega&#39;)
  _get(`myarray&#39;, _get(`myarray&#39;,1))  # -&gt; omega
  defn(`myarray[alpha]&#39;)              # -&gt; omega
</pre>

<a name="substrfix"></a>
<h2>String macro problem workaround</h2>
<p>
<a href="#strings">Above</a>, we noted a problem with the string macros:
it&#39;s not possible to prevent the string that&#39;s returned
from being expanded.
</p>
<p>
Steven Simpson wrote a
<a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/websitemgmt/tools#m4patch">patch for m4</a>
which fixes the problem
by allowing an extra parameter to be passed to string macros –
however this of course means using a non-standard m4.
</p>
<p>
A less radical fix is to redefine the
<code>substr</code> macro as follows.
It works by extracting the substring one letter at a time,
thus avoiding any unwanted expansion (assuming, of course,
that no one-letter macros have been defined):
</p>
<pre>  define(`substr&#39;,`ifelse($#,0,``$0&#39;&#39;,
  $#,2,`substr($@,eval(len(`$1&#39;)-$2))&#39;,
  `ifelse(eval($3&lt;=0),1,,
  `builtin(`substr&#39;,`$1&#39;,$2,1)`&#39;substr(
  `$1&#39;,eval($2+1),eval($3-1))&#39;)&#39;)&#39;)dnl
  
  define(`eng&#39;,`engineering&#39;)
  substr(`engineer&#39;,0,3)       # -&gt; eng
</pre>
<p>
To keep it simple, this definition assumes reasonably
sensible arguments, e.g., it doesn&#39;t allow for
<code>substr(`abcdef&#39;, -2)</code> or <code>substr(`abc&#39;)</code>.
Note that, as with the corresponding builtin <code>substr</code>,
you may have problems where a string contains quotes, e.g.,
<code>substr(``quoted&#39;&#39;,0,3)</code>
</p>
<p>
The new version of <code>substr</code> can in turn be used to
implement a new version of <code>translit</code>:
</p>
<pre>  define(`translit&#39;,`ifelse($#,0,``$0&#39;&#39;,
  len(`$1&#39;),0,,
  `builtin(`translit&#39;,substr(`$1&#39;,0,1),`$2&#39;,`$3&#39;)`&#39;translit(
  substr(`$1&#39;,1),`$2&#39;,`$3&#39;)&#39;)&#39;)dnl
  
  define(`ALPHA&#39;, `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#39;)
  define(`ALPHA_UPR&#39;, `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&#39;)
  translit(`alpha&#39;, ALPHA, ALPHA_UPR)
  # -&gt; ALPHA
</pre>

<h2>M4: Assessment</h2>
<p>
M4&#39;s general character as a macro language can be seen
by comparing it to another, very different macro language:
<a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">FreeMarker</a>.
</p>
<p>
GNU m4 and FreeMarker are both free in both senses of the
word: FreeMarker is covered by a BSD-style license.
They are more-or-less equally “powerful”, e.g.,
both languages support recursive macros.
</p>
<p>
In some respects, m4 has an edge over FreeMarker:
</p>
<ul>
<li>m4 is a standalone tool, FreeMarker requires Java.
</li><li>On Unix platforms, m4 is a standard tool with a long
heritage – e.g., a Makefile can reasonably expect to be
able invoke it as a filter in a processing sequence.
</li><li>m4 scripts can interact with the Unix shell.
</li><li>m4 is arguably a simpler, “cleaner”, macro language.
</li></ul>


<p>
The two languages are quite different in appearance and
how they work.
In m4, macros are ordinary identifiers; FreeMarker uses
XML-like markup for the <code>&lt;#opening&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/#closing&gt;</code>
delimiters of macros.
While m4&#39;s textual rescanning approach is conceptually
elegant, it can be confusing in practice and demands
careful attention to layers of nested quotes.
FreeMarker, in comparison, works like a conventional
structured programming language, making it much easier
to read, write and debug.
On the other hand, FreeMarker markup is more verbose and
might seem intrusive in certain contexts, for example,
where macros are used to extend an existing programming
language.
</p>
<p>
FreeMarker has several distinct advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it has an associated tool, FMPP, which can read in data
from different sources (e.g., in XML or CSV format) and
incorporate it into the template output.
</li><li>FreeMarker has a comprehensive set of builtin macros
and better data handling capabilities.
</li><li>No compatibility issues: there is a single, cross-platform
implementation that is quite stable and mature (whereas
differences even between recent GNU m4 versions are not
strictly backwardly compatible).
</li><li>FreeMarker supports Unicode; m4 is generally limited to
ASCII, or at best 8-bit character sets.
</li></ul>


<p>
Ultimately, which language is “better” depends on the
importance of their relative advantages in different contexts.
This author has very positive experience of using
FreeMarker/FMPP for
<a href="http://statestep.com/templates.html">automatic code generation</a>
where, for several reasons, m4 was unsuitable.
On the other hand, m4 is clearly a more sensible and
appropriate choice for Unix sendmail&#39;s configuration
macros.
