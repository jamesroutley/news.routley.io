<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hantzsche%E2%80%93Wendt_manifold" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">didicosm</a> is a certain kind of three-dimensional space, one of ten <b>platycosms</b>, the name given by the mathematician
John Conway<sup><a href="#REF1">[1]</a></sup> to a space that has a finite volume, no boundary, and a <b>flat geometry</b>: the same
geometry locally as ordinary Euclidean space.  Four of the ten platycosms are 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">non-orientable</a>
(a property for which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Möbius_strip" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Möbius strip</a> is the most famous two-dimensional example) which would lead
to serious complications if we lived inside such a space, as it would allow matter to be transformed into its own mirror image just by travelling around a loop.  The remaining six, including the didicosm, are potentially candidates
for the shape of our own universe, if it happens to be finite.<sup><a href="#REF2">[2]</a></sup>
(The didicosm is also referred to as a <b>Hantzsche-Wendt Manifold</b>, named after the mathematicians who discovered it in the 1930s, but we will use the name that Conway gave it much later.)</p>
<p>A didicosm can be formed by taking a rectangular prism,
as in the image <b>on the right</b>, and “identifying” its faces, so that when you move within the prism to any point on its boundary, you re-enter it at a different point, determined by the way the faces are matched up with
each other.</p>
<p>For the two faces labelled <b>Face A</b> this is done in the simplest way possible:  if you hit the front <b>Face A</b>, you jump to the corresponding point on the back <b>Face A</b>, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For the two faces labelled <b>Face B</b>, the identification is a little trickier: when you reach points on these faces,
you jump to the other face while also undergoing a rotation by 180 degrees around a vertical axis, as indicated by
the way the labels are rotated in the image.</p>
<p>For the face labelled <b>Face C</b>, you jump to a new horizontal coordinate by adding or subtracting half the length of the face, while your vertical coordinate is reflected in the horizontal midline of the face.
The same thing happens for <b>Face D</b>.</p>
<p>These different instructions might leave you worrying about what happens along the edges, and at the vertices, of the
prism.  At first sight, the instructions seem to be potentially contradictory.  For example, suppose you hit an edge
shared by faces labelled <b>Face A</b> and <b>Face B</b>; the instructions for <b>Face A</b> tell you to jump
to another point at the same height, while those for <b>Face B</b> tell you to jump between the top and bottom
faces.  But just as the two faces labelled <b>Face A</b> only comprise a <i>single rectangle</i> within
the didicosm
itself, the four edges shared between faces labelled <b>Face A</b> and <b>Face B</b> only comprise
a <i>single line segment</i> in the didicosm.</p>
