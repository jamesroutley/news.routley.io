    <h1>Hacker News personal ranking app (2012)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
          <article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">There are way too many stories on Hacker News, and there&#39;s no option for &#34;show me only the stories that Joel would like&#34;.  So I built one.  (Maybe &#34;cobbled together&#34; is more appropriate.)</p>
<p dir="auto">I used Ruby 1.9.2 with the &#34;mongo_mapper&#34; gem.  If you want to scrape the HN daily archives to get old stories, you&#39;ll also need the &#34;nokogiri&#34; gem.  And if you want to post the results to blogger, you&#39;ll need the &#34;blogger&#34; and &#34;maruku&#34; gems.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, if one wanted to use this, one would install mongo (or already have it installed).  Then one would run &#34;scrape_old.rb&#34; to download the old HN daily archives.  And one would run &#34;scrape_api.rb&#34; to download the more recent stories.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next one would run &#34;judger.rb&#34; and rate a lot of stories as to whether you liked or disliked them.  Once you&#39;re done judging, it will automatically build a model and predict for everything in the database and spit out some stats.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can do what you want with the results.  I post mine to <a href="http://joelgrus-hackernews.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Blogger</a>, using the code in &#34;blogger.rb&#34;.  This runs automatically once an hour, as does &#34;scrape_api.rb&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">That&#39;s it.  The Porter Stemmer &#34;stemmable.rb&#34; is the canonical version that floats around the web.  The list in &#34;stopwords.rb&#34; I found on a website.  Everything else is by me, and you can use it for whatever you want to, although I&#39;m not sure that you <em>would</em> want to.</p>
