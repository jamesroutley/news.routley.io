                        <p><span>Researchers have linked the travels of a 14,000-year-old woolly mammoth with the oldest
                              known human settlements in Alaska, providing clues about the relationship between
                              the iconic species and some of the earliest people to travel across the Bering Land
                              Bridge.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>Scientists made those connections by using isotope analysis to study the life of a
                              female mammoth, </span><a href="https://media.uaf.edu/media/t/1_90y53m1b"><span>named Élmayųujey&#39;eh</span></a><span> by the Healy Lake Village Council</span><span>. A </span><span>tusk from Elma was discovered at the Swan Point archaeological site in Interior Alaska.
                              Samples from the tusk revealed details about Elma and the roughly 1,000-kilometer
                              journey she took through Alaska and northwestern Canada during her lifetime.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>Isotopic data, along with DNA from other mammoths at the site and archaeological evidence,
                              indicates that early Alaskans likely structured their settlements to overlap with
                              areas where mammoths congregated. Those findings, </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk0818"><span>highlighted in the new issue of the journal Science Advances</span></a><span>, provide evidence that mammoths and early hunter-gatherers shared habitat in the
                              region. The long-term predictable presence of woolly mammoths would have attracted
                              humans to the area.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>“She wandered around the densest region of archaeological sites in Alaska,” said Audrey
                              Rowe, a University of Alaska Fairbanks Ph.D. student and lead author of the paper.
                              “It looks like these early people were establishing hunting camps in areas that were
                              frequented by mammoths.”</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>The mammoth tusk was excavated and identified in 2009 by Charles Holmes, affiliate
                              research professor of anthropology at UAF, and François Lanoë, research associate
                              in archaeology at the University of Alaska Museum of the North. They found Elma’s
                              tusk and the remains of two related juvenile mammoths, along with evidence of campfires,
                              the use of stone tools and butchered remains of other game. All of this “indicates
                              a pattern consistent with human hunting of mammoths,” </span><span>said </span><span>Ben Potter, an archaeologist and professor of anthropology at UAF.</span><span> </span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>Researchers at UAF’s Alaska Stable Isotope Facility then analyzed thousands of samples
                              from Elma’s tusk to recreate her life and travels. Isotopes provide chemical markers
                              of an animal’s diet and location. The markers are then recorded in the bones and tissues
                              of animals and remain even after they die. </span></p>

                        <p><span>Mammoth tusks are well-suited to isotopic study because they grew throughout the ancient
                              animals’ lives, with clearly visible layers appearing when split lengthwise. Those
                              growth bands give researchers a way to collect a chronological record of a mammoth’s
                              life by studying isotopes in samples along the tusk.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>Using that isotopic data, researchers determined Elma was a healthy 20-year-old female.
                              Much of her journey overlapped with that of </span><a href="https://www.uaf.edu/news/study-takes-unprecedented-peek-into-life-of-17000-year-old-mammoth.php"><span>a previously studied male mammoth who lived 3,000 years earlier</span></a><span>, demonstrating long-term movement patterns by mammoths over several millennia. </span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>“She was a young adult in the prime of life. Her isotopes showed she was not malnourished
                              and that she died in the same season as the seasonal hunting camp at Swan Point where
                              her tusk was found,” said senior author Matthew Wooller, who is director of the Alaska
                              Stable Isotope Facility and a professor at UAF’s College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span>The era in which Elma lived may have compounded the challenges posed by the relatively
                              recent appearance of humans. The grass- and shrub-dominated steppe landscape that
                              had been common in Interior Alaska was beginning to shift toward more forested terrain.</span></p>
