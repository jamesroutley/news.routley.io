    <h1>What a gas stove ban means for restaurants</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><div data-subscriber-content=""><p>Dinner at Park’s BBQ in Koreatown inevitably starts with a small flame.</p><p>Even before a greeting and the drink order, your server lifts the grate on your table grill and turns a knob. There’s the faint smell of gas and a barely audible hiss. At the click of a lighter, the flames start to dance under the grill.</p><p>It’s a ritual that starts the meal, repeated at so many Korean BBQ restaurants around town, readying the table for the procession of meats, vegetables and seafood to come.</p><p>“The tabletop gas grill is an important part of our Korean food culture,” said Ryan Park, general manager of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-01-24/101-best-restaurants-koreatown">Park’s BBQ</a>. “It’s connected to the taste of the food and how we grill the meat.”</p><p>All that may change by 2023 — at least in new Los Angeles buildings.

But voices in the restaurant world are already sounding an alarm.</p><p>“With the sheer number of restaurants in L.A., this will have a massive impact on the future of the restaurant industry and how many diverse cuisines are offered,” said Jot Condie, president of the California Restaurant Assn.</p><p>Without any specific exceptions outlined for restaurants in Los Angeles just yet, many chefs and restaurants that rely on gas to cook their food are expressing worries. The move could increase the cost of doing business and push some cooking techniques, and many styles of cooking, out of the city’s new developments.</p><p>Leo and Lydia Lee, owners of RiceBox, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2021-04-21/la-chile-sauces-oils-crisps-try-now">a Cantonese BBQ restaurant</a> in downtown Los Angeles, use gas to cook the entirety of their menu, with the exception of rice. Gas powers the stoves used to cook dishes in a wok and the custom barbecue oven used to prepare the restaurant’s signature char siu Duroc pork, roasted low and slow with a sweet honey glaze.</p><p>“The wok itself is really essential to Asian cuisine,” Leo said. “By taking gas away, you’re telling us we cannot use woks anymore, essentially taking away our identity and heritage. It forces us to adapt to American culture.”</p><p>If there’s no gas, Lee said he “won’t even consider” opening a second location of RiceBox in Los Angeles.</p><h2 id="flame-is-critical">‘Flame is critical’</h2>
<p>The California Restaurant Assn., which lobbies for California restaurant owners, attempted to block a 2019 phaseout of gas hookups in all newly constructed residential buildings and most nonresidential buildings in Berkeley. In <a href="http://climatecasechart.com/case/california-restaurant-association-v-city-of-berkeley/" target="_blank">a lawsuit filed against the city</a>, which is still being litigated, the CRA argued that restaurants “rely on gas for cooking particular types of food, whether it be flame-seared meats, charred vegetables, or the use of intense heat from a flame under a wok.”</p><p>The suit went on to argue that the CRA’s members “will be unable to prepare many of their specialties without natural gas and will lose speed and control over the manner and flavor of food preparation.”</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" data-lazy-load="true" data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4964b29/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a322b7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90a55a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d330906/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 840w" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-sizes="100vw"/>     <img alt="Owner Leo Lee demonstrates making his chile oil at RiceBox in downtown, over gas-powered flames." data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8cf088a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/faac0d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3aec4a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5989c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg 840w" data-sizes="100vw" width="840" height="560" data-src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5989c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3531x2354+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F53%2F884144cf48419530ba9f4cfba7d5%2Fla-photos-1staff-751485-fo-0412-chile-crisp-ricebox-mrt-07.jpg" data-lazy-load="true" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/>  </picture>   <div> <p>Owner Leo Lee demonstrates making his chile oil at RiceBox in downtown, over gas-powered flames.</p><p>(Mariah Tauger / Los Angeles Times)</p> </div>  </figure></div><p>“Flame is critical for [chefs] to create their masterpieces,” said Condie of the association members. “It’s like asking an artist to throw away all their small paintbrushes and start painting with a roller.”</p><p>At Chengdu Taste in Alhambra, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/la-xpm-2013-aug-03-la-fo-gold-20130803-story.html">one of the city’s most lauded Sichuan restaurants</a>, managing partner Sean Xie said everything from the fried rice, to the fiery stir-fried eggplant and the kung pao chicken, is prepared using high heat on gas-powered equipment.</p><p>“There is no substitute if you ban gas equipment,”  Xie said. “For Chinese cuisine, we use a technique called stir-frying and the temperature is key.”</p><p>Many of the dishes at Chengdu Taste require a jolt of heat to caramelize and sear the surface of the meats, vegetables and seafood;

So most dishes in the wok would lose some of that wok hei character, which is fundamental to many (not all) dishes cooked in the wok.”</p><p>While it would be hard to make the switch to electric or induction, Ng does think it is possible. </p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-left=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" data-lazy-load="true" data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/358a5b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/320x480!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e72412e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/568x852!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/760aa22/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/768x1152!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/340d7e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/840x1260!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 840w" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-sizes="100vw"/>     <img alt="A cook sears gai lan at Cassia." data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10bb488/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/320x480!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf7cad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/568x852!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2cba93/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/768x1152!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8bd062/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/840x1260!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg 840w" data-sizes="100vw" width="840" height="1260" data-src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8bd062/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x3000+0+0/resize/840x1260!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fc2%2F1807465c4f9fa9ceef3f9f996206%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-646581-la-fo-101-cassia-sr0774-1.jpg" data-lazy-load="true" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/>  </picture>   <div> <p>A cook sears gai lan at Cassia.</p><p>(Silvia Razgova)</p> </div>  </figure></div><p>Condie is hoping for an exemption for L.A. restaurants, similar to the infeasibility waivers considered for restaurants in Sacramento that can show challenges posed by electrifying the business.</p><p>“For the most part, I do believe most cooking can be done with electric or induction cooking equipment, but it would require a lot of re-training to get there, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing and better for the environment,” wrote Ng. “But you’ll have to have the resources to do so…&#34;</p><p>Xie estimates that he pays around $500 to $700 a month on gas, and about $1,200 on electricity.</p><p>Lee said that running an all-electric kitchen would likely double his monthly expenses.
