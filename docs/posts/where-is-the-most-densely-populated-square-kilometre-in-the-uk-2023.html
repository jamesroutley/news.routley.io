    <h1>Where is the most densely populated square kilometre in the UK? (2023)</h1>

<p>After the recent release of England and Wales Census data for 2021 I decided to take a quick look at which areas have the highest population density. I&#39;ve done this kind of thing before, for the <a href="http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2018/01/the-most-densely-populated-square.html" target="_blank">whole of Europe</a> and also in relation to thinking about measures of population density more generally - in short, my view is that using the arithmetic mean approach to density makes very little sense at the country level because it doesn&#39;t reflect how we actually experience density (unless we live somewhere like Monaco). That&#39;s why I came up with the very simple idea of using &#39;<a href="https://theconversation.com/think-your-country-is-crowded-these-maps-reveal-the-truth-about-population-density-across-europe-90345" target="_blank">lived density</a>&#39; instead. But this piece is about my attempt to find the area of the UK with the highest population density in a single square km. And note that I say &#39;in the UK&#39; in the title because the highest density area of the UK is within London - the highest densities in (e.g.) Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast are about half that of London&#39;s densest areas. Here&#39;s where I think the most densely populated square kilometre in the UK is, based on 2021 Census data.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuvqMGLymSXOntxH3ELvm8mphPq-BPF1ww57c3SyjxpvXDysul3EpoJo80sVhOfRPvyMwd3yNuKitvIu80OPxZonwfc6A2UOnfXhYXebCdFPhfrlgvAO8NmTPe-JBS1w4UQuWQ8vUnGlxDafafBjsxEswSk7ztRz0zuayN4x4OIDoLzxGvNDmI1p4FIA/s1771/uk-most-dense-bow-2021-24k.png"><img data-original-height="1771" data-original-width="1771" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuvqMGLymSXOntxH3ELvm8mphPq-BPF1ww57c3SyjxpvXDysul3EpoJo80sVhOfRPvyMwd3yNuKitvIu80OPxZonwfc6A2UOnfXhYXebCdFPhfrlgvAO8NmTPe-JBS1w4UQuWQ8vUnGlxDafafBjsxEswSk7ztRz0zuayN4x4OIDoLzxGvNDmI1p4FIA/w400-h400/uk-most-dense-bow-2021-24k.png" width="400"/></a></td></tr><tr><td>This is the answer to my question - read on to see how I got here</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
