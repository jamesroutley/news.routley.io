    <h1>Inflection-2.5: meet the best personal AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id=""><div justify="center"><div><div><p>At Inflection, our mission is to create a personal AI for everyone. Last May, we released <a href="https://pi.ai/talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pi</a>—a personal AI, designed to be empathetic, helpful, and safe. In November we announced a new major foundation model, <a href="https://inflection.ai/inflection-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflection-2</a>, the second best LLM in the world at the time.</p>
<p>Now we are adding IQ to Pi’s exceptional EQ.</p>
<p>We are launching Inflection-2.5, our upgraded in-house model that is competitive with all the world&#39;s leading LLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini. It couples raw capability with our signature personality and unique empathetic fine-tuning. Inflection-2.5 is available to all Pi&#39;s users today, at <a href="https://pi.ai/talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>pi.ai</strong></a>, on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-personal-ai-assistant/id6445815935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>iOS</strong></a>, on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.inflection.pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Android</strong></a>, or our new <a href="https://pi.ai/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>desktop</strong></a> app.</p>
<p>We achieved this milestone with incredible efficiency: Inflection-2.5 approaches GPT-4’s performance, but used <strong>only 40% of the amount of compute for training</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ve made particular strides in areas of IQ like coding and mathematics. This translates into concrete improvements on key industry benchmarks, ensuring Pi always pushes at the technological frontier. Pi now also incorporates <strong>world-class real-time web search capabilities</strong> to ensure users get high-quality breaking news and up-to-date information.</p>
<p>We’ve already rolled out Inflection-2.5 to our users, and they are really enjoying Pi! We’ve seen a very significant impact on user sentiment, engagement, and retention accelerating our organic user growth.</p>
<p>Our one million daily and six million monthly active users have now exchanged more than four billion messages with Pi.</p>
<p>An average conversation with Pi lasts <strong>33 minutes</strong> and one in ten lasts over an hour each day.  About <strong>60%</strong> of people who talk to Pi on any given week return the following week and we see higher monthly stickiness than leading competitors.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
