    <h1>Using Apple Shortcuts to Find My Phone</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>[<em>Note: I got this idea from a Reddit post. I couldn&#39;t find the original post, but I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/1haai8k/sharing_shortcut_to_find_lost_phone/">others similar implementations</a>.]</em></p>
<p>In February, I <a href="https://liquidbrain.net/blog/gemini-transcription-shortcut/">wrote about</a> an Apple Shortcut which transcribed my handwriting. In this post, I&#39;ll cover the other Apple Shortcut I use frequently: find your phone with just a text.</p>
<p>I lose my phone in my house constantly. Having a friend call me works only if I keep my phone off silent. The FindMy app is a pain. What I&#39;d like is a code someone else can text me, which would make noise even if my phone is on silent.</p>
<p>This is pretty easy to do in the Apple Shortcuts app! Just follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Shortcuts app.</li>
<li>Go to the Automation tab and press &#34;New Automation.&#34; 
<img alt="IMG_4409.PNG" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/13bde371.png"/></li>
<li>Scroll down and select the option &#34;Message&#34;
<img alt="IMG_4410.JPG" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/eebf9e87.jpeg"/></li>
<li>Set your code message. A short phrase that isn&#39;t going to show up in regular texting is probably best. Example: &#34;Sing for me, Kai&#39;s iPhone.&#34; The code message isn&#39;t case sensitive, as far as I can tell. (I won&#39;t share my actual code...)</li>
<li>Click &#34;Run Immediately,&#34; and then Next. <img alt="IMG_4412.PNG" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/a85643ef.png"/></li>
<li>Click &#34;New Blank Automation&#34;
<img alt="IMG_4413.PNG" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/dc0ed9d2.png"/></li>
<li>Type &#34;Start Timer&#34; into the actions search bar. <img alt="IMG_4414.PNG" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/40f91722.png"/></li>
<li>Set a timer for 2 seconds. <img alt="IMG_5423.jpg" src="https://mataroa.blog/images/13c265c2.jpeg"/></li>
</ol>
<p>And there you go! If anyone texts you your secret code, a timer will go off on your phone a couple of seconds later, as long as it can receive texts.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Best to test this once you&#39;ve set it up! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Signal (kai_williams.48), or respond in the comments!</li>
<li>Keep your code close to your chest. My family and partner knows. This is easy to disable, but probably best for strangers not to know.</li>
<li>This works best if your phone is in the same physical location as you. I don&#39;t know how to disable the alarm from abroad.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In my previous post, I complained a lot about Apple Shortcuts, because I was using it as a general purpose programming language. This task showcases the strengths of Shortcuts: a simple task that requires integration with the rest of the Apple ecosystem.</li>
<li>I came across this idea from on the Shortcuts subreddit (r/shortcuts). This is the closest thing to documentation for Apple Shortcuts, and people make a lot of cool projects on it. If you&#39;re a specific type of nerd, you might enjoy it! (For instance, here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/1cyyz25/sharing_my_most_useful_shortcuts_from_ai_to_dd_to/
