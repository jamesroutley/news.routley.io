</div><p>NASA has re-established contact with its tiny helicopter on Mars, the US space agency said Saturday, after an unexpected outage prompted fears that the hard-working craft had finally met its end.</p>


		    <!-- Phys.org - News - AMP -->
		

                    <p>Ingenuity, a drone about 1.6 feet (0.5 meters) tall, arrived on Mars in 2021 aboard the rover Perseverance and became the first motorized craft to fly autonomously on another planet.</p>
<p>Data from the helicopter are transmitted via Perseverance back to Earth, but communications were suddenly lost during a test flight on Thursday, Ingenuity&#39;s 72nd lift-off on Mars.</p>
<p>&#34;Good news today,&#34; NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) wrote on X, formerly Twitter, late Saturday.</p>
<p>The agency said that contact had finally been made with the helicopter by commanding Perseverance to &#34;perform long-duration listening sessions for Ingenuity&#39;s signal.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The team is reviewing the new data to better understand the unexpected comms dropout during Flight 72,&#34; it added.</p>
<p>NASA previously said that Ingenuity had attained an altitude of 40 feet (12 meters) on Flight 72, which was a &#34;quick pop-up vertical flight to check out the helicopter&#39;s systems, following an unplanned early landing during its previous flight.&#34;</p>
<p>But during its descent, &#34;communications between the helicopter and rover terminated early, prior to touchdown,&#34; the agency said.</p>
<p>JPL had noted on Friday that Perseverance was temporarily &#34;out of line-of-sight with Ingenuity, but the team could consider driving closer for a visual inspection.&#34;</p>
<p>In a response to a post on X asking if Ingenuity would be able to fly again, JPL said Saturday that &#34;the team needs to assess the new data before that can be determined.&#34;</p>
<p>NASA has lost contact with the helicopter before, including for an agonizing two months last year.</p>
<p>The mini rotorcraft, which weighs just four pounds (1.8 kilograms), has far exceeded its original goal of undertaking five flights over 30 days on the red planet.</p>
<p>In all, it has covered just over 10 miles (17 kilometers) and reached altitudes of up to 79 feet (24 meters).</p>
<p>Its longevity has proved remarkable, particularly considering that it must survive glacially cold Martian nights, kept warm by the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+panels/" rel="tag">solar panels</a> that recharge its batteries during daylight hours.</p>
<p>Working with Perseverance, it has acted as an aerial scout to assist its wheeled companion in searching for possible signs of ancient microbial life.</p>
