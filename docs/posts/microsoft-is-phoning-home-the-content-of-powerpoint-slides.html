    <h1>Microsoft is phoning home the content of PowerPoint slides</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>Were you aware of it: Microsoft is phoning home the content of your PowerPoint slides.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t just take my word for it: open up the network monitor of your choice. Close all of your other applications or perform a fresh restart.</p>
<p>Fire up PowerPoint. Turn off all the cloud options. Make a new slide with a title of your choice. Choose &#34;Designer.&#34; Look at your network traffic as you do.</p>
<p>It makes sense: the tool is reading your text and suggesting designs/delivering stock photography. But this means that any data that you might want to keep private is being sent to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Did we consent to this?</p>
