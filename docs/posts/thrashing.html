		<p>I’ve invested in a new odometer to help my car go faster. Accountability is important, and as a driver I believe the most important thing I can do is set measurable, achievable and inspiring goals for the people pushing my car down the road.</p>
<p>I’m never sure what to say to people who… don’t quite seem to realize they sound like this. I think, what chain of reasoning brought us to this? How did we get here? </p>
<p>But I think I know how we got here.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/multitasking/">So, about this link</a>.</p>
<p>No disrespect to my old team – hey, team, hey – but… look, the fact that “manager”, “leader” and “culture” are nowhere in this article (are nowhere in so many articles like it about how people struggle to manage their time) is telling.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The underlying message is clear: We’re all just distracted by our devices, victims of shrinking attention spans who could stop multitasking if we’d just exercise more self-control.”</p></blockquote>
<p>… and this is victim-blaming. </p>
<p>People multitask because they’ve been <em>assigned multiple unprioritized tasks</em>. People are distracted and unfocused because day to day their managers and leaders value responding to distractions and interruptions over consistency and focus. But for some reason – focus, <a href="https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2020/03/18/notice/">burnout</a>, you name it – there’s always somebody out there ready to shift the the blame for management and leadership shortcomings to the individual.</p>
<p>I can understand the seduction in the reasoning – telling disempowered, demoralized people that they just need to do these few things feels a lot like helping! And for the audience it might even be a relief to find something like agency, to have a direction to move and a sense that somebody hears you. But it’s not real help and it’s not real agency and individual action won’t change systemic problems. Excusing failures of power this way is a kind of participatory gaslighting.</p>
<p>If prioritizing interruptions ahead of everything else isn’t just tolerated but valorized where you work – that “<acronym title="A code that means &#39;you will never be able to concentrate on anything for more than ten minutes in a row ever again.&#39;">fast paced, dynamic environment”</acronym> everyone is so proud to put in their job descriptions – then the problem is not one person’s attention span.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I tried Asana, Trello, all the project management tools. It’s just too much.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those. Aren’t. Productivity. Tools. They’re accountability tools that foist the scut work of management off on the people being managed, one more thing tossed on the multitasking pile.</p>
<p>We all know what real productivity tools are; the litmus is simple: if the tool goes away, does the work stop?</p>
<p>Take away version control or CI, and we’re in weeds pretty quickly. The bug tracker’s down? <em>Red alert.</em> If editors and compilers go away – R-studio, Excel or Illustrator if those are your creative tools, you know what I mean – you might as well have cut power to the building.</p>
<p>Asana’s gone? Enh, it’ll probably be back eventually. We’ll be fine for a week or two. Oh no my epics, said not a single human ever. </p>
<p>Helping people and teams work effectively together – defining and fostering the organization’s operational culture – is the responsibility of leadership. It’s unambiguously the most important part of the job. </p>
<p>There are a thousand ways to start working on chronic distraction and frantic multitasking and a thousand other real, sand-in-the-gears problems like them, but change for the better in any org only starts when the responsibility and accountability for change lives exactly where it belongs. </p>
<p>And wherever that is, I guarantee it’s never in the pants pockets of the people hanging by a thread off the bottom of your orgchart.</p>
