    <h1>I finally got Twitter after years of not getting it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div>
        <p>I was pretty socially awkward until my late 20s, just a few years ago.</p><p>Still, I managed to <em>figure out</em> Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn over the years.</p><p>But Twitter was always a mystery to me. It was different and I just didn&#39;t <em>get it</em>.</p><p>This changed in 2022. I&#39;ve now been active on Twitter for a few months, and I love it. So, I&#39;m dedicating this article to my 400 followers and Twitter friends.</p><p>Here&#39;s everything I know about Twitter so far:</p><hr/><p>I got my first PC with a dial-up modem when I was 12.</p><p>There were no social networks back then around here (in Latvia), but IRC was all the rage. So, my early online years were made up of a dozen small channels and DMs with the people I knew, mostly classmates and friends.</p><p>I was a massive introvert back then, so I had little interest in the early social media of the mid-2000s. Hiding behind an IRC handle was one thing, but putting my real self out there for everyone to see was different. Intimidating. It just wasn&#39;t for me.</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="491" height="406"/><figcaption>On the Internet, nobody knows you&#39;re a socially awkward introvert.</figcaption></figure><p>So, I spent years scoffing at Facebook and Instagram before finally caving in and signing up in the early 2010s. Around that time I went through <a href="https://martinboss.com/why-notes-why-diary/">my first identity crisis</a>. This made me just a little bit more comfortable with being myself online and offline. Still, I was relatively private on socials, and mostly interacted with friends.</p><p>This was also when I signed up for Twitter. But it wasn&#39;t a big deal around here in 2013, and I had no friends on Twitter, so nothing came of it. I didn&#39;t tweet once.</p><p>By 2018, I was running my small software biz. That&#39;s when I got active on LinkedIn, started publishing my thoughts on the marketplace industry, and built up a network of about a thousand followers. I was still self-conscious at that time, but I learned to <a href="https://martinboss.com/personal-professional-divide/">put on a professional mask</a> on LinkedIn, which made it bearable.</p><p>Why not do the same on Twitter?</p><p>Well, I gave it a try:</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="613" height="1127" srcset="https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/image-1.png 600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-1.png 613w"/><figcaption>Wow Martin you really are a genius! Proud of you.</figcaption></figure><p>Not great.</p><p>See what my problem was?</p><p><strong>Yep, I didn&#39;t understand the essence of Twitter.</strong> I was all over the place: a little bragging, a little personal stuff, a bit of business. Zero engagement.</p><p>Here&#39;s how I understood the different social networks back then:</p><ul><li>Facebook is for staying in touch with friends, bragging about my social activities (&#34;I&#39;m meeting people, everyone!&#34;), and ranting about life.</li><li>Instagram is for showing the way I see the world, bragging about life (&#34;I&#39;m traveling, everyone!&#34;), and sharing my thoughts.</li><li>LinkedIn is for professional connections, sharing my thoughts on business, and occasional self-promotion (&#34;I built this great thing, everyone!&#34;)</li><li>Twitter is...</li></ul><p>...I had no idea what Twitter was.</p><p>A few things confused me about it:</p><h2 id="i-just-didnt-get-twitter">I just didn&#39;t get Twitter</h2><p>How do you (typically) get started on Twitter?</p><p>You sign up, follow the people you&#39;re interested in, and start interacting with them.</p><p><strong>That was my first problem. Who was I actually interested in?</strong></p><p>Back then, I saw two main use cases of Twitter:</p><ul><li><strong>Personal, local. </strong>Interact with the people around you, e.g. friends, coworkers, politicians, local personalities.</li><li><strong>Professional, international.</strong> Follow the people in the industry, in my case tech bros, founders, investors, journalists.</li></ul><p>Kinda makes sense?</p><p>But it didn&#39;t work for me:</p><ul><li>I didn&#39;t need Twitter for personal and local use. It wasn&#39;t big here, my friends were on Facebook and Instagram, I wasn&#39;t into local politics and culture, and...</li><li>...I already had LinkedIn for professional use, where I could connect with the people in the industry, locally and internationally. And it worked fine for me.</li></ul><p>So there was no real reason for me to use Twitter.</p><p><strong>My second problem was that I didn&#39;t get &#34;tweeting&#34;.</strong></p><p>I was <a href="https://martinboss.com/why-do-i-write/">a long-form person</a> and a photo person. It was either <em>publishing articles</em>, or <em>sharing photos</em>, but not <em>sharing thoughts </em>or <em>interacting</em>.</p><p>Social anxiety was one of the reasons. Publishing an article was stressful enough, but it didn&#39;t happen often. Twitter, though? Absolutely draining. I could spend an hour crafting a seemingly offhand tweet just to be 100% sure I don&#39;t accidentally embarrass myself somehow. I could write a LinkedIn post faster than that!</p><p><strong>Another problem was the mix of professional and personal.</strong></p><p>In my world, these things were strictly separate. Personally, I was a Latvian dude struggling with my tiny business. Professionally, I was a founder of a marketplace software company primarily working with international clients.</p><p>It felt weird seeing Silicon Valley entrepreneurs casually mix their personal and professional things. My compartmentalized brain couldn&#39;t quite process that.</p><p><strong>Finally, I felt irrelevant on Twitter.</strong></p><p>Since my business was international and I was generally inspired by the US tech industry, I mostly followed the big US tech accounts on Twitter. Yet I had little in common with them. I lived in a different world, both geographically and culturally.</p><p>I knew I could reply to Elon Musk, but I&#39;d be one of a million people replying to Elon Musk. I felt like I was just a drop in the Twitter ocean. Completely irrelevant.</p><p>I was an NPC tweeting into the void. And I didn&#39;t last long.</p><h2 id="what-do-you-want-out-of-it">What do you want out of it?</h2><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with being a casual Twitter user, an NPC.</p><p>You&#39;re free to follow whomever you like, share your thoughts and photos occasionally, retweet things you enjoy, and reply to Elon Musk.</p><p>If that works for you - great!</p><p>I wasn&#39;t really enjoying it since I was getting zero engagement. What&#39;s the point? I had other socials for &#34;being a casual user&#34;, and doing it on Twitter made no sense.</p><p>What if I told you there&#39;s a better way to use Twitter?</p><p>That&#39;s right. It&#39;s called having a good reason to be there.</p><p>Here are a few good reasons to be on Twitter:</p><ul><li><strong>To stay informed</strong> about what&#39;s going on (in the world, in your country, in your industry, in your community, in the niche you&#39;re in).</li><li><strong>To meet and connect</strong> with like-minded people, find new Twitter friends with common interests, and expand your social circle.</li><li><strong>To promote</strong> your business or sell your products and services. Twitter is a great way to do it without being pushy.</li><li><strong>To share</strong> your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with the world. Create serendipity around yourself!</li><li><strong>To help</strong> people who are currently at the stages of their lives that you&#39;ve already gone through. Share your lessons!</li></ul><p>See? This instantly makes Twitter more purposeful.</p><p>It also gives you a clearer path forward than simply following a bunch of people, tweeting random stuff, and feeling completely irrelevant.</p><p>And there&#39;s no reason to stick to a single goal, too. You can (and should) have a mix of reasons to be on Twitter. It&#39;s perfectly fine to want to connect with people while also promoting your business and sharing your thoughts.</p><p>But first, there&#39;s one more thing I want to talk about:</p><p>Your niche.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-feel-about-niches">How do you feel about niches?</h2><p><em>The first step to success in life and business is to find your niche.</em></p><p>Whew. How did that line make you feel?</p><p>If you&#39;re a generalist like me, you&#39;ve just sighed and rolled your eyes.</p><p><em>&#34;Find your niche&#34;</em> is my least favorite advice out there. As a generalist, I&#39;m interested in ALL the things. Sometimes I like to imagine the possibility of getting cloned and seeing my clones become scientists, lawyers, electricians, adventurers, plumbers, and motorcycle racers. And a thousand other things.</p><p>Is it weird? Am I the only one doing it?</p><p>Anyway, I find it almost impossible to limit myself to pursuing a few specific things. That would mean missing out on everything else that&#39;s out there!</p><p>And yet, &#34;find your niche&#34; isn&#39;t the worst advice you&#39;ll hear.</p><p>It&#39;s kinda true. There&#39;s only one life, and there&#39;s only 24 hours in a day. Not focusing on anything at all will likely mean not achieving anything in particular. It&#39;s hard to make meaningful progress in something when you&#39;re all over the place.</p><p>Lately, I&#39;ve come to accept the fact that I need to focus.</p><p>Still, I don&#39;t call it a niche. That&#39;s way too limiting. Besides, I&#39;m still curious about a bunch of different stuff, even when I&#39;m focused.</p><p>Instead, I call it my core set of interests:</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/IMG_0134.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1772" height="1329" srcset="https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/IMG_0134.jpg 600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/IMG_0134.jpg 1000w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/IMG_0134.jpg 1600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/IMG_0134.jpg 1772w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>My core set of interests. It&#39;s an older draft, but you get the idea.</figcaption></figure><p>Here&#39;s my core set of interests:</p><ul><li><strong>Creating things</strong>, e.g. building products, creating content, entrepreneurship, creativity, etc.</li><li><strong>Making things happen</strong>, e.g. managing people, projects, and products, organizing processes, etc.</li><li><strong>Psychology</strong>, especially related to productivity, habits, mental health, communication, &#34;how people work&#34;, etc.</li></ul><p>In addition to this, I&#39;m big on two other areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Skills </strong>related to my core interests, e.g. writing, speaking, networking, presenting, organizing, etc.</li><li><strong>Things I enjoy</strong> in life, e.g. dogs, extreme sports, nature, friends, and whatnot.</li></ul><p>See, it&#39;s not quite a &#34;niche&#34;. Niches are more specific, but this is as specific as I&#39;m willing to go, at least right now. Still better than not having anything at all!</p><p>Are you a <em>niche</em> person, or a <em>core set of interests</em> person?</p><h2 id="find-your-twitter-people">Find your Twitter people</h2><p>Now let&#39;s find the people you&#39;ll hang out with on Twitter.</p><p>If you&#39;re introverted, how do you feel about being alone at a party or an event?</p><p>Some of my memories from the mid-2010s are about attending various high-powered startup events where I would just awkwardly sit somewhere in the back row all by myself and fumble with my phone for hours. Not exciting!</p><p>What if you knew at least a few people? A world of difference! Even if all of you are awkward engineers that would rather not be there, it&#39;s still better than being alone.</p><p>Twitter can be like that, too.</p><p>Just like in real life, knowing a single person who&#39;s part of your Twitter <em>community </em>makes the experience more fun. And when there&#39;s one, there&#39;s more. This is crucial especially if you&#39;re just starting out on Twitter.</p><p>Here&#39;s my recent experience:</p><p>I got back on Twitter in November 2021. At this point, I had about 200 random followers from my previous run, but I didn&#39;t know any of them, so you might as well say I had 0 followers. I was definitely not part of any communities, and I didn&#39;t feel like I belonged anywhere on Twitter.</p><p>So for a few months, I did the only thing I knew how to do. I published occasional tweets about nothing in particular and tried interacting with random people:</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="655" height="1153" srcset="https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/image-4.png 600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-4.png 655w"/></figure><p>The result?</p><p>I actually lost a follower in November, and then another one in December:</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1214" height="909" srcset="https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/image-5.png 600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/image-5.png 1000w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-5.png 1214w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>So many tweets, so little to show for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Oh, come on! It felt like 2018 all over again. What a waste of time.</p><p>But this time, I was absolutely determined to figure it out. So when the New Year rolled around, I finally started doing research. Meaning I googled &#34;how does Twitter work&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t understand Twitter&#34;.</p><p>That&#39;s how I found out about Jay Clouse and his <a href="https://tweet100.com/">Tweet100 community</a> dedicated to being consistent on Twitter. But it was more than just that! Most importantly, it was a friendly group of people with diverse interests aligned around a single goal:</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1387" height="1092" srcset="https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/image-8.png 600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/image-8.png 1000w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-8.png 1387w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>This felt like a community I could get on board with!</figcaption></figure><p>That&#39;s exactly what I was missing all along!</p><p>I signed up for the Tweet100 challenge on the second week of January, and that month I gained followers for the first time in years:</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1201" height="1027" srcset="https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/image-6.png 600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/image-6.png 1000w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-6.png 1201w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Whoa, I&#39;m gaining followers instead of losing them!</figcaption></figure><p>Notice the difference?</p><p>Similar numbers of tweets and impressions, but a lot more profile visits and mentions. <strong>I was interacting with the people I had something in common with.</strong></p><p>And unlike my 200 random followers I didn&#39;t know, these were real people. They became my first Twitter friends, and it was only up from there.</p><p>Do you absolutely need a formal community or a challenge?</p><p>Nah. I enjoyed Tweet100, and I recommend you take part in it, sure. But the important thing is to understand the community aspect of Twitter, and how it works. Then, all you need is a place where like-minded people gather, which can be a hashtag, a big account, or a group of <em>experts</em>.</p><p>Here are a few of my personal <em>community</em> suggestions:</p><p><strong>If you&#39;re getting started or leveling up your Twitter skills, check out:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/MeetKevon">Kevon Cheung&#39;s</a> Making Twitter Friends course and other resources.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl">Arvid Kahl&#39;s</a> Find Your Following course and YouTube channel.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/jayclouse">Jay Clouse</a> and the Tweet100 challenge I mentioned earlier.</li></ul><p>They also have great resources for creators and are big on building in public. And they&#39;re all amazing humans, too!</p><p>Now, a few more suggestions based on my core interests:</p><ul><li><strong>For more public builders and creators</strong>, start with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23buildinpublic">#buildinpublic</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dagorenouf">Dagobert Renouf</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexLlullTW">Alex Llull</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tdinh_me">Tony Dinh</a>.</li><li><strong>For writing online</strong>, start with <a href="https://twitter.com/dickiebush">Dickie Bush</a> (Ship 30 for 30) and <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell">David Perell</a> (Write of Passage). There&#39;s also <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WritingCommunity">#WritingCommunity</a> for writing in general.</li><li><strong>For product management</strong>, start with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23prodmgmt">#prodmgmt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/onejasonknight">Jason Knight</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/johncutlefish">John Cutler</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/shreyas">Shreyas Doshi</a>.</li></ul><p>A quick tip: don&#39;t simply follow them. Keep reading for a better way. </p><p>I&#39;m also maintaining <a href="https://twitter.com/imMartinBoss/lists">lists of people</a> grouped by my interests, the big ones being:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1493720411976224768?s=20">Product+</a> for product people.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1493924002653425665?s=20">Creators+</a> for creators and builders.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1494095388130877443?s=20">Thinking+</a> for people who make me think.</li></ul><p>Finally, there&#39;s of course me and my Twitter friends.</p><p>Follow me and join us - being part of a community is way more fun! </p><p>Never tweet into the void again.</p><h2 id="the-right-content-mix">The right content mix</h2><p>Alright, so what do you tweet about exactly?</p><p>As you&#39;ve seen above, I used to tweet about pretty much everything:</p><ul><li>I made sock-buying product management puns (it wasn&#39;t THAT bad!)</li><li>I asked for website and comment system recommendations</li><li>I wrote threads based on my daily writing prompts</li><li>I complained about products not working</li></ul><p>If you saw my timeline around that time, could you tell what I was really into?</p><p>Nope. My content was all over the place.</p><p>I was one of the two Twitter extremes:</p><ul><li><strong>Talking about everything </strong>without focusing on anything in particular. You can be all over the place personally and professionally.</li><li><strong>Focusing exclusively on one topic</strong>, such as promoting your business, sharing productivity advice, writing marketing threads, and nothing else.</li></ul><p>There are two problems with these approaches:</p><p><strong>When your tweets are all over the place, you don&#39;t give people a good enough reason to follow you. </strong>(Your personality and random thoughts and observations are usually not a good enough reason to follow you.)</p><p>If you&#39;re my friend, I may find it interesting because it&#39;s part of you. But if you&#39;re a random Twitter user, I don&#39;t really care about your life stuff. You might be a great person, but I won&#39;t know this until I start interacting with you. And I won&#39;t start if you don&#39;t give me a reason to do it.</p><p>This is why I was losing followers last December, even while tweeting regularly. I was tweeting about random stuff, and people didn&#39;t care enough to engage with it.</p><p>What about going all in?</p><p>It&#39;s not perfect either.</p><p><strong>When you go all in on one topic, you risk losing your personality.</strong> You will attract followers, but they won&#39;t be <em>your</em> followers. They&#39;re after your content.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, you&#39;ll turn into one of those faceless accounts sharing stale productivity quotes or banal marketing tips. Or into one of those profiles that don&#39;t tweet anything except shortened links to their blog posts and product offers.</p><p>When I see these profiles, my first thoughts are &#34;But who are YOU, the person behind this account? Do you even exist? And why would I follow you?&#34;</p><p>Look, <a href="https://martinboss.com/sliced-mindful-procrastination/">I appreciate good productivity advice</a> or a useful marketing tip, but that&#39;s not the main reason I&#39;m on Twitter. I can get <em>content</em> in a million different places, so if <em>content</em> is the only thing you can offer then I&#39;m not interested.</p><p>You can grow your following by being ultra-focused on a single topic and tweeting a lot. It might be one of the fastest ways to get followers, in fact. But if you&#39;re looking for meaningful long-term <em>Twitter relationships</em>, that&#39;s not the way. <strong>When you&#39;re a <em>content</em> account, people don&#39;t care about you, the person.</strong></p><p>What&#39;s the alternative?</p><p><strong>A healthy mix of personal and <em>professional</em>.</strong></p><p>Make the bulk of your tweets about your core interests, then infuse your profile with your personality by sharing things that are personal to you. I primarily tweet about product management, building, and habits, but I also let my personality shine through e.g. by sharing my love for dogs and telling stories from my life:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lover of all dogs, master of none 🥲 <a href="https://t.co/Ah7C4bS1XL">pic.twitter.com/Ah7C4bS1XL</a></p>— Martin Boss (@imMartinBoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/imMartinBoss/status/1520310265505632256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2022</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>D&#39;ya like dags?</figcaption></figure><p>What should the professional to personal ratio be?</p><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one right answer. I like to keep my ratio at around 80/20, but I&#39;d say if you&#39;re above 50/50 it&#39;s a good start. <strong>If at least half of your tweets are related to a particular topic you&#39;re into, you&#39;re doing alright.</strong></p><p>And remember, you can always weave <em>professional</em> into personal. Are you a new parent? It might be a good opportunity to share your tips for staying focused. Remodeling your home? Perhaps there&#39;s a project management lesson in there.</p><p>Just don&#39;t overdo it. Not everything has to be a lesson. Let yourself be yourself!</p><p>Be a person, not a Twitter handle. Humans are drawn to humans, not content.</p><h2 id="strategy-doesnt-have-to-be-complicated">Strategy doesn&#39;t have to be complicated</h2><p>&#34;Martin, that&#39;s a lot of stuff! How do I keep track of it?&#34;</p><p>Let&#39;s pull it all together and create a strategy that will guide your Twitter efforts!</p><p>Now, I know strategy may sound daunting. (And that coming from <a href="https://martinboss.com/my-product-management-backstory/">a product manager</a>.) If you&#39;re like me, you prefer doing rather than planning. Action!</p><p>But no worries. You can keep your Twitter strategy simple and minimalist.</p><p>At its core, your strategy answers the questions I&#39;ve covered above:</p><ul><li>Why are you on Twitter? What do you expect to get out of it?</li><li>Why should people follow you? Who are you and what can you offer?</li><li>What will your process be? Who will you interact with, and how often?</li><li>How will you keep yourself on track? Keep moving in the right direction?</li></ul><p>When I worked on my own Twitter strategy back in February, I wanted to keep it as simple as I could.</p><p>Here&#39;s what I came up with:</p><figure><img src="https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="970" height="1165" srcset="https://martinboss.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/image-7.png 600w, https://martinboss.com/content/images/2022/05/image-7.png 970w"/><figcaption>My Twitter Strategy v1.0</figcaption></figure><p>See? Pretty simple! And half of this is brainstorming that I trimmed down later.</p><p>It&#39;s not a perfect strategy, and a new version is long overdue. But it did help guide me through the early stages of my Twitter journey, and that&#39;s the important part.</p><p>What&#39;s your Twitter strategy?</p><h2 id="so-whats-the-process">So what&#39;s the process?</h2><p>Alright, let&#39;s do it!</p><p>But how exactly?</p><p>I see the Twitter process as three types of activities:</p><ul><li>Publishing</li><li>Socializing</li><li>Analyzing</li></ul><p><strong>Publishing is the easy part.</strong></p><p>To me, Twitter is primarily a social platform, not a publishing platform.</p><p>When you&#39;re a smaller account, creating high-quality content that will get seen by exactly zero people is a waste of time. This makes Twitter different from <em>writing online</em>. Blog posts or articles have a long shelf life and get discovered over time, while tweets disappear pretty much immediately never to be seen again.</p><p>So, I don&#39;t focus on publishing too much. In my early days, I wrote one tweet a day as part Tweet100, and that was it. Nowadays, I publish 2-3 times a day to cover most of my core interests. And I schedule my tweets in bulk (more on that later).</p><p><strong>Then there&#39;s socializing.</strong></p><p>That&#39;s what Twitter is all about! Putting yourself out there, discovering other like-minded people, taking part in conversations, and being friendly and helpful.</p><p>Yet so many people don&#39;t see Twitter this way!</p><p>So how do you socialize exactly?</p><p>That&#39;s what your <em>community</em> is for. Start following people, topics, and hashtags, and the Twitter algo will pick that up and show you the relevant conversations.</p><p>Now, just go and hang out in replies and profiles. Answer questions, make jokes, follow the people you&#39;re curious about. Replies are socializing gold mines! </p><p>It&#39;s a great way to get noticed and make friends. <strong>I call this &#34;socializing broad&#34;.</strong></p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh Martin - how am I not following you after seeing your name so many times?</p>— Kevon Cheung 🥦 (@MeetKevon) <a href="https://twitter.com/MeetKevon/status/1510010483490754562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2022</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>How I met Kevon!</figcaption></figure><p>Another part of socializing broad is retweeting, which means you consider the content worthy enough of being shared with your audience.</p><p>I actually prefer quote tweets to retweets. They feel less lazy and allow me to complement the original content with my own thoughts, adding value:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quote tweets are the ultimate act of generosity and selflessness:</p>— Martin Boss (@imMartinBoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/imMartinBoss/status/1491888640439603201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2022</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>When I socialize broad, I not only put myself out there and become more visible, but also generate ideas that I can later turn into new tweets and articles.</p><p>Again, the point is to be genuine, be helpful, be entertaining. It&#39;s not about spamming and canned replies. Quantity matters, but so does quality.</p><p>In contrast to socializing broad, <strong>&#34;socializing deep&#34;</strong> is strengthening your existing connections. This simply means interacting with your existing followers: thanking them, talking to people in DMs and replies, and generally doing whatever good friends do.</p><p>If you think it&#39;s a waste of time because you don&#39;t actively gain followers this way, think again. It&#39;s a crucial part of building authentic connections.</p><p>Socializing is more than just chasing numbers.</p><p><strong>Finally, there&#39;s analyzing.</strong></p><p>If you want to keep moving in the right direction, you need to be strategic about your Twitter use. This means understanding what works and what doesn&#39;t, and doubling down on what works.</p><p>How analytical you get is up to you. It&#39;s a spectrum from just trusting your gut and being yourself to analyzing the performance of every tweet and reply over time. I&#39;m closer to trusting my gut, but I&#39;d like to be more analytical than that.</p><p>What does your ideal Twitter process look like?</p><p>There are lots of great Twitter tools out there. Surely it makes sense to use them?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Like any tools, Twitter tools are a double-edged sword. They can make Twitter easier, or they can be a waste of time and money if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. We humans like to surround ourselves with tools while completely disregarding the basic principles of whatever we&#39;re doing.</p><p>I&#39;m a big believer in doing things manually at first to figure out the basics, then gradually introducing tools to automate the things I know should be automated. During the first month of my Tweet100 challenge I published all of my tweets manually to establish the habit, and only started looking into the tools later.</p><p>Now, let&#39;s briefly review the tools you can use to simplify your Twitter experience.</p><p>I like to broadly group them into three main categories:</p><ul><li>Publishing tools make publishing easier, e.g. by offering scheduling features or better thread creation interfaces.</li><li>Analytics tools provide you with additional insights that you don&#39;t always get from native Twitter analytics.</li><li>And some tools just don&#39;t fit any of these two groups.</li></ul><p>As of today, I use three tools: <a href="https://hypefury.com/">Hypefury</a>, <a href="https://blackmagic.so/">Black Magic</a>, and <a href="https://bengrosser.com/projects/twitter-demetricator/">Twitter Demetricator</a>.</p><p><strong>Hypefury</strong> helps me automate parts of my Twitter publishing process:</p><ul><li>I (usually) schedule a week&#39;s worth of tweets on Sunday, which makes up the core of my content.</li><li>I also use Hypefury&#39;s Evergreen feature to retweet some of my older tweets automatically.</li><li>Occasionally, I schedule Quote Tweets throughout the week.</li></ul><p>I don&#39;t always have time to be on Twitter during the week, so scheduling tweets and retweets with Hypefury ensures I don&#39;t disappear completely.</p><p>Some of the popular Hypefury alternatives are <strong>Buffer </strong>and <strong>Typefully</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, I use <strong>Black Magic</strong> for extra analytics and to occasionally schedule replies. It&#39;s a powerful tool with many more features, so I highly recommend you check it out. And definitely follow <a href="https://twitter.com/tdinh_me">Tony</a>, the founder of Black Magic.</p><p>One popular alternative to Black Magic is <strong>ilo.so</strong>.</p><p>Finally, there&#39;s Twitter Demetricator by Ben Grosser. It&#39;s a browser plugin that hides all metrics, such as the number of likes, replies, retweets, and followers.</p><p>And I just love it:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Turns out <a href="https://twitter.com/bengrosser?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bengrosser</a> built exactly the thing I was looking for: Twitter Demetricator.</p>— Martin Boss (@imMartinBoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/imMartinBoss/status/1518696743940018176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2022</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>We had a nice chat with Ben in the comments</figcaption></figure><p>Without the numbers, I&#39;m a lot more mindful about my Twitter use. It also allows me to focus on the content, not the vanity metrics, when browsing Twitter.</p><p>Give Demetricator a try!  </p><p>If I had to go with a single tool, I&#39;d go with a scheduler. Writing and scheduling tweets in bulk is a lifesaver when you have other stuff going on in your life.</p><p>Still, if you&#39;re just starting out, I suggest not using any tools at all. Except for, perhaps, the Demetricator, to silence the part of your brain that&#39;s constantly obsessed with your engagement metrics. Don&#39;t worry about engagement at first!</p><p>Any tools that I missed?</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2><p>No matter what happens to Twitter after Elon Musk&#39;s acquisition, I want to believe it will remain a great social tool. Dare I say my favorite one?</p><p>And now that you know how it works, I&#39;m sure you will get value out of it!</p><p>To wrap this up, here are a few additional Twitter tips that I&#39;ve learned over the past few months that have gotten me to where I am today:</p><ul><li><strong>Be yourself. </strong>Authenticity trumps cool every time (just found this cheesy quote on Google). You can fake it elsewhere, but it&#39;s hard to do on Twitter.</li><li><strong>Be socializing!</strong> I&#39;ve gained most of my friends and followers from interacting with people, not from publishing. Crucial if you&#39;re a small account.</li><li><strong>Make friends, not numbers. </strong>It&#39;s tempting to chase followers, but I suggest you focus on building meaningful connections. The numbers will follow.</li><li><strong>Stay consistent.</strong> From my experience, disappearing for a few days stops growth. You need to be out there to be growing. At the very least ensure you have a few daily tweets scheduled for when you&#39;re unavailable. Although I still try to spend at least a few minutes per day replying to the people I care about.</li><li><strong>Keep going.</strong> I guarantee you will encounter plateaus. You may also feel like it&#39;s all a waste of time and that Twitter is full of shallow bits and clout chasing. I still get this feeling once in a while. It&#39;s not true. Keep going, it doesn&#39;t last long.</li></ul><p>And that&#39;s everything I know about Twitter so far.</p><p>I hope this was helpful!</p><p>In any case, <a href="https://twitter.com/imMartinBoss">find me on Twitter</a> and let me know. Happy twittering!</p>
