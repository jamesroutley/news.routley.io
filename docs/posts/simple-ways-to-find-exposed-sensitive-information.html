        <p>Informational advantage is a form of power. On the flipside, exposure of sensitive
information about a person or organisation can be a privacy/security problem.
Sensitive Data Exposure is a type of vulnerability where software system (or
user) makes sensitive data (API keys, user information, private documents, etc.)
available to potential adversaries. For example, web app that lets users edit
potentially confidential documents may be storing them in S3 buckets without
any proper access controls. This results in information that should not be
public being potentially available to those who know how to look for it. In this
post we will go through some basic techniques of Sensitive Data Discovery -
the activity of hunting for accidental leaks of things that are best kept hidden.</p>
<p>One way to look for potentially sensitive information is to do search engine
dorking - launching queries specifically crafted to narrow down on specific,
potentially sensitive things.</p>
<p>For example, the following query (Google dork) would look for PDF documents
containing the word “confidential” and hosted under specific domain:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>filetype:pdf site:hackerone.com &#34;confidential&#34;
</code></pre><p>We have used <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types#search-by-file-type"><code>filetype:</code></a>
operator to limit result to specific file extension and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/search-operators/all-search-site"><code>site:</code></a>
operator to limit them to specific domain.</p>
<p>Of course, not every document containing word “confidential” is actually
confidential, but a query like this could be a starting point to check if
nothing sensitive is being leaked.</p>
<p>Another, more realistic example is the following Google query:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;contractors&#34; filetype:xls &#34;@gmail.com&#34; site:gov
</code></pre><p>Automating Google dorking can be done via many of SERP scraper APIs available,
but at the end of the day you will need to review the results manually.</p>
<p>On the very first page of search results I was able to find actual lists of
government agency (e.g. Illinois Dept. of Transportation) contractors with email
addresses. Since pretending to be a contractor is very viable social engineering
vector that can lead to unauthorised access (physical and/or digital) to the
sensitive infrastucture this sort of information exposure can have pretty serious
security implications. Furthermore, service-based businesses should take care
not to expose their lead list spreadsheet on the public web as they can
potentially be found by some growth hacker working for the competition.</p>
<p>Real examples of sensitive, private information ending up findable via Google
dorking:</p>
<ul>
<li>H1 report <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/644358">644358</a> - PDF files with
SSNs and family data related US military personnel.</li>
<li>H1 report <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/672629">672629</a> - searching for
<code>site:*.mil ext:ppt intext:password</code> would lead to US DoD training materials
with usernames/password being available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to look for more technical sensitive data exposures is to search on
Github.</p>
<p>For example, the following query (Github dork) looks for instances of Git
credentials file being accidentally commited to public repos:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>path:**/.git-credentials
</code></pre><p>We can also look for API keys to paid or private services. Github search query
can be derived from sample code related to the API. Let me give you a real
example. Google maps iOS SDK sample code repo contains the follow code
in <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps-samples/maps-sdk-for-ios-samples/blob/main/MapsAndPlacesDemo/MapsAndPlacesDemo/ApiKeys.swift">MapsAndPlacesDemo/MapsAndPlacesDemo/ApiKeys.swift</a>
file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>/// API keys needed for this project</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>public</span> <span>enum</span> <span>ApiKeys</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    #error(<span>&#34;Register for API keys and enter them below; then, delete this line&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span><span>    <span>static</span> <span>let</span> mapsAPI = <span>&#34;&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>static</span> <span>let</span> placesAPI = <span>&#34;&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now there is a chance that some people trying out the GMaps iOS SDK filled in
the API keys and commited the code to public repository. Indeed, the following
Github dork gives us what seem to be some real API keys to Places API:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;static let placesAPI&#34;
</code></pre><p>However, it must be noted that Github has <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning">secret scanning automation</a>
running to warn users about accidentally publishing API keys for a growing list
of partner services (and revoke leaked ones), which makes this trick less
viable as time goes on.</p>
<p>But what if we want to find API keys and other sensitive pieces of information
on websites running in production? In this case <a href="https://publicwww.com/">PublicWWW</a> -
a code-level search engine - can be helpful. To look for some API keys hardcoded
into client-side JS snippets we can run queries like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;api_key&#34; depth:all
&#34;apiKey&#34; depth:all
</code></pre><p>Again, not everything you will find like this is going to be sensitive data.
Some API keys are not meant to be kept secret.</p>
<p>Some real examples of API key exposures being a security problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>H1 report <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/1065041">1065041</a> - Google geocoding
API leak.</li>
<li>H1 report <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/1066410">1066410</a> - leaking API keys
in client-side JS code lead to further security problems.</li>
<li>H1 report <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/1218754">1218754</a> - leaked
API key lead to exposure of internal system statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like with Google, we can use <code>site:</code> operator to limit the results to given
domain. However, PublicWWW results are limited to users without paid account
and one must pay up to get the full results. Users with paid plan can also
search for stuff via API.</p>
<p>Some sites heavily reliant on client side JavaScript may use preloaded state - a
JSON document or JavaScript object with some initial data to be shown on the
first load of webpage. It may include data beyond what is visibly seen on the
screen. I have personally found and scraped email addresses from preloaded
state that were not seen on the rendered form of HTML, but could be found
by digging through the page source a little. In some cases, web pages have more
information in them than what is seen at the very surface.</p>
<p>AWS S3 and compatible services (e.g. Digital Ocean Spaces, MinIO, and many
others) are commonly used to store files in the cloud. For example, many web
applications use it to store user-uploaded data that they are supposed to
keep private - one user should not access other users files. However, sometimes
due to misconfiguration S3 buckets happen to be wide open to anyone who finds
them, which may lead to sensitive data discovery.</p>
<p>Some tools to look for misconfigured S3 buckets are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner">S3Scanner</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/">Grayhat Warfare</a> - search with API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openbuckets.io/">OpenBuckets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Last, but not least way the sensitive data discovery happens I want to mention
is people simply not keeping their mouths shut. See the following conference
talks about this:</p>

</ul>
<p>Remember: once you tell something to the world you no longer control that
information. “Loose lips sink ships” says the ancient wisdom.</p>
