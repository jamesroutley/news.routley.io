      <h2>Left drawers</h2>
      <p>
        The drawers on the left are carefully organized to help you <strong>open the app, file, or web page</strong> you’re looking for ASAP! Some apps will have shortcuts that will save you a click or tap.

      <h2>Non-disruptive notifications</h2>
      <p>
        Kera Desktop’s notifications are designed to <strong>avoid appearing on top of whatever you’re doing</strong> as much as possible, yet give enough information to know what they are about without interaction.

      <h2>Feasible Menus</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s forget about those text-oriented menus that are hard to find what you’re looking for even after using them hundreds of times.

      <h2>Window management</h2>
      <p>
        You can split windows in various ways, including a 3-column mode which is especially useful for ultra-wide monitors.

      <h2>Window placement</h2>
      <p>
        When opening a new window, Kera Desktop will identify the <strong>empty spaces</strong> on the screen and try to put the window there.

      <h2>Search</h2>
      <p>
        Are you on the desktop? You can start typing right away. Typed “spoft” instead of “Spotify”? Go ahead, and hit Enter anyway.

      <h2>Rooms</h2>
      <p>
        It is easy to get distracted when you do many different things on the same device. Think of rooms as profiles but for the same person. You can have different rooms <strong>based on what you do</strong> and arrange them with things for only that purpose. Maybe change the wallpaper to something related to set the mood.

      <p>
