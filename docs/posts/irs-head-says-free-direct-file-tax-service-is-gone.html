During a summit earlier this week, IRS Commissioner Billy Long said the free tax filing service is “gone,” adding that “big beautiful Billy wiped that out,” as <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-tax-report/irs-chief-says-direct-file-is-gone-other-audit-tech-is-coming">reported earlier by <em>Bloomberg Law</em></a>.</p><p>President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill includes <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/07/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-directs-treasury-find-replacement-direct-file/406525/">a provision</a> to establish a task force dedicated to “the replacement of Direct File.” The IRS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23727414/irs-free-direct-tax-filing-test">first announced</a> Direct File in 2023, which lets taxpayers submit their tax returns directly to the government for free. It began testing the program <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922150/irs-direct-file-pilot-available-13-states-income-tax-2024">in select states during</a> last year’s tax season, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168131/the-irss-free-tax-filing-service-is-here-to-stay">planned on expanding it this year</a>.</p><p>The future of Direct File has remained uncertain for months, with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/direct-file-irs-taxes-electronic-28c8100ac1c1980676ca175f04d42876">several reports</a> suggesting the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) federal cuts <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-direct-file-chopping-block/">may eliminate it</a>. Now, it seems that may be the case. “I don’t care about Direct File. I care about direct audit,” Long said, according to <em>Bloomberg Law</em>.</p><p><a href="https://hoyer.house.gov/media/press-releases/ranking-member-hoyer-statement-cancellation-irs-direct-file-program">Many</a> <a href="https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/1950568586960908717">lawmakers</a> are <a href="https://x.com/RepPressley/status/1950988273754542232">frustrated</a> by the program’s potential elimination. “Direct File was an easy way for Americans to file their taxes for FREE each year,” Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote in <a href="https://x.com/SenWarren/status/1950243905456251123">a post on X</a>. “Why in the world did the Trump administration kill it? To give a huge handout to giant tax prep companies like TurboTax that rip Americans off.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/irs-chief-says-agency-plans-to-end-free-direct-file-program.html">a statement to CNBC</a>, an IRS spokesperson said, “We look forward to Treasury’s forthcoming report to Congress on the Direct File program and on potential public-private partnership alternatives to Direct File, as required by the One Big Beautiful Bill.” The IRS didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
