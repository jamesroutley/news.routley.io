<p>How do FAIR data resources work? How can you build a FAIR resource from many little parts, each
non-FAIR by itself?</p>
<p>Minsky’s <em>The Society of Mind</em> tries to explain how minds can work, how intelligence can emerge from
non-intelligence, how you can build a mind from many little mindless parts.</p>
<p>In the “society of mind” scheme, a mind is made of many smaller <em>agents</em>. Each agent plays a simple
role that needs no mind at all. When we join enough of them, we get “mind”.</p>
<p>In a FAIR “mind” (e.g. a research knowledge management system), each connected resource -
plans/protocols, recorded observations, information products (tables/figures/plots), assigned
metadata/tags, validation/review artifacts, integration/analysis code, publication/distribution
assets, data schemas / controlled vocabularies, archives – may also play a simple role that needs
no “FAIRification” at all. When we join enough of them in principled ways, we get “FAIR”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s much the same for shattered pots as for the cogs of great machines. Until you’ve seen some of
the rest, you can’t make sense of any part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each part may have lots of cross-connections. It’s not clear that the parts may be arranged so that
we can climb “straight to the top” together, by mental stair-steps, one by one. The parts are
tangled in a Web. Let’s begin.</p>
