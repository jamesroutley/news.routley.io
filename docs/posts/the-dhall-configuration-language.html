      <p>Struggling with configuration drift?  Create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">single source of truth</a> you can reference everywhere.</p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
      <p>&#34;Configuration drift occurs when a standardized group of IT resources, be they virtual servers, standard router configurations in VNF deployments, or any other deployment group that is built from a standard template, diverge in configuration over time. … The Infrastructure as Code methodology from DevOps is designed to combat Configuration Drift and other infrastructure management problems.&#34;</p>
      
      <hr/>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Create a single authoritative configuration file:</p>
      <p>… that you can read directly into several languages or convert to other file formats (including YAML or JSON).</p>

      <p>Need to clean up a big mess?  Move fast without breaking things by leaning on Dhall&#39;s tooling.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Refactoring something mission-critical?  Use Dhall&#39;s support for
      semantic hashes to guarantee that many types of refactors are
      behavior-preserving</p>

      <p>What if you intend to make a change?  Use a semantic diff to verify that
      you changed what you expected to:</p>

      <p>Did you inherit a messy configuration?  Use the type system and
      integrated editor support to navigate more effectively.</p>

      <p>Sick of Turing-complete configuration languages?  Dhall is
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_functional_programming">
      total programming language</a> that forbids arbitrary side effects.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>We take language security seriously so that your Dhall programs
      never fail, hang, crash, leak secrets, or compromise your system.</p>
      <p>The language aims to support safely importing and evaluating untrusted
      Dhall code, even code authored by malicious users.  We treat the inability
      to do so as a specification bug.</p>

      <p>Hold your configuration files to the same standard of
      quality as the rest of your code.
      </p><hr/>
      <blockquote>
      <p>&#34;Configuration bugs, not code bugs, are the most common cause I&#39;ve seen of really bad outages. … As with error handling, I&#39;m often told that it&#39;s obvious that config changes are scary, but it&#39;s not so obvious that most companies test and stage config changes like they do code changes.&#34;</p>
