The demand is here and now&#34;.</p><p>Rhodri Williams, technical director of the Home Builders Federation, told BBC News it was &#34;essential&#34; the government made sure there was &#34;adequate investment&#34; into the supply network to support housing developments.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Among a list of recommendations, the committee suggested introducing a separate planning category for data centres, to ensure better energy coordination.</p><p>A government spokesperson told BBC News it was exploring &#34;bespoke options&#34;, including through the AI Energy Council, to support data centres and the housing sector.</p><p>The report also called on Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan to include a dedicated data centre policy in the next London Plan.</p><p>A spokesperson for the mayor told BBC News they are working to include &#34;how to best address the need for data centres in London&#34; in the next London Plan, and would &#34;carefully consider&#34; the recommendations of the report.</p><p>&#34;Under Sadiq, we have seen more new council home starts in London than at any time since the 1970s and, prior to the pandemic, more new homes completed in London than any time since the 1930s,&#34; they added.</p><p><i id="additional-reporting-by-jess-warren.">Additional reporting by Jess Warren.</i></p></div></div>
