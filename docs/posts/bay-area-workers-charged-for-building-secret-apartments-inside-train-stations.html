    <h1>Bay Area Workers Charged for Building Secret Apartments Inside Train Stations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two Bay Area railway workers gave new meaning to “transit oriented development” – when they allegedly built two illegal apartments inside train stations for a combined $50,000.</p><p>San Mateo prosecutors allege that two former Caltrain officials built two secret office-to-apartment conversions in two Peninsula stations south of San Francisco, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/03/30/crime-or-peak-urbanism-yimbys-cant-help-but-applaud-the-caltrain-officials-who-built-secret-apartments-inside-stations/">the San Jose Mercury News reported.</a></p><p>Former Caltrain Deputy Director Joseph Navarro and contractor Seth Andrew Worden <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/03/28/ex-caltrain-employee-contractor-charged-with-building-secret-homes-at-train-stations/">face felony charges</a> for misusing public funds to build the mini apartments in the historic Burlingame and Millbrae stations. Neither facility is being used by the public.</p><p>Worden, a 61-year-old resident of Oceanside in San Diego County, was arraigned March 27 and released on his own recognizance, court records show. He pleaded not guilty, according to media reports.</p><p>Navarro, 66, formerly of the Bay Area and now of Newtown, Pennsylvania, is scheduled to be arraigned April 29.</p><p>Transit workers found Worden’s Millbrae apartment in 2020, but didn’t discover Navarro’s secret hideaway inside the Burlingame station until an anonymous tip in 2022. Both were fired.</p><p>Their alleged crimes have received some admiration in a region where developers can easily spend <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/10/26/death-spiral-its-getting-obscenely-expensive-to-build-housing-in-san-jose/">north of $900,000</a> to build one unit of affordable housing.</p><p>Some on social media said that living in a historic train station like Burlingame, which was built in 1894 and designated a historic landmark in California, had its own appeal.</p><p>“If this isn’t a case for building more housing next to transit then I don’t know what is,” wrote<a href="https://twitter.com/VladSF/status/1773891660830916648"> one user on social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.</a></p><p>Many were impressed that Worden and Navarro, who spent a respective $8,000 on the Millbrae unit and $42,000 on the Burlingame unit, managed to convert offices into housing on the cheap.</p><p>“Hire that man to build housing,” wrote Mark Dinan, an East Palo Alto-based recruiter. “$42k for an apartment!”</p><p>For a mere $42,000, Navarro allegedly installed a kitchenette, shower, plumbing and security cameras, prosecutors said. </p><p>The duo are accused of trying to fly below the radar by making sure none of the invoices exceeded $3,000, which would have triggered further authorization from Caltrain and TransAmerica Services, the firm that employed Worden.</p><p>New housing is<a href="https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/research-and-policy/cost-to-build-housing-legislation-2022/"> notoriously expensive</a> to build in California — beyond high construction costs, impact fees and the permitting process can cost thousands of dollars, fees that Worden and Navarro would not have paid, according to the Mercury News.</p><p>The crime also highlighted the<a href="https://bayareaequityatlas.org/indicators/extreme-commuting"> plight of super-commuters</a> in the Bay Area.</p><p>District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/03/29/caltrain-train-station-little-homes-felony-charges/"> told the San Francisco Standard</a> that the apartments were a “convenience” for the two former railway workers. “They figured the Bay Area [commute] really is lousy,” he said.</p><p><em>— Dana Bartholomew</em></p><section>
