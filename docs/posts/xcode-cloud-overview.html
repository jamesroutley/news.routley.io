							<p><span>Xcode Cloud</span> is a continuous integration and delivery service built into Xcode and designed expressly for Apple developers. It accelerates the development and delivery of high-quality apps by bringing together cloud-based tools that help you build apps, run automated tests in parallel, deliver apps to testers, and view and manage user feedback.</p>

							<h2>Automated workflows</h2>
							<p>Configure workflows to suit your development process or use the built-in workflow to get started and customize it as your process evolves. You can build every committed code change and your team will be instantly alerted if a change introduces any issues — potentially saving days of wasted time before bugs are found by your users.</p>

						<div>
							<h2>Parallel testing</h2>
							<p>Configure <span>Xcode Cloud</span> to test one or two device types for a quick check on your project’s health, or test a wide range of device configurations less frequently for edge cases. <span>Xcode Cloud</span> allocates resources in parallel to quickly complete the testing job while you and your Mac keep coding.</p>

						<div>
							<h2>Built into Xcode</h2>
							<p>Results for your builds and tests — and even feedback on crashes from users — are presented right inside Xcode. As builds happen in the cloud, Xcode shows live status indicators and lets you filter by the build tasks you want to monitor.</p>
							<p><img src="https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/images/screen-cloud_2x.jpg" width="100%" alt=""/></p><h2>Built into <span>App Store Connect</span></h2>
							<p>The <span>App Store Connect</span> web dashboard shows critical information about your builds and testing results. You can also edit your workflows and launch builds directly from the web.</p>

							<p><span>Xcode Cloud</span> and TestFlight work together to install new builds for your team so that everyone can immediately start testing, or to send specific branches of your app with unique in-development features to select external testers as you experiment with new ideas.</p>
						</div>

							<p><img src="https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/images/secure-and-private.svg" height="64" alt=""/></p><h2>Secured and private</h2>
							<p><span>Xcode Cloud</span> is designed to protect your projects and privacy, with all data encrypted at rest and access protected by two-factor authentication. Source code is only accessed for builds and the ephemeral build environments are destroyed when your build completes.</p>
