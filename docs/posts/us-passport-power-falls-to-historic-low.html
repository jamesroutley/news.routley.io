    <h1>US Passport Power Falls to Historic Low</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>For the first time since the <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index">Henley Passport Index</a> was created 20 years ago, the United States is no longer ranked amongst the world’s Top 10 most powerful passports. Once unrivalled at No.1 in 2014, the American passport has now slumped to 12<sup>th</sup> place, tied with Malaysia, with visa-free access to only 180 of 227 destinations worldwide. The Asian trifecta of Singapore (access to 193 destinations visa-free), South Korea (190 destinations), and Japan (189 destinations) now occupy the top three spots on the index powered by exclusive data from the <a href="https://www.iata.org/" target="_blank">International Air Transport Association</a> (IATA) and ranking all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.</p><p>The decline of the US passport and its most recent drop from 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> position on the index has been driven by a series of access changes. The loss of visa-free access to Brazil in April due to a lack of reciprocity, and the US being left out of China’s rapidly expanding visa-free list, marked the start of its downward slide. This was followed by adjustments from Papua New Guinea and Myanmar, which further eroded the US score while boosting other passports. Most recently, Somalia’s launch of a new eVisa system and Vietnam’s decision to exclude the US from its latest visa-free additions delivered the final blow, pushing it out of the Top 10.</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/about/key-people/christian-h-kalin">Dr. Christian H. Kaelin</a>, Chairman of Henley &amp; Partners and creator of the Henley Passport Index, says these seemingly small changes have had outsized consequences — underscoring just how finely balanced the global mobility landscape has become. “The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings — it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics. Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.”</p><p>Similarly, the UK passport has fallen to its lowest-ever position on the index, slipping two places since July, from 6<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> place, despite also once holding the top spot (in 2015).</p><p><strong>Visa Reciprocity Matters More</strong></p><p>While American passport holders can currently access 180 destinations visa-free, the US itself allows only 46 other nationalities to enter without a visa. This puts it way down in 77<sup>th</sup> place on the <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/henley-openness-index">Henley Openness Index</a>, which ranks all 199 countries and territories worldwide according to the number of nationalities they permit entry to without a prior visa.</p><p>This disparity between visa free access and openness is one of the widest globally — second only to Australia, and just ahead of Canada, New Zealand, and Japan. Interestingly, all five nations with the biggest gaps between the travel freedom they enjoy and the openness they offer have either stagnated or declined in their passport power ranking over the past decade.</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/henley-private-wealth-migration-report-2025/americas-hard-line-immigration">Annie Pforzheimer</a>, Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, notes that America’s retreat is rooted in politics. “Even before a second Trump presidency, US policy had turned inward. That isolationist mindset is now being reflected in America’s loss of passport power.”</p><p>This more insular stance has hit developing nations particularly hard. President Trump has suspended visa issuance to travelers from 12 nations across Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, imposed heavy restrictions on an additional seven, and threatened bans on up to 36 more, the majority of them in Africa. A visa bond of USD 5,000 to 15,000 now applies to seven African nations, refundable only upon departure. Plans are also underway to introduce a blanket USD 250 ‘visa integrity fee’ for most non-immigrant visa applications, while the cost of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) nearly doubled on 30 September 2025, from USD 21 to USD 40.</p><p><strong>China’s Ascent: A Decade of Gains</strong></p><p>In sharp contrast, China has been among the biggest climbers on the Henley Passport Index over the past decade, leaping from 94<sup>th</sup> place in 2015 to 64<sup>th</sup> in 2025, with its visa-free access score increasing by 37 destinations during that time.</p><p>On the Henley Openness Index, China has also risen dramatically, granting visa-free access to an additional 30 countries in the past year alone. It now sits in 65<sup>th</sup> position, providing entry to 76 nations — 30 more than the US.</p><p>Recent developments, including granting visa free access to Russia, underscore Beijing’s ongoing strategy of increased openness. China’s moves — alongside new agreements with the Gulf states, South America, and several European countries — are cementing its role as a global mobility powerhouse, bolstering the Asia-Pacific region’s dominance in travel freedom.</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/usa-wealth-report-2025/navigating-uschina-trade-tightrope">Dr. Tim Klatte</a>, Partner at Grant Thornton China, highlights the geopolitical implications. “Trump’s return to power has bought fresh trade conflicts that weaken America’s mobility, while China’s strategic openness boosts its global influence. These diverging paths will reshape economic and travel dynamics worldwide.”</p><p><strong>Americans Lead Global Rush for Second Citizenships</strong></p><p>The decline in US passport power is fueling an unprecedented surge in demand for alternative <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/residence-investment">residence</a> and <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-investment">citizenship</a> options. Henley &amp; Partners data shows that Americans have become by far the largest group of applicants for <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/countries">investment migration programs</a> in 2025.</p><p>By the end of Q3, applications from US nationals were already 67% higher than the total for 2024, which itself recorded a 60% year-on-year increase. Group Head of Private Clients at Henley &amp; Partners, Dominic Volek, says the firm now has more American clients than the next four nationalities — Turkish, Indian, Chinese, and British — combined. “Faced with unprecedented volatility, investors and wealthy American families are adopting a strategy of geopolitical arbitrage to acquire additional residence and citizenship options. They are hedging against jurisdictional risk and leveraging differences across countries to optimize personal, financial, and lifestyle outcomes.”</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/usa-wealth-report-2025/dual-citizenship-new-american-dream">Prof. Peter J. Spiro</a> of Temple University Law School in Philadelphia says while US citizenship remains a valuable status, it’s no longer good enough as a standalone. “In coming years, more Americans will be acquiring additional citizenships in whatever way they can. Multiple citizenship is being normalized in American society. While it may be a bit of an exaggeration, as one social media poster recently put it, “dual citizenship is the new American dream”.</p><p>-<strong>Ends-</strong></p><p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p><p><strong>About the 2025 Henley Passport Index</strong></p><p>With cutting-edge expert commentary and historical data spanning over 20 years, the <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index">Henley Passport Index</a> is the original ranking of all the world’s passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa.
