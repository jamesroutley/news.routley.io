      <p>
	February 5th 2026
      </p>
      <p>
	We are pleased to announce the release of Ardour 9.0. This is
	a major release for the project, seeing several substantive
	new features that users have asked for over a long period of
	time. Region FX, clip recording, a touch-sensitive GUI,
	pianoroll windows, clip editing and more, not to mention
	dozens of bug fixes, new MIDI binding maps, improved GUI
	performance on macOS (for most) ...
      </p>
      <p>
	We expect to get feedback on some of the major new features in
	this release, and plan to take that into account as we improve
	and refine them and the rest of Ardour going forward. We have
	no doubt that there will be both delight and disappointment
	with certain things - rather than assume that we don&#39;t know
	what we&#39;re doing, please leave us feedback
	on <a href="https://discourse.ardour.org/">the forums</a> so
	that Ardour gets better over time. Those of you new to our
	clip launching implementation might care to read up
	on <a href="https://ardour.org/clip_differences.html"> the differences with
	Ableton Live</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
	In the coming weeks, we&#39;ll begin to sketch out what we have
	planned next for Ardour, in addition to responding to the
	feedback we get on this 9.0 release.
      </p>

      <h2 id="major-new-features">Major New Features</h2>

      <h3 id="pianoroll-windows">Pianoroll Windows</h3>
      <p>
	Double-click on a MIDI region to edit it in its own dedicated
	window, or in a pane at the bottom of the main window. Editing in
	that window will work almost identically to the way it does in the
	main timeline, but without the distractions of the rest of the user
	interface. You can also see MIDI automation (velocity, CC parameters
	etc.), optionally overlaid.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/pianoroll.png" alt="Pianoroll window in Ardour 9.0"/></p><h3 id="cue-editing">MIDI and Audio Cue Editing</h3>
      <p>
	The Cue page now allows direct editing of the contents of MIDI cues
	(“clips” for Live &amp; Bitwig users). A pianoroll area opens that
	allows precisely the same MIDI editing operations as would be
	available on the editor timeline.
      </p>

      

      <h3 id="cue-recording">Cue Recording</h3>
      <p>
	You can now record directly into cue slots, making Ardour a “looper”
	in the same sense that Live, Bitwig and several other contemporary
	DAWs are. You can pre-specificy the recording duration (e.g. “Record
	4 bars”) or you can record until you think you’re done. Whatever you
	recorded will start playing at the next quantization point (e.g.
	bar/beat).
      </p>

      <!--       <p>

      </p> -->
      
      <h3 id="region-fx">Region FX</h3>
      <p>
	If you&#39;ve ever asked “how do I add some delay to just this part of
	my vocal?”, then region FX are what you&#39;ve been looking for. Similar
	to region gain it allows to apply any plugin a given audio region
	only. The effect and its automation remains with the region, even
	when it is moved around on the timeline. While the same result can
	be achieved with channels-strip plugins in the mixer (using bypass
	automation), applying effects directly to regions on the timeline is
	convenient for many workflows. The given effect is applied offline,
	when reading the region from disk and does not add any additional
	DSP load.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/region-fx.png" alt="Region FX in Ardour 9.0"/></p><h3 id="real-time-analyzer">Realtime Perceptual Analyzer</h3>
      <p>
	A dedicated perceptual analyzer window is now available within
	Ardour which allows one to visualize the live spectrum of multiple
	signals. A key feature is that one can overlay individual sources
	(tracks and busses) on top of each other. This allows one to see
	which track contributes a given of frequency range to the
	overall mix, find conflicting ranges or holes in the spectrum.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/rta.png" alt="Realtime perceptual analyzer in Ardour 9.0"/></p><h3 id="note-brushing">Note Brushing</h3>
      <p>
      	Want to set up a pattern of hihats every 1/16th notes? 1/8th
	note pizzicato strings every 1/4 note? Just hold down the
	shift key and drag the mouse while draw MIDI notes, and Ardour
	will fill according to your grid and note settings. Hold down
	Alt as well, and get only every other note drawn. Engage caps
	lock, and you can pick the notes that are drawn from a MIDI
	keyboard or pad device. A fast, easy way to draw melodies and
	rhythms.
      </p>

      	<source src="/images/9-0/note-brushing.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
      </video>

      <h3 id="keyboard-drive-automation-editing">Keyboard-Driven Automation Editing</h3>
      <p>
      	You can now use keyboard modifiers, arrow keys, and the Enter key
      	to add new automation control points and change their position and value.
      </p>

      <h3 id="mixer-strips-importing-exporting">Mixer Strips Importing and Exporting</h3>
      <p>
	You can now import mixer strips from arbitrary Ardour sessions as new track or map existing track to processing in mixer strips of external sessions. You can also export strips as local (session-level) or global presets for reuse.
      </p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/mixer-strip-import.png" width="100%" alt="Mixer strip mapping"/></p><h3 id="multi-touch-ui">Multi-Touch GUI</h3>
      <p>
	On Linux and Windows, Ardour now supports multi-touch interaction as
	provided by the operating system. This may come for macOS
	eventually, but the way multi-touch works there is significantly
	different and will need more work.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ui-changes">User Interface Changes</h2>

      <h3 id="ui-changes-app-bar">Updated Application Bar and Pane Control</h3>
      
      <p>The application bar was cleaned up and reorganized for each context. Editor specific options toggles, such as <strong>Follow Playhead</strong> and <strong>Follow Range</strong>, are now in the editor toolbar next to zoom controls. Other advanced and workflow specific options such as <strong>Rec Cues</strong> and <strong>Play Cues</strong> and the <strong>Plugin Delay Compensation</strong> (PDC) section are not shown by default anymore. Sections visibility can be configured in <a href="#new-preferences">Preferences</a> &gt; Appearance &gt; Application Bar.</p>

      <p>Additionally, one can now toggle the visibility of the left, the right, and the bottom panes directly from the toolbar. The control section is on the right, next to page switchers.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-application-bar.png" alt="Updated application bar"/></p><h3 id="ui-changes-editor-list">Revamped Editor List</h3>

      <p>The editor List panel has been redesigned to simplify switching between two commonly used tabs which you can select at the top of the panel.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-editor-list.png" alt="New Editor List pane"/></p><h3 id="ui-changes-new-session-dialog">Revamped New Session Dialog</h3>

      <p>We now used tabbed interface for the <strong>New Session / Recent Sessions</strong> dialog where you can quickly switch between creating a new session, opening a recent one, and opening an arbitrary session from the disk. The new dialog was originally developed for Harrison LiveTrax.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/recent-sessions.png" alt="Updated New Session dialog"/></p><h3 id="ui-changes-rulers">Updated Ruler Area</h3>

      <p>Rulers now have additional controls to add new markers and navigate to the previous or next marker from the current playhead position. Several rulers have been collapsed into one: all range-based markers are in one ruler, and all location-based markers are in another.</p>

      <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/9-0/new-rulers.png" alt="Updated ruler area"/></p><h3 id="ui-changes-library-manager">Improved Library Manager</h3>

      <p>The dialog for managing clip libraries has received cleanup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only show progress bar when downloading/installing.</li>
        <li>Don&#39;t allow re-install.</li>
        <li>Scale progress bar width with UI.</li>
        <li>Make sure target clip library folder exists.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="ui-changes-midnam-controls">MIDNAM Controls Relocated</h3>

      <p>MIDNAM related controls have been moved out of the track header of MIDI tracks and into the header context menu. Far too many users were confused about the functionality associated with these controls, so we&#39;ve moved them to a place where we can make this much clearer.</p>

<section>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="editing-changes">Editing Changes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Ardour now supports the concept of MIDI files and regions that are longer than their data would suggest (e.g. a 4-bar segment with the last note before the end of the 4th bar). This is mostly useful when playing clips in the cue editor for looping to work corectly.</li>
	<li>Step Editor improvements:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Chord mode: advance on final note-off.</li>
	    <li>Improve overlapping note handling:
	      <ul>
	        <li>No need to shift notes during normal edit.</li>
	        <li>Prevent duplicate (overlapping) chord notes.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li>Better management of visible note range in MIDI tracks and pianorolls.</li>

	<li>Add MIDI note strumming operator.</li>

	<li>When timestretching an audio region, stretch both its gain envelope and region-FX automation.</li>

	<li>In the internal edit mode, a rubber-band select with no motion (i.e. click) selects region.</li>

	<li>In pianoroll editors, allow shifting all existing MIDI later in a region/clip during a drag operation (this is not yet possible for editing on the main timeline (in the editor).</li>

	<li>Region trimming now obeys ripple mode settings.</li>

	<li>Drag threshold (how far you need to drag the pointer
	before we consider it really a &#34;drag&#34; operation) returns to using just pure pixel distances (rather than distances that are affected by the current zoom level).</li>

	<li>Copy-drags now require more motion before they start.</li>

	<li>Switch to draw tool when selecting region line to be shown in the region editor.</li>
	
	<li>Dragging notes past the end of a MIDI region extends it to cover them.</li>

	<li>The new &#34;Any&#34; algorithm for timestretching uses the StaffPad library.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<section>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Default file format is now WAV-compatible RF64.
	  <p>
	    If the file is too large for WAV, it will be converted to
	    RF64 automatically; otherwise it will be a normal WAV
	    file. Ardour has supported this format for years, but it
	    is now the default one to use when recording.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>I/O plugins and their ports can be renamed now.</li>
	<li>ACE fluidsynth: relax sample rate constraint, unload soundfonts after use, allow MMA style bank select an all channels, and pick drums on channel 10 when available.</li>
	<li>Round to bars when mouse scroll/dragging BBT bars.</li>
	<li>Monitor controls in application bars now appropriately sensitive.</li>
	<li>Show &#34;+&#34; icon on editor track-header area, suggesting use
	for adding new tracks etc.</li>
	<li>Use round-robin palette color for new groups.</li>
	<li>Add &#34;search all&#34; mode to the mixer&#39;s sidebar plugin list.</li>
	<li>Prevent issues when changing processors while recording #10017.</li>
	<li>Make scrollbar less prominent with default theme and themeable.</li>
	<li>Update themes, make transport option button state visible.</li>
	<li>Enforce a 1 octave minimum note range in MidiViews.</li>
	<li>Set executable stack flag when linking.
	  <p>
	    This is required on some modern hardened Linux systems to allow
	    Ardour to load plugins.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Ignore FLAC seek/peak-file read while recording.</li>
	<li>For the dark colored theme (the default) make pianoroll dividing lines less bright.</li>
	<li>Single pixel line, in themed &#34;black&#34; color, to divide B/C and E/F on piano roll header.</li>
	<li>Add find-and-display-stripable, bound to <key>Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-L</key> by default.</li>
	<li>MIDI mute fix
	  <p>
	    Previously, a sustained note that was audible as a track
	    was muted would not return when the track was unmuted. Now, the
	    note will return after the track is muted/unmuted during its
	    duration.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Exclusive solo may select track.</li>
	<li>Micro-optimization: speed up connection-matrix rendering.</li>
	<li>Clarify PDC (Plugin Delay Compensation) label units.</li>
	<li>Add color scheme for inactive selected tracks.</li>
	<li>Allow selection of inactive tracks.</li>
	<li>Replace git.ardour link with github
	  <p>
	    <a href="https://git.ardour.org">git.ardour.org</a> no
	    longer allows access to individual commits
	    or source files (thanks to LLM scrapers trying to get them
	    one by one, which is ridiculous).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Sources/Regions get their own tempo and meter.</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t show hidden tracks in the editor-mixer.</li>
	<li>Reduce likelihood of dropouts when reordering processors (plugins etc).</li>
	<li>Use configurable parameter for max gain everywhere (some
	parts of the program used a hardcoded 6dB value).</li>
	<li>More correctly handle real-time (MMCSS) threads on windows, and add a popup dialog when MMCSS threads are exhausted.</li>
	<li>Overhaul persistent tooltip position #9979.</li>
	<li>Reimplement MIDI file import to retain metadata in the
	  files written.
	  <p>
	    Previosuly, all meta data was thrown away. Now we retain it, so that MIDI
	    regions can ask about their source file&#39;s tempo &amp; meter.
	  </p>
	</li><li>Allow selection of VCAs in the mixer window.</li>
	<li>Produce valid HTML when printing bindings. </li>
	<li>Add click-free bypass/enable to the ACE Amp plugin.</li>
	<li>Implement restoring hardware-to-hardware connections for internal backends</li>
	<li>Improve keyboard shortcuts for track height
	  <p>
	    Just use Alt as a modifier, instead of Alt-Shift.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Add an action to print keyboard shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Expose marker scene changes. In this context,
	  &#34;scene changes&#34; are a pair of MIDI bank and program change
	  messages that Ardour will send to a dedicated port when the
	  playhead passed the marker.
	  <p>
	    Access the marker edit dialog via double clicking a marker
	    (or right click the marker and choose &#34;Edit&#34;).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix &#39;Arrangement Boundary&#39; toggle for scenes
	  <p>
	    The &#39;Arrangement Boundary&#39; toggle was not working correctly for markers
	    with scene changes. Location markers would get turned into section markers,
	    but would not get shifted down to the correct row.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>First time use dialog now allows the user to specify a
	  default location for samples/clips.</li>
	<li>You can now create audio inputs for VST3 plugin in the Pin Connection dialog directly. This already worked for AU and Lua plugins prior to v9.0.</li>
	<li>Add support for global mixer strip templates to the Template Manager.</li>
	<li>Support newer APIs at Soundcloud and Freesound.</li>
	<li>Dramatically improve behavior when using BBT markers.</li>
	<li>Allow SchedRR for I/O threads, as originally intended.</li>
	<li>When using Pipewire&#39;s JACK support, clean up names
	displayed on I/O buttons in the mixer strip and the context
	  menu for those buttons (full names still appear in the port
	  matrix).</li>
	<li>Use a bold font for bar tick labels in the BBT ruler.</li>
	<li>Correctly handle timeline cue scenes that have &#34;Again&#34;
	  as their follow action.</li>
	<li>Errors during loading a session are now properly escaped,
	  so that reporting the error does not cause its own set of problems.</li>
	<li>When changing MIDI port properties (e.g. &#34;Follow
	  Selection&#34;), Ardour now automatically updates the ports used
	  for connection dialogs and menus appropriately.</li>

      <ul>
	<li>Faster GUI drawing
	  <p>
	    Without telling anyone, Apple have subtly changed the way their drawing APIs
	    work for graphical applications over the last 5-10 years. The result has been
	    that a naive graphical app would end up redrawing its entire window even if
	    only a few pixels needed updating. We’re far from the only application to be
	    affected by this. In Ardour 9.0 the GUI drawing speed will be significantly
	    faster, at least on very dense pages like the mixer.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is a complicated area, and there are still monitor
	    configurations where our new implementation will
	    misbehave. You can switch back to a drawing model where
	    macOS is in charge, which will work but can be slower.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Reduce chance of &#34;device busy&#34; when ejecting DMG.</li>
	<li>Improve retina scaling.</li>
	<li>Add new NSApplicationDelegate method to deal with warning on macOS Sonoma.</li>
	<li>Use ArdourMono font on macOS for consistency.</li>
	<li>use small text for ruler text on macOS.</li>

      <dl>
	<dt>Stop transport using the current grid (Transport)</dt>
	<dd>If enabled, stopping the transport (playback or
	  recording) will happen at the next grid point instead of
	  immediately.
	</dd>
	<!-- 	<dt>global quantize</dt>
		<dd></dd> -->
	<dt>Region Editing Preference (Editor)</dt>
	<dd>
	  This controls whether double-clicking to edit a region opens
	  a new window or uses the bottom panel of the editor. 
	</dd>
	<dt>Default location of new windows (Appearance)</dt>
	<dd>
	  This setting defines where new non-modal Ardour windows are opened
	  by default: at the center of the screen, centered at the mouse
	  pointer position, or centered at the parent window.
	</dd>
	<dt>Drag deadzone (Appearance &gt; Size and Scale)</dt>
	<dd>
	  This setting provides broad control over how many pixels the pointer
	  must move before a drag (or copy-drag) begins. 
	</dd>
	<dt>Group operations on selected tracks (General)</dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>
	    In Ardour 8.x, we introduced the idea that selected
	    tracks/busses form a &#34;quick&#34; or &#34;implicit group&#34;, so that if
	    you select 3 tracks and adjust the volume of one of them,
	    the others will follow.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Some users were delighted with this, others were
	    not. This preference item can turn this behavior on or
	    off.
	  </p>
	</dd>
	<dt>VST3 Knob Mode (Plugins &gt; GUI)</dt>
	<dd>
	  Enforce a knob mode for VST3 plugins: use plugin default
	  or switch between linear (depends on vertical movement)
	  and two variation of circular, with and without a jump
	  to clicked position.
	</dd>
	<dt>
	  Automatically open instrument plugin GUI when adding a new
	  MIDI Track/Bus (Plugins &gt; GUI)
	</dt>
	<dd>
	  Ardour now defaults to automatically showing instrument plugin
	  GUIs when new tracks/busses with instruments are added.
	  If multiple tracks are added, Ardour will only show the GUI
	  for the first one. This setting allows you to opt out
	  of the new behavior.

      <h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Fix some odd behavior when using note splitting/joining.
	  <p>
	    This commit ends the split/join operation any time
	    selection is cleared or notes are added to the selection
	    (except when in the middle of a split). This prevents some
	    rather hard to predict behavior when using note splitting.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Redraw arrangement rectangles after tempo change
	  <p>
	    Previously they remained unchanged and thus incorrectly
	    indicating an arrangement section
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix MIDI Clock generator (rounding issues).</li>
	<li>Fix crash after deleting a track/bus.</li>
	<li>Fix crash when loading session from a running instance.</li>
	<li>Fix export encoder race condition.</li>
	<li>Fix crash when dragging plugins from sidebar.</li>
	<li>Fix PT Import when track name contains illegal chars.</li>
	<li>NetBSD build fixes.</li>
	<li>Fix incorrect placement of message catalogs during installation.</li>
	<li>Some potential fixes for weird note split/join behavior.</li>
	<li>Fix crashes when moving mouse over port-matrix.</li>
	<li>Fix race-condition when detecting xjadeo/harvid version.</li>
	<li>Fix false read-only detection of sessions on Windows with OneDrive.</li>
	<li>Fix many issues with precise pixel alignment of MIDI note
	  lines and the keyboard in track headers.</li>
	<li>Fix comment-editor editing to allow inserting text.</li>
	<li>Fix opening links in preferences editor (e.g. VST spec).</li>
	<li>Fix #9961, update saved port-name references when renaming ports.</li>
	<li>Fix MIDI panic timestamp at cycle-end.</li>
	<li>Fix timecode update after locate for demo version.</li>
	<li>Fix a simple but rather error when computing the number
	  of quarter notes that correspond to a number of beats in a
	  given meter.
	  <p>
	    No effect when working in common (4) time, but
	    significant effects for other time signatures/meters.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix computing the difference between two Bar|Beat|Tick (BBT) times.</li>
	<li>Fix edge case when region start is after the source&#39; end
	  <p>
	    This fixes an edge case where an audio-region was split near
	    its end using music-time.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Fix jump in gain when deactivating aux-send with non-unity gain.</li>
	<li>Fix generic UI plugin support for numeric properties.</li>
	<li>Fix crash due to concurrent sndfile access.</li>

      <h2 id="coding-build-changes">Coding &amp; Build Changes</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>We began to use C++17 syntax and features, which caused us to
	  drop support for macoS earlier than 10.13 (High Sierra, 2017).</li>
	<li>We moved a lot of our C++ header file inclusion to use <code>#pragma once</code></li>
	<li>PBD::Signal was reimplemented using contemporary C++ and
	  avoiding as much realtime memory allocation as possible.</li>
	<li>Large amounts of our use of the Boost libraries were
	  replaced by their <code>std::</code> equivalents.</li>
	<li>The build-time requirements for JACK were bumped to JACK2.</li>
	<li>The build system will now allow builds with recent msys2/mingw.</li>
	<li>reduce use of gettimeofday in favor of truly monotonic time.</li>
	<li>Use global FFT planner lock in GUI
	  <p>
	    This <em>should</em> not be needed since the GUI is single
	    threaded, but ... we&#39;re looking at you, JUCE.
