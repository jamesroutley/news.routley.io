    <h1>The Allied “Passierschein” Safe Conduct Passes of WWII (2003)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><strong>Some of the leaflets also have the message in French on the front.
  All of the leaflets have the great seals of the United States and the United Kingdom on
  the top front; those with French-language text also have the seal of France. All of the
  passes bear the facsimile signature of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The messages on the
  back differ in subject and length </strong>but most stressed six points.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Immediate removal from the danger zone.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p><b>
	Shortly after the end of WWII, the U.S. Army Air Force prepared a classified 
	report titled Special Operations: <i>AFF Aid to European Resistance 
	Movements 1943-1945</i>. It mentions the official safe conduct pass:</b></p>
	<blockquote><p><b><i>
	Local tactical leaflets, designed to serve a temporary situation, were 
	disseminated largely by artillery and fighter bombers. There were three 
	basic tactical leaflets. Most important was the passierschein, which was 
	introduced in July 1944. Effective from the beginning, this passport to a 
	prisoner-of-war cage Went through three revisions. </i></b></p></blockquote>

  <p><strong>British soldier prepares leaflet balloon launch of German Safe
  Conduct Passes </strong></p><strong>
  <p>Although this leaflet clearly show a member of the British “M Balloon” unit
  sending off safe conduct passes, British expert Lee Richards told me that the picture
  itself is propaganda. By 1943 the M unit only sent “black propaganda” into
  Germany and the picture is probably meant to disguise that fact and imply that they just
  ballooned harmless white leaflets. In fact, he adds “Looking closely at a higher
  resolution version of the photo you can see that just the top leaflet is the Safe Conduct,
  beneath it are the forged Skorpion newspapers.”</p>
  </strong><p><strong>The image sometimes appeared on the back of a leaflet. For instance, ZG49 is entitled:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>To the Survivors, soldiers and officers of the 7th Army.</strong></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This leaflet bears the passierschein on the back identical to leaflet ZG53. 640,000
  copies of leaflet ZG49 were dropped on 16 August 1944.</p>
  <blockquote>

    <p><strong>ZG53</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>ZG53 also has the passierschein on the back of a leaflet entitled “Stay
  Alive!” Two million copies of ZG53 were dropped from 23 to 24 August 1944. The text
  on the back of ZG53 is:<i> </i></p>
  <p><i>Stay Alive!</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The 7th Army does not exist any longer. But the individual (soldier) can save his
    life. The following instructions are meant to help you stay alive. If you want to save
    your life do the following:</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>1. Stay back! Whoever proceeds to the <st1:place w:st="on">Seine</st1:place> will meet thousands of 
      fighter-bombers.</i></p>
      <p><i>2. Stay away from the streets! The retreat routes are streets of death.</i></p>
      <p><i>3. Weapons away! Wait until the allied advance units appear – then:</i></p>
      <p><i>4. Rally yourselves! The eldest (of you) will be responsible for the discipline.</i></p>
      <p><i>5. Helmet down – belt also – hands up! Wave a white flag!</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i>We are obliged to treat you fairly and correctly like opponents that fought bravely
    for as long as they could before they were forced to surrender due to the enemy
    superiority.</i></p>
    <p><i>Show the reverse of this leaflet upon surrender!</i></p>

    <p>Germans in France surrender using leaflets. 26 September 1944. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This placement of the Passierschein on the back of a regular leaflets was quickly
  prohibited. The book <i>Publicity and Psychological Warfare 1943-1945,</i> by the Twelfth
  United States Army Group, European Theater of Operations, explains: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>In order to have a single safe conduct pass for the entire front, the safe
    conduct pass was produced only by Psychological Warfare detachment SHAEF. In December,
    1944, Psychological Warfare Detachment SHAEF issued directives forbidding reproduction of
    the safe conduct pass on the reverse of Army Group leaflets in order to protect the
    authenticity of the document.</strong></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Most of the safe conduct passes bear a &#34;ZG&#34; code, though some bear a
  &#34;WG&#34; code. These codes were used on combined US-British SHAEF leaflets to
  Germany 1944-1945.</strong></p>
  <p>There are six disseminated versions of the leaflet and they were constantly improved
  through each production run. They were printed by Waterlows of London. <strong>Among the
  leaflets using the general format of the Passierschein are WG21, ZG21, ZG21A, ZG37, ZG61,
  US/GB-ZG61A-1944, ZG61K, ZG76, US/GB–ZG.90– 1944, and US/GB-ZG.139-1945.</strong></p>

  <p>ZG 21 Front</p>
  <p><img src="https://www.psywarrior.com/ZG21backRes.jpg" width="400" height="644" alt="ZG21backRes.jpg (99172 bytes)"/></p>
  <p><strong>ZG21 Back</strong></p>
  <p>ZG21 was dropped in July of 1944. The Allies printed 4,253,175 and dropped 3,360,000.
  This is an early version in brown and light gray-yellow from the Headquarters, 21st Army
  Group. The text on the back mentions Chapter 2, article II, treaty number 864 of the
  Geneva Convention in regard to German prisoners of war receiving the same rations as
  Allied soldiers, payment for camp work, educational lessons and mail. In this early
  version, the English text is above the German, there are no signatures of any commanding
  officer, and the authority is the 21st Army Group. As we mentioned earlier, once SHAEF
  designed a standard leaflet to be used by all forces, the Army Group was prohibited from
  printing and disseminating such leaflets. An almost identical leaflet was meant to be
  dropped to Germans in France. It is coded ZG21a. Records show that 253,175 were prepared
  for delivery to France, but there is no official record of them being distributed.</p>
  <p>The text on the back of ZG21 is an explanation of the rights of prisoners of war:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>In accordance with Chapter 2, Article II, Treaty Number 846 of the Geneva Conference
    of July 27, 1929, prisoners-of-war in American or British armies: Their food is prepared
    in their own manner by cooks taken from their ranks.</i></p>
    <p><i>In America or Canada, prisoners-of-war receive 80 cents a day for work inside or
    outside the camp. Half that amount is deposited in a bank for after the war, the other
    half being paid in tickets which enable prisoners-of-war to purchase cigarettes, candy and
    soft drinks, etc., at the canteen.</i></p>
    <p><i>Prisoners-of-war are afforded facilities for the holding of courses of instruction
    and study, for the performance of sports and games, the holding of concerts, theater
    performances and lectures. They may read newspapers and listen to the radio.</i></p>
    <p><i>All communications between the prisoner camps and home goes via the Red Cross and is
    fast and dependable. After the war, prisoners are returned to their country as soon as
    possible.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <i>Report of Operations of the 12th Army Group</i>, Vol. 14 says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Germans usually don&#39;t speak English. American soldiers usually do not understand
    German. In this obvious fact lay a grave barrier to the surrender of the German soldier.
    How was he to indicate quickly and on the instant, before being shot, that he was giving
    up? To meet this situation, this headquarters developed a leaflet, which reproduced, in
    German phonetic spelling, the words, ‘I surrender.’ It came out ‘Ei
    Sorrender.’ After reading this, the German soldiers could easily say the words that
    any American soldier would understand. This phonetic phrase was printed over and over
    again in millions of leaflets and troop newspapers with indisputable effect. The value of
    the phrase went far beyond its actual employment by a German soldier in surrendering. By
    planting the phrase in the German soldier&#39;s mind, by making it a byword among German
    troops about which they could talk and joke - and even sneer - the phrase gained currency
    and stayed in the back of the mind for possible future reference. It did what the leaflets
    were intended to do, i.e. make the German familiar and at home with the idea of surrender,
    so that the switchover to action became that much easier...</i></p>

  <p>An Un-coded Safe Conduct Pass signed by General Howard Alexander<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>This leaflet is similar to the one above but it bears the signature of the Commander of
  the 15th British Army Group, General Alexander. Once again, the back mentions the Geneva
  Convention</p>
  <p>When Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander for the Normandy invasion he
  suggested that General Alexander become ground forces commander. However, Alexander
  remained in command of the 15th Army Group in Italy and eventually captured Rome in June
  1944. Alexander remained in command of 15th Army Group, as well as its successor, the
  Allied Armies in Italy, for most of the Italian Campaign, until December 1944, when he
  relinquished his command to American General Mark Clark and took over as the Supreme
  Commander of the Allied Forces Headquarters, responsible for all military operations in
  the Mediterranean. Alexander was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal. </p>

  <p><b>A PWB/AFHQ Safe Conduct
  Pass for German Troops in the
  Mediterranean</b></p>
  
  <p><b>We should point out that
  leaflets similar to the above were produced by the Psychological Warfare Branch (PWB) of
  Allied Forces Headquarters in the Mediterranean (AFHQ). The standard safe conduct pass was
  used in Northwest Europe by The joint Anglo-American Psychological Warfare Division (PWD)
  of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). They were generally signed by
  Eisenhower. The PWB leaflets were not signed by General Eisenhower since he was not Allied
  Commander in the Mediterranean Theatre. Notice that this leaflet is signed by General H.
  R. Alexander, Commander in Chief, Allied Armies in Italy. We should mention that Harold
  Rupert Leofric George Alexander was later promoted to Field Marshal and titled 1st Earl
  Alexander of Tunis.</b></p>
 
  <p><b>Notice also that the seals
  at the top of the leaflet are different that the usual U.S. and British national emblems.
  It has been suggested that they are the WWII emblems of the U.S. and British Armies. </b></p>

	</div><p><b>We mention Mark Clark above as being considered to command the 15th 
	Army Group. He had previously commanded the U.S. 5th Army. In December 1944, 
	Lieutenant General Mark Clark became the new Group Commander and above is a 
	safe conduct pass he signed. What is strange about this leaflet is that it 
	is addressed to non-commissioned officers, in other words enlisted leaders 
	that we call Sergeants in the United States. This is rare since Officers 
	have more power and responsibility and it is usually, they that 
	propagandists target to have them bring over entire units. A sergeant might 
	have control of a squad or a patrol, so generally they can influence far 
	fewer people. This safe conduct pass bears no code number but we know that 
	Clarke led the 15th Army Group that was composed of the U.S. Fifth Army and 
	British Eighth Army, and also had units from other allied countries and 
	regions; such as Corps from Free France and Poland, one Division from 
	Brazil, and multiple separate Italian and Greek brigades, besides supporting 
	and being supported by the local Italian partisans. The Group operated in 
	the Italian Campaign between 1943 and 1945.</b></p><p><b>The front of the leaflet is in English. The back is in German and
