I would not reject it on ideological grounds - but the preliminary examination has shown that it does not help us.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim 2 remain the last nuclear plants that produce power in Germany after the country a decade ago decided to phase out the fuel in the wake of Japan&#39;s Fukushima disaster.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The three plants are owned by German energy firms E.ON <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/EONGn.DE" target="_blank">(EONGn.DE)</a>, RWE <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/RWEG.DE" target="_blank">(RWEG.DE)</a> and EnBW <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/EBKG.DE" target="_blank">(EBKG.DE)</a>, respectively. Habeck said the three operators have pointed out that extending the life-spans would not help for the 2022/23 winter season.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;Because the preparations for the shutdowns are already so far advanced that the nuclear power plants could only continue to operate under the highest safety concerns and possibly with fuel supplies that have not yet been secured,&#34; Habeck said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">&#34;And that is certainly not what we want.&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Christoph Steitz; editing by Diane Craft</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
