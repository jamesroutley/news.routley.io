            <p><strong>Stunnel is a proxy designed to add TLS encryption functionality to existing clients and servers without any changes in the programs&#39; code.</strong>
Its <a href="https://www.stunnel.org/features.html">architecture</a> is optimized for security, portability, and scalability (including load-balancing), making it suitable for large deployments.</p>

<p>Stunnel uses the <a href="https://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> library for cryptography, so it supports whatever cryptographic algorithms are compiled into the library. It can benefit from the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4282">FIPS 140-2</a> validation of the OpenSSL FIPS Provider, as long as the building process meets the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp4282.pdf">OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 Security Policy</a>.  Our latest Windows installer includes the OpenSSL FIPS Provider.</p>
