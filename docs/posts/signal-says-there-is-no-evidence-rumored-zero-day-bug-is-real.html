    <h1>Signal says there is no evidence rumored zero-day bug is real</h1>

<p>Signal messenger has investigated rumors spreading online over the weekend of a zero-day security vulnerability related to the &#39;Generate Link Previews&#39; feature, stating that there is no evidence this vulnerability is real.</p>
<p>This statement comes after numerous sources told BleepingComputer and <a href="https://twitter.com/gaughen/status/1713368501929300300" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported on Twitter</a> that a new zero-day vulnerability allowed for a full takeover of devices.</p>
<p>After contacting Signal about the zero-day last night, they released a statement on Twitter stating that they have investigated the rumors and have found no evidence that this flaw is real.</p>
<p>&#34;PSA: we have seen the vague viral reports alleging a Signal 0-day vulnerability, reads a statement on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#34;After responsible investigation *we have no evidence that suggests this vulnerability is real* nor has any additional info been shared via our official reporting channels.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We also checked with people across US Government, since the copy-paste report claimed USG as a source. Those we spoke to have no info suggesting this is a valid claim,&#34;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1713789257599353084" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Signal tweet" height="500" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/vulnerabilities/s/signal/link-previews-zero-day/signal-tweet.jpg" width="531"/></a></p>
<p>Citing US government sources, news of the alleged zero-day quickly spread online and among the cybersecurity community Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>These unnamed USG sources said that the vulnerability could be mitigated by disabling the &#39;Generate Link Previews&#39; setting in Signal.</p>

<p>However, BleepingComputer could not confirm the validity of these statements, even though we heard it from numerous people claiming the same sources.</p>
<p>While Signal has stated that they have no evidence of a new zero-day, they still request that those with new and &#34;real&#34; info contact their security team.</p>
<p>As this is an ongoing investigation, and the mitigation is to simply disable the Link Previews feature, users may want to turn this setting off for the time being until it&#39;s fully confirmed not to be real.</p>
<h2>Signal zero-days in high demand</h2>
<p>Signal zero-day bugs are highly sought after by vulnerability brokers, who are willing to pay a hefty amount for flaws that can lead to remote code execution on devices.</p>
<p>Zero-day broker Zerodium offers up to $500,000 for a zero-day Signal exploit chain, leading to privilege escalation and remote code execution.</p>

<p>However, Russian zero-day broker Operation Zero is <a href="https://opzero.ru/en/prices" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">willing to pay</a> as high as $1.5 million for a Signal zero-day remote code execution vulnerability.</p>
<p>While both vulnerability brokers sell acquired zero-day flaws to private corporations and government agencies, Operation Zero only sells to Russian entities.</p>
<p>Zero-day vulnerabilities for mobile apps and operating systems are in high demand as spyware developers <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-finds-more-android-ios-zero-days-used-to-install-spyware/" target="_blank">commonly use them to install their software</a> on mobile devices.</p>
<p>These services have been found to be used by entities, including government agencies, to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iphones-running-latest-ios-hacked-to-deploy-nso-group-spyware/" target="_blank">monitor the activities</a> of journalists, activists, and politicians.</p>
