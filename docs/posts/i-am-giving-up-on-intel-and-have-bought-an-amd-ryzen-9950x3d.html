  <p>The Intel 285K CPU in my <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-05-15-my-2025-high-end-linux-pc/">high-end 2025 Linux
PC</a> died <strong>again</strong>! üò° Notably,
this was the replacement CPU for the original 285K that <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-03-19-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-on-asus-z890-not-stable/">died in
March</a>, and
after reading through the reviews of Intel CPUs on my electronics store of
choice, many of which (!) mention CPU replacements, I am getting the impression
that Intel‚Äôs current CPUs just are not stable üòû. Therefore, I am giving up on
Intel for the coming years and have bought an AMD Ryzen 9950X3D CPU instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-or-the-batch-job-of-death">What happened? Or: the batch job of death</h2>
<p>On the 9th of July, I set out to experiment with
<a href="https://layout-parser.github.io/">layout-parser</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)">tesseract</a> in order to
convert a collection of scanned paper documents from images into text.</p>
<p>I expected that offloading this task to the GPU would result in a drastic
speed-up, so I attempted to build layout-parser with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>. Usually, it‚Äôs not required to
compile software yourself on <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, but CUDA is non-free,
so the default NixOS cache does not compile software with CUDA. (Tip: Enable the
<a href="https://nix-community.org/cache/">Nix Community Cache</a>, which contains prebuilt
CUDA packages, too!)</p>
<p>This lengthy compilation attempt failed with a weird symptom: I left for work,
and after a while, my PC was no longer reachable over the network, but fans kept
spinning at 100%! üò≥ At first, <a href="https://mas.to/@zekjur/114822353514097399">I¬†suspected a Linux
bug</a>, but now I am thinking this was
the first sign of the CPU being unreliable.</p>
<p>When the CUDA build failed, I ran the batch job without GPU offloading
instead. It took about 4 hours and consumed roughly 300W constantly. You can see
it on this CPU usage graph:</p>

<p>But the next day, when I wanted to wake up my PC from suspend-to-RAM as usual,
it wouldn‚Äôt wake up. Worse, even after removing the power cord and waiting a few
seconds, there was no reaction to pressing the power button.</p>
<p>Later, I diagnosed the problem to either the mainboard and/or the CPU. The Power
Supply, RAM and disk all work with different hardware. I ended up returning both
the CPU and the mainboard, as I couldn‚Äôt further diagnose which of the two is
broken.</p>
<p>To be clear: I am not saying the batch job killed the CPU. The computer was
acting strangely in the morning already. But the batch job might have been what
really sealed the deal.</p>
<h2 id="no-it-wasnt-the-heat-wave">No, it wasn‚Äôt the heat wave</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/firefox-dev-says-intel-raptor-lake-crashes-are-increasing-with-rising-temperatures-in-record-european-heat-wave-mozilla-staffs-tracking-overwhelmed-by-intel-crash-reports-team-disables-the-function">Tom‚Äôs Hardware recently
reported</a>
that ‚ÄúIntel Raptor Lake crashes are increasing with rising temperatures in
record European heat wave‚Äù, which prompted some folks to blame Europe‚Äôs general
lack of Air Conditioning.</p>
<p>But in this case, I actually <strong>did air-condition the room</strong> about half-way
through the job (at about 16:00), when I noticed the room was getting
hot. Here‚Äôs the temperature graph:</p>















<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp.jpg"><img srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp_hu_1c38592935786593.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp_hu_6501c7c4a99a9259.jpg 3x" src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp_hu_f4d3a15f7c3ae485.jpg" alt="temperature graph (measured with HomeMatic sensors)" title="temperature graph (measured with HomeMatic sensors)" width="600" height="215" loading="lazy"/></a></p><p>I would say that 25 to 28 degrees celsius are normal temperatures for computers.</p>
<p>I also double-checked if the CPU temperature of about 100 degrees celsius is too
high, but no: <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cooling-testing-how-much-does-it-take-to-keep-arrow-lake-cool-in-msis-mpg-gungnir-300r-airflow-pc-case/2">this Tom‚Äôs Hardware
article</a>
shows even higher temperatures, and Intel specifies a maximum of 110
degrees. So, running at ‚Äúonly‚Äù 100 degrees for a few hours should be fine.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if Intel CPUs were prone to <em>crashing</em> under high heat, they should
<em>never die</em>.</p>
<h2 id="which-amd-cpu-to-buy">Which AMD CPU to buy?</h2>
<p>I wanted the fastest AMD CPU (for desktops, not for servers), which currently is
the Ryzen 9 9950X, but there is also the Ryzen 9 9950X<strong>3D</strong>, a variant with 3D
V-Cache. Depending on the use-case, the variant with or without 3D V-Cache is
faster, see <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-linux/10">the comparison on
Phoronix</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided for the 9950X3D model, not just because it performs better
in many of the benchmarks, but also because Linux 6.13 and newer <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-3d-vcache-optimizer-9950x3d">let you
control whether to prefer the CPU cores with larger V-Cache or higher
frequency</a>,
which sounds like an interesting capability: By changing this setting, maybe one
can see how sensitive certain workloads are to extra cache.</p>
<p>Aside from the CPU, I also needed a new mainboard (for AMD‚Äôs socket AM5), but I
kept all the other components. I ended up selecting the <a href="https://www.asus.com/ch-en/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-x870-plus-wifi/">ASUS TUF
X870+</a>
mainboard. I usually look for low power usage in a mainboard, so I made sure to
go with an X870 mainboard instead of an X870E one, because the X870E has two
chipsets (both of which consume power and need cooling)! Given the context of
this hardware replacement, I also like the TUF line‚Äôs focus on endurance‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>The performance of the AMD 9950X3D seems to be slightly better than the Intel
285K:</p>

<h2 id="power-consumption">Power consumption</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-05-15-my-2025-high-end-linux-pc/">high-end 2025 Linux PC</a> I
explained that I chose the Intel 285K CPU for its lower idle power consumption,
and some folks were skeptical if AMD CPUs are really worse in that regard.</p>
<p>Having switched between 3 different PCs, but with identical peripherals, I can
now answer the question of how the top CPUs differ in power consumption!</p>
<p>I picked a few representative point-in-time power values from a couple of days
of usage:</p>

<p>Looking at two typical evenings, here is the power consumption of the Intel 285K:</p>

all regards: the baseline is higher, the spikes are higher (peak consumption)
and it spikes more often / for longer.</p>
<p>Looking at my energy meter statistics, I usually ended up at about 9.x kWh per
day for a two-person household, cooking with induction.</p>
<p>After switching my PC from Intel to AMD, I end up at 10-11 kWh per day.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started buying Intel CPUs because they allowed me to build high-performance
computers that ran Linux flawlessly and produced little noise. This formula
worked for me over many years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back in 2008, I <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2008-04-02-startschwierigkeiten_2008/">bought a mobile Intel CPU in a desktop case (article in
German)</a>.</li>
<li>Then, in 2012, I could just <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2012-06-24-buying_linux_computer_2012/">buy a regular Intel CPU (i7-2600K) for my Linux
PC</a>, because they had gotten so
much better in terms of power saving.</li>
<li>Over the years, I bought an i7-8700K, and later an i9-9900K.</li>
<li>The last time this formula worked out for me was <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2022-01-15-high-end-linux-pc/">with my 2022 high-end Linux
PC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the one hand, I‚Äôm a little sad that this era has ended. On the other hand, I
have had a soft spot for AMD since I had one of their K6 CPUs in one of my early
PCs and in fact, I have never stopped buying AMD CPUs (e.g. for my <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2024-07-02-ryzen-7-mini-pc-low-power-proxmox-hypervisor/">Ryzen
7-based Mini
Server</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe AMD could further improve their idle power usage in upcoming models? And,
if Intel survives for long enough, maybe they succeed at stabilizing their CPU
designs again? I certainly would love to see some competition in the CPU market.</p>
