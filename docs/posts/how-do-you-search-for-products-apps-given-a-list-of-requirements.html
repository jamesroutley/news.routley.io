    <h1>Ask HN: How do you search for products / apps given a list of requirements?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Very often (for example right now) I get the impression that at least for some products market evolves backwards. Or maybe it&#39;s just flooded with crap making it just close to impossible to find the &#34;tip of the pyramid&#34; (nicely demonstrated by Adam in his rant on search engines [1]).<p>Right now I&#39;m searching for a Music/MP3 player device that comes with a list of attributes that I&#39;d take for granted. Apart from modern technology like Bluetooth - most of them existed 20 years ago!</p><p>But looking the length alone of the list of features I don&#39;t want to pass on fill my mind with hopelessness nowadays:</p><p>[ ] lightweight / has a clip</p><p>[ ] plays from filesystem</p><p>[ ] supports resume from last played for large files (must have for audiobooks)</p><p>[ ] support for at least OGG and FLAC next to MP3</p><p>[ ] auto-connects to BT headset</p><p>[ ] equalizer or at least bass/treble control</p><p>[ ] playback modes (continue alphabetically, shuffle, etc.) (no - not obvi</p><p>[ ] auto-off after N minutes</p><p>[ ] display easy to read in sunlight (why not e-paper?)</p><p>[ ] support for firmware updates (I don&#39;t dare to ask for open source..)</p><p>[ ] nice: audio jack for analog headsets</p><p>[ ] nice: support for multiple (2) bluetooth headsets</p><p>I know today it&#39;s profitable to throw cheap crap on the market - most people will just buy and forget. But what&#39;s with those who&#39;d like to spent quite some money for a quality product? Do they have a chance to search nowadays?</p><p>How do you do it? Just with standard search engines and endurance? Reddit? Special keywords? Are there reliable platforms for product recommendations? Build your own ([2])?</p><p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31476069</p><p>[2] https://www.instructables.com/ESP32-Audio-Player/</p></div></div>
