    <h1>Mullvad becomes highest level of Tor Member (Shallot)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Mullvad has been a Tor Project Vidalia Onion Member since 2021 and has now become a Shallot Onion Member of Tor.</p>

<p>Contributing to communities and organisations that really strive to improve privacy and integrity online is important for Mullvad. Unfortunately, there are very few. Those that understand privacy, actively work to improve anti-fingerprinting and to protect users against more advanced attacks - are even fewer.</p>

<p>We believe that the Tor Project is one such organisation. We share their values when it comes to human rights, freedom of expression, anti-censorship and online privacy.</p>

<p>We want to encourage others who believe in the Tor Projects mission, and we have now decided to upgrade to become a Shallot onion in the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/membership/">Tor Projectâ€™s Membership Program.</a></p>
