However, surprisingly, the ELIZA program itself was never published, and it wasn&#39;t written in Lisp, but in a now-obscure language called<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSLIP_%28programming_language%29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0z3vGZx6u2BvvRWC_6s0-y" target="_blank"> </a></span><span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSLIP_%28programming_language%29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0z3vGZx6u2BvvRWC_6s0-y" target="_blank">MAD-SLIP</a></span><span> running on an<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FIBM_7090&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vRRLIM8kRKUs1ZNepQc9Q" target="_blank"> </a></span><span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FIBM_7090&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vRRLIM8kRKUs1ZNepQc9Q" target="_blank">IBM 7094</a></span><span> computer at MIT. Until now, the ELIZA source code has been missing, presumed by many to be lost, and </span><span>because</span><span> many alternate versions have been created over the years, the original source code </span><span>remained</span><span> undiscovered.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Weizenbaum&#39;s ELIZA was intended as a general conversational agent. It interpreted a separate, domain-specific script </span><span>that</span><span> determined its style of conversation. The most well-known script is called &#34;DOCTOR&#34;. This is the one that carries on the well-known &#34;Rogerian therapist&#34; conversations that appear in Weizenbaum&#39;s 1966 paper, and which are most commonly associated with the name &#34;ELIZA.&#34; Indeed, the name &#34;ELIZA&#34; has basically come to mean “</span><span>t</span><span>he ELIZA agent running the DOCTOR script.”  ELIZA can be seen as the precursor of many of the conversation interfaces and chatbots that we have become so familiar with today, such as Siri, but it worked over a much more clunky typewriter-based console. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>As Weizenbaum (1967: 475) explains, “</span><span>F</span><span>rom one point of view, an ELIZA script is a program and ELIZA itself an interpreter. From another perspective, ELIZA appears as an actor who must depend on a script for his [sic] lines. The script determines the contextual framework within which ELIZA may be expected to converse plausibly.&#34; In </span><span><em>Contextual Understanding by Computers</em></span><span> (CACM, 1967), he writes: &#34;The first program to which I wish to call attention is a particular member of a family of programs which has come to be known as DOCTOR. The family name of these programs is ELIZA. This name was chosen because these programs, like the Eliza of Pygmalion fame, can be taught to speak increasingly well. DOCTOR causes ELIZA to respond roughly as would certain psychotherapists (Rogerians). ELIZA performs best when its human correspondent is initially instructed to &#34;talk&#34; to it, via the typewriter, of course, just as one would to a psychiatrist.&#34;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>However, only the DOCTOR script appears in the 1966 paper, not the ELIZA code that interprets that script, although the algorithm is described in great detail. The common misconception that ELIZA was originally written in Lisp arose because shortly after the publication of the 1966 paper, Bernie Cosell wrote a version in Lisp, based upon the description of the algorithm in the 1966 paper. Cosell&#39;s version used a version of the published script, but he never saw the original ELIZA.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The language of the original ELIZA was MAD-SLIP. MAD (“Michigan Algorithm Decoder”) was an Algol-like programming language, available on many common large computers at that time. Weizenbaum added list-processing functionality to MAD, creating MAD-SLIP (&#34;Symmetric LIst Processor,&#34; Weizenbaum, 1963), a </span><span>Lisp-like language embedded in MAD</span><span>. Indeed, adding to the Lisp/MAD-SLIP confusion, the published DOCTOR script, an appendix to the 1966 paper, is parenthesized exactly like a Lisp S-expression, the way one would if one were writing a Lisp program.** </span><span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XtF7EM1KhwMPKsp5t6F0gwN-8LsNDPOl/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a copy of the MAD-SLIP manual from a long, 3-volume 7090 user&#39;s guide.</a></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><strong>(Re)Discovery of the Original E</strong></span><span><strong>LIZA</strong></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In hopes of discovering the original source code for ELIZA, I recently went [remote] spelunking in Weizenbaum&#39;s archives, held by MIT.

[This is a common confusion!] </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Jeff called the author of the educational version of ELIZA &#34;Paul Howard&#34;. His name is really &#34;Paul Hayward&#34;. </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Adam says at one point that Bernie Cosell worked at Raytheon, and at another point that he worked at BBN. Bernie worked at BBN at the time of the events under discussion; BBN was acquired by Raytheon much later. </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Jeff calls one of the missing functions &#34;MATCH&#34;; it&#39;s actually &#34;YMATCH&#34;.  </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Adam says that SLIP was written in MAD. Actually, SLIP was what we would now call a package that added list processing functionality to MAD. </span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Jeff claims that MAD weirdly allows you to abbreviate &#34;END&#34; as &#34;E&#39;D&#34;. It&#39;s true that MAD permits this sort of abbreviation, but there is no &#34;END&#34; keyword; Jeff appears to be referring to the </span><span>abbreviation</span><span> &#34;E&#39;L&#34; which is used where conditional blocks end, and so could me misinterpreted as an abbreviation for &#34;END&#34;, but it&#39;s really an abbreviation for &#34;End Conditional&#34;. (Not that that make the language any less weird!)</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Adam calls the ENIAC &#34;<span>the first general purpose electric computer&#34;</span>. ENIAC actually stands for &#34;<span>Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer&#34;, so it was probable </span><span>the first general purpose </span><span>ELECTRONIC</span><span> computer. (I know -- picky picky picky! :-)</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Adam implies that Anthony Hay started working on his C++ ELIZA in order to understand the </span><span>rediscovered</span><span> MAD-SLIP code. Actually, Anthony had been working on his version for some time before he and Jeff even met. It&#39;s true that he improved his version based on the discovered code, and that he was instrumental in understanding what the discovered code did. [Jeff did not make this clear in the interview.]</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>At the very beginning, Jeff says that in a party of philosophers, he&#39;d probably be a linguist. In fact, Jeff has very little reason to fairly call himself a linguist; it would have made much more sense to call himself a molecular biologist in that setting.)</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Jeff hypothesizes that Bernie Cosell&#39;s ELIZA would have been written &#34;<span>at BBN in Maclisp, I guess would be… Well, it was BBN LISP at the time.</span>&#34; This is a bit confused (and confusing). Both MacLisp and BBN Lisp were forks from PDP-6 Lisp 1.5, but whatever BBN used at the time (mid 1960s), it apparently wasn&#39;t called BBN Lisp until the early 1970s. These details are just messily confusing, and irrelevant. Let&#39;s  just say that it was written at BBN in some non-MacLisp branch of Lisp 1.5, whatever it was called at the time at the time. (Note that Bernie&#39;s original code is over on <span><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/elizagen-org/commonly-known-eliza-clones">the &#34;Commony Know ELIZA Clones&#34; page</a></span> on this site!)</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Adam says: &#34;<span>everybody thought ELIZA was written in LISP [bacuase] Snippets of it were published in the original paper, and they looked like LISP S-expressions&#34;. This is slightly misleading. The &#34;snippets&#34; Adam is referring to is the DOCTOR conversation driver script, which is published in full in the CACM paper, and, indeed, looks exactly like a Lisp s-expression. And this almost certainly had a part to play in folks thinking that ELIZA was written in Lisp.

Good old fashioned AI. &#34; Obviously this is an unintentional mis-classification; Hinton is definitely not among the leaders of GOFAI; he&#39;s one of the leaders of the neo-connectionism, which is the antithesis of GOFAI.</span></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="h.45572ceca6b140ae_0"><div><div tabindex="-1"><div><div><div jscontroller="sGwD4d" jsaction="zXBUYb:zTPCnb;zQF9Uc:Qxe3nd;" jsname="F57UId"><div><div id="h.45572ceca6b140ae_3"><div><div><p dir="ltr"><span><strong>SOME NOTES ON READING THE CODE</strong></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Note that the ELIZA main program actually starts on page 9 of the PDF (the 4th page of actual MAD-SLIP code), and continues to the end.

The programmer responsible was John Burger who was involved with many early AI efforts. Somehow, John talked to one of the Playboy writers and the next thing we knew, there was an article in Playboy much to Weizenbaum&#39;s and everybody else&#39;s horror. We got all sorts of calls from therapists who read the article and wanted to contribute their &#34;expertise&#34; to make the program better. Eventually we prepared a stock letter and phone script to put off all of this free consulting.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The crisis passed when the unstoppable John Burger invited a husband and wife, both psychology profs at UCLA, to visit SDC and see the Doctor in action. I was assigned damage control and about lost it when both visitors laughed and kept saying the program was perfect! Finally, one of them caught their breath and finished the sentence: &#34;This program is perfect to show our students just exactly how NOT to do Rogerian* therapy. *I think Rogerian was the term used but it&#39;s been a while.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>A little latter [sic] we were involved in the (D)ARPA Speech Understanding Research (SUR) Program and some of the group was there all hours of day and night. Spouses and significant others tended to visit particularly in the crazy night hours and kept getting in our way. We would amuse them by letting them use Eliza on the Q32 Time Sharing System. One day, the Q32 became unavailable in those off hours for a long period of time. We had a Raytheon 704 computer in the speech lab that I thought we could use to keep visitors happy some of the time. So one weekend I wrote an interpretive Lisp system for the 704 and debugged it the next Monday. The sole purpose of this Lisp was to support Eliza. Someone else adopted the Q32 version to run on the new 704 Lisp. So in less than a week, while doing our normal work, we had a new Lisp system running Eliza and keeping visitors happy while we did our research.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The 704 Eliza system, with quite a different script, was used to generate a conversation with a user about the status of a computer. The dialogue was very similar to one with a human playing the part of a voice recognition and response system where the lines are noisy. The human and Eliza dialogues were included/discussed in A. Newell, et al., &#34;Speech Understanding Systems; Final Report of a Study Group,&#34; Published for Artificial Intelligence by North-Holland/ American Elsevier (1973). The content of that report was all generated in the late 1960s but not published immediately.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The web site, </span><span><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.softwarepreservation.org%2Fprojects%2FLISP%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw2TMF-PpEREjy-FKN8GDkEK" target="_blank">http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/</a></span><span>, has a little more information about the Raytheon 704 Lisp.
