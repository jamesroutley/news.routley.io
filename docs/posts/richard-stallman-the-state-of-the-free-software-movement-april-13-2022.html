    <h1>Richard Stallman – “The state of the Free Software movement” – April 13, 2022</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>On April 13th, 2022, Richard Stallman — founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project — gave an hour and a half presentation on “The state of the free software movement”.</p><p><strong>You can <a href="https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/the-state-of-the-free-software-movement/" rel="">listen to the whole presentation on LibrePlanet.org</a>.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Note: According to the Free Software Foundation, “Due to unforeseen technical difficulties, RMS gave his talk over audio only.”</p></blockquote><p>I’ve included a few choice quotes from Stallman’s 90 minute presentation below.  </p><p>Though, truthfully, I highly recommend <a href="https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/the-state-of-the-free-software-movement/" rel="">listening to the whole thing</a>.  There’s no denying the massive influence Richard Stallman has had on the software world (Free Software in particular, obviously), and hearing his thoughts on the current state of the computer software world is both important and enlightening.</p><h3>Stallman on Ubunu:</h3><blockquote><p>“Ubuntu of course is a non-free distro, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend that anyone use it. Some important packages are now distributed only through their non-freedom-respecting package system, and not as Debian packages. So it&#39;s even harder than before to get any freedom out of an Ubuntu installation.”</p></blockquote><h3>Stallman on Hardware Freedom and Macintoshes</h3><blockquote><p>“What&#39;s getting worse? Well, the libre-booted machines that we have are getting older and scarcer. Finding a way to support something new is difficult, because Intel and AMD are both designing their hardware to subjugate people. If they were basically haters of the public, it would be hard for them to do it much worse than they&#39;re doing.</p></blockquote><h3>Stallman on Video Games</h3><blockquote><p>“Well, first of all, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything bad about playing a game. Unless the game is non-free — then it&#39;s bad for you, if you play it.</p></blockquote><h3>Stallman on Planned Obsolescence and Waste</h3><blockquote><p>“Planned obsolescence causes a lot of waste. And in particular, it produces lots of e-waste. Of course, manufacturing the new devices to be sold to people who have just suffered planned obsolescence uses a lot of energy and a lot of material resources. So free software is exactly the thing to help people keep using the same device for longer.</p></blockquote><h3>Stallman announcing a Manual for GNU C</h3><p>Stallman closed out his presentation by announcing a new book he has written: a manual for the GNU C compiler.</p><blockquote><p>“I have written a manual for GNU C, and the Free Software Foundation is going to publish it in not-too-terribly long. Now, why do I say it&#39;s a manual for GNU C? It does not try to describe the C standard — because that would be tremendously complicated, and tremendously hard to use.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks to the Slashdot users who <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/22/04/16/238221/richard-stallman-calls-for-software-package-systems-that-help-maintain-your-freedoms" rel="">transcribed</a> some portions of Richards speech.
