          In the grand compendium of universal knowledge, it is universally
          acknowledged that the scribbles of a wizard not only transcend the
          mundane but are, without a shadow of a doubt, the most exhilarating
          form of notation known to humanoid kind. For who could resist the
          allure of a well-placed spell in the margins?

        <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>
          magick.css is a minimalistic, (mostly) classless CSS framework that
          is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. It is contained
          in a single file, and every choice is commented. The goal is to
          achieve an elegant, but magically playful look, while maximizing
          readability and the ability to convey information; <em>somewhat akin
            to the notes of a wizard</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework retains its beauty and functionality across <strong>all
            devices</strong> and screen sizes, and works entirely
          <strong>without JavaScript</strong>. It is inspired by <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>,
          old school TTRPG rulebooks, CSS frameworks like <a href="https://concrete.style/" target="_blank">concrete.css</a> and
          <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank">Tufte CSS</a> and the &#34;usability as design&#34; ethic of
          brutalism.

      <section id="howto">
        <h2>How to use magick.css</h2>
        
        <p>
          The easiest way to check out magick.css for your own project is to add it from
          a CDN. Just add these two lines to your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/normalize.css&#34;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/magick.css&#34;&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also just download the magick.css file from this repo, and include
          it into your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> as you normally would:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;path/to/magick.css&#34;&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also add magick.css to your JS project like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>npm install normalize.css magick.css</code></pre>
        <p>
          And import them in your code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>import &#39;normalize.css&#39;
import &#39;magick.css&#39;</code></pre>
        <p>
          For anything beyond that: magick.css should work with any HTML5
          document, as it is 99% classless. There are some cool features that
          you can use, though; just scroll down to discover them!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="layout">
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          To have your page structured as a responsive, readable column, wrap
          all of your content in <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tags, and then use
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags to break up long form content
          content into sections. This page is a good example of how to do this.
        </p><p>
          (You could of course just ignore this advice and use magick.css for
          typography and styled components only.)
        </p>
        <p>Here is a simple example of the usual structure:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          To add tangential information, magick.css uses the
          <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag. You will find it used from time to
          time on this page. Should you want to elaborate on a point, or provide
          additional context, you can use magick.css&#39;s sidenotes.<span></span>
          <span>Sidenotes are automagically numbered!</span>
          You can find out more about this in the <a href="#extras">Extras</a>
          section below.

      <section id="typography">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a showcase of the typography that magick.css offers:
        </p>
        </section>

      <section id="structured-content">
        <h2>Structured Content</h2>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>
          Lists are kept simple, as to not distract from the content:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is...</li>
          <li>... an unordered list.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

      <section id="forms-and-input">
        <h2>Forms &amp; Input</h2>
        Interactive elements can be used on their own, or as part of a form.
        Keep reading to see examples of both.
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        
        

        <h3>Text Inputs</h3>
        <p>
          Free standing text inputs are not opinionated in regards to their size
          or placement, as their use can vary greatly. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        
        
        

        <h3>Checkboxes &amp; Radio Buttons</h3>
        <p>
          Labels for checkboxes and radio buttons are expected <em>after</em>
          the input element. This way, magick.css can ensure proper grouped
          spacing between them, without requiring additional wrappers and classes.
        </p>
        
        <label for="checkbox1">I am a checkbox.</label>
        
        <label for="checkbox2">I am disabled.</label>
        </section>

      <section id="media-and-figures">
        <h2>Media &amp; Figures</h2>
        <p>
          Media elements such as images and video can stand alone or be
          presented as a figure, giving structure and elegance to your content,
          and an opportunity to add context using a caption.
        </p>
        <h3>Standalone</h3>
        
        <p>
          Let&#39;s start with a standalone <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.
          It will not be stretched or distorted, but will be displayed at its
          natural size; as long as enough space is available:
        </p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=1" alt="an example, depicting a random subject"/>
        <h3>In a Figure</h3>
        <p>
          Using a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element, we can display the media
          element more prominently, and can also add a caption using a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=2" alt="an example, depicting a random subject"/>
          <figcaption>This is the figure caption, is usually provides context.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="code-quotes-and-preformatting">
        <h2>Code, Quotes and Preformatting</h2>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
          Displaying code can be done either inline or in a distinct block. To
          inline code, use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. For larger pieces of
          code, use <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> to wrap the
          <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. By the way, you can also use figures to
          display code snippets!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre><span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span><span>6</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>9</span></span><code>void fib(int x) {
    unsigned long a = 0, b = 1, c;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) {
        printf(&#34;%lu &#34;, a);
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
}</code></pre>
          <fibcaption>This C function generates numbers of the fibonacci sequence.</fibcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          (Line numbering of code requires some extra preprocessing of the
          content, but it is quite simple to do, even just by hand. Find out
          how in the <a href="#extras">Extras</a> section.)
        </p>

        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>
          For quotes, use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag. Depending on
          the content, you might want to use preformatted text or let the
          browser handle the formatting:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
          </p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Adding a citation is done using a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> inside
          the blockquote. Just look at the source code of this page to see how
          it&#39;s done!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&#39;s now consider a poem, where the formatting is imporant and can&#39;t be
          dynamically determined by the browser. In this case, we wrap the poem
          contents in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre><p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and meâ€” 
Yes!â€” that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
   And killing my Annabel Lee.</p></pre>
          
        </blockquote>
