          In the grand compendium of universal knowledge, it is universally
          acknowledged that the scribbles of a wizard not only transcend the
          mundane but are, without a shadow of a doubt, the most exhilarating
          form of notation known to humanoid kind. For who could resist the
          allure of a well-placed spell in the margins?

        <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>
          magick.css is a minimalistic, (mostly) classless CSS framework that
          is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. It is contained
          in a single file, and every choice is commented. The goal is to
          achieve an elegant, but magically playful look, while maximizing
          readability and the ability to convey information; <em>somewhat akin
            to the notes of a wizard</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework retains its beauty and functionality across <strong>all
            devices</strong> and screen sizes, and works entirely
          <strong>without JavaScript</strong>. It is inspired by <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>,
          old school TTRPG rulebooks, CSS frameworks like <a href="https://concrete.style/" target="_blank">concrete.css</a> and
          <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank">Tufte CSS</a> and the &#34;usability as design&#34; ethic of
          brutalism.

      <section id="howto">
        <h2>How to use magick.css</h2>
        
        <p>
          The easiest way to check out magick.css for your own project is to add it from
          a CDN. Just add these two lines to your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/normalize.css&#34;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/magick.css&#34;&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also just download the magick.css file from this repo, and include
          it into your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> as you normally would:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;path/to/magick.css&#34;&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also add magick.css to your JS project like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>npm install normalize.css magick.css</code></pre>
        <p>
          And import them in your code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>import &#39;normalize.css&#39;
import &#39;magick.css&#39;</code></pre>
        <p>
          For anything beyond that: magick.css should work with any HTML5
          document, as it is 99% classless. There are some cool features that
          you can use, though; just scroll down to discover them!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="layout">
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          To have your page structured as a responsive, readable column, wrap
          all of your content in <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tags, and then use
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags to break up long form content
          content into sections. This page is a good example of how to do this.
        </p><p>
          (You could of course just ignore this advice and use magick.css for
          typography and styled components only.)
        </p>
        <p>Here is a simple example of the usual structure:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          To add tangential information, magick.css uses the
          <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag. You will find it used from time to
          time on this page. Should you want to elaborate on a point, or provide
          additional context, you can use magick.css&#39;s sidenotes.<span></span>
          <span>Sidenotes are automagically numbered!</span>
          You can find out more about this in the <a href="#extras">Extras</a>
          section below.

      <section id="typography">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a showcase of the typography that magick.css offers:
        </p>
        </section>

      <section id="structured-content">
        <h2>Structured Content</h2>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>
          Lists are kept simple, as to not distract from the content:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is...</li>
          <li>... an unordered list.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

      <section id="forms-and-input">
        <h2>Forms &amp; Input</h2>
        Interactive elements can be used on their own, or as part of a form.
        Keep reading to see examples of both.
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        
        

        <h3>Text Inputs</h3>
        <p>
          Free standing text inputs are not opinionated in regards to their size
          or placement, as their use can vary greatly. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        
        
        

        <h3>Checkboxes &amp; Radio Buttons</h3>
        <p>
          Labels for checkboxes and radio buttons are expected <em>after</em>
          the input element. This way, magick.css can ensure proper grouped
          spacing between them, without requiring additional wrappers and classes.
        </p>
        
        <label for="checkbox1">I am a checkbox.</label>
        
        <label for="checkbox2">I am disabled.</label>
        </section>

      <section id="media-and-figures">
        <h2>Media &amp; Figures</h2>
        <p>
          Media elements such as images and video can stand alone or be
          presented as a figure, giving structure and elegance to your content,
          and an opportunity to add context using a caption.
        </p>
        <h3>Standalone</h3>
        
        <p>
          Let&#39;s start with a standalone <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.
          It will not be stretched or distorted, but will be displayed at its
          natural size; as long as enough space is available:
        </p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=1" alt="an example, depicting a random subject"/>
        <h3>In a Figure</h3>
        <p>
          Using a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element, we can display the media
          element more prominently, and can also add a caption using a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=2" alt="an example, depicting a random subject"/>
          <figcaption>This is the figure caption, is usually provides context.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="code-quotes-and-preformatting">
        <h2>Code, Quotes and Preformatting</h2>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
          Displaying code can be done either inline or in a distinct block. To
          inline code, use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. For larger pieces of
          code, use <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> to wrap the
          <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. By the way, you can also use figures to
          display code snippets!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre><span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span><span>6</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>9</span></span><code>void fib(int x) {
    unsigned long a = 0, b = 1, c;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) {
        printf(&#34;%lu &#34;, a);
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
}</code></pre>
          <fibcaption>This C function generates numbers of the fibonacci sequence.</fibcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          (Line numbering of code requires some extra preprocessing of the
          content, but it is quite simple to do, even just by hand. Find out
          how in the <a href="#extras">Extras</a> section.)
        </p>

        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>
          For quotes, use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag. Depending on
          the content, you might want to use preformatted text or let the
          browser handle the formatting:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
          </p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Adding a citation is done using a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> inside
          the blockquote. Just look at the source code of this page to see how
          it&#39;s done!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&#39;s now consider a poem, where the formatting is imporant and can&#39;t be
          dynamically determined by the browser. In this case, we wrap the poem
          contents in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre><p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me— 
Yes!— that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
   And killing my Annabel Lee.</p></pre>
          
        </blockquote>
