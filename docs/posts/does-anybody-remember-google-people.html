Enough nuggets of internet history to to lend an air of nostalgia to an ageing (50+) netizen, liberally spiced with enough confection to make me doubt my memories of the period and contemplate (albeit just for a short while) if I was mis-remembering. As the denouement approached (and realisation dragged a slow grin across my face) I wasn&#39;t sure if I was rooting for the trapped phantasm, or the narrator, (or a guillotine by way of profile deletion...) I would only suggest (beg for) a slightly slower, longer reveal but that&#39;s just me being selfish and greedy. I want more. Looking forward to the rest of your work.

              <div>Hey I find this story really cool but I&#39;m curious, to what extent did you plan it out? Did you just hop online every so often and improvise a few more spooky tweets, or was each word planned from the start?
Did you contact people in advance and ask them to play along, or were they improvving too?</div>

              <div>I had plenty of notes and ideas, originating from an abortive first attempt to execute this on IRC instead. But most of the tweets were improvised, as you can tell from the occasional typo, particularly in the second tweet. Other people who participated were also improvising once they figured out what was going on, although I suspect one or two maybe didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t figure out that I could button it all down with a proper ending until around part 3 or 4.</div>
