If you know the distance between each wave — called the wavelength, literally the length of the wave — it&#39;s possible to use light &#34;as a very fine ruler&#34;, Dr Warrington says.</p><p>And in 1960, the platinum alloy bars were out and a new definition of the metre was introduced.</p><p>Pass an electrical current through a lamp filled with krypton gas and the krypton atoms throw off light, including a reddish orange wavelength.</p><figure data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="105302452" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/105302452"><div><div><div><p><img alt="A glass lamp filled with colourless gas." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/10c5741d368f78ed83f82607d1a9c52b?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=920&amp;cropW=690&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=76&amp;width=862&amp;height=1149" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div></div></div><figcaption><p data-component="Typography">Krypton-86 gas is odourless, colourless and exists in tiny quantities in the atmosphere.<!-- --> <cite>(<span>Supplied: National Institute of Standards and Technology Digital Collections, Gaithersburg, MD 20899</span>)</cite></p></figcaption></figure><p>One metre equalled 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of this specific reddish orange light.</p><p>Meanwhile, electronics fabrication kicked off and the scale of manufacturing shrunk to the incredibly tiny. Think transistors in a smartphone integrated circuit, which are only a few billionths of a metre wide.</p><p>&#34;So you need rulers that can check for and control the quality of that manufacturing at that level,&#34; Dr Warrington says — something the krypton lamp metre definition could not do.</p><p>Since 1960, there&#39;d been a lot of progress made on measuring time accurately with atomic clocks. Their &#34;ticking&#34; is produced by oscillations of radiation emitted when atoms are bathed in laser light.</p><p>And they can tick billions of times every second. This new ability to divvy up the second into increasingly tinier slices, coupled with a universal physical constant, the speed of light, redefined the metre.</p><p>From 1983, a metre was considered the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second (because light travels 299,792,458 metres per second).</p><p>This new definition incorporating time and the speed of light opened up new ways of measuring length, Dr Warrington says.</p><p>For instance, scientists use it to accurately measure Earth&#39;s distance to the Moon.</p><p>&#34;The Apollo astronauts left a kind of fancy mirror on the surface of the Moon, and to this day, you can still fire a laser at that reflector, and time the round trip for the light to go all the way to the Moon and back,&#34; Dr Warrington says.</p><p>&#34;And you can turn that into a very careful measurement of the distance between the Earth and the Moon.&#34;</p><p>These measurements show the Moon is slowly pulling away from Earth at around 3.8 centimetres each year.</p><figure data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="105302604" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/105302604"><div><div><div><p><img alt="A mirror lying on the grey, dusty surface of the Moon." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8b80acbfd1679deaaa9a9f97276c1d5b?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=1280&amp;cropW=1920&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=496&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div></div></div><figcaption><p data-component="Typography">Of the five reflecting panels on the Moon, two were delivered by Apollo 11 and 14 crews in 1969 and 1971, respectively.<!-- --> <cite>(<span>Supplied: NASA</span>)</cite></p></figcaption></figure><h2 data-component="Heading">Slow adoption of the metric system</h2><p>Even as the metre and other units of measurement were being redefined, it was up to each Metre Treaty signatory to adopt the metric system in their own time.</p><p>It took Australia more than 20 years after signing the Metre Treaty to officially adopt the metric system when the Metric Conversion Act was passed in 1970.</p><p>Other countries have been far slower to go metric.
