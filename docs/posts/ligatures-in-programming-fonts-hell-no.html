    <h1>Ligatures in programming fonts: hell no</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><p>Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts—a mis­guided trend I was hop­ing would col­lapse un­der its own il­logic. But it per­sists. Let me save you some <span>time—</span></p><p>Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts are a ter­ri­ble <span>idea.</span></p><p>And not be­cause I’m a purist or a grump. (Some days, but not to­day.) Pro­gram­ming code has spe­cial se­man­tic con­sid­er­a­tions. Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts are likely to ei­ther mis­rep­re­sent the mean­ing of the code, or cause mis­cues among read­ers. So in the end, even if they’re cute, the risk of er­ror isn’t worth <span>it.</span></p><p>First, what are lig­a­tures? <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/ligatures.html">Lig­a­tures</a> are spe­cial char­ac­ters in a font that com­bine two (or more) trou­ble­some char­ac­ters into one. For in­stance, in ser­ifed text faces, the low­er­case <em>f</em> of­ten col­lides with the low­er­case <em>i</em> and <em>l</em>. To fix this, the <em>fi</em> and <em>fl</em> are of­ten com­bined into a sin­gle shape (what pros would call a <em>glyph</em>).</p><table><tbody><tr><td><example-text><span><span><span>f</span><span>i</span> <span>f</span><span>j</span> <span>f</span><span>l</span><span> </span></span><em><span><span>f</span><span>f</span><span>i</span> <span>g</span><span>g</span> <span>g</span><span>y</span></span></em></span></example-text></td><td><example-caption>ok</example-caption></td></tr><tr><td><example-text><span><span><span>f</span><span>i</span> <span>f</span><span>j</span> <span>f</span><span>l</span><span> </span></span><em><span><span>f</span><span>f</span><span>i</span> <span>g</span><span>g</span> <span>g</span><span>y</span></span></em></span></example-text></td><td><example-caption>wrong</example-caption></td></tr><tr><td><example-text><span><span>fi fj fl </span><em><span>ffi gg gy</span></em></span></example-text></td><td><example-caption>right</example-caption></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In this type de­signer’s opin­ion, a good lig­a­ture doesn’t draw at­ten­tion to it­self: it sim­ply re­solves what­ever col­li­sion would’ve hap­pened. Ide­ally, you don’t even no­tice it’s there. Con­versely, this is why I loathe the <em>Th</em> lig­a­ture that is the de­fault in many Adobe fonts: it re­solves noth­ing, and al­ways draws at­ten­tion to <span>itself.</span></p><p>Lig­a­tures in pro­gram­ming fonts fol­low a sim­i­lar idea. But in­stead of fix­ing the odd trou­ble­some com­bi­na­tion, well-in­ten­tioned am­a­teur lig­a­tur­ists are adding dozens of new &amp; strange lig­a­tures. For in­stance, these come from <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code,</a> a heav­ily lig­a­tured spin­off of the open-source <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/">Fira <span>Mono.</span></a></p><p><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/fira-code.png"/></p><p>So what’s the prob­lem with pro­gram­ming <span>ligatures?</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>They con­tra­dict Uni­code.</strong> <a href="http://unicode.org/standard/standard.html">Uni­code</a> is a stan­dard­ized sys­tem—used by all mod­ern fonts—that iden­ti­fies each char­ac­ter uniquely. This way, soft­ware pro­grams don’t have to worry that things like the Greek let­ter <code>Δ</code> (= up­per­case Delta) might be stashed in some spe­cial place in the font. In­stead, Uni­code des­ig­nates a unique <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0394/">name and num­ber</a> for each char­ac­ter, called a <a href="http://unicode.org/glossary/#code_point"><em>code point</em>.</a> If you have a <code>Δ</code> in your font, you as­so­ciate it with its des­ig­nated Uni­code code point, which is <code>0x0394</code>. In ad­di­tion to al­pha­betic char­ac­ters, Uni­code as­signs code points to thou­sands of sym­bols (in­clud­ing <span>emoji).</span></p><p>The prob­lem? Many of the pro­gram­ming lig­a­tures shown above are eas­ily con­fused with ex­ist­ing Uni­code sym­bols. Sup­pose you’re look­ing at a code frag­ment that uses Uni­code char­ac­ters and see the sym­bol <code>≠</code>. Are you look­ing at a <code>!=</code> lig­a­ture that’s shaped like <code>≠</code>? Or the ac­tual <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2260/">Uni­code char­ac­ter <code>0x2260</code>,</a> which also looks like <code>≠</code>? The lig­a­ture in­tro­duces an am­bi­gu­ity that wasn’t there <span>before.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>They’re guar­an­teed to be wrong some­times.</strong> There are a lot of ways for a given se­quence of char­ac­ters, like <code>!=</code>, to end up in a source file. De­pend­ing on con­text, it doesn’t al­ways mean the same <span>thing.</span></p><p>The prob­lem is that lig­a­ture sub­sti­tu­tion is<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “dumb”</dquo-open-pull> in the sense that it only con­sid­ers whether cer­tain char­ac­ters ap­pear in a cer­tain or­der. It’s not aware of the se­man­tic con­text. There­fore, any global lig­a­ture sub­sti­tu­tion is guar­an­teed to be se­man­ti­cally wrong part of the <span>time.</span></p></li></ol><p>When we’re us­ing a ser­ifed text font in or­di­nary <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/body-text.html">body text</a>, we don’t have the same con­sid­er­a­tions. An <em>fi</em> lig­a­ture al­ways means <em>f</em> fol­lowed by <em>i</em>. In that case, lig­a­ture sub­sti­tu­tion that ig­nores con­text doesn’t change the <span>meaning.</span></p><p>Still, some ty­po­graphic trans­for­ma­tions in body text can be se­man­ti­cally wrong. For in­stance, <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/foot-and-inch-marks.html">foot and inch marks</a> are of­ten typed with the same char­ac­ters as quo­ta­tion marks. (See <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html">straight and curly quotes</a>.) But whereas quo­ta­tion marks want to be curly, foot and inch marks want to be straight (or slanted slightly to the up­per right). So if we ap­ply au­to­matic smart (aka curly) quotes, we have to be care­ful not to cap­ture foot and inch marks in the <span>transformation.</span></p><p>Does that mean pro­gram­mers can never have nice things? It’s to­tally fine to re­design in­di­vid­ual char­ac­ters to dis­tin­guish them from oth­ers. For in­stance, in <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html">Trip­li­cate,</a> I in­clude a spe­cial<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “Code”</dquo-open-pull> vari­ant that in­cludes re­designed ver­sions of cer­tain char­ac­ters that are eas­ily <span>confused.</span></p><p><code>`$te_fl{1234*567~890}</code> <example-caption>Reg­u­lar</example-caption></p><p>But in this case, the point is dis­am­bigua­tion: we don’t want the low­er­case <em>l</em> to look like the digit <em>1</em>, nor the zero to look like a cap <em>O</em>. Whereas lig­a­tures are go­ing the op­po­site di­rec­tion: mak­ing dis­tinct char­ac­ters ap­pear to be <span>others.</span></p><p>Bot­tom line: this isn’t a mat­ter of taste. In pro­gram­ming code, every char­ac­ter in the file has a spe­cial se­man­tic role to play. There­fore, any kind of<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “pret­ti­fy­ing”</dquo-open-pull> that makes one char­ac­ter look like an­other—in­clud­ing lig­a­tures—leads to a swamp of de­spair. If you don’t be­lieve me, try it for 10 or 15 <span>years.</span></p><p><sig>—Matthew But­t­er­ick</sig></p><div><p>by the way</p><ul><li><p>Yes, I do a <a href="https://beautifulracket.com">lot of <span>programming.</span></a></p></li><li><p><dquo-open-pull>“What</dquo-open-pull> do you mean, it’s not a mat­ter of taste? I like us­ing lig­a­tures when I code.” Great! In so many ways, I don’t care what you do in pri­vate. Al­though I pre­dict you will even­tu­ally burn your­self on this hot mess, my main con­cern is ty­pog­ra­phy that faces other hu­man be­ings. So if you’re prepar­ing your code for oth­ers to read—whether on screen or on pa­per—skip the lig­a­tures. Not least be­cause you won’t even know when they go wrong. See <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/trademark-and-copyright-symbols.html">trade­mark and copy­right sym­bols</a> for a re­lated cau­tion­ary <span>tale.</span></p></li><li><p>One in­spi­ra­tion for this piece was the La­TeX crowd, who would rou­tinely write me to in­sist their ty­pog­ra­phy was in­fal­li­ble. And yet. I kept see­ing La­TeX-pre­pared books that in­cor­rectly sub­sti­tuted curly quotes for back­ticks. For in­stance, the ex­am­ple be­low is from Kent Dy­b­vig, <em>The Scheme Pro­gram­ming Lan­guage</em>, 4th ed. In this chunk of Scheme code, the open­ing-quote marks are sup­posed to be back­ticks; the clos­ing-quote mark is sup­posed to be a sin­gle straight <span>quote:</span></p><p><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/dybvig.jpg"/></p><p><dquo-open-pull>“But</dquo-open-pull> code sam­ples like these aren’t really am­bigu­ous, be­cause every­one knows that you don’t type the curly quotes.” A sloppy ar­gu­ment, though it may be true for lan­guages that only ac­cept ASCII in­put. But many of to­day’s pro­gram­ming lan­guages (e.g., <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>) ac­cept UTF-8 in­put. In that case, curly quotes can le­git­i­mately be part of the in­put stream. So am­bi­gu­ity is a real pos­si­bil­ity. Same prob­lem with <span>ligatures.</span></p></li><li><p>The other in­spi­ra­tion for this piece were the peo­ple who re­peat­edly asked me when <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html">Trip­li­cate</a> would get lig­a­tures, Pow­er­line char­ac­ters, and so on. An­swer, as nicely as pos­si­ble: <span>never.</span></p></li></ul></div></div></div>
