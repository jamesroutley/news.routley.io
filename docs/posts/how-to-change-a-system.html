    <h1>How to Change a System</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

							<p>“Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless. That is because they are intrinsically systems problems – undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them.”</p>
<p>Systems are everywhere: natural systems, institutional systems, health systems, food systems, communities, corporations, families, schools, bodies, lives.</p>
<h3><b>2) Skills</b></h3>
<p>You could increase the repertoire of behaviours available to certain players. If the actors respond to the same stimuli with different behaviours, that’s a stronger kind of change. Probably more sustained too. If, instead of assaulting a spouse a stressed person goes for a walk, that makes a big change to their outcomes. If a decision-maker under pressure learns to collaborate with staff instead of making snap decisions alone, that would alter the outcomes.</p>
<h3><b>3) Add resources that increase an individual’s leverage or productivity</b></h3>
<p>Giving people resources can enable them to make changes that would otherwise be slow and impossible.</p>
<h3><b>4) Provide services</b></h3>
<p>Change requires time and lots of mental processing power. Busy, distracted people lack those things. The easiest way to enable those people to act is to do things for them. That’s what services are for.</p>
<h3><b>5) Provide buffers </b></h3>
<p>Potentially more useful than resourcing people to act is giving them sustained cash transfers, access to credit, time and expertise that’s free from expectations, that’s simply “in the bank”, literally redundant.</p>
<h3><b>6) Build/modify physical infrastructure, processes or products</b></h3>
<p>If you want people to bicycle, build a bikeway. Want them to save energy, give them motion-sensor switches. If you want to fight rural poverty, give African farmers a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=260&amp;v=zIDzBQ6meYY" target="_blank">money-making pump</a> they can fix themselves.</p>
<h3><b>7) Build timely feedback loops</b></h3>
<p>“Now we’re beginning to move from the physical part of the system to the information and control parts, where more leverage can be found.” wrote Donella.</p>
<h3><b>8) Inclusive decision-making</b></h3>
<p>Pope Francis<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/04/the-15-diseases-of-leadership-according-to-pope-francis" target="_blank"> recently wrote</a> about “The disease of closed circles”, where “belonging to a clique becomes more powerful than our shared identity. This disease too always begins with good intentions, but with the passing of time it enslaves its members and becomes a cancer which threatens the harmony of the organisation and causes immense evil, especially to those we treat as outsiders. [This] ‘Friendly fire’ from our fellow soldiers is the most insidious danger. It is the evil which strikes from within. As it says in the bible, ‘Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste.’”</p>
<h3><b>9) Create a community-of-practice</b></h3>
<p>How often we hear something like this:</p>
<h3><b>10) Accountability: creating “skin in the game” for decision-makers</b></h3>
<p>“There is a systematic tendency on the part of human beings to avoid accountability for their own decisions. That’s why there are so many missing feedback loops — and why this kind of leverage point is so often popular with the masses, unpopular with the powers that be.” wrote Donella.</p>
<h3><b>11) Level playing field (limit the gain to dominant actors)</b></h3>
<p>This is about combating runaway processes. It’s important because that’s how most systems fail: not by scarcity but by unequal distribution of success. Dominant actors use their superior leverage to rapidly accumulate resources, while others are excluded, and the whole system degenerates into disorder.</p>
<h3><b>13) Establish counterweights</b></h3>
<p>The reason marriage equality, climate change, overseas aid and indigenous issues get the attention of decision makers, and why public health doesn’t, is because they are organised. Public health, by comparison, “has been timid or mostly absent”, as one public health advocate recently complained.</p>
<h3><b>14) Change the rules</b></h3>
<p>Donella wrote, “The rules of the system define its scope, its boundaries, its degrees of freedom. Thou shalt not kill. Everyone has the right of free speech. Contracts are to be honoured. The president serves four-year terms and cannot serve more than two of them. Nine people on a team, you have to touch every base, three strikes and you’re out. If you get caught robbing a bank, you go to jail.”</p>
<h3><b>15) Build/defend institutions</b></h3>
<p>What predicts the prosperity of nations? According to Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail" target="_blank">Why Nations Fail</a>, the answer is “Institutions, institutions, institutions”. They meant that prosperous states are the result of effective institutions working without fear or favour for the common good, not captured by elites for their private enrichment.</p>
<h3><b>16) System innovation</b></h3>
<p>Systems that don’t evolve fade away, become irrelevant or noxious. Sustainability therefore requires continuous evolution, flexibility and adaptation.</p>
<ul>
<li>grow the diversity of actors and the density of their connections (i.e. social capital);</li>
<li>increase the stock of possibilities available (e.g. conserving genetic stocks and human cultures, multi-disciplinary projects, silo busting, bringing in outside voices);</li>
<li>create permission to innovate and resource the innovators.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most powerful innovations are new human relationships, especially between groups who haven’t worked together before, and new institutions.</p>
<h3> <b>17) Pivoting the purpose</b></h3>
<p>Pope Francis’s <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.pdf">Laudato si </a>encyclical is an attempt to change the purpose of the whole human system: the social agreement on what it’s all ultimately for.</p>
<h3><b>18) Change the mindset or paradigm behind the system</b></h3>
<p>Big, unstated assumptions govern all human affairs. Change those assumptions and everything else follows.</p>
<p>‘Every nation and every man instantly surround themselves with a material apparatus which exactly corresponds to … their state of thought. Observe how every truth and every error, each a thought of some man’s mind, clothes itself with societies, houses, cities, language, ceremonies, newspapers. Observe the ideas of the present day … see how timber, brick, lime, and stone have flown into convenient shape, obedient to the master idea reigning in the minds of many persons…. It follows, of course, that the least enlargement of ideas … would cause the most striking changes of external things.’</p>
<p>In Donella’s words: “The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated assumptions — unstated because unnecessary to state; everyone already knows them — constitute that society’s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about how the world works… Money measures something real and has real meaning (therefore people who are paid less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. One can “own” land. Those are just a few of the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture, all of which have utterly dumfounded other cultures, who thought them not the least bit obvious.”</p>
