        <h3>
          Can I use my virtual faces for commercial use?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. All images produced are released under the CreativeML Open RAIL-M license.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Is there a money back guarantee?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes if the processing didn&#39;t start or fail before completing. </p>

        <h3>
          Are my uploaded photos private?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. All your images are yours and we are deleting them 7 days after your processing.
          We are keeping them 7 days in case you lose the link to download them (contact us in that case).

        <h3>
          Can I generate variations of a rendering that I like?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. If you liked a style in particular feel free to order a new set of virtual faces
          with only your preferred styles.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Are you using my photos to train your AI model for other users?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No. Your photos are only used to train your own fine-tuned model. The fine-tuning takes a base model
          (in our case Stable Diffusion 1.5+) which is already trained on a large variety of images, then
          we leverage the Dreambooth paper written by Google Researchers to align the diffusion model on your
          face.
