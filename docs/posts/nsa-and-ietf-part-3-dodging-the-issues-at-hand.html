<h2>2025.11.23: NSA and IETF, part 3: <span>Dodging the issues at hand. #pqcrypto #hybrids #nsa #ietf #dodging</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html">Normal practice</a>
in deploying post-quantum cryptography is to deploy ECC+PQ.
IETF&#39;s TLS working group is standardizing ECC+PQ.
But IETF management is also non-consensually ramming a particular NSA-driven document
through the IETF process,
a &#34;non-hybrid&#34; document that adds <em>just PQ</em> as another TLS option.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry: we&#39;re standardizing cars with seatbelts.
Also, recognizing generous funding from the National Morgue Association,
we&#39;re going to standardize cars <em>without</em> seatbelts as another option,
ignoring the safety objections.
That&#39;s okay, right?</p>
<p>Last month I posted
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html">part 1</a>
of this story.
Today&#39;s
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251123-corruption.html">part 2</a>
highlighted the corruption.
This blog post, part 3,
highlights the dodging in a particular posting at the beginning of this month
by an IETF &#34;security area director&#34;.
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251123-scope.html">Part 4</a>
will give an example of how
dissent on this topic has been censored.</p>
<p><strong><a name="chairs"></a>Consensus means whatever the people in power want to do.</strong>
Recall from my previous blog post that
&#34;adoption&#34; of a document is a preliminary step
before an IETF &#34;working group&#34; works on, and decides whether to standardize, the document.
In April 2025,
the chairs of the IETF TLS WG called for &#34;adoption&#34; of this NSA-driven document.
During the call period,
20 people expressed unequivocal support for adoption,
2 people expressed conditional support for adoption,
and 7 people expressed unequivocal opposition to adoption.
(<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html#agreement">Details for verification.</a>)</p>
<p>The chairs
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html#chairs">claimed</a>
that &#34;we have consensus to adopt this draft&#34;.
I promptly
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.6">asked for explanation</a>.</p>
<p>Before the chairs could even reply,
an &#34;area director&#34;
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.7">interrupted</a>,
claiming, inter alia, the following:
&#34;There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions&#34;.</p>
<p>After these lies by the &#34;area director&#34; were
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10">debunked</a>,
the chairs said that they had declared consensus
&#34;because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft&#34;
specifically &#34;enough people willing to review the draft&#34;.</p>
<p>I can understand not everybody being familiar with
the specific definition of &#34;consensus&#34; that
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html#standards">antitrust law</a>
requires standards-development organizations to follow.
But it&#39;s astonishing to see chairs substituting a consensus-evaluation procedure
that simply ignores objections.</p>
<p><strong><a name="stonewalling"></a>Stonewalling.</strong>
The chairs said I could escalate.
IETF procedures say that an unresolved dispute can be brought
&#34;to the attention of the Area Director(s) for the area in which the Working Group is chartered&#34;,
and then &#34;The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute&#34;.</p>
<p>I filed a complaint with the &#34;security area directors&#34;
in <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250605-non-hybrid.pdf">early June 2025</a>.
One of them never replied.
The other,
the same one who had claimed that there was &#34;clearly consensus&#34;,
sent a <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.14">series of excuses</a>
for not handling the complaint.
For example, one excuse was that the PDF format &#34;discourages participation&#34;.</p>
<p>Do IETF procedures say &#34;The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute
unless the dispute is documented in a PDF&#34;?
No.</p>
<p>I sent email two days later
systematically addressing the excuses.
The &#34;area director&#34; never replied.</p>
<p>It isn&#39;t clear under IETF procedures whether a non-reply allows an appeal.
It is, however, clear that an appeal <em>can&#39;t</em> be filed after two months.
I escalated to the &#34;Internet Engineering Steering Group&#34; (IESG)
in <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf">August 2025</a>.</p>
<p>(These aren&#39;t even marginally independent groups.
The &#34;area directors&#34; are the IESG members.
IESG appoints the WG chairs.)</p>
<p>IESG didn&#39;t reply until October 2025.
It rejected one of the &#34;Area Director&#34; excuses for having ignored my complaint,
but endorsed another excuse.
I promptly filed a
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf">revised complaint</a>
with the &#34;area director&#34;,
jumping through the hoops that IESG had set.
There were then further
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251024-rules.pdf">runarounds</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="switch"></a>The switch.</strong>
Suddenly,
on 1 November 2025,
IESG publicly instructed the &#34;area director&#34; to address the following question:
&#34;Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?&#34;</p>
<p>The &#34;area director&#34; posted his conclusion mere hours later:
&#34;I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result
was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document&#34;.</p>
<p><strong><a name="dodging"></a>Dodging procedural objections.</strong>
Before looking at how the &#34;area director&#34; argued for this conclusion,
I&#39;d like to emphasize three things that the &#34;area director&#34; <em>didn&#39;t</em> do.</p>
<p>First,
did the &#34;area director&#34; address my <a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf">complaint</a>
about the chair action on this topic?
No.</p>
<p>One reason this matters is that
the law requires standards-development organizations to provide an
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html#standards">&#34;appeals process&#34;</a>.
Structurally,
the &#34;area director&#34; isn&#39;t quoting and answering the points in my complaint;
the &#34;area director&#34; puts the entire burden on the reader
to try to figure out what&#39;s supposedly answering what,
and to realize that many points remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Second,
did the &#34;area director&#34; address the chairs claiming that
&#34;we have consensus to adopt this draft&#34;?
Or the previous claim from the &#34;area director&#34;
that there was &#34;clearly consensus&#34;?
No.
Instead IESG and this &#34;area director&#34;
quietly shifted from &#34;consensus&#34; to &#34;rough consensus&#34;.
(Did you notice this shift when I quoted IESG&#39;s &#34;rough consensus&#34; instruction?)</p>
<p>One reason this matters is that
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html#standards">&#34;consensus&#34;</a>
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
The law doesn&#39;t allow &#34;rough consensus&#34;.
Also,
IETF claims that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">&#34;decision-making requires achieving broad consensus&#34;</a>.
&#34;broad consensus&#34; is even stronger than &#34;consensus&#34;,
since it&#39;s saying that there&#39;s consensus <em>in a broad group</em>.</p>
<p>Third,
the way that my complaint had established the
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.5">lack of consensus</a>
was, first, by reviewing the general definition of &#34;consensus&#34;
(which I paraphrased from the definition in the law, omitting a citation only because
the TLS chairs had threatened me with a
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251123-scope.html">list ban</a>
if I mentioned the law again),
and then applying the components of that definition to the situation at hand.
Did the area director follow this structure?
Here&#39;s the definition of &#34;consensus&#34;, or &#34;rough consensus&#34; if we&#39;re switching to that,
and now let&#39;s apply that definition?
No.
Nobody reading this message from the &#34;area director&#34; can figure out what the &#34;area director&#34; believes these words mean.</p>
<p>Wow, look at that:
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html#standards">&#34;due process&#34;</a>
is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.
Part of due process is simply <em>making clear what procedures are being applied</em>.
Could it possibly be that the people writing the law
were thinking through how standardization processes could be abused?</p>
<p><strong><a name="numbers"></a>Numbers.</strong>
Without further ado,
let&#39;s look at what the &#34;security area director&#34; did write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><SPAN color="#663319">
The IESG has requested that I evaluate the WG Adoption call
results for ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3
(draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement). Please see below.
</SPAN></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above,
IESG had instructed the &#34;area director&#34; to answer the following question:
&#34;Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the
TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?&#34;</p>
<p>Side note:
Given that the &#34;area director&#34; posted all of the following
on the same day that IESG instructed the &#34;area director&#34; to write this,
presumably this was all written in advance and coordinated with the rest of IESG.
I guess the real point of finally (on 1 November 2025) addressing the adoption decision (from 15 April 2025)
was to try to provide cover for the &#34;last call&#34; a few days later (5 November 2025).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><SPAN color="#663319">

</SPAN><p><SPAN color="#663319">I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result

</SPAN></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above,
the TLS WG chairs had claimed &#34;consensus&#34;,
and the &#34;area director&#34; had claimed that there was &#34;clearly consensus&#34;.
The &#34;area director&#34; is now quietly shifting to a weaker claim.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>These numbers are <em>much</em> closer to reality
than the &#34;area director&#34; previously writing
&#34;There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions&#34;.</p>
<p>Also, given that the &#34;area director&#34; is continually making claims that aren&#39;t true
(see examples below)
and seems generally allergic to providing evidence
(the text I&#39;m quoting below has, amazingly, <em>zero</em> URLs),
it&#39;s a relief to see the &#34;area director&#34; providing names to back up the claimed numbers here.</p>
<p>But somehow, even after being
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10">caught</a>
lying about the numbers before,
the &#34;area director&#34; still can&#39;t resist shading the numbers a bit.</p>
<p>The actual numbers were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.
Clearly 7 is close to 6, and 20+2 is close to 23, but, hmmm, not exactly.
Let&#39;s check the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How does the &#34;area director&#34; end up with 6 negative votes rather than 7?
  By falsely listing Thomas Bellebaum as &#34;ambivalent&#34;
  and falsely attributing a &#34;prefer not, but okay if we do&#34; position to Bellebaum.
  In fact,
  Bellbaum had
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250813164633/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/">written</a>
  &#34;I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids.&#34;
  (This was in reply to Stephen Farrell,
  who had written &#34;I&#39;m opposed to adoption, at this time.&#34;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the &#34;area director&#34; end up with 23 positive votes rather than 22?
  By falsely listing the document author (Deirdre Connolly) as having stated a pro-adoption position during the call.
  The &#34;area director&#34; seems generally clueless about conflict-of-interest issues
  and probably doesn&#39;t find it obvious that an author <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> vote,
  but the simple fact is that the author <em>didn&#39;t</em> vote.
  She

  during the call period;
  all of those messages are merely commenting on specific points,
  not casting a vote on the adoption question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The document author didn&#39;t object to the &#34;area director&#34; fudging the numbers.
Bellebaum did politely
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251123055459/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/FmhDavgLrGR2y920WWbM80yMge8/">object</a>;

beyond trying to save face with comments such as &#34;Thanks for the clarification&#34;.</p>
<p>More to the point,
the &#34;area director&#34; has never explained
whether or how the tallies of positive and negative votes
are supposed to be relevant to the &#34;rough consensus&#34; claim.
The &#34;area director&#34; also hasn&#39;t commented on IETF

<p>Okay,

<p>Wrong.
Anything+PQ, and in particular ECC+PQ,
complies with NIST&#39;s standards when the PQ part does.

For example, if the PQ part is ML-KEM as per FIPS 203,
then NIST allows ECC+PQ too.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t bother addressing the errors here,
since the bottom-line claim is orthogonal to the issue at hand.
The TLS WG already has an ECC+PQ document using NIST-approved PQ;
the question is whether to also have a document allowing the ECC seatbelt to be removed.</p>

<p>This is the closest that the &#34;area director&#34; comes to acknowledging the central security argument for ECC+PQ.
Of course, the &#34;area director&#34; spends as little time as possible on security.

<p>Hmmm.
By listing this as part of an &#34;opposed argument summary&#34;,
is the &#34;area director&#34; suggesting that this was disputed?
When and where was the dispute?</p>
<p>As noted above, I&#39;ve seen

<p>This comment about &#34;weight&#34; is revealing.
What we&#39;ll see again and again is that the &#34;area director&#34;
is expressing the weight that <em>he</em> places on each argument
(within the arguments selected and phrased by the &#34;area director&#34;),
i.e., the extent to which <em>he</em> is convinced or not convinced by those arguments.</p>
<p>Given that IESG has power under IETF rules to unilaterally block publications approved by WGs,
it&#39;s unsurprising that the &#34;area directors&#34;, in their roles as IESG members,
will end up evaluating the merits of WG-approved documents.
But <em>that isn&#39;t what this &#34;area director&#34; was instructed to do here</em>.
There isn&#39;t a WG-approved document at this point.
Instead the &#34;area director&#34; was instructed to evaluate whether the chairs &#34;appropriately&#34;
called &#34;rough consensus&#34; to &#34;adopt&#34; the document.
The &#34;area director&#34; is supposed to be evaluating procedurally what the WG decision-makers did.
Instead the &#34;area director&#34; is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of the document.</p>

<p>I think that the &#34;area director&#34; is trying to make some sort of claim here
about ML-KEM not having been attacked,
but the wording is so unclear as to be unevaluatable.

How about <a href="https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/">Clangover</a>?
How about the continuing advances in lattice attacks
that have already reduced ML-KEM below its claimed security targets,
the most recent news being from
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1910">last month</a>?</p>
<p>More importantly,
claiming that ML-KEM isn&#39;t &#34;known&#34; to have problems
is utterly failing to address the point of the ECC seatbelt.
It&#39;s like saying
&#34;This car hasn&#39;t crashed, so the absence of seatbelts isn&#39;t a basic flaw&#34;.</p>

<p>Here the &#34;area director&#34; is reasonably capturing
a statement from one document proponent
(original wording:
&#34;I find it
to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the quantum threat requires immediate work, and
yet we are also somehow uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true at the same time&#34;).</p>
<p>But I promptly
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251005085348/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">followed up</a>
explaining the error:
&#34;Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they&#39;re contradictory?&#34;</p>
<p>There was, of course, no reply at the time.
The &#34;area director&#34; now simply repeats the erroneous argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><SPAN color="#663319">
As TLS (or IETF) is not phasing out all non-hybrid classics,

</blockquote>
<p>&#34;Non-hybrid classics&#34; is weird terminology.
Sometimes pre-quantum algorithms (ECC, RSA, etc.) are called &#34;classical&#34;,
so I guess the claim here is that using just ECC in TLS isn&#39;t being phased out.
That&#39;s a bizarre claim.
There are intensive efforts to roll out ECC+PQ in TLS
to try to protect against quantum computers.

<p>The answer is that &#34;not recommended&#34; doesn&#39;t mean what you think it means:

<p>If someone is trying to argue for removing ECC,
there&#39;s a big difference between the plausible scenario of ECC having &#34;less&#34; value
and the extreme scenario of ECC having &#34;no&#34; value.
It&#39;s wrong for the &#34;area director&#34; to be conflating these possibilities.</p>
<p>As I put it
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">almost two years ago</a>:
&#34;Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys.
Yikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that!
We don&#39;t even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break <em>one</em> key!
Users who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography.
But are the users going to say &#39;Let&#39;s turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack&#39;?
I&#39;m skeptical.
I think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value.&#34;</p>
<p>Furthermore,
let&#39;s think for a moment about the idea
that one will eventually want to transition to <em>just ML-KEM</em>,
the specific proposal that the &#34;area director&#34; is portraying as the future.
Here are three ways that this can easily be wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe ML-KEM&#39;s implementation issues
  end up convincing the community to shift to a more robust option,
  analogously to what happened with <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">ECC</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the advances in public attacks continue to the point of breaking ML-KEM outright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the cliff stops crumbling and ML-KEM survives,
  but more efficient options also survive. 
  At this point there are quite a few options more efficient than ML-KEM.
  (Random example: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/739">SMAUG</a>.
  The current SMAUG software isn&#39;t as fast as the ML-KEM software,
  but this is outweighed by SMAUG using less network traffic than ML-KEM.)
  Probably some options will be broken,
  but ML-KEM would have to be remarkably lucky to end up as the most efficient remaining option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this &#34;area director&#34; think that all of the more efficient options are going to be broken, while ML-KEM won&#39;t?
Sounds absurdly overconfident.
More likely is that the &#34;area director&#34; doesn&#39;t even realize that there are more efficient options.
For anyone thinking &#34;presumably those newer options have received less scrutiny than ML-KEM&#34;:
we&#39;re talking about what to do long-term, remember?</p>
<p>Taking ML-KEM as the PQ component of ECC+PQ is working for getting something rolled out now.
Hopefully ML-KEM will turn out to not be a security disaster (or a patent disaster).
But, for guessing what will be best to do in 5 or 10 or 15 years,
picking ML-KEM is premature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><SPAN color="#663319">
When and where to exactly draw the line of still using a

<p>Here the &#34;area director&#34; is <em>clearly</em> attacking a strawman.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>How is rolling out PQ supposed to be gaining experience
that isn&#39;t gained from the current rollout of ECC+PQ?</p>
<p>Also, I think it&#39;s important to call out the word &#34;pure&#34; here
as incoherent, indefensible marketing.
What we&#39;re actually talking about isn&#39;t modifying ML-KEM in any way;
it&#39;s simply hashing the ML-KEM session key together with other inputs.
Is ML-KEM no longer &#34;pure&#34; when it&#39;s plugged into TLS,
which also hashes session keys?
(The word &#34;pure&#34; also showed up in a few of the earlier quotes.)</p>

maintenance.
</SPAN></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the &#34;area director&#34; is again
making the same mistake explained earlier:
ignoring the fact that ECC+PQ is already there,
and thus getting the complexity evaluation backwards.</p>
<p>The &#34;thus add risk&#34; logic is also wrong.
Again, all of these options are more complex than the null cipher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><SPAN color="#663319">

at least some complexity that is added by the hybrid solutions.
</SPAN></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, the details of how to combine ECC with PQ in TLS are already settled and deployed.</p>
<p>Looking beyond TLS:
Chempat hashes the transcript (similarly to TLS),
making it robust for a wide range of protocols.
The other options add fragility by hashing less for the sake of minor cost savings.
Each of these options is under 10 lines of code.
The &#34;area director&#34; exaggerates the complexity by mentioning &#34;extensive discussions&#34;,
and spends much more effort hyping this complexity as a risk
than acknowledging the risks of further PQ attacks.</p>
<p>Anyway,
it&#39;s not as if the presence of this document
has eliminated the discussions of ECC+PQ details,
nor is there any credible mechanism by which it could do so.
Again, the actual choice at hand is whether to have PQ as an option <em>alongside</em> ECC+PQ.
Adding that option <em>adds</em> complexity.
The &#34;area director&#34; is getting the complexity comparison backwards
by instead comparing
(1) PQ in isolation to (2) ECC+PQ in isolation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah, yes, &#34;known to consume&#34;!
There was, um,
one of those, uh, studies showing the details of, um, how implementors use RFCs,
which, uh, showed that 100% of the implementors diligently consumed the warnings in the RFCs.
Yeah, that&#39;s the ticket.
I&#39;m sure the URL for this study is sitting around here somewhere.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get back to the real world.
Even if an implementor does see a &#34;This document is a bad idea&#34; warning,
this simply doesn&#39;t matter
when the implementors are chasing contracts issued by purchasing managers
who simply care what&#39;s standardized and haven&#39;t seen the warning.</p>
<p>It&#39;s much smarter for the document to
(1) eliminate making the proposal that it&#39;s warning about
and (2) focus, starting in the title, on saying why such proposals are bad.
This makes people <em>more</em> likely to see the warning,
and at the same time it removes the core problem of the bad proposal being standardized.</p>

<p>Certainly there were competition-like aspects to the process.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250814213602/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Stephen Farrell</a>
that the &#34;area director&#34; isn&#39;t quoting or linking to:
&#34;I don&#39;t see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
   wouldn&#39;t leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
   we don&#39;t adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
   certainly arise&#34;.</p>
<p>After reading this objection,
you can see how the &#34;area director&#34; is sort of responding to it
by suggesting that everybody is following NIST
(i.e., that the &#34;certainly arise&#34; part is wrong).</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not true.
NIST&#39;s selections are controversial.
For example, ISO is
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20250423-mceliece.html">considering</a>
not just ML-KEM but also</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classic McEliece,
  where NIST has
  <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20250423-mceliece.html">said</a>
  it&#39;s waiting for ISO
  (&#34;After the ISO standardization process has been completed, NIST may consider developing a standard for Classic McEliece based on the ISO standard&#34;),
  and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FrodoKEM,
  which NIST
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221005222322/https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8413-upd1.pdf">said</a>
  &#34;will not be considered further for standardization&#34;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ISO is also now
<a href="https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/ntru/index.html">considering</a>
NTRU, where the
<a href="https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/ntru/index.html">advertisement</a>
includes &#34;All patents related to NTRU have expired&#34;
(very different from the ML-KEM situation).</p>
<p>BSI, which sets cryptographic standards for Germany,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251123095123/https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=9">recommends</a>
not just ML-KEM
but also FrodoKEM (which it describes as &#34;more conservative&#34; than ML-KEM)
and Classic McEliece (&#34;conservative and very thoroughly analysed&#34;).
Meanwhile China has called for
<a href="https://www.niccs.org.cn/en/">submissions</a>
of new post-quantum proposals for standardization.</p>
<p>I could keep going,
but this is enough evidence to show that Farrell&#39;s prediction was correct;
the &#34;area director&#34; is once again wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><SPAN color="#663319">
The use of MLKEM in the IETF will
not set a precedent for having to accept other nation state cryptography.
</SPAN></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how the &#34;area director&#34; is dodging Farrell&#39;s point.
If NSA can pressure the TLS WG into standardizing non-hybrid ML-KEM,
why can&#39;t China pressure the TLS WG into standardizing something China wants?
What criteria will IETF use to answer this question
without leaving the WG &#34;open to accusations of favouritism&#34;?
If you want people to believe that it isn&#39;t about the money
then you need a <em>really</em> convincing alternative story.</p>

<p>The chairs claimed that &#34;we have consensus to adopt this draft&#34;
(based on claiming that &#34;there were enough people willing to review the draft&#34;,
never mind the number of objections).
That claim is wrong.
The call for adoption failed to reach consensus.</p>
<p>The &#34;area director&#34; claimed that
&#34;There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions&#34;.
These statements still haven&#39;t been retracted;
they were and are outright lies about what happened.
Again, the
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-see-a-future-in-jj/20251004-weakened.html#agreement">actual tallies</a>
were
20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,
2 people conditionally supporting adoption,
and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.</p>
<p>Without admitting error,
the &#34;area director&#34; has retreated to a claim of &#34;rough consensus&#34;.
The mishmash of ad-hoc comments from the &#34;area director&#34;
certainly doesn&#39;t demonstrate any coherent meaning of &#34;rough consensus&#34;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s fascinating that IETF&#39;s
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">advertising to the public</a>
claims that IETF&#39;s &#34;decision-making requires achieving broad consensus&#34;,
but IETF&#39;s
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html">WG procedures</a>
allow controversial documents to be pushed through on the basis of &#34;rough consensus&#34;.
To be clear,
that&#39;s only if the &#34;area director&#34; approves of the documents,
as you can see from the same &#34;area director&#34;
issuing yet another mishmash of ad-hoc comments to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251004151803/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/41gkoA74Dr-6JZYNThfpjZD0BPM/">overturn</a>
a separate chair decision in September 2025.</p>
<p>You would think that the WG procedures would <em>define</em> &#34;rough consensus&#34;.
They don&#39;t.
All they say is that
&#34;51% of the working group does not qualify as &#39;rough consensus&#39; and 99% is better than rough&#34;,
not even making clear whether 51% of <em>voters</em> within a larger working group can qualify.
This leaves a vast range of ambiguous intermediate cases up to the people in power.</p><hr/><SPAN size="1"><b>Version:</b>
