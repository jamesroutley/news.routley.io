    <h1>BMW Makes Heated Seats an $18/Month Subscription Service – Again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BMW has toyed with charging <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/34547/bmw-is-planning-to-sell-heated-seats-and-more-as-a-subscription-no-really" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monthly subscriptions</a> for certain digital <a href="https://www.bmw.co.kr/ko/shop/ls/cp/connected-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#34;Connected Drive</a>&#34; options for a few years, testing the waters in different markets with different features. Korea is the latest market for subscription-based options, and customers can now pay monthly for physical options such as heated seats and a heated steering wheel. </p><p>As cynical as that might sound, Korean owners aren&#39;t forced to pay monthly for heated seats, or any of BMW&#39;s other available options, but monthly payments can be made to try those out. Heated seats, for instance, cost ₩24,000 (roughly $18) per month. But you can also pay for a year subscription ($176), a three-year subscription ($283), or you can buy the heated seats permanently ($406). </p><p>Some other options available with monthly or yearly subscriptions are a high beam assistant, BMW&#39;s Driving Assistance Plus software, a heated steering wheel, and an artificial noise generator to give electric cars like the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/42668/2022-bmw-i4-first-ride-review-a-fast-ev-thats-too-conventional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i4 M50 a sci-fi noise while driving</a>. Those will be available for different fees, and some can be added to a customer&#39;s car immediately via computer or smartphone.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p>There may be other avenues to enable the options, potentially. For something like heated seats, where the function is paywalled by software, I can easily see modders figuring out how to jailbreak the system and unlock the option for free. <a href="https://www.ross-tech.com/vag-com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Volkswagen owners</a> have done similar things to older VWs for more than a decade by using simple OBDII-based tools and laptops to unlock lighting modes and window functions, for instance. More recently, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/44365/2022-ford-maverick-hybrid-review-return-of-the-great-american-economy-car" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ford Maverick</a> owners learned they can unlock cruise control on entry-level Mavericks, simply by swapping out the steering wheel buttons and using some software.</p><p>So it isn&#39;t a stretch to assume BMW enthusiasts will figure out how to do the same thing for heated seats, heated steering wheels, and other options that the car already physically has equipped. </p><p><em>Got a tip?
