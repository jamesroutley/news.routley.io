    <h1>FDIC Takes over Silicon Valley Bank</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                        <h2>For Immediate Release</h2>

                        <p>WASHINGTON – Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed today by the
                            California
                            Department
                            of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance
                            Corporation (FDIC)
                            as receiver. To protect insured depositors, the FDIC created the Deposit Insurance National
                            Bank of Santa
                            Clara (DINB). At the time of closing, the FDIC as receiver immediately transferred to the
                            DINB all insured
                            deposits of Silicon Valley Bank. </p>

                        <p>All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday
                            morning,
                            March 13, 2023. The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next
                            week. Uninsured
                            depositors will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their
                            uninsured funds. As
                            the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to
                            uninsured
                            depositors.
                        </p>

                        <p>Silicon Valley Bank had 17 branches in California and Massachusetts. The main office and all
                            branches of
                            Silicon Valley Bank will reopen on Monday, March 13, 2023. The DINB will maintain Silicon
                            Valley Bank’s
                            normal business hours. Banking activities will resume no later than Monday, March 13,
                            including on-line
                            banking and other services. Silicon Valley Bank’s official checks will continue to
                            clear.
                            Under the
                            Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may create a DINB to ensure that customers have
                            continued access
                            to their insured funds.</p>

                        <p>As of December 31, 2022, Silicon Valley Bank had approximately $209.0 billion in total assets
                            and about
                            $175.4 billion in total deposits. At the time of closing, the amount of deposits in excess
                            of the
                            insurance limits was undetermined. The amount of uninsured deposits will be determined once
                            the FDIC
                            obtains additional information from the bank and customers.</p>

                        <p>Customers with accounts in excess of $250,000 should contact the FDIC toll–free at
                            1-866-799-0959.</p>

                        <p>The FDIC as receiver will retain all the assets from Silicon Valley Bank for later
                            disposition. Loan
                            customers should continue to make their payments as usual.
                        </p>

                        <p>Silicon Valley Bank is the first FDIC–insured institution to fail this year. The last
                            FDIC–insured
                            institution to close was Almena State Bank, Almena, Kansas, on October 23, 2020.</p>
