    <h1>Far Cry 1.34 source code (2006)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today was my first day at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=24c53dc56ddd7af575ff67d7fa1194c4">Recurse Center</a> as a participant in this year’s Summer 2 batch!</p>

<p>Most of the day was spent meeting a lot of really amazing people! 
I love the mix of shared and diverse interests and backgrounds we have in our batch!</p>

<p>Besides meeting people, I also started to get more familiar with the communication tools we’re using - namely <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a> and a shared virtual space called “Virtual RC” that reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.gather.town/">gather.town</a>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I spent a bit of time pairing and walking through some of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/moq/about/">Media over QUIC</a> code that I’ve been working on in Rust. 
I pulled in some updates from another contributor and swapped out my test video - replacing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pSHGD7F83c">Big Buck Bunny</a> with a short teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHOpb2fS-cM">Tears of Steel</a> (my preferred <a href="https://www.blender.org/about/studio/">Blender Foundation</a> test video). 
The crude feature implementation I’m working on wasn’t 100% functional yet, but it was certainly easier to see what parts of it did work with that shorter test video.</p>

<p>I have an ambitious goal to write at least a short blog post every day of RC.</p>

<p>Last night, I started looking into converting this site from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> and migrating to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> so I don’t have to keep maintaining the host that serves this site. I may work more on that tomorrow. 
For now, I’ve dusted off my Ruby dependency-management skills enough to get Jekyll running again so I can make this first post.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
