A win means the union, the Times Tech Guild, can begin negotiations for a contract with management.</p><p>“We’re just elated and really soaking in what this means, not only for us as tech workers at The Times and for The New York Times but also for the tech industry as a whole,” said Nozlee Samadzadeh, a senior software engineer. “I think this is going to be the start of a wave of organizing in the tech industry.”</p><p>Ms. Samadzadeh said the union was eager to bargain a contract around issues “similar to what the newsroom unit has been fighting for — issues around pay, diversity and equity, a strong contract to make our workplace more fair.”</p></div></div><div><div><p>Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said The Times looked forward to working with the union to establish a contract.</p><p>“We continue to believe this election process was critical so our colleagues could learn more about the union, hear both sides of the argument and, ultimately, make an informed decision,” she said.</p><p>The Times Tech Guild, which represents about 600 software engineers, product managers, designers, data analysts and other workers, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/media/new-york-times-tech-workers-form-a-union.html" title="">asked</a> The Times for voluntary recognition in April. The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/business/media/new-york-times-tech-workers-union.html" title="">declined</a>, so the matter went to a formal election through the labor board.</p><p>The labor board alleged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/media/times-tech-guild-nlrb.html" title="">in a complaint</a> in January that The Times’s management had violated federal workplace law by preventing some employees from showing support for the union. A Times spokeswoman said at the time that the company disagreed with the allegations.</p><p>The Times Tech Guild is represented by the NewsGuild of New York, which also represents editorial workers at The New York Times and at Wirecutter, the company’s product-review website. In 2019, The Times <a href="https://newsguild.org/wirecutter-workers-win-union-recognition/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voluntarily recognized</a> the Wirecutter union.</p></div></div><div><p>The group is the biggest tech union with bargaining rights in America. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html" title="">Hundreds of Google employees announced a union</a> in January 2021, but it is not registered with the N.L.R.B. and cannot engage in collective bargaining.</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
