<p>I’m happy to announce the release of a new tvOS app called <em>Blank</em>. It turns your screen black and keeps it that way until you press any button on a remote. Seriously, that’s all it does. Here’s the screen you see when you launch the app for the first time:</p>

<p>That second paragraph hints at why this is important, despite the app’s simplicity.</p>



<h3>Sleeping Well</h3>



<p>As you get older, a good night’s sleep becomes harder to achieve. One thing that works well for my wife and me is to lower light levels before bedtime.</p>



<p>There has been scientific evidence of this since early in the last decade. Bright light can change your <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/light-and-sleep">circadian rhythm</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110113082716.htm">affect melatonin production</a>, which can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047226/">“potentially impact sleep, thermoregulation, blood pressure, and glucose homeostasis.”</a>. </p>



<p>A big ass screen in the living room makes this hard to achieve. If you want to listen to music or a podcast before going to bed, it’s impossible to avoid a bright now playing screen or animated screen saver.</p>



<p>So I wrote <em>Blank</em> as a way to address this problem. Of course, it’s FREE so people besides me and my wife can benefit from it.</p>



<h3>New &amp; Improved</h3>



<p>The first version I submitted didn’t meet Guideline 4.2 for “Design – Minimum Functionality”. Understandable, because this app was basically the “anti-flashlight” and we all know how that played out.</p>



<p>I took this initial rejection in stride and started working on an update that added some minimal functionality.</p>



<p>When you launch the app, or press any button on the remote, you get a screen with an inspirational quote. After you’ve had time to read it, the message disappears, and the screen goes black. It’s a nice addition and folks who are using the app love it.</p>



<p>I’m glad I did this extra work, and it’s a case where App Review helps a developer improve their product. Here’s what the quote screen looks like:</p>



<figure><img src="https://furbo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blank_Quote.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>After some back-and-forth with App Review, the app was approved with these changes. Yay!</p>



<h3>But That’s Not All!</h3>



<p>An additional benefit became apparent after we started using <em>Blank</em>: it significantly lowers the energy consumption of the screen.</p>



<p>All modern TVs have circuits that detect a blank signal and turn off LEDs to reduce the power required by the device. If you’ve ever felt heat coming off your big screen, <em>Blank</em> makes that go away.</p>



<p>So besides improving your sleep, you’re also helping out our ever warming planet.</p>



<h3>There Is None More Black</h3>



<p>So there you have it: another addition to our ever growing list of <a href="https://apps.iconfactory.com/#little_apps">“little apps”</a>. Just open up the App Store on your Apple TV, search for Blank, and click to<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blank-tv/id1550519498"> download</a> the app for FREE.</p>



<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSkGtW-fQ3s">Simple, beautiful, classic.</a> Enjoy!</p>
