<li>i actually remembered to post this on a monday, what a turn up for the history books.</li>
<li>passed my life in the uk test first time so operation british citizenship is full steam ahead! so excited.</li>
<li>watched <em>i saw the tv glow</em> at the cinema. i was not blown away but i was glad about that. <em>&#34;without courage all other virtues are meaningless&#34;</em> indeed.
<img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/oluonline-1722284878.jpeg" alt="A frame from i saw the tv glow. owen is walking down a high school hallway. a poster on the wall reads &#34;without courage, all other virtues are meaningless&#34; and over the entire scene in pink are the words &#34;isabel and tara are like family to me&#34;"/></li>
<li>cos of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a> discussion boards i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/integrate-rest-into-your-work-and-practice/?utm_source=atom&amp;utm_medium=feed">rest</a>, permacomputing and digital estate planning (as in &#34;what happens to my digital life and assets after i die?&#34;) again. no conclusions yet other than the latter two seem very hard and rest is very important (and it&#39;s hard to internalise that).</li>
<li>been thinking a lot about <a href="https://olu.online/how-im-leveling-up-technically-as-a-self-taught-software-developer/">leveling up as a software developer</a>; i started going through <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com">teach yourself cs</a> and i needed more maths than anticipated to make progress in the stated order. i don&#39;t think I&#39;m incapable of learning the pre-requisite maths - i did well at GCSE and was very ill during ib so didn&#39;t give it the old college try lol - I just think I need more human guidance on how the hell to catch up when it&#39;s often notation and wording tripping me up. googling &#34;what&#39;s that weird s&#34; won&#39;t bring up an explanation I understand so it&#39;s a challenge lol. i&#39;ve started looking at a new platform called <a href="https://www.0de5.net/">0de5</a> and learning some c is on the agenda now, so we&#39;ll see how we go!</li>
<li>really want some more technical mentorship with CSS and frontend architecture stuff but I should probably keep going with snapback (my habit app) and see what I can learn on my own for now. i feel like i can ask recurse some of the questions and I have <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/">css for js devs</a> to go through so should probably finish that before bothering people! I really enjoyed wizard zines <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/css/">css zine</a> too (i love all their zines, not going to lie).</li>
<li>gonna start posting more drafts over on <a href="https://notes.olu.online">my notes site</a>, the latest one is on <a href="https://notes.olu.online/disconnected---the-Marubo-people-are-online">the weird headlines about an &#39;uncontacted tribe&#39; getting Starlink</a>; very much in draft state but I&#39;d love opinions!</li>
