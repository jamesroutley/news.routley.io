      <span>Abstract:</span>  This paper explores Null Island, a fictional place located at 0$^\circ$
latitude and 0$^\circ$ longitude in the WGS84 geographic coordinate system.
Null Island is erroneously associated with large amounts of geographic data in
a wide variety of location-based services, place databases, social media and
web-based maps. While it was originally considered a joke within the geospatial
community, this article will demonstrate implications of its existence, both
technological and social in nature, promoting Null Island as a fundamental
issue of geographic information that requires more widespread awareness. The
article summarizes error sources that lead to data being associated with Null
Island. We identify four evolutionary phases which help explain how this
fictional place evolved and established itself as an entity reaching beyond the
geospatial profession to the point of being discovered by the visual arts and
the general population. After providing an accurate account of data that can be
found at (0, 0), geospatial, technological and social implications of Null
Island are discussed. Guidelines to avoid misplacing data to Null Island are
provided. Since data will likely continue to appear at this location, our
contribution is aimed at both GIScientists and the general population to
promote awareness of this error source.
