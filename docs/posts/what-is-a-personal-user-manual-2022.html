<p><em>“What happens to our culture if everyone is working from home?” </em></p>



<p><em>“But we’ll lose all of our culture if we don’t come back to the office.” </em></p>



<p>When we talk with executives about how they’re adapting to <a href="https://futureforum.com/pulse-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flexible work</a>, “culture” often comes up as a top-of-mind concern. The perception seems to be that people can only create and sustain culture when working together in person and face to face.</p>



<p>Of course, that isn’t true. While it’s difficult to measure something as intangible and ineffable as culture, <a href="https://futureforum.com/pulse-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data from the Future Forum Pulse</a> consistently shows that employee experience and sentiment is not wholly dependent on spending time together in the office. In fact, remote and hybrid employees (particularly <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/02/16/employee-experience-scores-are-rising-for-people-of-color" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black and Hispanic/Latinx respondents</a>) score higher than full-time office workers on all elements of the employee experience, including on culture-adjacent measures like sense of belonging at work and value of relationships with coworkers.</p>

<p>As companies adopt more flexible work models, leaders have an opportunity to build in intentional ways to foster trust and connection—key ingredients to culture. One way to get started is through creating and sharing Personal User Manuals (also known as Personal Operating Manuals).</p>



<div><div>
<h2 id="personal-user-manuals-defined"><strong><strong><em><strong><em>Personal User Manuals, defined</em></strong></em></strong></strong></h2>







<p><em><em>Personal User Manuals (also known as “Personal Operating Manuals”) are short descriptions of your background, values, and communication style. All team members should complete and exchange a Personal User Manual to help teammates better understand each other.</em> </em></p>



<p><em>Personal User Manuals complement other tools, like <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/06/23/team-level-agreements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team-level agreements</a>, by providing a means for each person to explicitly communicate to their team how they work and what works best for them in a flexible environment.</em></p>
</div></div>



<p>Every person has their own communication style: different ways they “intake” information, feedback, or requests. Being explicit and up front about what works best for each individual can help teams develop norms that support varying communication styles, reducing frustrations or misunderstandings early and fostering trust between colleagues.</p>



<h2 id="benefits-of-personal-user-manuals"><strong>Benefits of Personal User Manuals</strong></h2>







<p>Personal User Manuals  can shorten the learning curve for new employees joining a team. As such, leaders have found it useful to incorporate them into their team onboarding processes or team <a href="https://futureforum.com/2021/01/15/consider-changing-up-your-team-offsite-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offsites</a>. When used appropriately (often as a seeder for more in-depth, live conversations with teammates), a Personal User Manual can help a team to:</p>



<ul><li>Build psychological safety</li><li>Improve communication</li><li>Provide insight to individual motivations</li><li>Avoid misunderstandings.</li><li>Foster empathy </li><li>Improve collaboration</li></ul>



<p>Just the act of creating a Personal User Manual can help build the kind of self-awareness that Dawn Sharifan, Coach, Leader and former Head of People at Slack, considers an essential management trait.</p>

<h3 id="follow-the-leader"><strong>Follow the leader</strong></h3>



<p>Revealing personal details in a Personal User Manual can feel quite vulnerable or even uncomfortable, particularly for new employees who are still building their confidence and finding their place on a team. So we recommend that the team leader be the first to complete a Personal User Manual, to model open communication and demonstrate that it’s okay and encouraged to bring your whole self to the workplace.</p>



<h3 id="make-time-for-live-discussion"><strong>Make time for live discussion</strong></h3>



<p>Treat<strong> </strong>Personal User Manuals as a jumping off point for discussion. Make time to answer any questions or address any concerns that your employees may have before they begin the process of drafting their manual, and be sure to review and discuss as a team, encouraging compassion and empathy.</p>



<div><div>
<h3 id="what-to-include-in-your-personal-user-manual"><strong>What to include in your Personal User Manual</strong></h3>







<p><em>Personal User Manuals are most effective when they are short, succinct, and scannable. Ideally they should fit on a single page and the text should be active and engaging, including topics like:</em></p>



<ul><li>My work style</li><li>What I value</li><li>How to best communicate with me</li><li>What people misunderstand about me</li><li>What I don’t have patience for</li><li>How to help me</li></ul>



<h3 id="a-few-different-examples-of-how-to-best-communicate-with-me"><strong>A few different examples of “how to best communicate with me”</strong></h3>







<ul><li>“Content over format (and formality). I am a sponge. I’ll take more content earlier rather than a formal presentation, and will always be glad to give feedback on early thinking”</li><li>“Bad news travels faster than good news. Please give me the bad news before I hear it from somewhere else. I would rather hear tough feedback directly.”</li><li>“Audio-only where possible for meetings; video is just extra draining for me.”</li><li>“Be direct. Tell me what you need and when you need it.”</li></ul>



<p>You’ll note that the details under each topic can range from broad like “content over formality” to tactical like “audio-only for meetings” and often any single person’s operating manual will have a mixture of both.</p>

<p>The template below, created by the Organizational Effectiveness team at Slack, offers a starting point to customize for your team or organization. The template includes essential topics about how you work with others. More importantly, it aims to push you and others to be more open and vulnerable about your needs and foster deeper connections with your team.</p>

<p>A number of companies and leaders have embraced Personal User Manuals as a way to foster compassion and empathy across teams.
