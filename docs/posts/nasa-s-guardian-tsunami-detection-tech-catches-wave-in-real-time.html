    <h1>NASA&#39;s Guardian Tsunami Detection Tech Catches Wave in Real Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><!--[--><div><p data-block-key="fa7pg">Near-real-time outputs from GUARDIAN must be interpreted by experts trained to identify the signs of tsunamis. But already it’s one of the fastest monitoring tools of its kind: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-022-01365-6">Within about 10 minutes</a> of receiving data, it can produce a snapshot of a tsunami’s rumble reaching the upper atmosphere.</p><p data-block-key="4bvjg">The goal of GUARDIAN is to augment existing early warning systems. A key question after a major undersea earthquake is whether a tsunami was generated. Today, forecasters use seismic data as a proxy to predict if and where a tsunami could occur, and they rely on sea-based instruments to confirm that a tsunami is passing by. Deep-ocean pressure sensors remain the gold standard when it comes to sizing up waves, but they are expensive and sparse in locations.</p><p data-block-key="an1sv">“NASA’s GUARDIAN can help fill the gaps,” said Christopher Moore, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Tsunami Research. “It provides one more piece of information, one more valuable data point, that can help us determine, yes, we need to make the call to evacuate.”</p></div><!--]--></div></div><div><div><!--[--><div><p data-block-key="a0hro">While GNSS processing methods on Earth correct for such distortions, GUARDIAN uses them as clues.</p><p data-block-key="o200">The software scours a trove of data transmitted to more than 350 continuously operating GNSS ground stations around the world. It can potentially identify evidence of a tsunami up to about 745 miles (1,200 kilometers) from a given station. In ideal situations, vulnerable coastal communities near a GNSS station could know when a tsunami was heading their way and authorities would have as much as 1 hour and 20 minutes to evacuate the low-lying areas, thereby saving countless lives and property.</p><p data-block-key="2t9d5">Key to this effort is the network of GNSS stations around the world supported by <a href="https://space-geodesy.nasa.gov/">NASA’s Space Geodesy Project</a> and Global GNSS Network, as well as JPL’s Global Differential GPS network that transmits the data in real time.</p><p data-block-key="ardk">The Kamchatka event offered a timely case study for GUARDIAN. A day before the quake off Russia’s northeast coast, the team had deployed two new elements that were years in the making: an artificial intelligence to mine signals of interest and an accompanying prototype messaging system.</p><p data-block-key="b3toh">Both were put to the test when one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/us-french-swot-satellite-measures-tsunami-after-massive-quake/">spawned a tsunami</a> traveling hundreds of miles per hour across the Pacific Ocean. Having been trained to spot the kinds of atmospheric distortions caused by a tsunami, GUARDIAN flagged the signals for human review and notified subscribed subject matter experts.</p><p data-block-key="9tqme">Notably, tsunamis are most often caused by large undersea earthquakes, but not always. Volcanic eruptions, underwater landslides, and certain weather conditions in some geographic locations can all produce dangerous waves. An advantage of GUARDIAN is that it doesn’t require information on what caused a tsunami; rather, it can detect that one was generated and then can alert the authorities to help minimize the loss of life and property.</p><p data-block-key="elms7">While there’s no silver bullet to stop a tsunami from making landfall, “GUARDIAN has real potential to help by providing open access to this data,” said Adrienne Moseley, co-director of the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre. “Tsunamis don’t respect national boundaries. We need to be able to share data around the whole region to be able to make assessments about the threat for all exposed coastlines.”</p><p data-block-key="5gr02">To learn more about GUARDIAN, visit:</p><p data-block-key="77s85"><a href="https://guardian.jpl.nasa.gov/"><b>https://guardian.jpl.nasa.gov</b></a></p></div><!--]--></div></div></div>
