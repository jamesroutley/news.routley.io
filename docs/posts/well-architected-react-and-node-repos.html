    <h1>Ask HN: Well architected React and Node repos?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Does anyone have examples of what you consider to be well-architected react / node apps? Or just individual patterns you really like? I’m thinking about things like:
- folder structure and naming
- component breakdown and composition
- routing patterns (front end and backend)
- error handling
- custom hook abstractions
- protected routes / auth enforcement</p><p>For background: We’ve been building a number of SPA apps at work on a React / Vite / Fastify / tRPC stack and although I love the flexibility and devEx, I’ve found that it’s causing a certain amount of bikeshedding and ad-hoc architectural patterns to form, especially when we build similar features in parallel, so I’m curious how everyone else is leveling up their architectural sensibilities?</p></div></div></div>
