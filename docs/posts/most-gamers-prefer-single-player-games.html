    <h1>Most gamers prefer single-player games</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>It’s no secret that the bulk of <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/in-game-cosmetics-remain-a-huge-opportunity-for-brands-across-music-tv-sports-and-fashion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAA games market revenues come from in-game purchases</a>, mostly from live-service games. </p>
<p>It’s also impossible to ignore that the live-service market is fiercely competitive. Thanks to the oversaturated attention economy, only so many consumer hours are available. </p>
<p>And live-service games suck up <i>so much</i> attention and engagement. There are still opportunities in the space, but breaking through is extremely challenging.</p>
<p>With every new live-service hit that does manage to carve a spot for itself, there is less space available for new entrants to cast their net. </p>
<p>AAA developers on console and PC are continuing to chase the live-service jackpot, but single player remains the favourite way to play for most (53%) gamers. </p>
<p>There is also less risk, as there are more openings on the calendar for single player to stand out versus live service’s always-on engagement vacuum.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MIDiA&#39;s latest gaming report</a> looks at the growing viability of(re)allocating resources towards single-player games. </p>
<p>We zoom in on gameplay preferences by platform and age, motivators for trying new games, preferred game themes for puzzle, action-adventure, sports, shooter, and RPG fans, and offer data-backed strategic recommendations. </p>
<p>This article shines the spotlight on some high-level takeaways from the first section of the report. If you’re ready to dive deeper, <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let us know</a>.</p>
<p><b>Several single-player studios were pushed into making live-service games – the trend chasing did NOT pay off</b></p>
<p>Many AAA game makers have been chasing the live-service trend, looking to replicate the success of <i>Fortnite</i>, <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>Roblox</i>, and other success stories. </p>
<p>Even developers that rose to prominence thanks to single-player – with games that helped put their publishers on the map – were pushed to chase the live-service trend.  </p>
<p>For many, it was a wild goose chase, and the list of failures is growing. SEGA cancelled Creative Assembly’s <i>Hyenas</i> and PlayStation did the same thing for Naughty Dog’s <i>The Last of Us Online</i> after years of development. </p>
<p>Other revered single-player names in the industry have tried their hand at live services – with dire results: Crystal Dynamics (<i>Marvel’s Avengers</i>), EA’s BioWare (<i>Anthem</i>), Platinum Games (<i>Babylon’s Fall</i>), and Microsoft’s Arkane (<i>Redfall</i>) – the list goes on.  </p>
<p>This underlines an undeniable opportunity cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>These studios’ single-player offerings have respectively generated hundreds of millions in revenue</li>
<li>How much revenue and positive consumer sentiment was left on the table because these companies were pushed to make live-service games?</li>
<li>Aggravating things, the market is too delicate for most publishers to take huge risks in an oversaturated space</li>
</ul>
<p>Hitting a few singles and doubles beats trying to hit a home run and striking out.</p>
<p>The timing of live service’s oversaturation is not ideal. Publishers now need to cut costs to adapt to a challenging macroeconomic climate (and to course correct from overextending during the pandemic). </p>
<p><b>There&#39;s a way forward for these studios: returning to what has always worked, single-player games </b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/concord-postmortem-what-went-wrong-and-whats-next-for-playstations-live-service-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">While new live-service games have floundered</a>, new single-player games have continued to smash records and generate hundreds of millions – or more.  And it is not just juggernaut IP like <i>Zelda</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i> proving successful but also new franchises like <i>Elden Ring </i>(25 million copies sold) and <i>Black Myth Wukong </i>(20 million).</p>
<p>While live-service games and in-game purchases dominate spending and attention in the games market, over half of gamers prefer solo play: </p>
<p><img src="https://www.midiaresearch.com/storage/uploads/paragraphs/dbdbaba91de72cd615d8be1a0119cfca" alt="dbdbaba91de72cd615d8be1a0119cfca"/></p>
<p>There are some caveats to this opportunity and how best to seize it. Data from the above image, which you can dive deeper into via the <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full single-player opportunity report</a>, underlines a positive correlation between age and preferring single-player: </p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond younger generations’ higher emphasis on social play, life starts getting busier in the mid-20s</li>
<li>Life commitments make it trickier to play live-service games regularly, and co-ordinating sessions with friends becomes more challenging</li>
<li>To that end, the 25+ gamers are the lowest-hanging fruit to target with single-player games</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The one-and-done nature of single-player gels better with the saturated attention economy</b></p>
<p>Younger players prefer PVP, which captures a large swathe of consumer attention and engagement and is enjoyed by all generations. Convincing players – and their friends – to leave for new titles is a huge barrier. </p>
<p>Live-service games are the <i>homes</i> of many highly engaged players. Getting them (and their friends) to relocate permanently to another live-service game is a big ask.</p>
<p>Yet, going &#39;on holiday’ to a single-player game is more viable. Releasing in quieter periods for the big live-service games, like towards the latter part of the live-service seasons, could be beneficial here. </p>
<p>It is also easier for busier 25+ gamers to dip into a single-player game – perhaps even on a <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/steam-is-the-unlikely-winner-of-the-modern-console-wars-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supporting device like the Steam Deck</a> or PlayStation Portal. </p>
<p><b>Single-player games are a safer bet for new games</b></p>
<p>Make no mistake: the costs to make AAA single-player, non-live service games have inflated to astronomic levels. Leaks from Insomniac showed that PlayStation’s AAA flagship games, like <i>Spider-Man 2, </i>have budgets in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But there is a growing <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/gamers-arent-finishing-games-and-thats-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity for AAA studios to make leaner single-player games</a>. </p>
<p>Despite the extra risk, live-service games can be even more expensive. After launch, they also need significant additional costs to run over time (and keep their players coming back to spend). <i>Genshin Impact</i>’s budget was $100 million, with another $200 million <i>per year</i> needed for live-ops costs. </p>
<p>For many AAA publishers making new games, it might be time to course-correct from the red live-service ocean to the bluer single-player one – or at least shift some more resources to solo experiences. </p>
<p>The insights in this article are the tip of the iceberg of the <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges">full report</a>, which also looks at what exactly gamers are looking for in new games, what drives them to purchase, low-hanging fruit for publishers, and more. </p>
