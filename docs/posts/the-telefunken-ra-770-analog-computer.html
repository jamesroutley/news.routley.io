        On November 14th, 2007, a dream back from days of childhood came true,
        when I became the very, very happy and proud owner of a wonderful
        Telefunken RA 770 analog computer which can be seen after restoring 
        and repair in the picture above. The RA 770 is, in my opinion, the 
        finest analog computer ever made by any manufacturer - it is 
        a high precision analog computer (10^-4) in the very best tradition of
        Telefunken which can be seen in every detail of the system.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank Mr. Flaskamp from the 
        <a href="http://www.fzk-juelich.de" target="_blank">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>
        who saved this wonderful machine from scrap and gave me a phone call 
        asking if I were interested in the system. Without his invaluable
        support the system would have been scrapped. Also, I would like to 
        thank Mr. Fiss from the Bundesfinanzministerium for his help with some
        formal aspects.
       </p>
       <p>
        On November 14th, 2007, my beloved wife 
        <a href="http://www.veganwelt.de" target="_blank">Rikka</a> and I were on our way 
        with a truck to Jülich to get the machine. Mr. Flaskamp and his
        coworkers did a grand job in loading the rather heavy system which was
        partially dismantled in our truck (the system weighs about 550 kg).

        The picture on the left shows the nearly empty main frame of the 
        RA 770 after it arrived at home (without the help of my friends
        <a href="http://www.innenrin.de" target="_blank">Joachim Wagner</a>, Dr. Christian
        Kaminski and, of course <a href="http://www.veganwelt.de" target="_blank">Rikka</a>
        it would not have been possible to get the frame into the house.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to transporting the system we removed all drawers as well as
        all printed circuit cards and cabling as far as possible to get the
        weight of the frame down and to minimize the risk of damaging 
        something during the transport.

        On the right, the subframe UBE 770 can be seen - normally it is 
        located on the lower left of the main frame and houses two to three
        extension drawers containing function generators, non linear networks
        and the like. This frame has been removed, too, to facilitate the 
        transport of the system.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was obvious that quite some mice have been living in the system
        when we looked at the UBE 770 in more detail. There was an incredible
        amount of dirt covering all and everything and it became clear that
        the first action to be taken was to clean every single part of the 
        system thoroughly and then inspect it for damage due to its 
        inhabitants.

        The result of the first cleaning efforts can be seen on the left -
        we were afraid that this might only be the beginning of a rather
        disgusting work dealing with incredible amounts of mice droppings
        and the like and we were right.

        The picture on the right shows the first impression we had after
        removing the top panels from the machine. Nearly everything was
        covered with mice droppings and felt sticky and smelled rather bad
        to say the least.

        The true amount of the problem became obvious at the central relais
        frame which is located in the middle of the machine and contains
        a variety of control relays for the overall operation of the system.
       </p>
       <p>
        It turned out that the mice droppings were not easily removed since
        they were quite sticky and left a disgusting residue on everything 
        they were placed on, so I began to pick them one after the other with
        tooth picks out of the circuitry. After this I would clean the area
        with detergents.

        Unfortunately the mice had found that the insulation of the wiring
        of the machine tasted good and started to chew through some wires 
        which can be seen in the picture on the right.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately all of the wires which were cut through were easily 
        replaced since the mice were kind enough to let some traces of 
        both ends of the wires intact so with a bit of guessing and the 
        occasional help of the fantastic circuit schematics from Telefunken
        it was just a matter of time to fix the damages done by the mice.

        One of the most time consuming (and most disgusting) problems is
        shown in the picture on the left. These are the card guiding slides 
        which were frequently used by the mice to, ... To resolve this 
        problem the card cages had to be completely dismantled since it 
        proved next to impossible to clean the slides without removing them
        from the card cage.

        During dismantling the card cages it became clear that the mice 
        excrements found their way to the board seated in the card cages 
        causing corrision on contacts and finding its way into the sealed
        potentiomter housings of the parabola function generators of the
        multipliers.

       <p>
        The picture on the right shows part of such a parabola function 
        generator with the lid of the protective potentiometer housing
        removed for cleaning. Since the settings of the potentiometers are
        crucial for the operation of the multipliers the process of 
        cleaning them was very delicate and time consuming.

        expansion frame to the main frame of the RA 770 analog computer.
        Attaching the three interconnect cables to the main frame required
        some detective work since these seemed to be the only cables which 
        were not properly labeled, but fortunately their wiring matched with

       The two pictures above give an impression of the power distribution 
       system of the RA 770 - although the currents of the various 
       computing elements are very small (only several mA each) the power
       distribution bars are of a large diameter to avoid unnecessary voltage
       drops. Of course there is a central ground point in the machine since
       ground loops would be fatal for the overall accuracy of the system.

        The picture on the left shows a rather unusual feature for an 
        analog computer: This card contains the oven stabilized main 
        quartz oscillator which serves as the base for all clock signals
        derived from its output. Most analog computers just use a precision
        integrator as the main clock, but not the RA 770. Since it is 
        often convenient to have a time proportional ramp signal during 
        a calculation to drive an oscilloscope or a plotter it also features
        such a precision integrator but its only purpose is to generate a
        time proportional deflection voltage.

        Around 1970 Telefunken decided to abandon its own line of specialized
        dual trace oscilloscopes specially developed for its line of analog
        computers (the <a href="http://www.analogmuseum.org/english/collection/telefunken/oms811/">OMS 811</a> 
        oscilloscop) and to repackage a dual channel analog storage 
        oscilloscope made by HP. This device was then named HPO 771 and used
        in conjunction with the RA 770 analog computer. Its front plate
        can be seen on the left - since the standard Telefunken drawer is 
        a bit larger than the 19 inch usual today it looks a little bit 
        awkward and is not a prefect optical match for the wonderful RA 770.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately my HPO 771 has a severe problem in its high voltage
        power supply which I until now was unable to fix (due to the lack of
        schematics, mainly). Therefore I decided to insert one of my two
        <a href="http://www.analogmuseum.org/english/collection/telefunken/oms811/">OMS 811</a> oscilloscopes which were
        used in this machine, too.

        The next part of the system covered here are the servo potentiometers
        which are used in the RA 770. The basic idea is to have a central 
        keyboard on which coefficient values can be entered with a precision of
        four decimal digits. This value is then set by a servo loop consisting
        of a small motor coupled to a precision potentiometer and some servo
        electronics.

        This keyboard can be seen in the overal picture of the machine on

        The two pictures above show the central shielded analog patch field
        of the RA 770 analog computer. The patch panel is easily removable
        thus allowing rapid change of programs on the machine. In contrast
        to other machines made by EAI, Dornier etc. the RA 770 uses coaxial
        connectors throughout the patch field instead of cheap finger contacts
        being pressed to spring contacts. The quality of this Telefunken
        development is so high that the patch panel still has not a single
        weak contact after all this time and the storage conditions the 
        machine has experienced. This is in sharp contrast to most EAI systems
        known to me which need regularly careful cleaning of the patch field
        and its contacts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Located under the patch field are sixteen hand set coefficient 
        potentiometers and eight hand set switches. A very special feature
        of these potentiometers is the fact that four of them can be 
        coupled together by turning a knob thus forming two precision 
        double potentiometers. This is a unique and very useful feature I 
        have never seen on any other analog computer and makes the rapid 
        setup of manually controlled sweep generators and the like easy.

        The RA 770 uses chopper stabilized amplifiers in every place
        where extreme high precision and low drift is of prime importance
        (integrators, etc.). Some places with lower overall precision like
        function generators and the like allow the use of simpler operational
        amplifiers. One of these amplifiers is shown on the right - this board
        is called SV 1A and contains a single amplifier without chopper
        stabilization and without overload detection. This type of amplifier 
        is, for example, used in the NNT 771 drawer.

        The picture on the left shows one of the best operational amplifiers
        ever made for an analog computer. This is the so called OP14 from
        Telefunken (designed by Prof. Dr. Meyer-Brötz who developed the 
        first transistorized operational amplifiers for Telefunken - even 
        before companies like EAI did).

        On the right, under the metal shield, the semiconductor chopper and
        demodulator circuits are located. Below this shield the two power
        output transistors can be seen. The left half of the card contains
        the discretely implemented input stages of the main amplifier. The
        since integrated circuit is an off the shelf operational amplifier
        which is used for the chopper driven drift cancellation. This is
        the place where the overload detection takes place, too.

        Its more complex counterpart, the SK41, can be seen on the left. This
        board contains the control logic, precision resistors and capacitors
        to form two multi function integrators/summers in conjunction with
        two OP14 operational amplifier cards. The extreme number of relays
        used on this board is due to the fact that all integrators in the 
        RA 770 feature a dynamic test mode which adds quite complexity. The
        integrator control is, of course, purely electronic and does not 
        involve slow relays.
