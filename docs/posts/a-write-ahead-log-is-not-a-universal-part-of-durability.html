    <h1>A write-ahead log is not a universal part of durability</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>A database does not need a write-ahead log (WAL) to achieve
durability. A database can write its long-term data structure durably
to disk before returning to a client. Granted, this is a bad idea! And
granted, a WAL <b>is</b> critical for durability <b>by design</b> in most
databases. But I think it&#39;s helpful to understand WALs by
understanding what you <b>could</b> do without them.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s look at what terrible design we can make for a durable
database that has no write-ahead log. To motivate the idea of, and
build an intuition for, a write-ahead log.</p>
<p>Thank you to Alex Miller for reviewing a version of this post.</p>
<p>But first, what is durability?</p>
<h3 id="durability">Durability</h3><p>Durability happens in the context of a request a client makes to a
data system (either an embedded system like SQLite or RocksDB or a
standalone system like Postgres). Durability is a spectrum of
guarantees the server provides when a client requests to write some
data: that either the request succeeds and the data is safely written
to disk, or the request fails and the client must retry or decide to
do something else.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to set an absolute definition for durability since
different databases have different concepts of what can go wrong with
disks (also called a &#34;storage fault model&#34;), or they have no concept
at all.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start from the beginning.</p>
<h4 id="an-in-memory-database">An in-memory database</h4><p>An in-memory database has no durability at all. Here is pseudo-code
for an in-memory database service.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>btree</span><span>()</span>

<span>def</span> <span>handle_write</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>):</span>
  <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>handle_read</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>):</span>
  <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>&#34;value&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>value</span><span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Throughout this post, for the sake of code brevity, imagine that the
environment is concurrent and that data races around shared mutable
values like <code>db</code> are protected somehow.</p>
<h4 id="writing-to-disk">Writing to disk</h4><p>If we want to achieve the most basic level of durability, we can write
this database to a file.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;kv.db&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>btree</span><span>.</span><span>init_from_disk</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>handle_write</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>):</span>
  <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>
  <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>write_to_disk</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>handle_read</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>):</span>
  <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>&#34;value&#34;</span><span>:</span> <span>value</span><span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>btree.write_to_disk</code> will call
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pwrite">pwrite(2)</a> under the hood. And
we&#39;ll assume it does copy-on-write for only changed pages. So imagine
we have a large database represented by a btree that takes up 10GiB on
disk. With the btree algorithm, if we write a single entry to the
btree, often only a single (often 4Kib) page will get written rather
than all pages (holding all values) in the tree. At the same time, in
the worst case, the entire tree (all 10GiB of data) may need to get
rewritten.</p>
<p>But this code isn&#39;t crash-safe. If the virtual or physical machine
this code is running on reboots, the data we wrote to the file may not
actually be on disk.</p>
<h4 id="fsync">fsync</h4><p>File data is buffered by the operating system by default. By general
consensus, writing data without flushing the operating system buffer
is not considered durable. Every so often a new database will show up
on Hacker News claiming to beat all other databases on insert speed
until a commenter points out the new database doesn&#39;t actually flush
data to disk.</p>
<p>In other words, the commonly accepted requirement for durability is
that not only do you write data to a file on disk but you
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a> the
file you wrote. This forces the operating system to flush to disk any
data it has buffered.</p>

<p>Furthermore you must not ignore fsync failure. How you deal with fsync
failure is up to you, but exiting immediately with a message that the
user should restore from a backup is sometimes considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Databases don&#39;t like to fsync because it&#39;s slow. Many major databases
offer modes where they do not fsync data files before returning a
success to a client. Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FSYNC">offers</a>
this unsafe mode, though does not default to it and warns against
it. And MongoDB defaults to this unsafe mode. See
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-storage.journal.commitIntervalMs">storage.journal.commitIntervalMs</a>
and the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/write-concern/#j-option"><code>j</code> write concern
option</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The j option requests acknowledgment from MongoDB that the write
operation has been written to the on-disk journal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MongoDB defaults to committing on an interval, returning a success to
the client potentially before the write has been fsync-ed.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t particularly a dig on MongoDB. Almost every database trades
safety for performance in some regard. For example, few databases but
SQLite and Cockroach default to Serializable Isolation. While it is
commonly agreed that basically no level below Serializable Isolation
(that all other databases default to) can be reasoned about. Other
databases offer Serializable Isolation, they just don&#39;t default to
it. Because it can be slow.</p>
<h4 id="group-commit">Group commit</h4><p>But let&#39;s get back to fsync. One way to amortize the cost of fsync is
to delay requests so that you write data from each of them and then
fsync the data from all requests. This is sometimes called group
commit.</p>
<p>For example, we could update the database in-memory but have a
background thread serialize to disk and call fsync only every 5ms.</p>

<p>Although it might sound similar to what MongoDB does, the critical
difference is that <code>handle_write</code> waits to return a success until the
write is durable via fsync.</p>
<p>So to reiterate, the key idea for durability of a client request is
that you have some version of the client message stored on disk
durably with fsync before returning a success to a client.</p>
<p>From now on in this post, when you see &#34;durable&#34; or &#34;durability&#34;, it
means that the data has been written and fsync-ed to disk.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-durable-writes">Optimizing durable writes</h3><p>A key insight is that it&#39;s silly to serialize the entire permanent
structure of the database to disk every time a user writes.</p>
<p>We could just write the user&#39;s message itself to an append-only
log. And then only periodically write the entire btree to disk. So
long as we have fsync-ed the append-only log file, we can safely
return to the user even if the btree itself has not yet been written
to disk.</p>
<p>The additional logic this requires is that on startup we must read the
btree from disk and then replay the log on top of the btree.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>This is a write-ahead log!</p>
<p>Consider a few scenarios. One request writes the smallest key ever
seen. And one request within the same millisecond writes the largest
key ever seen. Writing these to disk on the btree means modifying at
least two pages spread out in space on disk.</p>
<p>But if we only have to durably write these two messages to a log, they
can likely both be included in the same log page. (&#34;Likely&#34; so long as
key and values are small enough that multiple can fit into the same
page.)</p>
<p>That is, it&#39;s cheaper to write only these small messages representing
the client request to disk. And we save the structured btree
persistence for a less frequent durable write.</p>
<h3 id="filesystem-and-disk-bugs">Filesystem and disk bugs</h3><p>Sometimes filesystems will write data to the wrong place. Sometimes
disks corrupt data. A solution to both of these is to checksum the
data on write, store the checksum on disk, and confirm the checksum on
read. This combined with a background process called scrubbing to
validate unread data can help you learn quickly when your data has
been corrupted and you must recover from backup.</p>
<p>MongoDB&#39;s default storage engine WiredTiger <b>does</b> checksum data <a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/develop/src/docs/tune-checksum.dox#L3">by
default</a>.</p>
<p>But some databases famous for integrity do not. Postgres does <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/checksums.html">no data
checksumming</a>
by default:</p>
<blockquote><p>By default, data pages are not protected by checksums, but this can
optionally be enabled for a cluster. When enabled, each data page
includes a checksum that is updated when the page is written and
verified each time the page is read. Only data pages are protected by
checksums; internal data structures and temporary files are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SQLite likewise does no checksumming by default. Checksumming is an
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cksumvfs.html">optional extension</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The checksum VFS extension is a VFS shim that adds an 8-byte
checksum to the end of every page in an SQLite database. The checksum
is added as each page is written and verified as each page is
read. The checksum is intended to help detect database corruption
caused by random bit-flips in the mass storage device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even this isn&#39;t perfect. Disks and nodes can fail completely. At
that point you can only improve durability by introducing redundancy
across disks (and/or nodes), for example, via distributed consensus.</p>
<h3 id="other-reasons-you-&lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;-a-wal?">Other reasons you <em>need</em> a WAL?</h3><p>Some databases (like SQLite) require a write-ahead log to implement
aspects of ACID transactions. But this need not be a requirement for
ACID transactions if you do MVCC (SQLite does not). See my previous
post on <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-05-16-mvcc.html">implementing
MVCC</a> for details.</p>
<p>Logical replication (also called change data capture (CDC)) is another
interesting feature that requires a write-ahead log. The idea is that
the log already preserves the exact order and changes that affect the
database&#39;s &#34;state machine&#34;. So we could copy these changes out of the
system by tracking the write-ahead log, preserving change order, and
apply these changes to a foreign system.</p>
<p>But again, just CDC is not about durability. It&#39;s an ancillary feature
that write-ahead logs make simple.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>A few key points. One, durability primarily matters if it is
established before returning a success to the client. Second, a
write-ahead log is a cheap way to get durability.</p>
<p>And finally, durability is a spectrum. You need to read the docs for
your database to understand what it does and does not.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s a new post about durability and write-ahead logs. Write-ahead logs are used almost everywhere. But to build an intuition for why, it is helpful to imagine what you would do without a WAL. And to explore the meaning of durability.<a href="https://t.co/nzS2pMz22z">https://t.co/nzS2pMz22z</a> <a href="https://t.co/m1n9x8CNcp">pic.twitter.com/m1n9x8CNcp</a></p>— Phil Eaton (@eatonphil) <a href="https://twitter.com/eatonphil/status/1807741130093556098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
