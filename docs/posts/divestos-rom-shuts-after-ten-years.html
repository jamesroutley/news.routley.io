This modification to the CVE checker allows checking newer versioned patches against older kernels when a matching version patch is unavailable. This feature was rolled out in three stages, firstly applying one version higher, then applying up to two versions higher, and lastly attempting all 4.4 patches on all 3.x versions. The result is anywhere between 50 and 180 additional CVE patches per 3.x kernel.
