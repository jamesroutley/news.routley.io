    <h1>Travle: A daily game â€“ get between countries in as few guesses as possible</h1>

Try to get there in as few guesses as possible.</p><p>Guess countries in any order. You must name every country you&#39;d pass through, so exclaves don&#39;t make new connections.</p><p>After each guess you get an emoji signaling how much the computer liked it.</p></div><div><div><p>âœ…</p><p><span id="infoGrid1">Guess is <b>optimal</b>! You&#39;re one step closer.</span></p></div><div><p>ðŸŸ§</p><p><span id="infoGrid2">Guess is <b>pretty good</b>. You&#39;re in the ball park... This country is close, but not on the route with the fewest guesses.</span></p></div><div><p>ðŸŸ¥</p><p><span id="infoGrid3">Guess is <b>not great</b>. Your guess is a significant detour.</span></p></div><div><p>â¬›</p><p><span id="infoGrid4">There isn&#39;t even a way to get from your guess to the target country by land.
