<h2>Tales from the first quarter...</h2>
<p>Spring is officially here, so it&#39;s time for an update on some of the visual journalism I&#39;ve produced at <a href="https://www.afp.com/en">AFP</a> over the past few months.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve posted a few graphics below that I like because of the color scheme, or the topic, or both. Most of them are made with either Python or R, as usual, and finished in Adobe Illustrator. I also took on a few mapping projects which were made with QGIS.</p>
<p>It was fun to start learning more about geospatial data, and my first experiments were enough to see that QGIS is both complex and powerful. I&#39;ve still got a long way to go with it, but there&#39;s something nice about doing visualization work that feels more directly connected to a sense of place.</p>
<p>I also worked on some more in-depth projects that didn&#39;t have a direct graphical output,  which I&#39;ll write about in some future posts.</p>
<p>For now here are the charts:</p>
