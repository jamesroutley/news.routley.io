Moreover, it is understood that non-senescent cells within the elderly tissue still proliferate. However, the reason for the decline in organic function in the elderly as they age remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that there might be a subset of cells in an intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process within the tissue, significantly impacting and ultimately leading to organic dysfunction in the elderly. Here, we propose the existence of intermediate stage cells that are neither youthful nor senescent. We termed these cells as “mid-old cells.” Moreover, these cells would likely accumulate in the stromal region of the tissues for the following reasons. Epithelium, which undergo differentiation rather than self-replication, have shorter lifespans and undergo periodic replacement<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Park, J.

Here, we found that the major population of local organic fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells are mid-old status.

Primary human fibroblasts were sub-cultured in increasing passages, observing flattened morphology and decreased proliferation along with reduced Ki67 expression and EdU incorporation (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">1a</a>). Sub-cultured fibroblasts could be categorized into three groups based on doubling time (DT) and SA-β-Gal positivity: early passage named ‘young’ (1-2 days DT, &lt;1% SA-β-Gal), middle passage named ‘mid-old’ (5-7 days DT, &lt;5% SA-β-Gal), and later passage named ‘old’ (&gt;14 days DT, &gt;65% SA-β-Gal). Notably, these three cell groups exhibit distinct expression patterns of conventional senescence markers, p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, p21<sup>Waf1</sup>, and p53. Fibroblasts in the early passage did not express those senescent markers (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig1">1a</a>). However, in the later passage showed higher expression of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and p21<sup>Waf1</sup>. Moreover, heterochromatin foci formation and higher SA-β-Gal positivity were observed (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">1b–d</a>).

However, in our studies, recombinant human SAA1 (rhSAA1) increased expression of MMPs only, especially <i>MMP9</i>, in fibroblasts and muscular mucosa smooth muscle cells (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3b, c</a>) via NFκB signaling (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">10a</a>). Thus, the expression of MMP9 was considered a characteristic of mid-old and old cells (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">10b</a>). These findings suggest that SAA1 may contribute to the development of aging-related microenvironments by promoting the degradation of ECM components. Indeed, MMP9 protein expression was robustly increased in elderly tissues that expressed SAA1 (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3d</a>).

The thickness of the muscular mucosa, which exhibited high expression of SAA1 in the colon, was significantly reduced in tissues from elderly subjects (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3f</a>). Although we attempted to assess the thickness of the bronchial smooth muscle layer, irregularities in histological sectioning hindered precise measurements in lung tissue. We then investigated the impact of SAA1 on epithelial cells, specifically their function in ionic exchange and water reabsorption capacity. Interestingly, SAA1 did not alter the expression of genes associated with these functions in colonic epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">12</a>). These findings suggest that SAA1 directly affected mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, but not epithelial cells. Based on a previous study showing that SAA1 stimulates the upregulation of MMP9<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="Lee, H.

Maintaining the integrity of the BM is crucial for proper epithelial cell function, and remnants of degraded ECM components, known as ‘Matrikines<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Sivaraman, K. &amp; Shanthi, C.

Therefore, we evaluated epithelial cell function based on BM stability. Although the mRNA levels of type IV collagen, a major component of the BM, did not show significant difference between elderly and young-aged tissues (GSE178341<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Pelka, K. et al.

Type IV collagen mRNA expression was downregulated only in old fibroblasts, and treating with rhSAA1 did not decrease type IV collagen mRNA levels in young fibroblasts (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3h</a>). Hence, it is considered that the downregulation of type IV collagen in the BM of elderly organs is likely due to its degradation by MMP9 rather than reduced production of type IV collagen. To test this hypothesis in vitro, we cultured young or mid-old fibroblasts in Matrigel containing type IV collagen and found that collagen IV degradation was more pronounced in the presence of mid-old fibroblasts (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3i</a>).

Intriguingly, MMP9 knockdown in mid-old fibroblasts rescued the upregulation of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>AQP3</i> expression (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">13a</a>).

To address this question, we proposed that young cells may prevent the onset of senescence in adjacent mid-old cells. However, if the senescence-driving factors outweigh the inhibitory ability of young cells, a large population of mid-old cells would rapidly enter the senescence program (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig5">5a</a>).

To exclude the possibility of migration from the upper chamber, we introduced a GFP system in mid-old fibroblasts, demonstrating that the proliferation of GFP-positive mid-old fibroblasts increased (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">14c</a>). These data suggest that factors secreted from young cells has effect of reverse aging not only the self-replication ability but also other functions of mid-old fibroblasts.

These data indicate that increased proliferative ability alone is not sufficient for reversal of aging phenotype, suggesting the involvement of other primary mechanisms. Previously, we proposed CXCL12 as a juvenile factor, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting T-cell infiltration<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Choi, Y.

However, CXCL12 itself did not affect the expression of inflammatory genes in mid-old fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">16</a>). In contrast, SLIT2, identified as a representative young cell secretory factor in our in vitro studies, is a known anti-inflammatory protein that progressively decreases as cells become senescent. To assess the impact of young cell driven SLIT2 on mid-old cells, we treated mid-old fibroblasts with recombinant human SLIT2 protein (rhSLIT2). Treatment with rhSLIT2 resulted in decreased expression of inflammatory genes and proteins, including SAA1 and IL1β, through inhibition of Pyk2-NFκB signaling<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Zhao, H., Anand, A.

SLIT2 overexpression also showed similar effects (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6c</a>). Surprisingly, long-term treatment with rhSLIT2 protein restored the morphology of mid-old fibroblasts, causing them to revert to a small and spindle-shaped morphology reminiscent of young cells. To exclude the possibility of proliferation in young cells within the mid-old cell population in response to rhSLIT2, we treated young cells with rhSLIT2 and observed that young cells did not undergo increased proliferation (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17a</a>). Additionally, the proliferative capacity of mid-old fibroblasts was recovered, accompanied by decreased levels of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> mRNA and protein in a p53-independent manner (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6d, e</a>).

Treatment with rhSLIT2 in mid-old cells resulted in upregulated expression of <i>SOX2</i> and <i>OCT4</i> (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6f</a>). The expression of known SLIT2 receptors, including <i>ROBO2</i> and <i>ROBO4</i>, was not significantly downregulated in mid-old cells (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17b</a>), suggesting that the effect of SLIT2 is not solely due to decreased receptor activity. To further investigate the role of SLIT2, we downregulated SLIT2 expression using shRNA in young fibroblasts. SLIT2 downregulation induced the expression of inflammation-related genes and proteins, including IL1β and SAA1, and decreased the proliferation ability of the cells (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6g, h</a>). These findings suggest that a decrease in SLIT2 itself could promote senescence process. We further confirmed the effect of SLIT2 by adding back rhSLIT2 protein to shRNA-infected young cells, which resulted in the downregulation of the expression of upregulated inflammatory genes (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6i</a>). Finally, we applied SLIT2 downregulation in a co-culture system and found that it abolished the reversal of aging phenotype effect on mid-old cells (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6j</a>).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-6" data-title="SLIT2 has an impact on mid-old cells."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig6" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 6: SLIT2 has an impact on mid-old cells.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w/figures/6" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-43491-w/MediaObjects/41467_2023_43491_Fig6_HTML.png?as=webp"/><img aria-describedby="Fig6" src="http://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-43491-w/MediaObjects/41467_2023_43491_Fig6_HTML.png" alt="figure 6" loading="lazy" width="685" height="462"/></picture></a></div><p><b>a</b> Mid-old cells were treated for 24 h with rhSLIT2, and inflammatory gene expression was analyzed using real-time PCR (upper panel).

Thus, we hypothesized that SLIT2 could be an anti-aging factor in both species. We conducted two independent experiments using aged mice.

However, we did not observe significant morphological changes in various organs (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">18c</a>).

In this second experiment, we analyzed additional indices including activity, muscle weight, the number of mid-old cells in tissues, and blood analysis. Activity in the cage and hanging ability were measured before and after rmSLIT2 treatment to reduce animal to animal bias. During the experiment, body weight showed decreasing tendency in the rmSLIT2-treated groups. After 10 rounds of treatment, mouse aging-related characteristics significantly improved. Specifically, activity in the cage and hanging ability increased (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig7">7a, b</a>, and Supplementary Movie <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM8">3</a>).

The accumulation of senescent cells in the organs of the elderly may provide a plausible explanation for this decline. Multiple studies employing various senescence models have consistently demonstrated an increase in p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-positive cells, which are believed to be senescent, in aged mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Omori and colleagues revealed that the proportion of tdTomato (p16<sup>INK4A</sup>)-positive cells increased in aged mice; in the lung, skin, liver and kidney tissues of 12-month-old mice compared to 2-month-old mice using p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-CreERT2-tdTomato mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

While senescent cells can exert a significant impact on their surrounding environment through the expression of SASPs, we have conjectured that this phenomenon, which is associated with the accumulation of senescent cells, may not be the sole explanation for the functional decline observed in aged organs. This is because p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-negative cells still make up the majority of the organ’s population according to the abovementioned studies<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Instead, we put forth a hypothesis that the accumulation of cells in an intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process, referred to as ‘mid-old’ cells in the current study, might be another relevant factor in understanding this decline in organ function. Interestingly, our current data show that a considerable number of mesenchymal cells in aged organs exhibit the intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process rather than epithelial cells. This might be related to the relatively rapid turnover of epithelial cells, which predominately undergo apoptosis or are phagocytized by macrophages prior to induction of the senescence process<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Park, J.

The full extent of the effects of senescent and mid-old cells on the functional decline observed in aged organs remains uncertain. However, there is a strong indication that these cells may have a synergistic effect, meaning that their combined presence and activities could play a significant role in contributing to this decline. Further research is needed to better understand the interplay between senescent and mid-old cells and their collective impact on organ function during the aging process, and this interaction will be another interesting future studies.</p><p>Our in vitro transcriptomic studies showed that mid-old cells are functionally impaired compared to young cells; ECM formation, proliferation capacity, and tissue regeneration ability are significantly decreased. Nevertheless, it was observed that mid-old cells undergo a certain degree of functional recovery through the paracrine effect of substances released by young cells. Our study revealed that SLIT2 had a positive impact on the functional capacity of mid-old cells, although it remains uncertain whether it increased their maximum functional limit or enhanced their remaining functional potential. This is consistent with a prior study which demonstrated that <i>Slit2</i>-transgenic mice had improved organ function during aging<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Li, G. et al. Overexpression of Slit2 improves function of the paravascular pathway in the aging mouse brain. Int. J. Mol. Med. 42, 1935–1944 (2018)." href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#ref-CR46" id="ref-link-section-d33754130e2274">46</a></sup>. Surprisingly, SLIT2 decreased inflammatory response and improved proliferative capacity only in mid-old, but not in old fibroblasts. Moreover, SAA1 expression was regulated by SLIT2, but SAA1 is not related to cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">22</a>). Therefore, SLIT2 is a potential cell cycle regulator, and this could be attributed to the upregulation of stem cell factors, including SOX2 and OCT4. Previous reports demonstrated that SOX2 and OCT4 regulate the downregulation of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> expression via direct binding to its promoter or DNA methyltransferase<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Yamamizu, K., Schlessinger, D. &amp; Ko, M.

Based on our cautious interpretation, we suggest that SLIT2 may enhance cell proliferation by upregulating stem cell factors, particularly SOX2. However, it is important to note that effects of SLIT2 are not universally applicable. Specifically, senescent fibroblasts did not exhibit a response to SLIT2, and mid-old fibroblasts showed diminished effectiveness when DT exceeded 8 days (Supplementary Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="http://tinylogger.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">23</a>). Here, another important question arises: Can SLIT2 extend lifespan? Although our mouse sample size was small (<i>n</i> = 4, each), we administered PBS or rmSLIT2 injections once a week to 23-month-old mice and measured longevity. However, we did not observe evidence that SLIT2 extends lifespan, which is a major drawback of this study. Nonetheless, we believe that further investigation using a larger sample size of aged mice is necessary to draw conclusive results.</p><p>Regarding the changes in colon function with aging, we observed alterations in gene expression related to water absorption and the smooth muscle function involved in bowel movements in the large intestine. Specifically, we observed that the muscular mucosa layer became thinner in elderly colon tissue, and this was associated with increased expression of SAA1. Additionally, the expression of ‘Atrogenes’ was heightened in smooth muscle cells due to the presence of SAA1. Our findings suggest that SAA1 can induce atrophy in smooth muscle cells and may contribute to systematic muscle atrophy as circulating SAA1 levels increase with age. These results imply that targeting the master regulators of SAA1 directly could potentially prevent muscle mass loss in elderly individuals. Furthermore, we noted an increase in the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>, genes related to water absorption, in colon and lung epithelial cells in aged tissues. Notably, this increase in <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> expression was not attributed to SAA1 but rather appeared to be induced by the effects of degraded ECM on the stromal microenvironment. These degraded ECM fragments were found to function as ‘Matrikines,’ which upregulated signaling pathways such as Erk1/2, JNK, and NFκB. It is through these pathways that the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> is regulated. Therefore, collagen degradation by MMPs could serve as ‘Matrikines,’ potentially leading to increased expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>.</p><p>This study offers new insights into the heterogeneous nature of the senescence ecosystem. The current concept and definition of senescence can be somewhat broad and vague. While the term ‘cellular senescence’ is often used interchangeably with ‘irreversible cell cycle arrest<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Gorgoulis, V. et al.

Furthermore, the ‘mid-old cells’ identified in our study could represent an intermediate state of cellular senescence, as they are positive for the conventional markers, such as p21<sup>Waf1</sup> and IL1β. We demonstrated that the reduced or halted proliferation capacity of these mid-old cells can be reversed with appropriate stimulation. However, the borderline of cellular traits and the definition between ‘mid-old’ and ‘early senescence’ is still vague, and the additional study is needed to elucidate this question. Moreover, previously mentioned facts suggest that there could be various subtypes within the cellular senescence which makes us hard to understand the overall senescence ecosystem. Senescence encompasses various stages in cellular development, including early phases where proliferation ability can be restored, as well as later stages where cells take on specialized roles in molecule secretion or play a role in either promoting or inhibiting immune clearance processes. Furthermore, the trait of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions can be different from those in normal tissues, and the role of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions, such as age-related diseases will be another interesting future study.</p><p>Conclusively, our results demonstrated that most fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the organs of elderly subjects were in the mid-old status. Furthermore, SLIT2 protein originating from young cells could act as an anti-aging protein for mid-old cells. Collectively, the study proposes a new strategy for anti-aging, including targeting mid-old cells and restoring young cell factors to improve quality of life in elderly persons.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Methods"><div id="Sec9-section"><h2 id="Sec9">Methods</h2><div id="Sec9-content"><h3 id="Sec10">Human tissue experiments</h3><p>This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ajou University Hospital (AJIRB-BMR-OBS-20-552, Suwon, Korea), and informed consent was obtained from all patients, parents, or legal guardians as appropriate.

KG, Düren, Germany). Briefly, sample quality was checked using a Bioanalyzer RNA Chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and RNA-seq was conducted with a Nextseq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). To prepare the data for analysis, Skewer version 0.2.2 was used to trim potentially existing sequencing adapters and raw quality bases from the raw reads. The resulting high-quality reads were then mapped to the reference genome using STAR version 2.5 software. A sequencing library was prepared by LAS Inc. (Gimpo, Korea). Gene models based on the gene annotation of the reference genome hg38 from the UCSC genome in GTF format were used to calculate gene expression values in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) units. Heatmaps drawn in this study used FPKM data to visualize the gene expression. For variance stabilizing transformation (VST) and GSEA, raw sequencing data are trimmed and mapped using AltAnalyze (v.2.1.4.3). Raw count data are loaded in the R (v 4.0.3) DESeq2 package (v.1.38.3). DESeq data set was generated using ‘DESeq’ function. Sample distance was generated by calculating VST and drawn using ‘pheatmap’ function. GSEA was performed using the “fgsea” package (v.1.24.0) from R. Permutations were performed 1000 times, and <i>p</i> values were calculated using statistics from GSEA.
