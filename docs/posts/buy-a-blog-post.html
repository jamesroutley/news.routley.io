<p>I just read this <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/vdzcfg/two_types_open_source#c_wuhgld">interesting comment</a> about getting paid for open source.
I had a <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@LGUG2Z/114586871580310822">short conversation</a> with the author.</p>
<p>That lead to this lovely bit of text:</p>
<pre><code>When purchasing a license subscription, you are optionally encouraged
to enter your GitHub username; this makes it easier for me to identify
issues created by users with license subscriptions on the Komorebi
GitHub repo.
</code></pre>
<p>I like the incentive there, pay to get priority.</p>
<p>So here‚Äôs an experiment. I‚Äôll write a list of topics I‚Äôve been meaning to turn into blog posts, and a price, and you, oh well-funded reader, can bribe me to finish them.</p>
<p>What happens when the money arrives? I‚Äôll immediately dump a raw unedited blog post with the description and resources I‚Äôve already collected, and then clean up the post.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to change prices after writing any of these blog posts. As time passes I may grow more or less interested in a topic.</p>

<ul>
<li><label>A survey of <a href="https://www.scannedinavian.com/tools-built-on-tree-sitters-concrete-syntax-trees.html">cool tools</a> built on top of tree sitter‚Äôs concrete syntax trees. ( $15 )</label></li>

<li><label>conversations with correctness, why I believe incremental interactive ‚Äòproof assistant‚Äô tools such as GHCi, <a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/elaboratorReflection/elaborator-reflection.html">idris</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/shapr/hlsexamples/blob/main/src/Examples.hs#L117">wingman</a> are superior to large language models for exploratory programming ( $35 )</label></li>

</ul>
<p>This is about a third of the full list, and includes posts I would immediately feel comfortable writing.</p>

<p>I will happily discuss suggestions, send me a message!</p>

<p>That‚Äôll get priority over anything else, I am most productive when working with someone else on a task.</p>

<p>Sure? I‚Äôm also fine if you want to be anonymous.</p>

<p>Mostly by how much I want to write each thing. Small price means I want to do it, and think it‚Äôs easy enough.
Ok, maybe I just made up all the prices anyway.</p>

<p>ü§î
This could also be an excuse to re-organize my scattered lists of ideas, and find people who want to collaborate.</p>
<p>If you want a blog post, send money to my email address at paypal, with a note describing which post, and I‚Äôll get right on it!
If your payment is less than the amount in the list above, I will update the post with something like ($5 of $40).
So far latency has averaged 12 hours between request and post online.</p>

<p>Post your own ‚Äúblog post stub‚Äù list on your own blog, and SEND ME A LINK!</p>
