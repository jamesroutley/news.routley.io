    <h3>Never leave the keyboard with powerful link hinting.</h3>
    <p>Speed up the process as you follow
      links with your keyboard. In this example we follow a link to view
      a page about <i>Aerodynamic Forces</i>, without resorting to the mouse
      pointer.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/element-hint.png" alt="The user using element hints. Element hints display a
              character shortcode next to each element on the page. The
              user can then type in that shortcode to interact with said
              element."/>

    <h3>Quickly navigate documents with Jump Headings.</h3>
    <p>Immediately skip to important
      chapters with Jump Headings by fuzzily searching through header
      tags. In this example we jump to the section: <i>Intelligence and
        Learning</i>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/jump-heading.png" alt="The user using fuzzy search to jump around between
              headings. The user types in any characters that appear in a
              heading, and the browser jumps to that position in the
              document."/>

  <div>
    <h3>Instantly switch between your tabs.</h3>
    <p>Easily find relevant tabs with a
      fuzzy search. In this example we have 11 open tabs, and we
      narrow this group with each keystroke.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/switch-buffer.png" alt="The user using a fuzzy search to switch between many
              buffers. This allows them to jump to any tab instantly."/>

<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Find the right info the first time with multi-tab search.</h3>
    <p>Search multiple tabs
      simultaneously. In this example we look for the diet of penguins
      across several pages at once.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/search-buffers.png" alt="The user searching multiple tabs at once."/>

<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Avoid tedious repetition by selecting groups of tabs.</h3>
    <p>Run commands against multiple tabs
      to avoid repeating yourself. In the example below we finish our
      online research of elephants by selecting and closing all webpages
      that match the string &#34;ele&#34;.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/kill-buffers.png" alt="The user killing buffers. The user can type
              in a string to match and select multiple objects (in this
              case buffers), and then the user can apply an operation
              against those multiple objects."/>

<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Execute commands easily.</h3>
    <p>Fuzzy search relevant commands to
      instantly run them. No more digging through menus.

              name."/>

    <h3>Built-in programmability.</h3>
    <p>Use the built-in REPL to program
      Nyxt. Run short scripts, and try out new workflows. Everything
      in Nyxt is fully extensible and modifiable.
    </p>

    <h3>Smart bookmark search.</h3>
    <p>Use the prompt buffer to
      intelligently search your tagged bookmarks.

  <div>
    <h3>Customizable autofills.</h3>
    <p>Use autofills to fill in
      forms. Autofills can be functions or plain strings. In the case
      of functions, you can make them intelligent. For example, you may
      want an autofill to fill in the current date.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/auto-fill.png" alt="The user using autofills. Autofills are shortcodes to
              operations that can fill in input fields."/>

    <h3>Clipboard history.</h3>
    <p>Anything you copy is remembered so
      that you can re-paste it at any time. No more looking for the
      &#39;last thing&#39; you pasted!
    </p>

    <h3>Lossless tree history.</h3>
    <p>A tree based history ensures that
      you never lose track of where you&#39;ve been. All pages you&#39;ve
      visited are stored in a tree that you can traverse and search. No
      more losing items in your history.
