        <p><i>Daily dispatches from my 12 weeks at the Recurse Center in Summer 2023
</i></p>
        
        <p>Today I have this to show for myself:</p>



<p>In Creative Coding my group was working on generating weird fractals in response to the day’s prompt about organic machines. Meanwhile I got sucked into seeing if I could bounce this rectangle around since it was my first time playing with p5.js. You’re welcome.</p>

<p>Going to keep it short today since I’m eager to continue doing things with Lisp. Although, I suppose I’ll share a problem I encountered, which is this:</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following Scheme code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>))</span>

<span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>test</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
      <span>0</span>
      <span>y</span><span>))</span>

<span>(</span><span>test</span> <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The question is: What behaviour would we expect if the interpreter is using applicative-order evaluation (like Lisp) vs. normal order evaluation (like…something else)?</p>

<p>With applicative-order evaluation, the expressions are recursively expanded first. That means when we call <code>test</code> with arguments <code>0</code> and <code>(p)</code>, the expression <code>(p)</code> will be evaluated first. This is where I got stuck: When you call the function (or I guess “procedures” as SICP prefers), what the hell is going on? The Lisp syntax was throwing me off. It seems like we are defining a procedure <code>p</code> with no parameters, and the body of this procedure does nothing but recursively call itself. Infinitely. Which, it turns out, is correct: When the expression <code>(test 0 (p))</code> is evaluated in an applicative order, <code>(p)</code> is expanded first – infinitely – thus… well, actually, I’m not sure. I’m assuming the interpreter would throw an error if there’s a maximum recursion limit. But the point is that the procedure <code>test</code> will never actually be called.</p>

<p>Not so in a normal-order evaluation, where the expression <code>(test 0 (p))</code> will pass <code>0</code> and <code>(p)</code> as arguments to the procedure (the latter still not having been expanded), and when <code>(= x 0)</code> evaluates to true, the procedure will happily return <code>0</code> without ever needing to expand the second, fatal argument.</p>

<p>Not a particularly difficult problem. Where I got stuck was the unfamiliar Lisp syntax in the recursive function, which I thought I might have been interpreting incorrectly. The Python equivalent might be something like this:</p>



<p>Here’s what else you need to know today:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Checkins</li>
  <li>Met with another humanist-turned-coder, talked about data trajectories, mused about studying stats, got some more valuable GitHub hand-holding</li>
  <li>Creative Coding (fractals and DVD logo and p5.js)</li>
  <li>Nand2tetris, where I successfully reeled in one and maybe three folks to join me from the beginning and demo’ed the first week’s projects</li>
</ul>
