        <p>Thanks to a world-renowned art detective, an early Vincent van Gogh painting is back at home three and a half years after it was stolen from a Dutch museum.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200406-meet-the-worlds-greatest-art-detective">Arthur Brand</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CxFc5XGo0uB/">announced</a> the recovery of <em>The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring</em>, an 1884 canvas estimated to be worth between $3.2 and $6.4 million, on September 12. The day before, an anonymous tipster delivered the bubble-wrapped painting to Brand’s Amsterdam apartment in an Ikea bag.</p>

<p>The individual who returned the painting is not believed to be involved in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/van-gogh-masterpiece-stolen-dutch-museum-shuttered-covid-19-180974542/">the theft</a>, which took place before dawn on March 30, 2020—van Gogh’s birthday—at the <a href="https://www.singerlaren.nl/en/pQ3Z3Sv/singer-laren">Singer Laren</a> museum in the Netherlands. At the time, the Singer Laren was closed due to Covid-19 restrictions. The artwork was on loan from the <a href="https://www.groningermuseum.nl/en/press/schilderij-van-gogh-terug-in-groninger-museum">Groninger Museum</a>, also in the Netherlands.</p><center><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxFc5XGo0uB/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote> </center>
<p>Authorities arrested the culprit behind the heist in April 2021, using <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/arts/van-gogh-theft-dna.html">DNA evidence</a> left on a broken picture frame to link a man identified only as Nils M. to the thefts of both the van Gogh and a Frans Hal painting <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/old-master-painting-stolen-netherlands-third-time-180975682/">stolen</a> in August 2020. A Dutch court <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2022/07/20/8-years-prison-theft-van-gogh-hals-paintings-worth-millions">sentenced</a> Nils to eight years in prison and ordered him to pay nearly $9 million in compensation to the owner of the Hals.</p>

<p>Prosecutors believe Nils stole the van Gogh on the orders of Peter Roy K., a Dutch shipping mogul involved in drug smuggling, who hoped to use the artwork as leverage for negotiating a reduced prison sentence, reported Marco Willemse for Dutch newspaper <em><a href="https://www.ad.nl/amersfoort/peter-roy-k-38-is-brein-achter-grootschalige-cocainesmokkel-en-betrokken-bij-gestolen-van-gogh-stelt-om~a7a1691a/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fartanddesign%2F2023%2Fsep%2F12%2Findiana-jones-of-art-world-recovers-stolen-van-gogh-painting">AD</a></em> in 2021.</p>

<p>“The perpetrator is in custody and the painting is back,” Richard Bronswijk, a member of the Dutch Police’s Art Crime Unit, tells <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/stolen-van-gogh-painting-worth-millions-recovered-dutch/story?id=103110291">ABC News</a>’ Emma Ogao<em>.</em> “We are very happy with that result.”</p>

<p>After Nils’ arrest, the painting circulated in the criminal underworld, where it was used a down payment. But nobody was willing to buy it, as “the thieves had been convicted, and anybody possessing it would risk a hefty fine,” writes Claire Moses for the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/arts/design/van-gogh-returned-dutch-museum.html">New York Times</a></em>.</p>

<p>“We knew that the painting would go from one hand to another hand in the criminal world, but that nobody really wanted to touch it,” Brand tells the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/sep/12/indiana-jones-of-art-world-recovers-stolen-van-gogh-painting"><em>Guardian</em></a>’s Senay Boztas. “You could only get in trouble. So it was a little bit cursed.”</p>

<p>Brand is most famous for <a href="https://amzn.to/3t2pO5C">recovering two horse statues</a> created by Adolf Hitler’s favorite sculptor, Josef Thorak. The bronze horses once stood outside of the <a href="https://www.liberationroute.com/pois/843/new-reich-chancellery">New Reich Chancellery</a> in Berlin, but they went missing after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Brand helped authorities track the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/21/mystery-of-hitlers-missing-horse-statues-solved/">sculptures</a> through the underbelly of the art world, ensuring their return in 2015.</p>

<p>Since then, the so-called “<a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/06/24/meet-the-indiana-jones-of-the-art-world">Indiana Jones of the art world</a>” has helped authorities recover stolen paintings by <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/indiana-jones-of-art-world-finds-picasso-stolen-20-years-ago-saudi-billionaire-180971814/">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/art-detective-arthur-brand-stolen-dutch-a7170401.html">Salvador Dalí</a>, in addition to a 15th-century manuscript of <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/sale-rare-collection-persian-poetry-dramatic-backstory-180974391/&#39;">Persian poetry</a>, a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/art-detective-tracks-down-oscar-wildes-stolen-friendship-ring-180973576/">gold ring</a> gifted to a friend by Oscar Wilde and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/stolen-dutch-artworks-westfries-museum/index.html">more than 200</a> other artworks.</p>

<p>Brand tells the <em>Guardian </em>that the tipster who returned the painting contacted him, saying, “Mr. Brand, I could turn in the van Gogh, but I don’t want to get in trouble.” The art detective “had to gain his confidence” before the man agreed to drop off the canvas in a meeting sanctioned by authorities.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.groningermuseum.nl/en/press/schilderij-van-gogh-terug-in-groninger-museum">statement</a>, the Groninger Museum says the oil on paper on panel painting “has suffered” due to poor storage conditions over the past few years but “is—at first glance—still in good condition.” A formal examination and restoration work must be completed before the painting goes back on view, which could take “weeks, if not months,” according to the museum.</p>
