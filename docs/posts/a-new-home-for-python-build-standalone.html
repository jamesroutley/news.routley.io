<p><a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> powers Python
installation for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye">Rye</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jdx/mise">mise</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python">Bazel&#39;s rules_python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipx">pipx</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch">Hatch</a>, and more, with <strong>over 70,000,000 downloads</strong> since its release.</p>
<p>For much of the ecosystem, it&#39;s now the primary source of Python installations.</p>
<p>But given Gregory&#39;s <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2024/03/17/my-shifting-open-source-priorities/">shifting open source priorities</a>,
he&#39;s been looking for help. And since March, we&#39;ve been working with him to maintain <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>.
We&#39;ve shepherded every release since April, automated the release process itself, built out support for <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/pull/319">Python 3.13</a> (including support for <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/pull/326">free-threaded
Python</a>), and more.</p>
<p>To quote Gregory&#39;s own <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2024/12/03/transferring-python-build-standalone-stewardship-to-astral/">announcement</a>, <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> &#34;is effectively an Astral maintained project and has been that
way for months.&#34; So, to reflect that evolution, <strong>on 2024-12-17, Gregory will be transferring the project to the
Astral organization</strong>, where we&#39;ll continue to maintain and push the project forward.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>, but it&#39;s also part of a broader ecosystem
and will continue to be developed with that broader ecosystem in mind. We&#39;re excited to devote
full-time resources to its maintenance and development, and to foster the level of engagement and
activity that you might be familiar with from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff</a> or <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="whats-a-standalone-python-distribution"></span>What&#39;s a &#34;standalone&#34; Python distribution?<!-- --> <a href="#whats-a-standalone-python-distribution">#</a></h3>
<p>Normally, when you build CPython on Linux or macOS, several system paths are hardcoded into the
binary. This is fine if you&#39;re building and installing Python on a single machine, but it&#39;s a
problem if you want to pre-build Python and then distribute it to other machines. CPython is also
dynamically linked against a number of system libraries, which can cause trouble if the target
machine doesn&#39;t have those libraries installed. In this way, CPython is not &#34;standalone&#34;: it&#39;s
tightly coupled to the system on which it was built.</p>
<p>So, for example, when you download Python on Linux (e.g., from <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a>),
what you&#39;re actually downloading is the CPython source, which is then built on your machine.
Similarly, when you install Python with <code>pyenv</code>, it too is building from source.</p>
<p>While source installations have their benefits, they have some drawbacks too:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building from source is much slower than downloading a pre-built binary. This is especially true
if you&#39;re building CPython with optimizations enabled (i.e., PGO and LTO). Notably, <code>pyenv</code> does
<em>not</em> build with optimizations enabled by default, so if you&#39;re using <code>pyenv</code> to install Python,
you&#39;re leaving significant performance improvements on the table.</li>
<li>Building from source introduces a dependency on a build toolchain (e.g., <code>gcc</code>). And it can fail!
For a variety of reasons: missing dependencies, incompatible system libraries, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The net effect, though, is that you can&#39;t &#34;download a Python binary&#34; from... anywhere.
Other than the <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> project.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> solves these problems by (1) statically linking Python against
its dependencies; and (2) patching the CPython build system to operate on relative, rather than
absolute paths.</p>
<p>With those modifications, it then builds Python from source across a wide matrix of Python versions,
platforms, and build variants (e.g., optimized vs. debug builds), and publishes the built
distributions to GitHub Releases.</p>
<p>The Python builds produced by <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> are truly standalone: you can download,
unzip, and run them on any machine, without any additional dependencies. They make <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/"><code>uv python install</code></a> feel
magical. Not only is it extremely fast, but (to borrow from Armin), it&#39;s hassle-free.</p>
<h3><span id="the-future-of-standalone-python-distributions"></span>The future of standalone Python distributions<!-- --> <a href="#the-future-of-standalone-python-distributions">#</a></h3>
<p>I first met <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com">Gregory</a> about two years ago, when I had just started working on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff</a>, and we catch up
from time to time given our shared interests in Rust and Python.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Gregory mentioned to me that he was looking for help maintaining <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>. Given our use of the project in
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>, and the load-bearing role it plays in the Python ecosystem, we were eager to help out.</p>
<p>Since March, we&#39;ve been working with Gregory to maintain the project, ship improvements, and manage
releases, keeping the project up-to-date with the latest Python patch and minor versions, upgrading
dependencies (e.g., OpenSSL) in response to security advisories, and more.</p>
<p>We&#39;re now at a point where we feel comfortable stewarding the project going forward. By moving
the project into the Astral organization, we&#39;re committing to its long-term maintenance and
development.</p>
<p>In particular, we have (at least) four goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep the project up-to-date with Python releases.</strong> Every year, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#how-does-the-python-version-numbering-scheme-work">a new Python minor release comes out</a>;
and every year, the Python build system changes. We want to ensure that <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
keeps pace with those changes, providing the latest Python versions as soon as they&#39;ve hit a
stable release, be they patch releases or new minor versions.</li>
<li><strong>Upstream changes to the CPython build system.</strong> Many of the patches that <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
applies to the CPython build system are general-purpose improvements that would benefit the
broader Python ecosystem. We want to work with the Python core developers to upstream those
changes, to reduce the delta between the official CPython build system and that of <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Remove some of the project&#39;s existing limitations</strong>. For example, while <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
ships musl-based Python builds, those builds are incompatible with Python extension modules, a
significant limitation in practice.</li>
<li><strong>Improve the project&#39;s build and release process</strong>. <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
builds <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20241016">947 artifacts</a> on every commit, and for every release.
That&#39;s a lot of builds! We want to invest in making the build and release process easy, efficient, and continuous. For example, it&#39;d be sensible for us to build from CPython HEAD on a continuous basis, rather than on every CPython release.
We can also expand the set of supported platforms by moving beyond GitHub&#39;s free runners. (For example, we could ship Python builds for ARM Windows.)</li>
</ol>
<p>If this sounds interesting to you, <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/astral/84cf53c0-d584-47c6-bff0-07ec97c85093">we&#39;re hiring</a>! And we&#39;re
especially interested in folks with the kind of build engineering experience that would be relevant
here.</p>
<h3><span id="thanks-gregory"></span>Thanks, Gregory<!-- --> <a href="#thanks-gregory">#</a></h3>
<p>Finally, I want to take a moment to thank Gregory for all the work that he&#39;s put into <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> — for onboarding us onto the project, and for entrusting Astral with its development going forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> was initially built
to power <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a>, but has since grown into a critical
part of the Python ecosystem. The project itself is both a tremendous technical and social
achievement, and Gregory&#39;s commitment and expertise are clear and obvious throughout the codebase
and documentation.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also grateful that Gregory will remain involved with the project as we build upon those
foundations and continue investing in standalone Python distributions.</p></article></div>
