    <h1>How I built this website on a Raspberry Pi</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        
        <p>
            As of the time of writing this, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/">
                Raspberry Pi 5</a> has recently been released. Some people are buying it excitedly, while others
            think that its value over previous models doesn&#39;t warrant the price increase. In any event, many people
            will be implementing various projects on their new (or old) Pis.
        </p>
        <p>
            As most Pi-havers know, one of the many cool things you can do on a Raspberry Pi is run a webserver.
            There are tutorials <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fireship.io/lessons/host-website-raspberry-pi/">here</a> and
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/swlh/host-a-raspberry-pi-web-server-on-the-internet-89786287db77">here</a>
            and probably many more places that explain how. There are also some reasonably well known sites, my
            favorite being <a href="http://pi.qcontinuum.com">this one</a>, which is run on a solar-powered Pi.
            And there is also, of course, this site—my personal website—that you are currently viewing, which is
            being run on a Raspberry Pi in my room.
        </p>
        <p> While tutorials abound in regards to getting a basic webserver set up, there is a difference between
            a functional server and a good usable website. I&#39;ve been working on getting my personal site set up
            over the course of the past five years, spending an hour or so every month working on improving the Pi.
            I never intended for this personal project to become so lengthy or complex, but eventually I ended up
            with a fairly robust system for running, maintaining, and editing my website. This tutorial will describe
            what I&#39;ve learned throughout the process of creating this site in 15 steps, so that you can use it to create
            and maintain your own sites. </p>

        <p>This tutorial assumes that you already know how to use the command line, and that you have some understanding
            of HTML and CSS. That is about it.
        </p>
        <h3 id="equipment">Step 1: Getting your Equipment</h3>
        <p>I run this site off a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/?src=raspberrypi">Raspberry Pi 4
                B+</a>. I used to have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w">Raspberry Pi
                Zero 2 W</a>, but I upgraded it because I thought that my site was slow due to insufficient hardware.
            Turns out it was actually a PEBKAC bug on my end, which I was able to fix. So if you are starting out
            your personal site, a Pi Zero for $15 is more than enough; just make sure it is the Pi Zero W, which you
            can connect with the wifi.
        </p>
        <p>Many Pi shops sell &#34;kits&#34; with various accessories to the Raspberry Pi, like cameras. You don&#39;t need a
            kit, but you do need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vilros.com/products/official-raspberry-pi-foundation-power-supply-for-raspberry-pi-4-us-white-ul">A
                    charging cable</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vilros.com/products/copy-of-class-10-micro-sd-card-pre-programmed-with-noobs-raspbian-for-raspberry-pi">a
                    Micro SD Card</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vilros.com/products/micro-sd-to-usb-adapter">Micro SD card to USB Adapter </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That&#39;s it. That is all you need, unless you want a case. If you go for the Pi Zero, this currently costs
            $38.89, plus shipping and tax. If you want the Pi B+, it will run you up to $58.63. Be sure to plug it in
            somewhere safe, or else you may accidentally trip over the plugged-in cord right when then AAAI
            Undergraduate
            Consortium admissions officer is looking at your site, causing them to email you asking why your site link
            is
            broken, and you will feel extremely silly. This did indeed happen to me.
        </p>

        <h3 id="headless">Step 2: Creating a Headless Pi</h3>
        <p>
            Unless you want to have to plug a keyboard and monitor into the Pi, you will need to make the Pi
            &#34;headless.&#34; A headless Pi doesn&#39;t have to be accessed by a monitor and keyboard, and instead, you work
            on another computer, SSH into the Pi, and then play around in the filesystem of the Pi so long
            as both your current computer and the Pi are connected to the same wifi.
        </p>
        <p>To set this up, you need to specify that you want it when you first flash the Pi. To flash the Pi,
            I recommend using the <b>Raspberry Pi Imager</b> which can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you download and run the imager, it will ask you what device, OS, and storage you want. For the
            device, select the model of Pi that you bought. For the OS, I recommend clicking &#34;Raspberry Pi OS
            (other)&#34; and selecting the Raspberry Pi OS Lite, which comes without desktop capabilities. Since we will
            be running this headless, you will be interacting with it via the command line, and the desktop features
            will just be clutter. Plug your SD card into your computer using the Micro SD cart to USB adapter, and
            the the dropdown menu for selecting the storage device should list the SD card. Click &#34;Next,&#34; and it
            will ask you, &#34;Would you like to apply OS customization settings?&#34; Click &#34;Edit Settings.&#34;
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/os_customization_general.png" alt="Raspberry Pi Imager customization screen"/>
        <p>
            Technically you <i>can</i> leave the Pi name as the very boring raspberrypi.local, but you should change
            it if you want it to be interesting. After that, you want to make sure that the Pi can connect to wifi, so
            give it your wifi information. The rest is fairly self-explanatory.
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/os_customization_services.png" alt="Raspberry Pi Imager customization screen SSH popup"/>
        <p>
            Now you click the button to enable SSH! I personally do not recommend the option of only being able to
            access it with your public key. I know you want to make it extra secure, because you are making it
            accessible from the internet, but there have been a few occasions when I sent my computer in for repairs,
            didn&#39;t have my key, and couldn&#39;t access the site. However, if you are less forgetful and more
            security-conscious
            than I am, go ahead and make it only accessible by key.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then you put the SD card into the Pi, and plug it into the charger. Wait a bit for it to connect to
            wifi, and then SSH into your Pi with the command:
        </p>
        <p>ssh pi@your_pi_name.local</p>
        <p>You should now be in the home directory of your Pi! However, you probably don&#39;t want to have to remember
            the password every time, so I recommend setting up an RSA key pair. If you generate an RSA key pair, you
            can send the public key to the Pi and keep the private key on your computer, and the Pi will recognize your
            computer and grant you access. Everyone else can still get in via the password.</p>
        <p>You if you are on Linux or MacOS, create the key with the command:</p>
        <p>ssh-keygen -t rsa</p>
        <p>and then send it to your Pi with the command </p>
        <p>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/rpi_rsa.pub &lt;RPi_USER&gt;@&lt;RPi_IP&gt;</p>
        <p> If you are on windows,</p>
        <p>ssh-keygen</p>
        <p>will create the pair but you will have to manually send it to the Pi. Copy it from
            <span> C:\Users\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\.ssh\id_rsa.pub</span>,
            ssh into the Pi, and paste the file here: <span>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span>
        </p>

        <p>You now have a headless Pi that can be accessed via SSH! One thing that made my life easier was making a
            alias for it. So instead of having to remember the name of the Pi, open up your config file at
            <span>~/.ssh/config</span> with your text editor of choice (I recomend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://micro-editor.github.io">micro</a>) and
            create a Host object. It looks like this:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Add the above text to your config file with the real local IP address, and you will be able to just type
            <span>ssh website</span> and access your site. Also if you use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a>, if you put a Host in the
            config file, you can click
            on the bottom left corner of the VSCode IDE and click &#34;Connect to
            Host&#34; which will appear in the dropdown menu. Then you can edit files on your Pi
            with a VSCode environment!
        </p>

        <h3 id="apache">Step 3: Installing an Apache Server</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you can SSH into your Pi, it is time to give it a webserver. I prefer <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache2</a>.
            Now that I&#39;m talking about work taking place on the Pi, I will assume that your OS is Linux, because that
            is what Raspberry Pi OS is based off of. Install Apache2 with:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Congratulations, you now have a webserver running off your Pi! You can access it locally, meaning that
            anybody connected to your wifi can look at the site. In order to get it, you need the local IP address,
            which you can access with the following command:
        </p>
        <p>hostname -I</p>
        <p>Run that on the Pi and take the resulting IP address and paste it into a browser as if it were a url.
            You should see the Apache2 startup screen which should look like the below image:
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/apache_default.png" alt="Apache2 Default Splash Screen"/>
        <h3 id="public">Step 4: Making Your Site Publicly Accessable</h3>
        <p>
            The next step is getting the server on your Pi accessable to people who are on different Wi-Fis. First,
            log into your router. Typically the way to access your router (although you might have an unusal router)
            is by typing <span>192.168.1.1</span> into your browser, like as if it were a URL. The
            reason that this
            works is because the IP range <span>192.168.x.x</span> is reserved for local
            addresses, meaning that
            anything in that range will be a device connected to your Wi-Fi. Typically, routers select the first
            local IP address, which is <span>192.168.1.1</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you are in your router, you need to set up <b>port forwarding</b>. Everything on the internet,
            including websites and your personal router, have IP addresses. However, typically if somebody figures
            out your router&#39;s public IP and they try to search it, it will say &#34;I am a personal router, go away&#34; and
            not give a response. If you have a website, however, you don&#39;t want that! If the thing trying to access
            your public IP address is a browser or some other web searching device, it will use either port 80
            for the HTTP protocol or port 443 for the HTTPS protocol. So if somebody on the internet says, &#34;hey, I&#39;m
            trying to access your router via port 443,&#34; rather than saying, &#34;I am a personal router, go away,&#34; you
            want your router to say, &#34;oh, port 443 means I send this message to the Raspberry Pi.&#34; All of the personal
            devices connected to your router have the same public IP address as the router. However, they have
            different private IP addresses, so the router can talk to all the devices using their own specific
            private IP. Port forwarding tells your router that if somebody messages its public IP on port 80 or 443,
            then it should forward the message to the private IP corresponding with your Pi.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am using a Netgear router, so this section will explain how to port forward using a Netgear
            router. If you use a different router, the methods might be similar, or you may have to look up a
            different tutorial on how to set up port forwarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have Netgear, the homepage of your router should have a section titled &#34;attached devices&#34;. Click
            on it, and it will show all the local addresses of your devices.
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/local_devices.png" alt="Netgear Local Devices Display"/>
        <p>
            As you can see, the devices listed on my router include Talia (my computer), Unknown (my phone), and **Pi,
            which is my Raspberry Pi (name redacted for privacy). They are connected to the local network. Since the Pi
            is the one that I want to connect to, I take its IP address <span>192.168.1.2</span> and
            add
            port forwarding functionality to it. If the Wi-Fi resets during a power outage, or if you unplug
            and reset it, the local IP may change, and you might have to reset the port forwaring, but thankfully
            this shouldn&#39;t happen very often.
        </p>
        <p>
            To enable port forwarding on a Netgear router, go to the &#34;Advanced&#34; tab, then click &#34;Advanced Setup&#34; and
            go to &#34;Port Forwarding / Port Triggering.&#34;
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/port_forwarding_location.png" alt="port forwarding screen for netgear"/>
        <p>
            There are typically two protocols that will be used to look at websites: HTTP and HTTPS. HTTP uses port
            80, and HTTPS uses port 443. So, set up two protocols: one for port 80 to connect to the
            local address that you saw your Raspberry Pi use, and one for port 443 to do the same. Once you are
            on the port forwarding page, click the &#34;Add&#34; button.
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/port_forwarding.png" alt="port forwarding implementation for netgear"/>
        <p>
            The above image shows how to get a port forward set up for HTTPS. For HTTP, you just need to do port
            80 instead of 443. Ignore FEDERAL-SPYCAM; that is just my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find your public IP address <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whatismyip.com">here</a>. Paste it into your browser
            like a URL. You should see the Apache2 starting page, which means that you are connected to the internet!
            A word of warning: if you have the misfortune of being in an apartment complex with fiber internet, you
            will have to call the fiber internet company because the whole complex shares the same IP address. When
            I moved to Pittsburgh, my apartment had fiber internet, and I was literally on the phone with the Ruckus
            Box people for three consecutive days trying to get third-level support so I could get my own IP
            address. It is typically doable, and they did not charge me extra in my situation, but they might end up
            charging you, depending on where you live and which fiber internet company your location uses.
        </p>
        <h3 id="cert">Step 5: Getting an HTTPS Certificate</h3>
        <p>
            HTTPS is more secure than HTTP (the S stands for &#34;secure&#34;), so it is the default for most modern
            browsers. To allow your site to be accessed via HTTPS, you need an HTTPS certificate. Thankfully,
            you can just use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://certbot.eff.org">certbot</a>
            to install it. The linked site explains very clearly
            what you do—when it asks you what OS you are using, you can put &#34;Debian,&#34; which is what Raspberry Pi
            OS runs off of.
        </p>

        <h3 id="domain">Step 6: Getting a Domain Name</h3>
        <p>
            You now have a Raspberry Pi that is accessible from any Wi-Fi network around the world! Someone could be
            across the globe from you, and they could type in your public IP address and view your Raspberry Pi!
            However, they
            would need to memorize your IP address to look you up. If you want your site to be easy to access, you
            will need to buy a domain name. The downside of domain names is that they have to be rented rather than
            purchased outright like the Pi, but they are typically not very expensive. Personally, I recommend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://njal.la">Njalla</a>, which typically costs
            €15 annually. It doesn&#39;t try to &#34;help&#34; you too much, meaning it doesn&#39;t get in your way, and it markets
            itself as being secure and respectful of internet privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have bought your domain name from Njalla, go to the domain name page on Njalla and
            click &#34;manage.&#34;
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/njalla.png" alt="Njalla Records"/>
        <p>
            As you can see below, there are three records. The first is an A record, and the value is the IPV4
            address. This is fairly self explainatory: if your domain name is accessed via a browser, it will go in
            the direction that your IPV4 address points. The second record, the one below the first, is a CNAME record,
            which maps an alias domain name to the true domain name. So if your CNAME record is prefix and your
            domain name is domainname.com, then you can make a CNAME record for prefix with the value @ (the third
            record, the &#34;@,&#34; just
            refers to the domain name) and prefix.domainname.com will take you to domainname.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two CNAME (the last two) records are for the benefit of Google Search Console, which I talk about in
            more detail in
            section 10. However for now, if you like, you can add a www CNAME record like I have at the bottom row,
            or not if you don&#39;t want the www prefix to be an option for your site. Ignore the middle record for now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don&#39;t have a AAA record because I live in a building with fiber internet, so I do not have an IPV6
            address, but if you do, then I advise getting an AAA record pointing to your IPV6.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you should be able to access your site via a domain!
        </p>
        <h3 id="htmlcss">Step 7: HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
            Now this is the fun part: adding the HTML and CSS to build your site! The default homepage made by
            Apache2 is <span>/var/www/html/index.html</span>. I advise keeping the index file as
            your homepage, and putting the rest of your code in the html directory. I cannot walk you through this
            step-by-step, because how you wish to design your site is up to you! However, there are a few things
            you may wish to keep in mind:

        </p><p> Do NOT use an online free template; they are not very good. Remember the PEBKAC bug which made me buy a
            Raspberry Pi B+ rather than a perfectly good Raspberry Pi W Zero? It was because the template had
            unnecessary JavaScript that loaded too slowly. When I wrote my own script, the bug went away.

            Avoid copying from other sites, because oftentimes the HTML is autogenerated and will be unweildy.
            One exception to this is my site, which does not use autogenerated code. If you right-click on my site on
            a browser and press &#34;Developer Tools&#34; and then &#34;View Page Source,&#34; you
            can look at the raw HTML, which will link you to the raw CSS. I&#39;m hardly a professional web
            developer, but it is servicable, and you are welcome to steal it.

        <p>I never thought I would say this, but you can use ChatGPT sometimes. Don&#39;t ask it to generate your site
            all at once, or you will end up with a horrible disaster that is not
            only awful but unoriginal. However, ChatGPT <i>can</i> be good when you want advice on a small section of
            your site.
            For example: the background of the welcome portion of my home page, where it lists my name and resume, used
            to
            just be black in an earlier draft. I asked ChatGPT to make the CSS &#34;look more like a
            developer&#39;s site,&#34; and it added the box in the center. I changed the color scheme and added the blue
            gradient myself, but the box was ChatGPT&#39;s idea. Just make sure taht you don&#39;t overuse it; LLMs aren&#39;t quite
            that good yet. </p>
        <p>You want the secret to making good HTML and CSS on your website? Read a book on HTML and CSS,
            or take a class on it if you are still in college. There is no secret; you just have to learn the
            skills. I read chapter 3 of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wtf.tw/ref/robbins.pdf">this book</a> and that was what helped me make this site. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/you-must-read-at-least-one-book-to-ride/">Just read the book,
                okay?</a> Or find a better book. But if you find a better one, you need to email me and let me know
            so I can read it too.

        <p>Go easy on the JavaScript. All you really need is a static site for 99% of your needs if its just a

        <p>For security, you should set your files to permissions level <span>644</span> and your
            folders to

            for example, to
            change <span>file.html</span> to permission level <span>644</span>,
            you would use the command

            a text editor when I wish to make small edits on the Pi. When I want to make significant edits on the Pi, I
            use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">vscode</a>
            which can edit the text with a full IDE as if it is on your local computer. Right now, I am writing
            this tutorial on VSCode!

        <h3 id="virtual">Step 8: Virtual Hosts</h3>
        <p>
            Now, this may come as a surprise to some people, but I am actually a human with many thoughts and
            hobbies beyond just tech! Not <i>many</i>, but a few. As such, I decided to create two websites: a
            professional personal site and an actually personal personal site. That way, when I send my site to
            somebody and am hoping to get a job with them, they don&#39;t have to read my science fiction short stories.
            However, I host both of my websites on my Pi, and I do that by virtual hosting. If you are not interested in
            this, you can skip this section, but if you want an additional site for the terrible poems you wrote in
            middle school, then this is the way to do it!
        </p>
        <p>
            First, rather than the default location of <span>/var/www/html</span>, put one of your
            sites at <span>/var/www/domain1/html</span> and the other at <span>/var/www/domain2/html</span>. At this point, it may be
            convenient to make an alias to <span>cd</span> into both of your domains. If you are
            using the fish shell, you can do this by
        </p>
        <p>alias --save domain1=&#39;cd /var/www/domain1/html&#39;</p>
        <p>
            Now, in order to make sure that they are both owned by you rather than root, you must run the command
        </p>
        <p>
            sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/domain_name/html
        </p>
        <p>for both domains, and run the command </p>
        <p>
            sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
        </p>
        <p>
        which is the correct permission setting for folders you want to be served on your site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you have to edit the configuration files! They are found at
            <span>/etc/apache2/sites-available</span>.
            Apache already makes a default config file for you: it is the file at
            <span>000-default.conf</span>.
            Copy this file into two different files, your_domain_1.conf and your_domain_2.conf.
            Now you will have a very basic config for both domains that looks something like this but
            with comments:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Firstly, you will want to change the *80 to *443, so that it intercepts HTTPS requests and HTTP
            requests, and then you will want to change the DocumentRoot to the root of the proper domain. There are
            some other fun changes you can make here, such as adding in lines that will redirect
            www.domainname.com to domainname.com, and for the 443 virtual host, links to the certificate that you
            should have installed via certbot on step 5. As such, rather than walking you through adding every
            single line of code, I will simply leave my config file here, with added comments for clarity:
        </p>

        

        <p>
            Feel free to use the above config file for both of your virtual hosts! However, beware of
            the <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/01/10/Be-aware-of-the-Makefile-effect">makefile
                effect</a>
            and make sure not to add to this without also pruning unnecessary lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you have your config files set up. It is time to enable them via the command:
        </p>
        <p>
            sudo a2ensite domainname.conf
        </p>
        <p>
            Run that for both conf files, and then remove the default conf file via the command:
        </p>
        <p>
            sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
        </p>
        <p>It should prompt you to run the command:</p>
        <p>systemctl reload apache2</p>
        <p>Run it and then test for config issues with</p>
        <p>sudo apache2ctl configtest</p>
        <p>If this comes back with no errors, you can restart Apache2</p>
        <p>sudo systemctl status apache2</p>
        <p>
            And you should be ready to go! Now you can have two domain names that point to the same public IP
            address, but depending on which domain name is searched, it will give you a different website, and you
            will finally have a safe online space for your terrible middle school poetry, far away from where a
            colleague
            might find them.
        </p>
        <h3 id="backups">Step 9: Backups and Version Control</h3>
        <p>So now you have a site up and running! You start showing it to people who you hope will hire you, and all
            of a sudden, somebody spills an entire jug of tomato juice onto your Pi! You should have backups of your
            site, just in case something like this happens. No hardware is ever safe. I know the cloud is just somebody
            else&#39;s computer, but at least somebody else&#39;s computer is at less risk than a Pi in a residential home.
            I recommend backing up your Pi on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">Jujutsu</a>, which are then stored on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="seo">Step 10: Improve SEO with Google Search Console</h3>
        <p>
            If you are trying to make a professional site to showcase your engineering skill, it is helpful if the
            site comes up in the browzer when your name is searched. You can make that happen by firstly adding keywords
            to
            your header, and then by making your name one of the keywords. Keywords are added to the header like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            &lt;meta name=&#34;keywords&#34; content=&#34;software, person2hire, my full name&#34;&gt;
        </p>
        <p>What if that is still not enough? This is where <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a> is useful.
            Register your site with them by navigating the linked page and clicking in the top-left corner where it
            allows
            you to claim domain names. Remember that you want to register a whole domain, not just the domain prefix. It
            will tell
            you that a &#34;txt&#34; record-type is preferable, but if you are using Njalla, then you
            want CNAME. You should see this popup:</p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/google_console.png" alt="Google Popup displaying CNAME Label and Target"/>
        <p>
            Go to Njalla and add a CNAME record corresponding to what Google told you to do. If you recall
            my previous image:
        </p>
        <img src="https://mirawelner.com/images/website_howto_img/njalla.png" alt="Njalla Records"/>
        <p>
            The CNAME Label/Host goes in the &#34;name&#34; column, and the CNAME Destination/Target goes in the content
            column.
        </p>

        <p>
            Google Search Console does not automatically give you better SEO, so you would have to pay for that.
            However, it does allow you to request that unindexed files be indexed, which gives you a sense of what
            Google is picking up on and what it isn&#39;t. If you notice that Google keeps indexing files
            that you don&#39;t want it to be indexing, you can address the issue. For example, I have several pdfs on my
            site which I
            do not want indexed. Instead, I want the html files that serve the pdfs to be indexed, because I can
            control their keywords, title text, and preview text/images. So when I noticed that Google was indexing
            the pdfs rather than the html files, I was able to address it my making a robots.txt file and an
            .htaccess file.
        </p>
        <p>
            A robots.txt file tells crawlers like Google and DuckDuckGo what they are allowed to look at. Bots
            will ignore robots.txt most of the time, but &#34;good&#34; bots like searchbots will respect it. My robots.txt
            file looks like this:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The first of these, <span>User-agent: *</span> means that this applies to all people or
            bots in contact with
            the website.
            <span>Allow: /</span> means that they are allowed to access anything in the server
            except the following
            things that are
            <span>Disallow</span>ed. These ensure that nothing in the
            txt folder (which I
            will discuss later), including the pdfs, is indexed.
        </p>
        <p>
            And as you can see at the end, I have a sitemap! The sitemap lists all the files that you want indexed,
            as well as a number indicating how important they are in comaprison to the rest of the site. So the files
            that
            need to be indexed first get a number closer to 1. I typically don&#39;t make the sitemaps myself; I
            just autogenerate them with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com">this free tool</a> and then edit them
            afterwards, because it will
            automatically add even pages that you want blocked, and the values that they give to each page may
            not be optimal.
        </p>
        <p>
            So you have your robots.txt file and your sitemap, and you give Google a few weeks to index your files.
            You log into Google Search Console and notice that all the files that you blocked were added! What is up
            with
            that?
        </p>
        <p>
            Just because Google&#39;s searchbot doesn&#39;t crawl files listed in robots.txt doesn&#39;t mean that it cannot
            index them if you or another party directly link those files. Robots.txt ensures that Google doesn&#39;t
            waste
            its limited crawl budget on your site looking at files that it can safely ignore, but in order to
            really ensure that the files you do not want linked are not linked, you need <span>.htaccess</span>. My .htaccess file looks like this:
        </p>
        <div><p>
            &lt;FilesMatch &#34;\.(css|pdf|ico)$&#34;&gt; # if the file is a css file, a pdf file, or an icon file</p></div>
        <p>
            You will have to change some stuff up to tailor the code to your site; however, this could serve as a
            skeleton for you to build onto. Keep in mind that Google can take a few weeks to index something and
            will sometimes refuse to index things for no clear reason,
            but if you are patient, you can use Google Search Console to nudge your site in the correct direction.
            Also keep in mind that if you are a programmer, some of the people who you interact with will likely use
            DuckDuckGo rather than Google, and unsurprisingly, there is no console for that. There isn&#39;t much you can do
            about that other than choose good keywords.
        </p>
        <h3 id="goat">Step 11: Track Viewers with GoatCounter</h3>
        <p>
            Google Search Console tells you how many times your site was clicked when searched in Google.
            However, it does not tell you how many times your site was viewed in general, including people who
            followed links. For that, you need <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.goatcounter.com">GoatCounter</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
            There are other ways to track users to your site, but GoatCounter is the most privacy-sensitive. It
            tells you nearly nothing about the user, only how they got to the site, their OS and screen size,
            their country, and the language their device used. The site gives clear instructions on how to
            add it to your site: you just paste their JavaScript in your <span>head</span>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="fail2ban">Step 12: Keep bots away with fail2ban </h3>
        <p>
            Another way to check who has visited your site is to check your logs, which are found in
            <span>/var/log/apache2</span>.
            However, if you look at either your error or your access logs, you will find bots! Some of these bots are
            neccecary, like the Google bot, but some are malicious. If a bot keeps searching for files that don&#39;t
            exist on your server, it is likely searching for files which correspond to common vulnerabilities. Even
            if your site doesn&#39;t have serious vulnerabilities, its safest to keep these bots out. After all, your site
            is
            connected to your own Wi-Fi in your own house.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way to do this is by installing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban">fail2ban</a>! It is
            an open source project, and it temporarily bans IP addresses that keep querying nonexistant files. You
            can make it a temporary ban, but I would not recommend that. Google cannot forget an address, so if
            you have files and then delete them, Google will keep them tracked and may occasionally ping your site to
            see
            if they have come back. If Google does that, you can tell it to buzz off for a bit, but you don&#39;t want to
            permaban the Google search bot!
        </p>

        <h3 id="upgrade">Step 13: Install UnattendedUpgrades to keep your Pi up to date</h3>
        <p>
            This isn&#39;t neccecary, but it can be useful. If you update your site every week, you can just
            remember to run
        </p>
        
        <p>
            whenever you SSH into your Pi. However if you are like me and only post once in a while, your Pi will go
            a long
            while without getting updated and upgraded. So it might be a good idea to install <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades">UnnatendedUpgrades</a>!
            While it&#39;s not essential for running a personal site, I have personally found it quite helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, it&#39;s somewhat tricky to install, because it is very version-dependant. As of today,
            Raspberry Pi OS runs on Debian 12 (Bookworm). To get UnattendedUpgrades running
            on that system, you need to install it along with its dependency:
        </p>
        <p>
            sudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges
        </p>
        <p>
            Once those are installed, navigate to <span>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/</span> and open the
            file
            <span>50unattended-upgrades</span>, which should have a lot of boilerplate code with
            some of it commented out. Navigate to the part of the file where it says,
        </p>
        <div><p>
            Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {</p></div>
        <p>
            It is up to you what parts of your website that you want to update automatically, but comment
            the lines correspondingto features that you do not want to update automatically and uncomment the ones that
            you do. I personally uncommented everything because I want my Pi to be completely up to date, even when I
            abandon it for months.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, you will want to navigate lower in the file and uncomment the following two lines:
        </p>
        <div><p>
            Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot &#34;true&#34;;</p></div>
        <p>
            If you like, you can change the time to a different time, but what this does is make it so that if the
            Pi needs to reboot, it does not reboot until 2AM when presumably fewer people will be on the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then finally, navigate to <span>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades</span>. You should
            see these lines:
        </p>
        <div><p>
            APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists &#34;1&#34;;</p></div>
        <p>
            And they should be uncommented. If they are commented, uncomment them. They ensure that the automatic
            updates are run. Then, test your script with
        </p>
        <p>
            sudo unattended-upgrades --dry-run --debug
        </p>
        <p>
            If it works, you should see many things printed out under &#34;whitelist&#34; and very few or none under
            &#34;blacklist,&#34; depending on how you chose to set things up.
        </p>

            Academics, such as professors and researchers, care primarily about my publications and the
            labs I&#39;ve worked in, which is not a huge surprise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hiring managers care about how many keywords are in my resume and on my site. One thing that I think helped
            a lot was when I added the tools and languages I used to all of my projects. For example, I specified in
            my resume that when I implemented a modified autoencoder which could determine the three primary
            spectra of a hyperspectral image, it was in the Python language. This is very useful to a hiring
            manager; imagine if I had implemented it in Julia? It would have been a totally different situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            But without exception, the real hackers and programmers who do actual software engineering, and this
            includes the cooler professors who I have spoken with, are most interested in the fact that I am
            running this site on a Pi, and reporting its CPU temp, CPU use, and the total and used RAM. This is
            ironically probably among the simplest projects I&#39;ve done, but it <i>looks really cool</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Step one of this is to make a script which gathers than infornmation and puts it into a text
            file in the server. The following file, which I call <code> getstats.sh</code>, is as
            follows:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This results in a file in the <span>/var/www/mirawelner.com/html/txt</span> folder,
            which as you may
            remember is blocked by <span>.htaccess</span> and <span>robots.txt</span>.

            Then in the <span>index.html</span> file, it is read with the following JavaScript:
        </p>
        <div><p>
            &lt;script defer src=&#34;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p></div>
        <p>
            Now you have both a JavaScript script to load the text file, and a bash script to generate it. All that&#39;s
            left to do is to create a CRON job to run it every minute. Run this command:
        </p>
        <p>
            crontab -e
        </p>
        <p>
            And at the bottom of the file, put this:
        </p>
        <p>
            */1 * * * * /home/pi/getstats.sh
        </p>
        <p>
            This will run the command every minute. And then you have a realtime display of the stats of your Pi!
        </p>

        <h3 id="crashtest">Step 15: Crash test your site via HackerNews</h3>
        <p>
            This step was developed entirely by accident; testing of site functionality is especially challenging when
            the only devices available for testing are your own phone and computer. My only other resource was to ask my
            friends what they think of my site, and whether the site works properly on their phones, computers, and
            tablets.
        </p>
        <p>
            But then, one of my posts, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mirawelner.com/posts/checkout.html">can we communally
                deprecate git checkout?</a>
            was on the front page of HackerNews for an hour or so. At one point during that hour, a helpful
            HackerNews user named whalesalad commented, &#34;Can we communally deprecate using monospaced fonts with
            full browser width content blocks for free form text?&#34;
        </p>
        <p>
            While I was at first mildly offended, after further thinking I decided that whalesalad was definitely
            correct. My posts were not easy to read on computer-sized screens.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I added in some margins and figured that would be the end of that. I was wrong, however, because
            then I got an email from another helpful user, who told me that the margins looked way too big on phones.
            I fixed the margin issue and responed to whalesalad, thanking them for the advice and telling them I had
            fixed it. But then that comment got other comments, including one from a user called politelemon, who was
            indeed polite in telling me that my site looked bad on Firefox Mobile, sending me a screenshot to prove it.
            Another of these comments was from user hooli_gan, who told me the same about my site on Chrome Mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking their advice, I tried to figure out what was going wrong, but I didn&#39;t need to worry: it turns out
            that
            my post had been read by the incredible Izkata, who not only told me that there was an issue but
            <i>inspected my
                CSS via the browser and told me what to fix</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their entire comment read:</p>
        
        <p>
            Izkata, thank you so much. You are incredible. This is why I sometimes love the software community:
            rather than just ignoring the unreadable site, this person took the time to inspect my code and share
            their software wisdom with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I fixed that issue, and then soon after, I got a discord message from a friend informing me that I had an
            issue with my image captions overlapping with the text, so I fixed
            that as well. My speed-coding leaves much to be desired, but I think I did a pretty good job considering the
            stress of fixing issues on the live codebase while my server was getting hundreds of hits.
        </p>
        <p>
            In any event, you may not be quite so lucky as me as to be blessed by kind internet strangers and a very
            good friend, but hopefully you find a way to somehow stress-test your site. But before you go, behold:
