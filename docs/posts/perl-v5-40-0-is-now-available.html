<p>perldelta - what is new for perl v5.40.0</p>



<p>This document describes differences between the 5.38.0 release and the 5.40.0 release.</p>



<h2 id="New-__CLASS__-Keyword"><a href="#New-__CLASS__-Keyword">#</a><a id="New"></a>New <code>__CLASS__</code> Keyword</h2>

<p>When using the new <code>class</code> feature, code inside a method, <code>ADJUST</code> block or field initializer expression is now permitted to use the new <code>__CLASS__</code> keyword. This yields a class name, similar to <code>__PACKAGE__</code>, but whereas that gives the compile-time package that the code appears in, the <code>__CLASS__</code> keyword is aware of the actual run-time class that the object instance is a member of. This makes it useful for method dispatch on that class, especially during constructors, where access to <code>$self</code> is not permitted.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc#__CLASS__">&#34;__CLASS__&#34; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

<h2 id=":reader-attribute-for-field-variables"><a href="#:reader-attribute-for-field-variables">#</a><a id="reader-attribute-for-field-variables"></a><code>:reader</code> attribute for field variables</h2>

<p>When using the <code>class</code> feature, field variables can now take a <code>:reader</code> attribute. This requests that an accessor method be automatically created that simply returns the value of the field variable from the given instance.</p>

<pre><code>field $name :reader;</code></pre>

<p>Is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>field $name;
method name () { return $name; }</code></pre>

<p>An alternative name can also be provided:</p>

<pre><code>field $name :reader(get_name);</code></pre>

<p>For more detail, see <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlclass#%3Areader">&#34;:reader&#34; in perlclass</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Permit-a-space-in-M-command-line-option"><a href="#Permit-a-space-in-M-command-line-option">#</a><a id="Permit"></a><a id="Permit-a-space-in--M-command-line-option"></a>Permit a space in <code>-M</code> command-line option</h2>

<p>When processing command-line options, perl now allows a space between the <code>-M</code> switch and the name of the module after it.</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -M Data::Dumper=Dumper -E &#39;say Dumper [1,2,3]&#39;</code></pre>

<p>This matches the existing behaviour of the <code>-I</code> option.</p>

<h2 id="Restrictions-to-use-VERSION-declarations"><a href="#Restrictions-to-use-VERSION-declarations">#</a><a id="Restrictions"></a>Restrictions to <code>use VERSION</code> declarations</h2>

<p>In Perl 5.36, a deprecation warning was added when downgrading a <code>use VERSION</code> declaration from one above version 5.11, to below. This has now been made a fatal error.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is now a fatal error to issue a subsequent <code>use VERSION</code> declaration when another is in scope, when either version is 5.39 or above. This is to avoid complications surrounding imported lexical functions from <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/builtin">builtin</a>. A deprecation warning has also been added for any other subsequent <code>use VERSION</code> declaration below version 5.39, to warn that it will no longer be permitted in Perl version 5.44.</p>

<h2 id="New-builtin::inf-and-builtin::nan-functions-(experimental)"><a href="#New-builtin::inf-and-builtin::nan-functions-(experimental)">#</a><a id="New1"></a><a id="New-builtin::inf-and-builtin::nan-functions-experimental"></a>New <code>builtin::inf</code> and <code>builtin::nan</code> functions (experimental)</h2>

<p>Two new functions, <code>inf</code> and <code>nan</code>, have been added to the <code>builtin</code> namespace. These act like constants that yield the floating-point infinity and Not-a-Number value respectively.</p>

<h2 id="New-^^-logical-xor-operator"><a href="#New-%5E%5E-logical-xor-operator">#</a><a id="New2"></a><a id="New-logical-xor-operator"></a>New <code>^^</code> logical xor operator</h2>

<p>Perl has always had three low-precedence logical operators <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code>, as well as three high-precedence bitwise versions <code>&amp;</code>, <code>^</code> and <code>|</code>. Until this release, while the medium-precedence logical operators of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> were also present, there was no exclusive-or equivalent. This release of Perl adds the final <code>^^</code> operator, completing the set.</p>

<pre><code>$x ^^ $y and say &#34;One of x or y is true, but not both&#34;;</code></pre>

<h2 id="try/catch-feature-is-no-longer-experimental"><a href="#try/catch-feature-is-no-longer-experimental">#</a><a id="try"></a><a id="try-catch-feature-is-no-longer-experimental"></a><code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> feature is no longer experimental</h2>

<p>Prior to this release, the <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> feature for handling errors was considered experimental. Introduced in Perl version 5.34.0, this is now considered a stable language feature and its use no longer prints a warning. It still must be enabled with <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/feature#The-%27try%27-feature">the &#39;try&#39; feature</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn#Try-Catch-Exception-Handling">&#34;Try Catch Exception Handling&#34; in perlsyn</a>.</p>

<h2 id="for-iterating-over-multiple-values-at-a-time-is-no-longer-experimental"><a href="#for-iterating-over-multiple-values-at-a-time-is-no-longer-experimental">#</a><a id="for"></a><code>for</code> iterating over multiple values at a time is no longer experimental</h2>

<p>Prior to this release, iterating over multiple values at a time with <code>for</code> was considered experimental. Introduced in Perl version 5.36.0, this is now considered a stable language feature and its use no longer prints a warning. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn#Compound-Statements">&#34;Compound Statements&#34; in perlsyn</a>.</p>

<h2 id="builtin-module-is-no-longer-experimental"><a href="#builtin-module-is-no-longer-experimental">#</a><a id="builtin"></a><code>builtin</code> module is no longer experimental</h2>

<p>Prior to this release, the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/builtin">builtin</a> module and all of its functions were considered experimental. Introduced in Perl version 5.36.0, this module is now considered stable its use no longer prints a warning. However, several of its functions are still considered experimental.</p>

<h2 id="The-:5.40-feature-bundle-adds-try"><a href="#The-:5.40-feature-bundle-adds-try">#</a><a id="The"></a>The <code>:5.40</code> feature bundle adds <code>try</code></h2>

<p>The latest version feature bundle now contains the recently-stablized feature <code>try</code>. As this feature bundle is used by the <code>-E</code> commandline switch, these are immediately available in <code>-E</code> scripts.</p>

<h2 id="use-v5.40;-imports-builtin-functions"><a href="#use-v5.40;-imports-builtin-functions">#</a><a id="use"></a><a id="use-v5.40-imports-builtin-functions"></a><code>use v5.40;</code> imports builtin functions</h2>

<p>In addition to importing a feature bundle, <code>use v5.40;</code> (or later versions) imports the corresponding <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/builtin#Version-Bundles">builtin version bundle</a>.</p>



<h2 id="CVE-2023-47038-Write-past-buffer-end-via-illegal-user-defined-Unicode-property"><a href="#CVE-2023-47038-Write-past-buffer-end-via-illegal-user-defined-Unicode-property">#</a><a id="CVE"></a><a id="CVE-2023-47038---Write-past-buffer-end-via-illegal-user-defined-Unicode-property"></a>CVE-2023-47038 - Write past buffer end via illegal user-defined Unicode property</h2>

<p>This vulnerability was reported directly to the Perl security team by Nathan Mills <code>the.true.nathan.mills@gmail.com</code>.</p>

<p>A crafted regular expression when compiled by perl 5.30.0 through 5.38.0 can cause a one-byte attacker controlled buffer overflow in a heap allocated buffer.</p>

<h2 id="CVE-2023-47039-Perl-for-Windows-binary-hijacking-vulnerability"><a href="#CVE-2023-47039-Perl-for-Windows-binary-hijacking-vulnerability">#</a><a id="CVE1"></a><a id="CVE-2023-47039---Perl-for-Windows-binary-hijacking-vulnerability"></a>CVE-2023-47039 - Perl for Windows binary hijacking vulnerability</h2>

<p>This vulnerability was reported to the Intel Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) by GitHub user ycdxsb <a href="https://github.com/ycdxsb/WindowsPrivilegeEscalation">https://github.com/ycdxsb/WindowsPrivilegeEscalation</a>. PSIRT then reported it to the Perl security team.</p>

<p>Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (<code>cmd.exe</code>). When running an executable which uses Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute <code>cmd.exe</code> within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory.</p>

<p>An attacker with limited privileges can exploit this behavior by placing <code>cmd.exe</code> in locations with weak permissions, such as <code>C:\ProgramData</code>. By doing so, when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations, arbitrary code can be executed.</p>



<h2 id="reset-EXPR-now-calls-set-magic-on-scalars"><a href="#reset-EXPR-now-calls-set-magic-on-scalars">#</a><a id="reset"></a>reset EXPR now calls set-magic on scalars</h2>

<p>Previously <code>reset EXPR</code> did not call set magic when clearing scalar variables. This meant that changes did not propagate to the underlying internal state where needed, such as for <code>$^W</code>, and did not result in an exception where the underlying magic would normally throw an exception, such as for <code>$1</code>.</p>

<p>This means code that had no effect before may now actually have an effect, including possibly throwing an exception.</p>

<p><code>reset EXPR</code> already called set magic when modifying arrays and hashes.</p>

<p>This has no effect on plain <code>reset</code> used to reset one-match searches as with <code>m?pattern?</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Calling-the-import-method-of-an-unknown-package-produces-a-warning"><a href="#Calling-the-import-method-of-an-unknown-package-produces-a-warning">#</a><a id="Calling"></a>Calling the import method of an unknown package produces a warning</h2>

<p>Historically, it has been possible to call the <code>import</code> or <code>unimport</code> method of any class, including ones which have not been defined, with an argument and not experience an error. For instance, this code will not throw an error in Perl 5.38:</p>

<pre><code>Class::That::Does::Not::Exist-&gt;import(&#34;foo&#34;);</code></pre>

<p>However, as of Perl 5.39.1 this is deprecated and will issue a warning. Note that calling these methods with no arguments continues to silently succeed and do nothing. For instance,</p>

<pre><code>Class::That::Does::Not::Exist-&gt;import();</code></pre>

<p>will continue to not throw an error. This is because every class implicitly inherits from the class <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/UNIVERSAL">UNIVERSAL</a> which now defines an <code>import</code> method. In older perls there was no such method defined, and instead the method calls for <code>import</code> and <code>unimport</code> were special cased to not throw errors if there was no such method defined.</p>

<p>This change has been added because it makes it easier to detect case typos in <code>use</code> statements when running on case-insensitive file systems. For instance, on Windows or other platforms with case-insensitive file systems on older perls the following code</p>

<pre><code>use STRICT &#39;refs&#39;;</code></pre>

<p>would silently do nothing as the module is actually called <i>strict.pm</i>, not <i>STRICT.pm</i>, so it would be loaded but its import method would never be called. It will also detect cases where a user passes an argument when using a package that does not provide its own import, for instance most &#34;pure&#34; class definitions do not define an import method.</p>

<h2 id="return-no-longer-allows-an-indirect-object"><a href="#return-no-longer-allows-an-indirect-object">#</a><a id="return"></a><code>return</code> no longer allows an indirect object</h2>

<p>The <code>return</code> operator syntax now rejects indirect objects. In most cases this would compile and even run, but wasn&#39;t documented and could produce confusing results, for example:</p>

<pre><code># note that sum hasn&#39;t been defined
sub sum_positive {
    return sum grep $_ &gt; 0, @_;
    # unexpectedly parsed as:
    #   return *sum, grep $_ &gt; 0, @_;
    # ... with the bareword acting like an extra (typeglob) argument
}
say for sum_positive(-1, 2, 3)</code></pre>

<p>produced:</p>

<pre><code>*main::sum
2
3</code></pre>

<h2 id="Class-barewords-no-longer-resolved-as-file-handles-in-method-calls-under-no-feature-&#34;bareword_filehandles&#34;"><a href="#Class-barewords-no-longer-resolved-as-file-handles-in-method-calls-under-no-feature-%22bareword_filehandles%22">#</a><a id="Class"></a><a id="Class-barewords-no-longer-resolved-as-file-handles-in-method-calls-under-no-feature-bareword_filehandles"></a>Class barewords no longer resolved as file handles in method calls under <code>no feature &#34;bareword_filehandles&#34;</code></h2>

<p>Under <code>no feature &#34;bareword_filehandles&#34;</code> bareword file handles continued to be resolved in method calls:</p>

<pre><code>open FH, &#34;&lt;&#34;, $somefile or die;
no feature &#39;bareword_filehandles&#39;;
FH-&gt;binmode;</code></pre>

<p>This has been fixed, so the:</p>

<pre><code>FH-&gt;binmode;</code></pre>

<p>will attempt to resolve <code>FH</code> as a class, typically resulting in a runtime error.</p>

<p>The standard file handles such as <code>STDOUT</code> continue to be resolved as a handle:</p>

<pre><code>no feature &#39;bareword_filehandles&#39;;
STDOUT-&gt;flush; # continues to work</code></pre>

<p>Note that once perl resolves a bareword name as a class it will continue to do so:</p>

<pre><code>package SomeClass {
    sub somemethod{}
}
open SomeClass, &#34;&lt;&#34;, &#34;somefile&#34; or die;
# SomeClass resolved as a handle
SomeClass-&gt;binmode;
{
    no feature &#34;bareword_filehandles&#34;;
    SomeClass-&gt;somemethod;
}
# SomeClass resolved as a class
SomeClass-&gt;binmode;</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:</p>

<h3 id="perlapi"><a href="#perlapi">#</a><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi">perlapi</a></h3>

<ul>

<li><p>Corrected the documentation for <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi#form"><code>Perl_form</code></a>, <code>form_nocontext</code>, and <code>vform</code>, which claimed that any later call to one of them will destroy the previous returns from any. This hasn&#39;t been true since 5.6.0, except it does remain true if these are called during global destruction. With that caveat, the return of each of these is a fresh string in a temporary that will automatically be freed by a call to <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi#FREETMPS">&#34;<code>FREETMPS</code>&#34; in perlapi</a> or at at places such as statement boundaries.</p>

<li><p>Several internal functions now have documentation - the various <code>newSUB</code> functions, <code>newANONLIST()</code>, <code>newANONHASH()</code>, <code>newSVREF()</code> and similar.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="perlclass"><a href="#perlclass">#</a><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlclass">perlclass</a></h3>

<p>The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag">perldiag</a>.</p>

<h2 id="New-Diagnostics"><a href="#New-Diagnostics">#</a><a id="New4"></a>New Diagnostics</h2>

<h3 id="New-Errors"><a href="#New-Errors">#</a><a id="New5"></a>New Errors</h3>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Cannot-use-__CLASS__-outside-of-a-method-or-field-initializer-expression">Cannot use __CLASS__ outside of a method or field initializer expression</a></p>

<p>(F) A <code>__CLASS__</code> expression yields the class name of the object instance executing the current method, and therefore it can only be placed inside an actual method (or method-like expression, such as a field initializer expression).</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#get_layers%3A-unknown-argument-%27%25s%27">get_layers: unknown argument &#39;%s&#39;</a></p>

<p>(F) You called PerlIO::get_layers() with an unknown argument. Legal arguments are provided in key/value pairs, with the keys being one of <code>input</code>, <code>output</code> or <code>detail</code>, followed by a boolean.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#UNIVERSAL-does-not-export-anything">UNIVERSAL does not export anything</a></p>

<p>(F) You asked UNIVERSAL to export something, but UNIVERSAL is the base class for all classes and contains no exportable symbols.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Builtin-version-bundle-%22%25s%22-is-not-supported-by-Perl">Builtin version bundle &#34;%s&#34; is not supported by Perl</a></p>

<p>(F) You attempted to <code>use builtin :ver</code> for a version number that is either older than 5.39 (when the ability was added), or newer than the current perl version.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Invalid-version-bundle-%22%25s%22">Invalid version bundle &#34;%s&#34;</a></p>

<p>(F) A version number that is used to specify an import bundle during a <code>use builtin ...</code> statement must be formatted as <code>:MAJOR.MINOR</code> with an optional third component, which is ignored. Each component must be a number of 1 to 3 digits. No other characters are permitted. The value that was specified does not conform to these rules.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Missing-comma-after-first-argument-to-return">Missing comma after first argument to return</a></p>

<p>(F) While certain operators allow you to specify a filehandle or an &#34;indirect object&#34; before the argument list, <code>return</code> isn&#39;t one of them.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Out-of-memory-during-vec-in-lvalue-context">Out of memory during vec in lvalue context</a></p>

<p>(F) An attempt was made to extend a string beyond the largest possible memory allocation by assigning to <code>vec()</code> called with a large second argument.</p>

<p>(This case used to throw a generic <code>Out of memory!</code> error.)</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Cannot-create-an-object-of-incomplete-class-%22%25s%22">Cannot create an object of incomplete class &#34;%s&#34;</a></p>

<p>(F) An attempt was made to create an object of a class where the start of the class definition has been seen, but the class has not been completed.</p>

<p>This can happen for a failed eval, or if you attempt to create an object at compile time before the class is complete:</p>

<pre><code>eval &#34;class Foo {&#34;; Foo-&gt;new; # error
class Bar { BEGIN { Bar-&gt;new } }; # error</code></pre>

<p>Previously perl would assert or crash. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22159">GH #22159</a>]</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="New-Warnings"><a href="#New-Warnings">#</a><a id="New6"></a>New Warnings</h3>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Forked-open-%27%25s%27-not-meaningful-in-%3C%3E">Forked open &#39;%s&#39; not meaningful in &lt;&gt;</a></p>

<p>(S inplace) You had <code>|-</code> or <code>-|</code> in <code>@ARGV</code> and tried to use <code>&lt;&gt;</code> to read from it.</p>

<p>Previously this would fork and produce a confusing error message. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21176">GH #21176</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Attempt-to-call-undefined-%25s-method-with-arguments-%28%22%25s%22%25s%29-via-package-%22%25s%22-%28Perhaps-you-forgot-to-load-the-package%3F%29">Attempt to call undefined %s method with arguments (&#34;%s&#34;%s) via package &#34;%s&#34; (Perhaps you forgot to load the package?)</a></p>

<p>(D deprecated::missing_import_called_with_args) You called the <code>import()</code> or <code>unimport()</code> method of a class that has no import method defined in its inheritance graph, and passed an argument to the method. This is very often the sign of a misspelled package name in a use or require statement that has silently succeeded due to a case insensitive file system.</p>

<p>Another common reason this may happen is when mistakenly attempting to import or unimport a symbol from a class definition or package which does not use <code>Exporter</code> or otherwise define its own <code>import</code> or <code>unimport</code> method.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Changes-to-Existing-Diagnostics"><a href="#Changes-to-Existing-Diagnostics">#</a><a id="Changes1"></a>Changes to Existing Diagnostics</h2>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Name-%22%25s%3A%3A%25s%22-used-only-once%3A-possible-typo">Name &#34;%s::%s&#34; used only once: possible typo</a></p>

<p>This warning now honors being marked as fatal. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13814">GH #13814</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Out-of-memory-in-perl%3A%25s">Out of memory in perl:%s</a></p>

<p>There used to be several places in the perl core that would print a generic <code>Out of memory!</code> message and abort when memory allocation failed, giving no indication which program it was that ran out of memory. These have been modified to include the word <code>perl</code> and the general area of the allocation failure, e.g. <code>Out of memory in perl:util:safesysrealloc</code>. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21672">GH #21672</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Possible-precedence-issue-with-control-flow-operator-%28%25s%29">Possible precedence issue with control flow operator (%s)</a></p>

<p>This warning now mentions the name of the control flow operator that triggered the diagnostic (e.g. <code>return</code>, <code>exit</code>, <code>die</code>, etc).</p>

<p>It also covers more cases: Previously, the warning was only triggered if a low-precedence logical operator (like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>) was involved. Now it is also shown for misleading code like this:</p>

<pre><code>exit $x ? 0 : 1;  # actually parses as: exit($x) ? 0 : 1;
exit $x == 0;     # actually parses as: exit($x) == 0;</code></pre>

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag#Use-of-uninitialized-value%25s">Use of uninitialized value%s</a></p>

<p>This warning is now slightly more accurate in cases involving <code>length</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, or <code>splice</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my $x;
length($x) == 0
# Before:
#  Use of uninitialized value $x in numeric eq (==) at ...
# Now:
#  Use of uninitialized value length($x) in numeric eq (==) at ...</code></pre>

<p>That is, the warning no longer implies that <code>$x</code> was used directly as an operand of <code>==</code>, which it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Similarly:</p>

<pre><code>my @xs;
shift @xs == 0
# Before:
#  Use of uninitialized value within @xs in numeric eq (==) at ...
# Now:
#  Use of uninitialized value shift(@xs) in numeric eq (==) at ...</code></pre>

<p>This is more accurate because there never was an <code>undef</code> within <code>@xs</code> as the warning implied. (The warning for <code>pop</code> works analogously.)</p>

<p>Finally:</p>

<pre><code>my @xs = (1, 2, 3);
splice(@xs, 0, 0) == 0
# Before:
#  Use of uninitialized value within @xs in numeric eq (==) at ...
# Now:
#  Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at ...</code></pre>

<p>That is, in cases where <code>splice</code> returns <code>undef</code>, it no longer unconditionally blames its first argument. This was misleading because <code>splice</code> can return <code>undef</code> even if none of its arguments contain <code>undef</code>.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><code>microperl</code>, long broken and of unclear present purpose, has been removed as promised in <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5180delta#Future-Deprecations">Perl 5.18</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>



<p>Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release. Furthermore, these significant changes were made:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Update <i>nm</i> output parsing for Darwin in <i>t/porting/libperl.t</i> to handle changes in the output of nm on Darwin. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21117">GH #21117</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><i>t/op/magic.t</i> would fail when <code>ps</code> was the BusyBox implementation, since that doesn&#39;t support the <code>-p</code> flag and otherwise ignores a process id on the command-line. This caused <i>TEST</i> failures on BusyBox systems such as Alpine Linux. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17542">GH #17542</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><i>porting/globvar.t</i> now uses the more portable <code>nm -P ...</code> to fetch the names defined in an object file. The parsing of the names found in the object is now separated from processing them to handle the duplication between local and global definitions on AIX. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21637">GH #21637</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>A test was added to <i>lib/locale_threads.t</i> that extensively stress tests locale handling. It turns out that the libc implementations on various platforms have bugs in this regard, including Linux, Windows, *BSD derivatives including Darwin, and others. Experimental versions of this test have been used in the past few years to find bugs in the Perl implementation and in those platforms, as well as to develop workarounds in the Perl implementation, where feasible, for the platform bugs. Multiple bug report tickets have been filed against platforms, and some have been fixed. The test checks that platforms that purport to support thread-safe locale handling actually do so (and that perl works properly on those that do; The read-only variable <code>${^SAFE_LOCALES}</code> is set to 1 if perl thinks the platform can handle this, whatever the platform&#39;s documentation says).</p>

<p>Also tested for is if the various locale categories can indeed be set independently to disparate locales. (An example of where you might want to do this is if you are a Western Canadian living and working in Holland. You likely will want to have the <code>LC_MONETARY</code> locale be set to where you are living, but have the other parts of your locale retain your native English values. Later, as you get a bit more comfortable with Dutch, and in order to communicate better with your colleagues, you might want to change <code>LC_TIME</code> and <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> to Dutch, while leaving <code>LC_CTYPE</code> and <code>LC_COLLATE</code> set to English indefinitely.)</p>

</li>
<li><p>The test <i>t/porting/libperl.t</i> will no longer run in maint releases. This test is sensitive to changes in the output of <i>nm</i> on various platforms, and tarballs aren&#39;t updated as we update this test in blead.

</dl>



<ul>

<li><p><code>PERL_RC_STACK</code> build option added.</p>

<p>This new build option is highly experimental and is not enabled by default. Perl can be built with it by using the <i>Configure</i> option <code>-Accflags=&#39;-DPERL_RC_STACK&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>It makes the argument stack bump the reference count of SVs pushed onto it. It is mostly functional, but currently slow and incomplete.</p>

<p>It is intended in the long term that this build option will become the default option, and then finally the only option; but this will be many releases away.</p>

<p>In particular, there is currently no support within XS code for using these new features. So under this build option, all XS functions are called via a backwards-compatibility wrapper which slows down such calls.</p>

<p>In future releases, better support for XS code is intended to be added. It is expected that straightforward XS code will eventually be able to make use of a reference-counted stack without modification, with any heavy lifting being handled by the XS compiler (<code>xsubpp</code>) and the macros which it outputs. But code which implements PP() functions will eventually have to be modified to use a new PP API: rpp_foo() rather than PUSHs() etc. But this new API is not yet stable, nor has it yet been back-ported via <code>Devel::PPPort</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlguts#Reference-counted-argument-stack">perlguts</a> for more details.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new API function has been added that simplifies C (or XS) code that creates <code>LISTOP</code> optree fragments. <code>newLISTOPn()</code> is a variadic function that takes a <code>NULL</code>-terminated list of child op pointers, and constructs a new checked <code>LISTOP</code> to contain them all. This is simpler than creating a new plain <code>OP_LIST</code>, adding each child individually, and finally calling <code>op_convert_list()</code> in most code fragments.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>eval_sv()</code> API now accepts the <code>G_USEHINTS</code> flag, which uses the hints such as strict and features from <code>PL_curcop</code> instead of the default, which is to use default hints, e.g. no <code>use vX.XX;</code>, no strict, default features.</p>

<p>Beware if you use this flag in XS code: your evaluated code will need to support whatever strictness or features are in effect at the point your XS function is called.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21415">GH #21415</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>PERL_VERSION_LE</code> has been fixed to properly check for &#34;less than or equal&#34; rather than &#34;less than&#34;.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>dAX</code>, <code>dITEMS</code> and hence <code>dXSARGS</code> now declare <code>AX</code> and <code>items</code> as <code>Stack_off_t</code> rather than <code>SSize_t</code>. This reverts back to compatibility with pre-64-bit stack support for default builds of perl where <code>Stack_off_t</code> is <code>I32</code>. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21782">GH #21782</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new function is now available to <code>XS</code> code, <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi#sv_langinfo">&#34;sv_langinfo&#34; in perlapi</a>. This provides the same information as the existing <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi#Perl_langinfo8">&#34;Perl_langinfo8&#34; in perlapi</a>, but returns an SV instead of a <span><code>char *</code></span>, so that programmers don&#39;t have to concern themselves with the UTF-8ness of the result. This new function is now the preferred interface for <code>XS</code> code to the <a href="http://man.he.net/man3/nl_langinfo">nl_langinfo(3)</a> <code>libc</code> function. From Perl space, this information continues to be provided by the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/I18N::Langinfo">I18N::Langinfo</a> module.</p>

</li>
<li><p>glibc has an undocumented equivalent function to querylocale(), which our experience indicates is reliable. When this is function is used, it removes the need for perl to keep its own records, hence is more efficient and guaranteed to be accurate. Use of this function can be disabled by defining the <code>NO_NL_LOCALE_NAME</code> build option</p>

</li>
</ul>



<ul>

<li><p>The delimiter <code>SYRIAC COLON SKEWED LEFT/RIGHT</code> pair has been removed from the ones recognized by the <code>extra_paired_delimiters</code> feature. (See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators">&#34;Quote and Quote-like Operators&#34; in perlop</a>.) This is because those characters are normally written right-to-left, and this could be visually confusing [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22228">GH #22228</a>]. The change was actually to forbid any right-to-left delimiters, but this pair is the only current instance that meets this criterion. By policy, this change means that the <code>extra_paired_delimiters</code> feature cannot be considered to have been stable long enough for its experimental status to be removed.</p>

</li>

<li><p>Fixed a number of issues where <code>I32</code> was used as a string offset or size rather than <code>SSize_t</code> or <code>STRLEN</code>/<code>size_t</code> [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21012">GH #21012</a>]</p>

<li><p>sv_utf8_decode() would truncate the SVs pos() value. This wasn&#39;t visible via utf8::decode().</p>

</li>
<li><p>When compiling a constant folded hash key, the length was truncated when creating the shared SV. Since hash keys over 2GB are not supported, throw a compilation error instead.</p>

</li>
<li><p>msgrcv() incorrectly called get magic on the buffer SV and failed to call set magic on completion. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21012">GH #21012</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>msgrcv() used the size parameter to resize the buffer before validating it. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21012">GH #21012</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Inheriting from a class that was hierarchically an ancestor of the new class, eg. <code> class A::B :isa(A) { ... } </code>, would not attempt to load the parent class. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21332">GH #21332</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Declared references can now be used with <code>state</code> variables. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21351">GH #21351</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Trailing elements in an <code>unshift</code>ed and resized array will now always be initialized. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21265">GH #21265</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Make <code>use 5.036</code> respect the -X flag</p>

<p>perl&#39;s -X flag disables all warnings globally, but «use 5.036» didn&#39;t respect that until now. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21431">GH #21431</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed an OP leak when an error was produced for initializer for a class field. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20812">GH #20812</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed a leak of the return value when smartmatching against a code reference.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed a slowdown in repeated substitution replacements using special variables, such as <code>s/....x$1/g</code>. It actually makes all string concatenations involving such &#34;magic&#34; variables less slow, but the slowdown was more noticeable on repeated substitutions due to extra memory usage that was only freed after the last iteration. The slowdown started in perl 5.28.0 - which generally sped up string concatenation but slowed down when using special variables. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21360">GH #21360</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Lexical names from the enclosing scope in a lexical sub or closure weren&#39;t visible to code executed by calling <code>eval EXPR;</code> from the <code>DB</code> package. This was introduced in 5.18 in an attempt to prevent subs from retaining a reference to their outer scope, but this broke the special behaviour of <code>eval EXPR;</code> in package DB.</p>

<p>This incidentally fixed a TODO test for <code>B::Deparse</code>. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19370">GH #19370</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Optionally support an argument stack over 2**32 entries on 64-bit platforms. This requires 32GB of memory just for the argument stack pointers itself, so you will require a significantly more memory to take advantage of this.</p>

<p>To enable this add <code>-Accflags=-DPERL_STACK_OFFSET_SSIZET</code> or equivalent to the <code>Configure</code> command-line.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20917">GH #20917</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21523">GH #21523</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed various problems with join() where modifications to the separator could be handled inconsistently, or could access released memory. Changes to the separator from magic or overloading for values in the <code>LIST</code> no longer have an effect on the resulting joined string. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21458">GH #21458</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t clear the integer flag <code>IOK</code> from lines in the <code>@{&#34;_&lt;$sourcefile&#34;}</code> array when a <code>dbstate</code> op is removed for that line. This was broken when fixing [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19198">GH #19198</a>]. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21564">GH #21564</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Many bug fixes have been made for using locales under threads and in embedded perls. And workarounds for libc bugs have been added. As a result thread-safe locale handling is now the default under OpenBSD, and MingW when compiled with UCRT.</p>

<p>However, testing has shown that Darwin&#39;s implementation of thread-safe locale handling has bugs. So now Perl doesn&#39;t attempt to use the thread-safe operations when compiled on Darwin.</p>

<p>As before, you can check to see if your program is running with thread-safe locales by checking if the value of <code>${^SAFE_LOCALES}</code> is 1.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Various bugs have been fixed when perl is configured with <code>-Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_NUMERIC</code> or any other locale category (or categories).</p>

</li>
<li><p>Not all locale categories need be set to the same locale. Perl now works around bugs in the libc implementations of locale handling on some platforms that previously could result in mojibake.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>LC_ALL</code> is represented in one of two ways when not all locale categories are set to the same locale. On some platforms, such as Linux and Windows, the representation is of the form of a series of <code>&#39;category=locale-name&#39;</code> pairs. On other platforms, such as *BSD, the representation is positional like <span><code><i>name1</i> / <i>name2</i> / ... </code></span>. <i>name1</i> is always for a particular category as defined by the platform, as are the other names. The sequence that separates the names (the <span><code> / </code></span> above) also varies by platform. Previously, perl had problems with platforms that used the positional notation. This is now fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A bug has been fixed in the regexp engine with an optimisation that applies to the <code>+</code> quantifier where it was followed by a <code>(*SKIP)</code> pattern.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21534">GH #21534</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>The tmps (mortal) stack now grows exponentially. Previously it grew linearly, so if it was growing incrementally, such as through many calls to sv_2mortal(), on a system where realloc() is O(size), the performance would be O(n*n). With exponential grows this changes to amortized O(n). [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21654">GH #21654</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Lexical subs now have a new stub in the pad for each recursive call into the containing function. This fixes two problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If the lexical sub called the containing function, a &#34;Can&#39;t undef active subroutine&#34; error would be thrown. For example:</p>

<pre><code>use v5.36.0;
sub outer($oc) {
    my sub inner ($c) {
         outer($c-1) if $c; # Can&#39;t undef active subroutine
    }
    inner($oc);
}
outer(2);</code></pre>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18606">GH #18606</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>If the lexical sub was called from a recursive call into the containing function, this would overwrite the bindings to the closed over variables in the lexical sub, so calls into the lexical sub from the outer recursive call would have access to the variables from the inner recursive call:</p>

<pre><code>use v5.36.0;
sub outer ($x) {
    my sub inner ($label) {
        say &#34;$label $x&#34;;
    }
    inner(&#34;first&#34;);
    outer(&#34;inner&#34;) if $x eq &#34;outer&#34;;
    # this call to inner() sees the wrong $x
    inner(&#34;second&#34;);
}
outer(&#34;outer&#34;);</code></pre>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21987">GH #21987</a>]</p>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>prepare_export_lexical() was separately saving <code>PL_comppad</code> and <code>PL_curpad</code>, this could result in <code>PL_curpad</code> being restored to a no longer valid value, resulting in a panic when importing lexicals in some cases. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21981">GH #21981</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>A string eval() operation in the scope of a <code>use VERSION</code> declaration would sometimes emit spurious &#34;Downgrading a use VERSION declaration&#34; warnings due to an inconsistency in the way the version number was stored. This is now fixed. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22121">GH #22121</a>]</p>
