                <p>
                    augurs can be used to identify groups of series that behave
                    similarly through time. This can be slow for large number of
                    series but can be parallelized!

                <p>
                    A similar but easier problem is to identify series that are
                    outliers: those which behave differently to the majority of
                    series. There are several algorithms; this demo shows the
                    DBSCAN algorithm.

                    augurs contains several forecasting algorithms, including
                    <a href="https://robjhyndman.com/publications/mstl/">MSTL</a>, which is a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure for
                    modelling multiple seasonalities, based on LOESS.

                    augurs also contains an implementation of the
                    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">Prophet</a>
                    forecasting algorithm, which is a decomposable time series
                    model with three main components: trend, seasonality, and
                    holidays.

                <p>
                    augurs also exposes functionality from the excellent
                    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/changepoint"><code>changepoint</code></a>
                    crate, which provides a Bayesian approach to detecting
                    changepoints in time series data. Here, each changepoint is
                    highlighted in the plot.
