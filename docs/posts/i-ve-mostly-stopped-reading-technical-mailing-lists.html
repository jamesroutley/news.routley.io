    <h1>I&#39;ve mostly stopped reading technical mailing lists</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I&#39;ve mostly stopped reading technical mailing lists</h2>

	<p><small>May 11, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Once upon a time, I subscribed to and read a lot of mailing lists
for the software we used, things like Exim, Dovecot, Prometheus,
ZFS, OmniOS, and so on. These days I&#39;ve mostly stopped, which is a
shift that makes me a bit sad. Technically I&#39;m still subscribed to
some of these mailing lists, but in practice all their incoming
messages get filed away to a folder and periodically I throw out
the accumulated contents and start again. These days I only read
one of these mailing lists on the rare occasion when I&#39;m asking a
question on it</p>

<p>Some of this is because my interests and available time have shifted.
It no longer feels so interesting and compelling to keep up with these
mailing lists, so I don&#39;t; usually I feel I have better things to do
than to slog through any of them. But that &#39;slog through&#39; phrasing is
a clue to another reason, where reading some of these lists doesn&#39;t
feel as productive or engaging as it used to. It&#39;s not all of the
mailing lists; some of them simply have more volume than I have time and
enthusiasm for, with not enough important information. But with some
mailing lists, it feels like the character of them has changed over
time to one that is significantly less useful to me.</p>

<p>(To some extent I expect all technical mailing lists to get less useful
for me over time. In the beginning I&#39;m relatively new to the software
and so I can learn a lot from listening in on ongoing discussions and
hearing routine questions and answers. As I become more experienced in
whatever it is, more and more of the messages are about things I already
know and the nuggets of new information are increasingly rare.)</p>

<p>The primary change I&#39;ve noticed of these mailing lists is that they
see a lot more questions that are either basic or very specific,
where if I had the question I would have expected to answer it
myself by reading through the documentation. In the beginning I had
unkind descriptions of these sorts of questions, but I&#39;ve come to
be more sympathetic to them, especially the questions that come
from people abroad who may not have English as their first language.
The unfortunate fact is that projects aren&#39;t necessarily well
documented and their documentation probably is dauntingly hard to
read for people who aren&#39;t fluent in technical English, and people
have work to get done (using those projects). Turning to the project
user mailing list and asking their questions, if it works, is
probably much faster than the alternatives (and their boss may be
yelling at them to get it done ASAP).</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, where <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/MailingListsVsForums">the differences between mailing
lists and forums</a> become pointedly
relevant to my experiences with mailing lists. My current mail
reading environment is not well suited to situations where a large
amount of the volume is uninteresting to me and I&#39;m picking through
it for the small number of interesting discussions of interesting
issues. In a forum, I could ignore entire topic areas and most of
the threads, focusing only on some specific ones of interests; in
my current mailing list environment, I drown and stop reading.</p>

<p>I could likely manage to do better with various alternative ways of
following these mailing lists. But although I kind of miss being the
sort of person who reads mailing lists for software I use (and tries to
write helpful responses), the amount of value I might get out of doing
this has so far felt too low to motivate me to do anything. Just not
reading things is easier and I&#39;m probably not missing much.</p>

<p>(Pragmatically, some software I use has forums instead of mailing lists
and I don&#39;t try to follow those either. As much as I would like it
to be otherwise, I think my interests and enthusiasms have shifted
significantly from the past. Am I burned out on the whole &#39;mailing
list/forum&#39; thing? Maybe.)</p>
