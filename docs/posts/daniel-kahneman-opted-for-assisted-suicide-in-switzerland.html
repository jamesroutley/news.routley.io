</div><p data-t-name="Paragraph">In March 2024, Daniel Kahneman celebrated his 90th birthday - surrounded by his partner Barbara Tversky, his daughter and her family in Paris.</p>

<p data-t-name="Paragraph">The Israeli-American psychologist strolled through the city, visited museums and the ballet, enjoyed souffl√©s and chocolate mousse. They were days full of life.</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">But towards the end of his stay, Kahneman began to send a personal message to close friends: a farewell email. On March 26, he left his family and flew to Zurich. One day later, he died by assisted suicide.</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">In the email, he wrote openly about his decision, as the<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/books/daniel-kahneman-assisted-suicide-9fb16124">Wall Street Journal</a>has now revealed: He was convinced that the suffering and humiliations of old age were superfluous - and that it was now time to go.</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">He wanted to &#34;forestall natural decline, not slip helplessly into a state&#34; that he himself had experienced with his mother, his wife Anne Treisman and other loved ones.</p>

<p data-t-name="Paragraph">His partner died in 2018 as a result of vascular dementia. The loss affected him deeply.</p><h2>Kahneman wanted to preserve his autonomy until the end</h2><p data-t-name="Paragraph">Although Daniel Kahneman neither suffered from dementia nor required dialysis, he said he noticed an &#34;increase in mental lapses and a decline in his kidney function&#34;.</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">His decision seems to have been based less on his famous scientific thinking and more on a very personal feeling. He wanted to retain his autonomy until the end and to shape his own end.</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">Kahneman knew that many would see his decision as premature. But that was exactly what he intended, he wrote: If you wait until a life is &#34;obviously no longer worth living&#34;, it is already too late.</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">Therefore, his move was inevitably premature. He had spoken about it with some people close to him, and even though they initially resisted, they had finally accepted his decision.</p><h2>Kahneman: &#34;Thank you all for helping me&#34;</h2><p data-t-name="Paragraph">Daniel Kahneman did not want to make a statement or start a debate. &#34;I am not ashamed of my decision,&#34; he wrote, &#34;but I don&#39;t want it to be discussed publicly either.&#34;</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">Even in death, the Nobel laureate remained modest - his wish was that his passing should not dominate the obituaries.</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">He spent his last days in Paris - remembering, enjoying, writing. And even at the end, when asked what he would like to do, he said: &#34;I would like to learn something.&#34;</p><p data-t-name="Paragraph">Kahneman lived to the end as a curious researcher. He closed his email with the words: &#34;Thank you all for helping me to make this life a good one.&#34;</p><div data-t-name="ContentList">
