    <h1>Carp lang: statically typed Lisp, no GC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Born out of frustration with current tools for digital game making — and a love for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages — I invented Carp. It’s a programming language designed with game making in mind, focused on speed and predictable performance. Also, it has the kind of tooling and syntax that I prefer. Hopefully it will make me and others feel a little bit better while programming.</p>

<p>The first version of the compiler was made 2015 - 2016, attracting a fair bit of attention in the programming community. In the spring of 2017 I rebooted the project, rewriting it in Haskell (it used to be C). The project is open source and available for your viewing at <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp">Github</a>. There you can also find documentation explaining how to use the language, and a link to our chat group on gitter.im where you can ask questions and talk to the people involved.</p>
