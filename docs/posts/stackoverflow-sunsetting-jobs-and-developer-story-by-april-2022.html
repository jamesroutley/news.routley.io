    <h1>StackOverflow: Sunsetting Jobs and Developer Story by April 2022</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
                
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> – On March 31, 2022, we will discontinue Stack Overflow Jobs and Developer Story. This includes all job listings, saved searches, applications, messages, recommended job matches, job ads, developer story, saved resumes, and the salary calculator.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Back in April 2021, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/07/an-update-on-our-product-led-saas-transformation/">Prashanth posted an update</a> on the transformation of our company and he provided a high-level overview of the changes planned for our Talent business:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We are realigning the Talent business to focus more on customer employer branding and company awareness needs, and moving away from job slots and direct hiring. This will tie the product closer to what we offer through Stack Overflow Advertising [...]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/406651/1328704">Some of you wondered</a> what practical changes this shift in strategy would bring about. In the months that followed, we realigned our internal teams and mapped out the plan to transform our Talent &amp; Advertising businesses.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Before going into specific changes, I want to take a moment to talk about why we decided to transform these businesses and products. As we considered the next stage of growth for us as a company, we went back to product fundamentals and asked ourselves: how can we leverage our unique position to solve real, meaningful problems for our users and customers?</p>
<p>While Talent &amp; Jobs helped us get to where we are over the past decade, the talent acquisition space is not one where we have a strong competitive advantage. Developers, as you all know, don’t have a hard time finding job opportunities. The problem is often finding the <em>right</em> opportunity and job boards and sourcing are ineffective solutions. The effort it would take us to truly differentiate in this space is not one we could justify.</p>
<p>Exiting this space allows us to refocus on products that build on our core strengths: knowledge reuse and building communities at scale.</p>
<h2>What changes are we making?</h2>
<p>The following features will be discontinued and removed from the site by March 31, 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jobs – including job search, saved searches, applications, messages, recommended job matches, and job ads</li>
<li>Developer Story and any saved resumes</li>
<li>Salary Calculator</li>
<li>All emails, settings, and data associated with these features</li>
<li>All employer-facing features related to Jobs and Developer Story</li>
</ul>
<h2>What can you expect in the coming months?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Late January 2022 – users will no longer be able to create new Developer Stories</li>
<li>February 2022 – users will start to see banners and notices on all deprecated features</li>
<li>February 2022 – the Salary calculator will no longer be available</li>
<li>Early March 2022 – users will be able to easily export all their data related to Jobs &amp; Developer Story</li>
<li>March 31, 2022 – all remaining discontinued features will be removed from the site</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are we continuing to support?</h2>
<p>The Advertising components of our Talent offering, specifically focused on Employer Branding.</p>
<p>Developers and technologists often want to learn about companies as they begin to evaluate opportunities in order to understand things like the company culture, the work/life balance, the social and environmental policies, the tech stack, and the learning and development opportunities companies offer. This is collectively referred to as “Employer Branding.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aihr.com/blog/employer-branding-strategy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Academy to Innovate HR (AIHR)</a> provides a more detailed explanation of employer branding and how companies think of it as part of their talent strategy. Companies can continue to use Stack Overflow’s Employer Branding solutions to promote their employer brand through company pages and other types of advertising.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Jobs &amp; Talent have been a part of Stack Overflow in some form for almost 12 years and have played a critical role in getting us to this stage as a company. In fact, it was also the first product I worked on when I joined Stack Overflow 5 years ago as a Product Manager. To those of you who have used Jobs or created a Developer Story, on behalf of everyone who has worked on Jobs &amp; Talent over the years, I’d like to thank you for trusting us to be a part of your job search process.</p>
<p>The decision to sunset these products wasn’t a simple one and we understand that this may have an impact on your job search process. If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know by posting them as answers to this question.</p>
