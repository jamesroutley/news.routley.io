    <h1>Return to office is &#39;dead,&#39; Stanford economist says</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-6" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="RegularArticle-articleBody-6-2"><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107341548" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>Morsa Images | Digitalvision | Getty Images</p></div></div></div><div><p>The share of workers being called back to the office has flatlined, suggesting the pandemic-era phenomenon of widespread <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/the-federal-reserve-is-fighting-inflation-so-is-remote-work.html">remote work</a> has become a permanent fixture of the U.S. labor market, economists said.</p><p>&#34;Return to the office is dead,&#34; Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University and expert on the work-from-home revolution, <a href="https://twitter.com/I_Am_NickBloom/status/1729557222424731894" target="_blank">wrote</a> this week.</p><p>In May 2020 — the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic — 61.5% of paid, full workdays were from home, according to the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes. That share fell by about half through 2022 as companies called employees back to in-person work.</p><p>However, the story has changed in 2023.</p><p>The share of paid work-from-home days has been &#34;totally flat&#34; this year, hovering around 28%, said Bloom in an interview with CNBC. That&#39;s still four times greater than the 7% pre-pandemic level. The U.S. Census Bureau&#39;s Household Pulse Survey shows a similar trend, he said.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, Kastle data that measures the frequency of employee office swipe-ins shows that office occupancy in the 10 largest U.S. metro areas has flatlined at around 50% in 2023, Bloom said.</p><p>&#34;We are three and a half years in, and we&#39;re totally stuck,&#34; Bloom said of remote work. &#34;It would take something as extreme as the pandemic to unstick it.&#34;</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Why remote work has had staying power</h2><div><p>The initial surge of remote work was spurred by Covid-19 lockdowns and stay-at-home orders.</p><p>But many workers came to like the arrangement. Among the primary benefits: no commute, flexible work schedules and less time getting ready for work, according to WFH Research.</p><p>The trend has been reinforced by a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/03/the-job-market-is-strong-economists-say-but-workers-dont-think-so-.html">hot job market</a> in the U.S. since early 2021, giving workers unprecedented leverage. If a worker didn&#39;t like their company benefits, odds were good they could quit and get a job with better work arrangements and pay elsewhere.</p><p>Research has shown that the typical worker equates the value of working from home to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/31/a-pay-freeze-vs-returning-to-office-workers-equally-hate-both-options.html">an 8% pay raise</a>.</p><p><strong>More from Personal Finance:</strong></p><p>However, the work-from-home trend isn&#39;t just a perk for workers. It has been a profitable arrangement for many companies, economists said.</p><p>Among the potential benefits: reduced costs for real estate, wages and recruitment, better worker retention and an expanded pool from which to recruit talent. Meanwhile, worker productivity hasn&#39;t suffered, Bloom said.</p><p>&#34;What makes companies money tends to stick,&#34; he said.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>Remote policies show &#39;incredible diversity&#39;</h2><div><p>These days, most remote work is done as part of a &#34;hybrid&#34; arrangement, with some days at home and the rest in the office. About 47% of employees who can work from home were hybrid as of October 2023, while 19% are full-time remote and 34% are fully on site, according to WFH Research.</p><p>About 11% of online job postings today advertise positions as fully remote or hybrid, versus 3% before the pandemic, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.</p><p>While remote work is the labor market&#39;s new normal, there&#39;s significant variety from company to company, Pollak said.</p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107285373"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107285373" data-vilynx-id="7000311695" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107285374-16917755381691775534-30719088191-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1691779089&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Remote work expands job opportunity for both workers and employers, says Stanford&#39;s Steven Davis"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>For example, 7% of workers are required to be in the office one day a week, while 9% are required in two days, 13% three days and 8% four days, according to a recent ZipRecruiter employer <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter-research.org/annual-employer-survey/remote-or-rto-employers-and-workers-meet-in-the-middle" target="_blank">survey</a>. Nearly 1 in 5,<strong> </strong>18%, have discretion over their in-person workdays.</p><p>&#34;The new normal is this incredible diversity,&#34; Pollak said.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s still a lot of experimentation going on,&#34; she said. &#34;But the aggregate effect is that remote work is steady.&#34;</p></div><h2><a id="headline2"></a>Why remote work will likely increase beyond 2025</h2><div><p>While it&#39;s unlikely that the prevalence of remote work will ever decline to its pre-pandemic level, it&#39;s possible that a U.S. recession — and a weaker job market — may cause it to slide a bit, economists said.</p><p>&#34;Employers say the biggest benefit of remote work is retention,&#34; Pollak said. In a labor market with more slack, &#34;retention gets much easier.&#34;</p><p>However, since work-from-home arrangements also save companies money, it&#39;s likely a severe recession would be necessary to see a meaningful decline, Bloom said.</p></div></div></div>
