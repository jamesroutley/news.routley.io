    <h1>Protecting Against Browser-Language Fingerprinting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            
<p><em>This is the seventeenth post in <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/">an ongoing series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Senior Software Engineer Mark Pilgrim, with help from Principal Engineer Brian Johnson, and was written by Senior Privacy Director Peter Snyder.</em></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Brave has further strengthened its fingerprinting protections by preventing users from being identified based on preferred browser language. Starting with version 1.39, Brave randomizes how your browser informs sites of what language(s) you’ve set as default, and what fonts you have installed on your system. This expands <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/">Brave’s existing fingerprinting protections</a>, already the strongest of any popular browser.</p>

<h2 id="how-trackers-use-your-language-preferences-to-violate-your-privacy">How trackers use your language preferences to violate your privacy</h2>
<p>When you visit a website, your browser needs to tell that site your default language(s). This helps the site present content in a language you can understand. Browsers do this both explicitly (for example, with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language"><code>Accept-Language</code></a> header, and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language"><code>navigator.language</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages"><code>navigator.languages</code></a> Web APIs) and implicitly (for example with the fonts you have installed on your system).</p>
<p>However, as with so much online, features meant to <em>improve</em> your experience often just expose you to more risk. In this case, trackers can use your language preferences (both implicit and explicit) to fingerprint you, identifying you across sites and browsing sessions.</p>
<p>Brave’s unique <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/4-fingerprinting-defenses-2.0/">“farbling” features</a> already provide the best fingerprinting protections of any popular browser. These add small amounts of randomization into identifying browser features—enough to confuse and defeat trackers, but not so much that they break sites.</p>
<p>With this latest release, Brave has expanded “farbling” protections to language preferences, too.</p>

<h2 id="how-brave-defends-against-accept-language-fingerprinting">How Brave defends against Accept-Language fingerprinting</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language"><code>Accept-Language</code></a> HTTP header tells websites your preferred language(s). If you’ve configured your computer or browser to prefer multiple languages, the header typically conveys all of those preferences, in the order you’ve selected. The browser also includes a “weight” with each preference, which expresses how much you prefer one language over another.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve set your browser to say “I prefer to read websites in English, but if that’s not available, Spanish is fine too,” your browser might express this in the header as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Accept-Language: en;q=.7,es;q=.5
</code></pre><p>This information is then sent with every request your browser makes on the Web. The browser exposes similar information to JavaScript running on pages through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language"><code>navigator.language</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages"><code>navigator.languages</code></a> properties.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-shields">Integration with Shields</h3>
<p>With these new protections against browser-language fingerprinting, Brave now reduces and randomizes the information available in these APIs. And we’ve incorporated these as default protections, via Brave Shields.</p>
<p>By default, Brave will only report your most preferred language. So, if your language preferences are “English (United States)” first, and Korean second, the browser will only report “<code>en-US,en</code>.&#34;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Brave will also randomize the reported weight (i.e., “q”) within a certain range.</p>
<p>If fingerprinting protections have been set to <strong>Strict</strong>, Brave will instead always report the language preference as “English,” which ensures the largest available anonymity set<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. And here, too, Brave will randomize the reported weight (i.e., “q”) within a certain range.</p>

<h2 id="how-brave-defends-against-font-fingerprinting">How Brave defends against font fingerprinting</h2>
<p>In general, fonts can be split into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Web Fonts</strong>: Fonts included by a website, for use on that website. Since they don’t come from the user, web fonts aren’t useful as a method of fingerprinting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OS Fonts</strong>: Fonts installed by the operating system, and common to all users of that operating system. Since trackers can already learn what operating system you’re using (e.g. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a> string, JS APIs, etc.), exposing these fonts usually doesn’t impact privacy (though installing multiple sets of fonts for different languages can increase the likelihood of fingerprinting).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Fonts</strong>: Additional fonts installed by the user, either directly (downloading and installing a font from a website) or indirectly (because other software on your computer has installed fonts, e.g. office suites, presentation editing tools, or image editing software). These are most useful for fingerprinting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trackers also identify users by checking for uncommon fonts, or fonts that aren’t commonly paired together. These distinguishing fonts may be installed because of language preference—either as something you’ve installed directly, or something your operating system installed.</p>
<p>For example, if you tell Windows you prefer Hebrew and Malaysian, Windows will install <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/windows_11_font_list">additional fonts</a> for those languages. A tracker could then use these data points to identify you, because only a fraction of Web users will have that combination of fonts.</p>
<p>Currently Brave applies font fingerprinting protections on Android, macOS, and Windows versions. Brave does not apply these protections to iOS versions for two reasons: platform restrictions prevent us from doing so; and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview">WKWebView</a> already includes similar, although not quite as strong, protections<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Brave does not apply these protections on Linux because of difficulties in determining which fonts are “OS fonts” for each distro.</p>
<p>Note that it’s also possible to have uncommon fonts installed for reasons unrelated to language preference. For example, some software packages (e.g. office suites, slide and photo editing tools, etc.) will add additional fonts to the system. And sometimes people install additional fonts on their own.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-shields-1">Integration with Shields</h3>
<p>In both <strong>default</strong> and <strong>aggressive</strong> configurations, Brave will allow websites to access all Web fonts, OS fonts for your current top language preference, and a randomly selected (i.e. farbled) set of user fonts. As with all of Brave’s fingerprint randomization protections, the set of user fonts the page can access is randomly determined for each site and for each browser session; a site will always be able to access the same fonts during the same browser session.</p>


<p>While we expect the above protections to serve the vast majority of users, we appreciate that some users will need to share more detailed information with sites about their language preferences. For example, you may speak a language that’s not well supported by standard operating systems fonts, and so may be part of a linguistic community that relies on additional, user-installed fonts to browse the Web.</p>
<p>In cases like this, the benefits of sharing additional language preferences with websites may outweigh the privacy risk. To support these users, and to ensure everyone can use Brave for safe, private browsing, we’ve also taken the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased User-Controls</strong>: Brave users who wish to share more information about their language preferences with websites can easily configure Brave to do so.  Users can disable the font / language protections by visiting <code>brave://settings/shields</code> and toggling off <em>Reduce the identifiability of my language preferences</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Brave will monitor the rollout of these new protections, first for Nightly, then Beta, and eventually stable users. If we learn of compatibility issues on sites, we may modify these features, to make sure Brave’s protections don’t break sites.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="comparison-with-other-browsers">Comparison With Other Browsers</h2>
<p>Though Brave has the strongest privacy protections of any popular browser, other browsers are also taking important and laudable steps to protect user privacy. Below is a brief summary of the protections other browsers provide against language-targeting fingerprinting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Safari</strong>: Provides protections most similar to Brave’s. Safari will report only a user’s top language preference to websites in <code>Accept-Language</code> and <code>navigator.languages</code>,  and will allow sites to access only OS provided fonts for the user’s current language preference. The main differences between Brave and Safari are: Brave also slightly randomizes data sources to further confuse trackers; and Brave includes the ability to disable these protections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong>: Provides some protections against browser-language fingerprinting, though these are disabled by default. If a user enables Firefox’s <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting">resist fingerprinting</a> feature, Firefox will similarly restrict the fonts a website can access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chrome</strong> and <strong>Edge</strong>: Provide no protections against browser-language fingerprinting, though both are considering including such fingerprinting efforts as part of the <a href="https://github.com/bslassey/privacy-budget">Privacy Budget</a> proposal (a proposal about which <a href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/2-privacy-budgets/">Brave has serious concerns</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
