    <p>I started work on the Kirkstone-series early in December 2022. 
There have been two Release Candidates, discussed in this forum thread:<br/>

</p>
<p>I also receive feedback via direct email. Finally looking OK, so version 5.0 is now out. Here is a summary:<br/>
</p>
<p><i>Almost all of the packages in EasyOS Kirkstone-series are compiled
 from source, using a fork of OpenEmbedded (OE) Kirkstone-release. 
Almost all package versions are updated, compared with the 
Dunfell-series (the previous EasyOS release, last of which is version 
4.5.5, released January 10, 2023).</i><i><br/>
  </i><i>Apart from new package versions, many bug fixes and many 
improvements, there is one other major improvement; the abandonment of 
&#34;langpack&#34; language translation packages, as well as abandonment of 
language-specific builds. Now, there is just one file to download, the 
required language is chosen at first bootup, and the User Interface is 
then rendered in that language. More or less; French is just about 
complete, second is German.</i><i><br/>
  </i><i>MoManager is a GUI translation tool, that has its roots ten 
years ago in Puppy Linux; it has been extensively rewritten, to make it 
an easy experience for anyone to contribute translations. As a great 
aid, it features automatic translation using Google or Bing, that the 
user just needs to scan for correctness.</i><i><br/>
  </i><i>As always, EasyOS includes just about every application most 
users would want builtin, including Chromium, LibreOffice, Inkscape, 
Gimp, Gparted, SolveSpace, Homebank, etc., etc.</i><i><br/>
  </i><i>Easy does not ship with a ISO file, only a drive-image file, 
that can easily be written to a USB-stick, or opened up for direct 
install to internal hard drive.</i><br/>
</p>
<p>The obligatory snapshot; this is on a 1024x768 monitor, the smallest supported size:<br/>

</p>
<p>Easy will work on an old computer, as long as it has a 64-bit x86 
CPU. When the drive-image is written to a USB-flash-stick, it will boot on
 legacy-BIOS and UEFI-firmware PCs. I tested 5.0 on an old Compaq 
Presario, Intel Core2 Duo CPU with only 2GB RAM; Easy runs great.<br/>
