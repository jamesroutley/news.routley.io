    <h1>Predictions That Are Aging Well</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Hi readers, </p><p><span>I’m still recovering from Covid (</span><em>so</em><span> frustrating!), so I want to shine a spotlight on </span><em>Risk Musings </em><span>posts that are aging well so far. I say </span><em>so far</em><span> because things change, and I could end up totally embarrassed about how wrong these posts turn out! But as of today, they’re looking pretty good and were a bit ahead of the crowd. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024" width="512" height="512" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:&#34;normal&#34;,&#34;height&#34;:512,&#34;width&#34;:512,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f84abcf-3899-4312-a31c-0c8e38d970fe_1024x1024 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>A few ground rules: </p><ul><li><p><span>These are not</span><em> </em><span>evergreen posts, though I have plenty of those. Instead, they predicted something (events or economic outcomes). </span></p></li><li><p>These essays are more than three months old (they are aging). </p></li><li><p>There’s more data available now than when I wrote the post. That doesn’t mean the issue is fully resolved.</p></li></ul><p>Here goes, the unmodified posts that are looking better every day, from newest to oldest:  </p><p><strong>Aging Well</strong></p><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/recession-tug-of-war-downside-versus" rel="">Recession Tug-of-War: Downside versus Bright Side</a><span> (July 2023) - squeaking in just outside the three-month boundary, I’m increasingly pleased with how right-on this essay looks (so far, yes, I know!). I’ll probably do an annual economic tug-of-war essay. </span></p><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/more-not-less-regeneration-and-reframing" rel="">More, Not Less: Regeneration and Reframing</a><span> (June 2023) - it’s early to call this one, but it’s looking promising: this proposal simultaneously solves for human happiness, AI job displacement, and climate impact. Even </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-ai-day-shorter-work-week-2023-10" rel="">Jamie Dimon recently commented that future generations of workers will probably work part-time</a><span> (October 2023).</span></p><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/system-dynamics-of-a-bank-run" rel="">System Dynamics of a Bank Run</a><span> (March 2023) - in which I posited that being publicly traded is an independent risk factor increasing the likelihood of a bank run (yes, I put it in a footnote, but it’s there!). Unfortunately, if a bank is already public, putting out a going-private announcement is probably also a huge risk!</span></p><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/why-cant-we-have-a-strong-labor-market" rel="">Why Can’t We Have a Strong Labor Market and a Good Economy?</a><span> (February 2023) - as it turns out (so far, anyway), we totally can, for all the reasons I listed in this essay: demographics, Covid effects, immigration policy. I really like this one.</span></p><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/musings-on-ai-at-a-turning-point" rel="">Musings on AI at a Turning Point</a><span> (December 2022) - in which I saw the AI mega-trend coming the first time I used ChatGPT. </span></p><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/to-fight-inflation-build-starter" rel="">To Fight Inflation, Build Starter Homes</a><span> (November 2022) - wherein I predicted a residential housing crash wouldn’t happen in the US because of demographics and an outright housing shortage. </span></p><p><a href="https://riskmusings.substack.com/p/retrocession-roulette-when-climate" rel="">Retrocession Roulette: When Climate Change Makes Insurance Interesting</a><span> (September 2022) - I spent a lot of time on this prescient essay, and it was worth it. Not popular at the time, it’s gaining credence and weight as it ages. </span></p><p>So there we have it, the aging-well roundup. I hope you enjoy reading these, and I hope I’m feeling great soon so I can bring you more forward-thinking takes! </p><p>Thanks for reading,</p><p>Stephanie</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
