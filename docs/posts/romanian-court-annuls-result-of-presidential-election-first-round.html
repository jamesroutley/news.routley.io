    <h1>Romanian court annuls result of presidential election first round</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>Romania&#39;s constitutional court has annulled the result of the first round of voting in the presidential election just days before the second round was due to take place.<!-- --></p><p>It means the process will be restarted from scratch, with the government due to decide a date for a new vote.<!-- --></p><p>The first round was won by Calin Georgescu, an almost unknown far-right Nato-sceptic who has previously praised Vladimir Putin.<!-- --></p><p>The court&#39;s decision comes after intelligence documents were declassified, suggesting Georgescu benefitted from a mass influence operation – conducted from abroad – to interfere with the result of the vote.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Hours after the court&#39;s decision, Georgescu told a Romanian TV channel that the country&#39;s democracy was &#34;under attack&#34;, describing the verdict as a &#34;formalised coup d&#39;etat&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>He said he would &#34;go forward through the voting process&#34;, implying that he would try to run again for president, though it&#39;s far from clear that that will be possible.<!-- --></p><p>Outgoing Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said the court&#39;s decision to annul was &#34;the only correct solution after the declassification of the documents... which show that the result of the Romanians&#39; vote was blatantly distorted as a result of Russia&#39;s intervention&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>In an address on Friday evening, current President Klaus Iohannis confirmed he would remain in the role until a new president was elected.<!-- --></p><p>He said Romania was a stable, safe and solid country, one that remained safely and solidly pro-European and an ally to Nato. He called the court&#39;s decision a matter of &#34;national security&#34;.<!-- --></p><ul><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2yl2zxrq1o">Romania&#39;s cancelled presidential election and why it matters<!-- --></a></li><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7vee5n5lp0o">Alleged Russian election-meddling in Romania resurrects dark memories<!-- --></a></li></ul><p>The judges of the court met on Friday morning, despite having announced the previous night that they would not discuss new information regarding possible external influence on the elections.<!-- --></p><p>The law stipulates that, in the event of an election being cancelled, they should resume on the second Sunday after the date of the annulment - which would have meant on 22 December.<!-- --></p><p>However, the court has decided to ask the government to rerun the entire electoral process, and therefore the electoral campaign.<!-- --></p><p>Last week, the court had ordered a recount of votes cast in Sunday&#39;s first round following allegations that social media platform TikTok gave &#34;preferential treatment&#34; to the surprise winner, Calin Georgescu.<!-- --></p><p>The recount itself, though, was based on a complaint that a number of votes may have been mistakenly attributed to the runner-up, Elena Lasconi. On Monday night, the court rejected that claim.<!-- --></p><p>Georgescu, a radical with no party of his own, campaigned mainly on TikTok. The platform said it was &#34;categorically false to claim his account was treated differently to any other candidate&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>He won 23% of the vote, with 19%, Elena Lasconi, of the opposition Save Romania Union and Ciolacu of the governing Social Democrats in third.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lasconi condemned the court&#39;s ruling as &#34;illegal&#34; and &#34;immoral&#34;, saying &#34;today is the moment when the Romanian state has trampled on democracy&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;Whether we like it or not, from a legal and legitimate point of view, nine million Romanian citizens, both in the country and in the diaspora, have expressed their preference for a certain candidate. We cannot ignore their will!&#34; she said.<!-- --></p><p>She had been hoping to win the second round run-off on Sunday, which has now been cancelled.<!-- --></p><p>This week, <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg6l06ldpqo">Georgescu denied to the BBC that he was Moscow&#39;s man<!-- --></a>. <!-- --></p><p>He claimed the political establishment could not cope with his success and was trying to block him. <!-- --></p><p>The country is now in totally new territory, politically. And no-one is quite sure what comes next.<!-- --></p></div></div>
