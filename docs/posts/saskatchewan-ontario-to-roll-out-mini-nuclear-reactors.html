    <h1>Saskatchewan, Ontario to roll out mini-nuclear reactors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The GEH zero-emission reactors – each with enough power to fuel more than 200,000 homes - could be deployed by 2030s</p><div id="details-body" data-words="564" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Saskatchewan and Ontario have each chosen GE-Hitachi as the supplier of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), which could be deployed in the Prairie province by the 2030s and in Ontario by 2018.</p>

<p>“The GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation Small Modular Reactor (SMR) with passive safety systems,” according to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>“As the tenth evolution of the Boiling Water Reactor (BWR), the BWRX-300 represents the simplest, yet most innovative BWR design since GE began developing nuclear reactors in 1955,” the company states.</p>

<p>The powerful little reactors are carbon-free and emit no greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p> Following a thorough assessment of several SMR technologies, SaskPower selected the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan in the mid-2030s, according to Don Morgan, Minister responsible for SaskPower.</p>

<p>“This is an important milestone as Saskatchewan works towards a cleaner, more sustainable future,” said Don Morgan, Minister responsible for SaskPower. “Today’s announcement further acts on the Saskatchewan Growth Plan goal of advancing potential development of zero-emission small modular reactor technology.”</p>

<p>Each of the 300 MWe SMRs cost between $1 billion to $1.5 billion and can provide enough electricity to power approximately 240,0000 homes.</p>

<p><b>Comparative cost </b></p>

<p>As a comparison with other non-emission options, BC Hydro’s 1,100 Mwe Site C dam is expected to cost $16 billion. A 300W-solar power farm would require 1.5 million solar panels and cost approximately $300 million, provided the 1,500- to-1,800 acres of land needed was free and the sun shone steadily, based on data from the Solar Energy Industries Association.</p>

<p>The typical wind turbine delivers an optimal 2-3 MWe in power, and cost from $2 million to $4 million, so 300 Mwe would require at least 100 turbines at a total cost of between $200 million to $400 million. But land-based wind turbine, dependant on wind conditions, only run at about 40 per dent capacity, according to industry data,</p>

<p>SaskPower’s non-emission power assessment focused on several key factors including safety, technology readiness, generation size, fuel type and expected cost of electricity.</p>

<p>The selection of the GEH models follows an independent and comprehensive assessment process that also included close collaboration with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and a review by Calian, an independent engineering firm with extensive experience in Canada’s nuclear industry.</p>

<p>“We are excited that SaskPower has chosen our technology as it looks to SMRs for the generation of carbon-free electricity,” said Jay Wineman, President &amp; CEO, GEH. “We believe the BWRX-300 is an ideal solution for SaskPower and customers that want to make an impact on climate change and energy security in a meaningful timeframe.”</p>

<p>Interim President and CEO at SaskPower, Troy King, added “We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions while providing safe, reliable, and sustainable power for our customers. GE-Hitachi’s SMR technology could play a powerful role in this future.”</p>

<p>OPG has announced it will work with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to deploy Ontario’s Small Modular Reactor (SMR) at the <a href="https://www.opg.com/powering-ontario/our-generation/nuclear/darlington-nuclear/">Darlington</a> new nuclear site, the only site in Canada currently licensed for a new nuclear build.</p>

<p>GEH and Ontario plan to construct up to four 300 MWe small module reactors, with the first coming online by 2028. If built out to this level, the project at $4,000 per Kw, would have an estimated cost at completion of all four units of $4.8 billion.  Such an array would provide enough power to fuel approximately 960,000 Ontario homes each year, potentially for generations.</p>
