<p>6th June 2025</p>



<p>I presented an invited keynote at the <a href="https://www.ai.engineer/">AI Engineer World’s Fair</a> in San Francisco this week. This is my third time speaking at the event—here are my talks from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/">October 2023</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/27/ai-worlds-fair/">June 2024</a>. My topic this time was “The last six months in LLMs”—originally planned as the last year, but so much has happened that I had to reduce my scope!</p>

<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zXicOAF28&amp;t=5084s">on the AI Engineer YouTube channel</a>. Below is a full annotated transcript of the talk and accompanying slides, plus additional links to related articles and resources.</p>

With hindsight that was foolish—the space has been accelerating to the point that even covering the last six months is a tall order!</p>
<p>Thankfully almost all of the noteworthy models we are using today were released within the last six months. I’ve counted over 30 models from that time period that are significant enough that people working in this space should at least be aware of them.</p>
<p>With so many great models out there, the classic problem remains how to evaluate them and figure out which ones work best.</p>
<p>There are plenty of benchmarks full of numbers. I don’t get much value out of those numbers.</p>
<p>There are leaderboards, but I’ve been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/criticism-of-the-chatbot-arena/">losing some trust</a> in those recently.</p>
<p>Everyone needs their own benchmark. So I’ve been increasingly leaning on my own, which started as a joke but is beginning to show itself to actually be a little bit useful!</p>

<p>I’m running this against text output LLMs. They shouldn’t be able to draw anything at all.</p>
<p>But they can generate code... and SVG is code.</p>
<p>This is also an unreasonably difficult test for them. Drawing bicycles is really hard! Try it yourself now, without a photo: most people find it difficult to remember the exact orientation of the frame.</p>
<p>Pelicans are glorious birds but they’re also pretty difficult to draw. </p>
<p>Most importantly: <em>pelicans can’t ride bicycles</em>. They’re the wrong shape!</p>

This means you get a better idea of what they were <em>trying</em> to achieve.</p>

These haven’t made many waves yet but are notable because they handle 1 million tokens of input and feel competitive with the less expensive of Google’s Gemini family. The Nova models are also <em>really cheap</em>—<code>nova-micro</code> is the cheapest model I currently track on my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> table.</p>
<p>They’re not great at drawing pelicans.</p>

<p>The B stands for billion—it’s the number of parameters. I’ve got 64GB of RAM on my three year old M2 MacBook Pro, and my rule of thumb is that 70B is about the largest size I can run.</p>
<p>At the time, this was clearly the best model I had ever managed to run on own laptop. I wrote about this in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/">I can now run a GPT-4 class model on my laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Meta themselves claim that this model has similar performance to their much larger Llama 3.1 405B.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d be able to run something that felt as capable as early 2023 GPT-4 on my own hardware without some <em>serious</em> upgrades, but here it was.</p>
<p>It does use up all of my memory, so I can’t run anything else at the same time.</p>

A real drop-the-mic moment. </p>
<p>As people started to try it out it became apparent that it was probably the best available open weights model.</p>
<p>In the paper <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/26/deepseek-v3/">that followed the day after</a> they claimed training time of 2,788,000 H800 GPU hours, producing an estimated cost of $5,576,000.</p>
<p>That’s notable because I would have expected a model of this size to cost 10 to 100 times more.</p>

This time with the open weights release of their R1 reasoning model, competitive with OpenAI’s o1.</p>

The resulting stock market dive wiped $600 billion from NVIDIA’s valuation, which I believe is a record drop for a single company.</p>
<p>It turns out trade restrictions on the best GPUs weren’t going to stop the Chinese labs from finding new optimizations for training great models.</p>

It’s the best we have seen so far: clearly a bicycle and there’s a bird that could almost be described as looking a bit like a pelican. It’s not riding the bicycle though.</p>

It’s 24B which means I can run it in my laptop using less than 20GB of RAM, leaving enough for me to run Firefox and VS Code at the same time!</p>
<p>Notably, Mistral claimed that it performed similar to Llama 3.3 70B. That’s the model that Meta said was as capable as their 405B model. This means we have dropped from 405B to 70B to 24B while mostly retaining the same capabilities!</p>
<p>I had a successful flight where I was using Mistral Small for half the flight... and then my laptop battery ran out, because it turns out these things burn a lot of electricity.</p>
<p>If you lost interest in local models—like I did eight months ago—it’s worth paying attention to them again. They’ve got good now!</p>

This was many people’s favorite model for the next few months, myself included. It draws a pretty solid pelican!</p>
<p>I like how it solved the problem of pelicans not fitting on bicycles by adding a second smaller bicycle to the stack.</p>
<p>Claude 3.7 Sonnet was also the first Anthropic model to add reasoning.</p>

<p>It mainly served to show that just throwing more compute and data at the training phase wasn’t enough any more to produce the best possible models.</p>

That one was nearly as expensive at $60/million. The models we have today are an order of magnitude cheaper and better than that.</p>
<p>OpenAI apparently agreed that 4.5 was a lemon, they announced it as deprecated <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/14/gpt-4-1/#deprecated">6 weeks later</a>. GPT-4.5 was not long for this world.</p>

<p>This was one of the most successful product launches of all time. They signed up 100 million new user accounts in a week! They had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">a single hour</a> where they signed up a million new accounts, as this thing kept on going viral again and again and again.</p>
<p>I took a photo of my dog, Cleo, and told it to dress her in a pelican costume, obviously.</p>
<p>But look at what it did—it added a big, ugly sign in the background saying Half Moon Bay.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for that. My artistic vision has been completely compromised!</p>
<p>This was my first encounter with ChatGPT’s new memory feature, where it consults pieces of your previous conversation history without you asking it to.</p>
<p>I told it off and it gave me the pelican dog costume that I really wanted.</p>
<p>But this was a warning that we risk losing control of the context.</p>
<p>As a power user of these tools, I want to stay in complete control of what the inputs are. Features like ChatGPT memory are taking that control away from me.</p>
<p>I don’t like them. I turned it off.</p>

<p>The big problem with Llama 4 is that they released these two enormous models that nobody could run.</p>
<p>They’ve got no chance of running these on consumer hardware. They’re not very good at drawing pelicans either.</p>
<p>I’m personally holding out for Llama 4.1 and 4.2 and 4.3. With Llama 3, things got really exciting with those point releases—that’s when we got that beautiful 3.3 model that runs on my laptop.</p>

<p>Look at that pelican on a bicycle for like a fraction of a cent! These are genuinely quality models.</p>
<p>GPT 4.1 Mini is my default for API stuff now: it’s dirt cheap, it’s very capable and it’s an easy upgrade to 4.1 if it’s not working out.</p>
