<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper derives from a short, time-bound, review
of the literature, which sought to investigate the question “Did Insurance Fire
Brigades let uninsured buildings burn?”. The question is set in the context of
property fire insurance in London, from 1680. The situation was possibly
comparable with other large British urban and industrial centres, but less
likely to be so for less-developed rural areas.</p>

<p>Two conflicting views on the question are first
outlined, together with a note about the scope and context of the reviewed
literature. A chronological approach is then taken to an investigation of the
question, so far as the accessible sources allowed.</p>

<p>The directly relevant evidence is limited. The
question has therefore been largely considered through interpretation and
analysis of a number of factors, cautiously using texts from well-referenced secondary
sources. The conclusions that are drawn are therefore somewhat tentative, but firmly
grounded in the literature. They are set in the context of London. There is
scope for further research, particularly in primary and specialist sources that
were not available for the present work.</p>

<h2>Conflicting views on the question</h2>

<h3>The commonly held view</h3>

<p>Much literature of the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup>
centuries promulgates the belief that insurance fire brigades stood back and
let buildings burn, if they were not insured by their particular company. This
view has been common to both popular periodical articles and more formal
histories.<sup><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>,
<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>,
<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>,
<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>,
<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>,
<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a>,
<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>,
<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a></sup>
Some of those writers relate the situation to the “earlier days” of fire
insurance, within the 18<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>,
<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>,
<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a></sup>
The basis for their assertions cannot usually be determined, because the accounts
have not been referenced back to primary evidence, such as contemporary records
and commentaries. They can, though, only be based on sources beyond the
writers’ direct memories – presumably either earlier literature, or oral
tradition. </p>

<h3>The revisionist view</h3>

<p>A few suspicions have been voiced against this
commonly held view, but they are also unreferenced – there was “no doubt”, for
example, that the “concession” that insurance firemen would fight all fires “was
begun early in the eighteenth century on both politic and humanitarian grounds,”<sup><a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>
</sup>while “…the notion that any brigade would stand idly by while premises
bearing the fire mark of its competitor burned gaily away was probably always
fictional”.<sup><a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a>
</sup></p>

<p>More recent writers have more firmly rebutted the notion
of letting uninsured buildings burn. In 1996, an insurance company history referenced,
in 1702, “the first of many recorded examples” of insurance fire brigades
working together to fight fires. The insuring fire office recompensated the
other offices whose men who had assisted.<sup><a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a></sup>
The origins of the legend have, though, been placed elsewhere by a later
writer’s detailed history of insurance fire brigades.<sup><a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a></sup>
The “erroneous myth”, is said to have originated only in the 1920s.<sup><a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a></sup>
 However, the cited evidence relates to only two events, in 1871 and 1895.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<h2>Reviewing the contemporary literature</h2>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>The present time-bound review necessarily focussed on
published accounts. None-the-less, those texts substantially covered the period
of interest, both as historical and contemporary accounts in their own right,
and as more recently written histories. The reviewed literature was discovered
initially through primary searches under relevant keywords, and then through
reference checking. While considerable literature was unearthed, the search
could not be exhaustive within the time available.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Two particular limitations should be noted. Firstly,
it was not possible, in the time, to consult any original insurance company
records surviving in archives. Several primary references were, though,
gratefully received from the London Fire Brigade Museum, whose changed website
text had led to the question being raised.<sup><a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a></sup>
A few records have also been published; some in several places, enabling
cross-checking for veracity. Secondly, publications of the Fire Mark Circle<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> are an essential
resource for this research question; regrettably, their Library was
inaccessible.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
So, too, was the Library of the Chartered Institute of Insurance, another
highly relevant resource, whose holdings include the unpublished notes for
Walford’s <i>Cyclopaedia</i>.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<h2>The evidence reviewed</h2>

<p>The sources of evidence are scattered. Some bear
directly on the question, while others provide only a basis for interpretation
and inference. All sources must be placed in context, particularly in relation
to their nearness to the events they describe. The evidence is therefore now
considered for a range of individual factors, before any conclusions are
attempted. Its interpretation and analysis is split into chronological
sections, reflecting the different situations that seemed to have obtained as
insurance company fire-fighting evolved:</p>

<h3>The early period, 1680 – 1720s</h3>

<p>The first London fire insurance company – aptly named
<i>The Fire Office</i> – was set up in 1680, following the Great Fire of 1666.<sup><a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>, <a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Two further fire
offices were established in the following decade, in 1683<sup><a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a>, <a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a></sup> and 1696.<sup><a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a>, <a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Each office had
its own fire brigade,<sup><a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a>,
<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a></sup>
although in their earliest days, it consisted only of a body of men, recruited
from Thames watermen, not necessarily with a fire engine.<sup><a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a></sup>
Furthermore, only buildings were insured – neither their contents, nor the
lives of their occupants, were covered.</p>

<p>The brigade foreman at the scene of the fire was
responsible for ascertaining whether a property was insured, and if so, by
which company.<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a>
For the first century of fire insurance, an insured property had to clearly
display a brightly decorated fire mark, identifying the insurance company.<sup><a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<p>However, primary evidence shows that in these early
years, insurance company fire brigades seemingly made little distinction between
insured and uninsured properties. Originally writing in 1692-3, Daniel Defoe
noted that the firemen were “very active and diligent” in helping to put out
fires, “whether in houses insured or not insured”.<sup><a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a></sup>
Insurance companies’ instructions to their firemen were clear – they were to
attend and help extinguish “all” fires.<sup> <a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a>,
<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Later authors have argued
good reasons why this seemingly counter-productive policy was adopted:<sup> <a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[36]</a>,
<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a>,
<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[38]</a>,
<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>In densely developed London, a fire in an uninsured property
might easily spread to one that was insured</li>
<li>Smartly turned-out firemen, rapid attendance, and energetic
fire-fighting were all good advertising for an insurance company</li>
<li>Freely extinguishing fires in uninsured houses of the poor was a
charitable and humanitarian act.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="_Hlk121836480">The mid C18th, 1720s —
1780s</a></h3>

<p>Eight fire insurance offices had been established in
London by 1721.<sup><a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title="">[40]</a></sup>
No more were to be set up there for almost half a century, following the South
Sea Bubble crash of the previous year.<sup><a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="">[41]</a></sup>
Fire insurance was almost entirely a London-based business during this period.
A small handful of new Scottish and English provincial concerns provided no
competition to the capital.<sup><a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>Undifferentiated fire-fighting still seems to have
been practiced – in 1752, the London Assurance Company’s orders required their
brigade to turn out to “All alarms of Fire” … “in order to extinguish the
same”.<sup><a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[43]</a></sup>
In 1798, in Bolton, it was noted that the Royal Exchange company gave “equal
assistance if the parties are assured or not”.<sup><a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<p>Little direct evidence for insurance fire brigades
has been found for this part of its history, in comparison with earlier and
later dates. What can be discerned, then, from the sources that are available,
that might shine a little more light on the question at issue? Some later-dated
formal accounts can be reflected back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century, with due
caution, particularly with respect to undated assertions. Together with such
direct evidence as is available, several factors can then be considered in
relation to cooperation, competition and conflict during this part of the 18<sup>th</sup>
century.</p>

<h4>Monetary rewards</h4>

<p>Brigades’ enthusiasm to attend fires was no doubt
markedly boosted, in 1707-8, by the introduction of legislation providing money
rewards for the first engines to reach a fire.<sup><a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[45]</a></sup>
Thirty shillings (30s) was to be awarded to the first in attendance, 20s to the
second, and 10s to the third.<sup><a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title="">[46]</a></sup>
They were considerable sums of money for their time. While these inducements
initially applied only to London, provincial insurance brigades, such as in
Bath and Manchester, were offered similar incentives to arrive at a fire scene
first. Insurance companies also made additional payments for hard work and
bravery at fires, and made compensation awards for injury or death.<sup><a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title="">[47]</a>,
<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title="">[48]</a>,
<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title="">[49]</a>,
<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title="">[50]</a>,
<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Too many fire brigades</h4>

<p>Probably, up to half a dozen insurance fire brigades
were operating in London, at any one time, during this period.<sup><a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title="">[52]</a></sup>
 There were also parish fire engines, albeit often old and poorly maintained,
and some private engines and brigades.<a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title=""><sup>[53]</sup></a><sup>,
<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title="">[54]</a></sup>
Many or most brigades would therefore have had the potential to turn out to a
fire, depending on its location. One dramatic illustration depicts three
insurance fire engines racing each other along the road to a fire, while the
parish pump is bundled along the pavement in the background.<sup><a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Too little water</h4>

<p>A counter to an over-supply of engines at a fire was
often an under-supply of water to feed them. London’s fire-fighters had great
trouble finding enough fire-fighting water, or any water at all. Even the
waters of the Thames, if at ebb, might be out of reach.<sup><a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title="">[56]</a>, <a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title="">[57]</a></sup>
Such situations were aptly described in relation to a later fire, in
Scotland’s capital city. It was all very well to reward speed to a fire, but
that was only “a small part of the business”. The result was more engines than
required, and too little water to feed any of them effectively.<sup><a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title="">[58]</a></sup>
Firemen’s quarrels about water supply in Edinburgh were still being reported in
1830.<sup><a href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Character and conduct of the firemen</h4>

<p>These three logistical factors must be considered
alongside the character and conduct of the men involved. London firemen were
recruited initially from Thames watermen – strong, tough men, who were not
afraid of danger. Nor were they strangers to disrespectful expression and
disorderly conduct. They worked in a febrile atmosphere, often fuelled by the
free beer which flowed for those operating the fire engine pumps. Drunkenness
and brawling could accompany speed and bravery. Their employers enforced the
rules for firemen, but seemingly fairly, in frequent disciplinary proceedings.<sup>
<a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title="">[60]</a>,
<a href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61" title="">[61]</a>,
<a href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title="">[62]</a>,
<a href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>

<p>Some 19<sup>th</sup> century accounts graphically
describe the behaviour of insurance firemen in terms that were probably equally
appropriate to their 18<sup>th</sup> century forebears. The use of separate
company fire engines in Edinburgh, for example, “creates a degree of jealousy
among the men who work them… [which] seems, for the most part, to increase with
the fury of the flames; and at the moment when all success depends upon a union
of their efforts, then are they at their most discordant…”.<sup><a href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64" title="">[64]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>Similarly, in London, where “…every fire office …
maintained its own separate staff of firemen and engines,” …. “the men
quarrelled and fought for such rewards as came to their lot for promptness in
attending fires…”<sup><a href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title="">[65]</a></sup>
Looking back on the “earlier days”, a Victorian Parliamentary Select Committee reflected
on the “notoriety” that insurance fire brigades had given to their employers.
The “considerable rivalry” between them occasioned both “good” and “some considerable
evil” at fires.<a href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" title=""><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p>Such “evil” might well be of the kind related by a
popular periodical in 1840. Referring back to earlier times, when “each
Insurance Company had its own engines and firemen, ... it too often happened
that the latter would decline to exert themselves at the suppression of a fire,
unless the building which was a prey to it, was insured with the office to
which they belonged”.<a href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67" title=""><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<h3>The turn of the C19th, 1780s – 1820s</h3>

<p>In the 100 years to 1780, twenty two fire insurance
concerns had been set up in the UK, although only nine were still in business at
that date. In 1790, there were twelve extant, and in 1800, eighteen. There was
a substantial increase in the number of fire offices from that date; an initial
doubling in the next decade, and overall further growth subsequently, with both
gains and losses.<a href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68" title=""><sup>[68]</sup></a>
By 1808, there were more than fifty fire insurance company engines in London.<a href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69" title=""><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite their rivalries, insurance companies and
their brigades did also cooperate with each other. Indeed, from the 1780s, the
degree of general cooperation and collusion between large fire insurance
companies has been described as “unique” in the financial services sector, ranging
“over an extraordinary number of areas”.<a href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70" title=""><sup>[70]</sup></a>
Joint insurance was very common between the larger companies.<a href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71" title=""><sup>[71]</sup></a>
In 1795, for example, the Hand in Hand cooperated with the Sun, Royal Exchange
and Phoenix offices by jointly insuring the Pantheon theatre in London’s Oxford
Street.<a href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72" title=""><sup>[72]</sup></a>
A more general co-insurance agreement was made with the Albion Fire Office, in
1826.<a href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73" title=""><sup>[73]</sup></a>
This practice would obviously encourage insurance brigades to work together, if
such properties caught fire.<a href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title=""><sup>[74]</sup></a> </p>

<p>As briefly noted above, as early as 1707, the Hand in
Hand had made payments to fourteen men from the Friendly Society, and nine from
the Phoenix, for their assistance at a fire.<sup><a href="#_edn75" name="_ednref75" title="">[75]</a>, <a href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76" title="">[76]</a></sup>
A much later example, from Birmingham in 1841, illustrates that such
reciprocity between offices was part of normal business. The Birmingham Fire
Office was breaching such a reciprocity agreement with the Phoenix, by billing
for the attendance of their engines at some Phoenix fires. Refusing to pay
their supposed partners, the Phoenix reminded the Birmingham that the public
would not look favourably on the Phoenix if they started to withhold their own
fire engines, in retaliation.<sup><a href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77" title="">[77]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>Such reciprocity eventually led to more formalised united
working. In 1791, three London fire offices – the Royal Exchange, Phoenix and
the Sun – established a joint nightly Fire Watch, based on their respective
fire engine houses.<sup><a href="#_edn78" name="_ednref78" title="">[78]</a>,
<a href="#_edn79" name="_ednref79" title="">[79]</a>
</sup> This cooperation, though, only extended to patrolling. In the event of
an alarm, each company would endeavour to reach the fire first, where they
would act independently. The joint patrol operated until June 1806, when it
disbanded amid worries over cost, and the inability to attract other companies
to it.<sup><a href="#_edn80" name="_ednref80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1808, a further cooperative working proposal, to set
up a joint insurance fire engine establishment in London, came to naught.<sup><a href="#_edn81" name="_ednref81" title="">[81]</a></sup>
Around the same time, though, two fire offices in Bath established a joint
brigade, while in 1813, a joint fire patrol was established in Reading. The
following year, bitter winter weather prompted five London insurance companies
to set up another joint night patrol for the duration.<sup><a href="#_edn82" name="_ednref82" title="">[82]</a></sup> </p>

<p>In this period, fire insurance companies remained
firm in their instructions to firemen to attend “all” fires, and to “render the
utmost assistance to all who need it”, upon pain of dismissal for neglect.<sup><a href="#_edn83" name="_ednref83" title="">[83]</a>,
<a href="#_edn84" name="_ednref84" title="">[84]</a>,
<a href="#_edn85" name="_ednref85" title="">[85]</a></sup>
While such rules do not necessarily survive for every company, taken together
with attendance payments records, there is a firm impression that most
companies acted in the same way.<sup><a href="#_edn86" name="_ednref86" title="">[86]</a></sup>
Insurance fire brigades had by now become the <i>de facto</i> public fire
force, despite their attempts to encourage, resource and ultimately enforce
parishes’ legal responsibilities.<sup><a href="#_edn87" name="_ednref87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>

<p>As insurance fire brigades began to fight fires more
generally, they no longer needed to rely so much on fire marks as identifiers
of insured properties. Besides, after more than century of use, fire marks were
no longer reliable. Some remained on buildings long after their insurance had
lapsed, while some properties displayed more than one mark.<a href="#_edn88" name="_ednref88" title=""><sup>[88]</sup></a> </p>

<p>In 1809, the Albion company announced that fire marks
were no longer to be applied to buildings, because “…the firemen of the company
[will] render the utmost assistance to all who need it; the security of persons
insured will in no respect be diminished by the disuse of this superfluous
appendage.”<sub> </sub><a href="#_edn89" name="_ednref89" title=""><sup>[89]</sup></a>
None-the-less, some insurance companies started to issue fire plates, whose
sole purpose was to advertise the company.<sup><a href="#_edn90" name="_ednref90" title="">[90]</a></sup></p>

<h3>1820s onwards</h3>

<p>The number of fire insurance companies continued to
grow in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, both within London and beyond. Thirty-eight
were extant by 1820, and more than fifty a decade later. The companies became
increasingly concerned by the costs of their fire-fighting provisions, and
started to look for economies of scale. From 1<sup>st</sup> January 1827, three
London-based insurance brigades were brought under the control of a single
Superintendent. This allowed the individual companies to rationalize their
outlays. A fourth company joined the joint organization in 1831, followed by a
fifth.<sup><a href="#_edn91" name="_ednref91" title="">[91]</a>,
<a href="#_edn92" name="_ednref92" title="">[92]</a>, <a href="#_edn93" name="_ednref93" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>

<p>On 1<sup>st</sup> January 1833, ten London fire
insurance company brigades amalgamated, to form the London Fire Engine
Establishment (LFEE).<sup><a href="#_edn94" name="_ednref94" title="">[94]</a>,
<a href="#_edn95" name="_ednref95" title="">[95]</a> 
</sup>Its first major test raised the issue of uninsured properties once more.
Following the catastrophic burning of the Houses of Parliament, in October 1834,
fire insurance companies emphasised to the Government that they had fought that
fire purely as a “favour”. The Parliament buildings were not insured, their
fire brigades were still private concerns, and the insurance companies had to necessarily
protect their own interests first. If a choice had to be made between attending
a fire at a company’s insured property, or an uninsured one, the latter would
have to be left to burn. No Government action was taken.<sup><a href="#_edn96" name="_ednref96" title="">[96]</a>,
<a href="#_edn97" name="_ednref97" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following a further disastrous fire in 1861, the LFEE
advised Government that they could no longer be solely responsible for firefighting
in London. Only one third of London property was insured, but policy holders
were also bearing the expenses of protecting the majority of London properties,
which were uninsured. After an “official inquiry and some vacillation”, the
Government agreed to establish a public fire service for the capital. Consequently,
on 1<sup>st</sup> January 1866, the LFEE handed over its duties, and much of
its equipment, to the newly formed Metropolitan Fire Brigade.<sup><a href="#_edn98" name="_ednref98" title="">[98]</a>, <a href="#_edn99" name="_ednref99" title="">[99]</a>, <a href="#_edn100" name="_ednref100" title="">[100]</a>
</sup>At its peak, forty fire insurance companies had been associated with their
joint brigade, although that number had reduced to twenty-eight by the time of
its disbandment.<sup><a href="#_edn101" name="_ednref101" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>

<p>Outside London, many places were still reluctant to
establish municipal fire brigades, because the additional costs to the rates
were thought to be too unpopular. <a name="_Hlk121756070">Where local
authorities did take on fire-fighting responsibilities, they still looked to
the insurance companies for substantial support.</a><sup><a href="#_edn102" name="_ednref102" title="">[102]</a>,<a href="#_edn103" name="_ednref103" title="">[103]</a></sup>
Tensions grew between insurance companies and local authorities during 19<sup>th</sup>
century. Where the companies faced substantial risks, they remained encumbered
with maintaining their own brigades, or risk facing unaffordable losses. Many
local authorities were simply content to let them continue with the good job
that they had been doing for so many years.</p>

<p>Only two occasions have been reported, though, where
insurance companies threatened the authorities that they would cease attending fires
in uninsured properties. These instances, in 1871 and 1895, were part of the
much larger and long-standing disagreement over the provision and funding of
public fire services.<a href="#_edn104" name="_ednref104" title=""><sup>[104]</sup></a>
 They post-date much of the evidence that has been accrued for insurance
brigades letting uninsured buildings burn. Therefore, they cannot be regarded
as the foundation of the legend.</p>

<p>A similar threat of non-attendance was also available
in other circumstances. In 1833, regulations for the County Fire Office’s
brigades in provincial towns required that engines were not to be sent to
uninsured properties, unless an undertaking had been given that all expenses
would be paid by the interested parties. If such expenses were not paid, the
brigade would not attend future fires at the property.<a href="#_edn105" name="_ednref105" title=""><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p>The last fire insurance brigade did not disband until

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>In the early years of fire insurance, insurance
company fire brigades seemingly made little distinction between insured and
uninsured properties. They were instructed to attend and help put out all
fires. The grounds for this policy included the risk of fire-spread between
uninsured and insured properties, the advertising value of the firemen and
their engines, and charitable acts for those who could not afford insurance.</p>

<p>In principle, this policy seems to have remained in
force throughout the 18<sup>th</sup> century. In practice, though, changing
circumstances led to keen rivalry between fire brigades, whether insurance
company, parish or private. Firstly, monetary rewards were introduced for the
earliest attendees at fires. That innovation led to engines racing each other
through the streets. As the number of fire insurance companies grew, so, too,
did the number of fire engines. Once at the fire, too many engines were too
often competing for very limited water supplies.</p>

<p>When the nature of the firemen is added to this
situation, the scene is set for more competition, and chaos. This, in turn, can
reasonably be imagined as having led to conflict – both verbal and physical.
With no reward, no water, and no insurance interest in a burning building, it
is not difficult to envisage firemen standing back on occasion, jeering and
generally interfering with rival brigades fighting a fire in which they did
have an interest. Or, alternatively, simply packing up and going home.
Arguably, therefore, the legend of insurance fire brigades letting uninsured
buildings burn originated in the first half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Reciprocal fire-fighting arrangements had long been made
between insurance companies. They started to develop into more formal working
arrangements in the decades around the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. At
the same time, insurance brigades continued to follow their employers’ directives
to attend and extinguish all fires, whether insured or not. They were the <i>de
facto</i> established fire service for most localities. Fire marks became
redundant.</p>

<p>Despite these more formalized joint arrangements, rivalry
and discord are still ascribed to firemen as the 19<sup>th</sup> century
progressed. They brought “notoriety” to their employers, and sometimes “evil”
to the fire-grounds – including declining to put out fires in uninsured
properties. Insurance companies themselves, though, were sometimes minded not
to send engines to uninsured properties, unless their expenses were guaranteed
to be met. </p>

<p>Demands on the insurance brigades, and costs to their
employers, grew as the 19<sup>th</sup> century progressed. Some brigades,
including those for London, eventually handed over to newly established
municipal fire forces. Otherwise, they soldiered on, but only on two recorded
occasions did they threaten to stop attending fires in uninsured properties. These
instances, in 1871 and 1895, cannot be regarded as the foundation of the
legend.</p>
