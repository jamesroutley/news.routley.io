          Welcome to the online Awakening Bell, inspired by the teaching of Thich Nhat Hanh. Many people around the
          world take pleasure
          in stopping and consciously breathing in and out three times when they hear the sound of the bell.
          Click below for examples of the sound made by the big and the small bell. Either can be used by inputing a
          time interval,
          an exact time, or a random interval. Enjoy, and please email feedback and suggestions to awakeningbelldotorg
          at gmail.com. <span>â˜º</span>
