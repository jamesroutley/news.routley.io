    <h1>My Mechanic Journal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <div><div> <p><a href="https://calculatingempires.net/blog/?tag=cars">cars</a><span>, </span><a href="https://calculatingempires.net/blog/?tag=life">life</a><span></span></p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>I know I am not the only one who wants to know how everything works. After all, there are plenty of shows dedicated to the manufacturing processes of pretty much everything. I <em>really</em> like knowing how things work. As a kid, I would regularly take apart random things (think toys, small electronics), look at them, and put them back together. They usually worked after I put them back together.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the desire to know how things work goes beyond just curiosity. I bought a car not too long ago. A semi-cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_S-Class_(W220)">2000 Mercedes S500</a>, which I currently use every day. I have had a driver&#39;s license for a few years and have driven my mom&#39;s car on a couple of occasions. Now, I have my own car. An object that has tons of moving parts and electronics. I didn&#39;t know how it really worked, which bothered me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I studied using some books and lots of YouTube and now have a rudimentary understanding of the basics of a car. It turned out to be pretty fascinating! Unfortunately, finding a job in software engineering has become very very difficult for a fresh college grad like myself.</p>
<p>However, that gives me the perfect opportunity to go do random things like being a mechanic! That&#39;s what I decided to do, at least until I can get a job more aligned with my intended career. I&#39;ve started working part-time at an auto repair shop that is very willing to teach and be patient with me. I plan to do whatever they expect me to as long as they pay me and I get to learn more about cars. Quite a bit of what they expect me to do is IT stuff, since I&#39;m good with computers and all. It&#39;s okay though. I need to give some of my skills to take some of theirs.</p>
<p>To help me retain my skills and reflect on what I learn while working there, I plan to keep a journal where I just write down what I&#39;ve learned for the day. Here it is.</p>
<h3>6/15/24 (10 hours)</h3>
<ul>
<li>On some cars, you have an accessory belt with no tensioner. This means you have to stretch the belt around the pulley. There&#39;s no way you&#39;re managing that without a bit of trickery. I found <a href="https://youtu.be/diJ1mXW2WOY">a trick on YouTube</a> involving 2 zip ties.</li>
<li>The push-start ignition switch is a bitch to find and you will look like an idiot trying to get most modern cars started.</li>
<li>It is easy to have more debt from <a href="https://www.snapon.com/">Snap-on</a> tools than money in your bank account.</li>
<li>Common sense goes a long way.</li>
<li>Parts are cheap. Labor is expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6/17/24 (2 hours)</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you take the lugs off a wheel, and it&#39;s stuck to the hub, you may have to hit the tire with a hammer from the back.</li>
<li>Rotating your tires (i.e. swapping the front two with the back two) frequently will get you a lot more life out of them and save you some money.</li>
</ul>
