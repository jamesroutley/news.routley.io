On this page you can listen to and control a short-wave receiver located at the amateur radio club
<a href="http://www.etgd.utwente.nl">ETGD</a> at the
<a href="http://www.utwente.nl">University of Twente</a>.
In contrast to other web-controlled receivers, this receiver can be tuned by multiple
users simultaneously, thanks to the use of Software-Defined Radio.

This site, which in 2008 was the very first WebSDR site ever,
was finally reactivated in July 2012 after <a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/qrt.html">an interruption of more than 1.5 years</a>;
read also the <a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/oldnews.html">old news since then</a>.

The system is currently composed of a &#34;Mini-Whip&#34; antenna,
a homebuilt SDR board (as pictured; see <a href="http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/sdr/#nov2008">here for background</a>)
which samples the entire shortwave spectrum and sends all of this via
a gigabit ethernet link to a PC, where a special version of the
WebSDR server software processes it.
The Mini-Whip is based on a design from PA0RDT (google finds it); see
<a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/qrt.html">some pictures</a>.
The active receiving element is about 5 by 10 cm large.
Such an antenna only works well with a <a href="http://pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn09d.html">good grounding</a>;
ours is on top of a 20m high building, the upper part of which is all metal.
