    <h1>AMD passes Intel in market cap</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="RegularArticle-articleBody-5-2"><div><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMD" target="_blank">AMD</a> surpassed rival <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC" target="_blank">Intel</a>&#39;s market cap on Friday.</p><p>AMD stock rose over 3% for the day, giving the chipmaker a market capitalization of $153 billion. Intel fell nearly 9%, a day after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/intel-intc-earnings-q2-2022.html">disastrous earnings</a> that missed expectations for profit and showed declining revenue. Intel&#39;s market cap was $148 billion at the end of trading on Friday.</p><p>The shift is mostly symbolic, but it signifies a much more competitive market for PC and server chips, where the two companies compete directly.</p><p>The milestone also suggests that investors may value an asset-light chipmaker over one that&#39;s investing heavily in manufacturing. AMD outsources production to outside &#34;fabs,&#34; or chip factories, whereas Intel has said it plans to continue building and operating plants.</p><p>In recent years, AMD chips have become much more competitive with Intel&#39;s products in terms of performance, even surpassing their speed and efficiency for some applications.</p><p>Intel said on Thursday that its disappointing report reflected execution issues and dropped its forecast for full-year earnings per share from $2.30 to $3.60. Intel also blamed a slowing PC market and macroeconomic conditions for its miss.</p><p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger compared the company&#39;s comeback strategy to <a href="https://twitter.com/dee_bosa/status/1553092283565613061" target="_blank">climbing Mount Kilimanjaro</a> in an interview with CNBC on Friday.</p><p>AMD reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, when investors will be watching to see if it is facing the same macroeconomic challenges as Intel as PC sales <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/11/pandemic-boom-in-pc-sales-is-over.html">drop around the world</a>.</p><p><em>Correction: The original headline to this story mistakenly stated that it was the first time AMD had passed Intel in market cap. In fact, it happened before in Feb. 2022.</em></p></div></div></div>
