Sloths are unable to regulate their own body temperatures like most mammals, and instead are completely reliant on the environmental conditions. This means that when it is too hot or too cold, sloths have to modify their behaviour accordingly. On hot days, sloths move very little (because movement generates even more body heat). They drop down to the lower canopy, find some shade, spread out their limbs and wait for the temperature to cool down. When it is too cold, sloths either have to warm their body temperature by basking, or they have to just sit still, curl in a ball and wait for the sun to come out.</p><figure id="attachment_2813" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2813"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SLOTH_TW_027277-300x200.jpg" alt="SLOTH_TW_027277" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SLOTH_TW_027277-300x200.jpg 300w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SLOTH_TW_027277-600x400.jpg 600w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SLOTH_TW_027277-768x513.jpg 768w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SLOTH_TW_027277-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SLOTH_TW_027277.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2813"><em>Copyright, Suzi Eszterhas</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although the tropics do sometimes experience temperature extremes (cold depressions and heat waves), temperatures typically stay within a very narrow range. For example, during my sloth studies I set up a remote weather station and monitored the conditions for 3 continuous years. The temperature on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica never dropped below 23℃, even in the middle of the night. However, this is no longer the case. During the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, the temperature in the Caribbean has plummeted. In December we experienced our first tropical storm on record, and temperatures frequently fluctuated below 20℃ for weeks on end. Species that live in the tropics have evolved over millions of years in a climatically very stable environment, and as such, they do not have the flexibility to cope with extreme, rapid weather changes. This is particularly the case for sloths.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gjsg60dnguzx-225x300.jpg" alt="gjsg60dnguzx" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gjsg60dnguzx-225x300.jpg 225w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gjsg60dnguzx-600x800.jpg 600w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gjsg60dnguzx.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"/></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c-300x200.jpg" alt="c" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c-300x200.jpg 300w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c-600x400.jpg 600w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c-768x512.jpg 768w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/c.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"/></p><p><a href="http://slothconservation.org/product/sponsor-a-sloth-crossing" data-wpel-link="internal"> <img src="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/purple-banner.png" alt=" Sloth Conservation Primary"/> <img src="https://slothconservation.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/highlight-sponsor.png" alt="Sloth Conservation Secondary"/> </a></p></div></article></main></div></div></div>
