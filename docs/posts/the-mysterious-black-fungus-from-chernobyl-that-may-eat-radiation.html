It hadn&#39;t just moved in because workers at the plant had left. Instead, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756209810575">Zhdanova</a> had found in previous surveys of soil around Chernobyl that the fungi were actually growing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756208604281">towards</a> the radioactive particles that littered the area. Now, she found that they had reached into the original source of the radiation, the rooms within the exploded reactor building.</p><p>With each survey taking her close to harmful radiation, Zhdanova&#39;s work has also overturned our ideas about how radiation impacts life on Earth. Now her discovery offers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S187861461930159X">hope of cleaning up radioactive sites</a> and even provide ways of protecting astronauts from harmful radiation as they travel into space.  </p><p>Eleven years before Zhdanova&#39;s visit, a routine safety test of reactor four at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190725-will-we-ever-know-chernobyls-true-death-toll">quickly turned into the world&#39;s worst nuclear accident</a>. A series of errors both in the design of the reactor and its operation led to a huge explosion in the early hours of 26 April 1986. The result was a single, massive release of radionuclides. Radioactive iodine was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl/faqs">a leading cause of death</a> in the first days and weeks, and, later, of cancer. </p><p>In an attempt to reduce the risk of radiation poisoning and long-term health complications, a 30km (19 mile) exclusion zone – also known as the &#34;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sites.se.manchester.ac.uk/nuclearhitchhiker/2017/03/10/637/">zone of alienation&#34; – was established</a> to keep people at a distance from the worst of the radioactive remains of reactor four.</p><p>But while humans were kept away, Zhdanova&#39;s black mould had slowly colonised the area.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Germán Orizaola/Pablo Burraco Ionising radiation may have led tree frogs inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone to have darker skin (left) than those outside it (right) (Credit: Germán Orizaola/ Pablo Burraco)"/><span>Germán Orizaola/Pablo Burraco</span></p><figcaption>Ionising radiation may have led tree frogs inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone to have darker skin (left) than those outside it (right) (Credit: Germán Orizaola/ Pablo Burraco)</figcaption></figure><p>Like plants reaching for sunlight, Zhdanova&#39;s research indicated that the fungal hyphae of the black mould seemed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756209810575">attracted</a> to ionising radiation. But &#34;radiotropism&#34;, as Zhdanova called it, was a paradox: ionising radiation is generally far more powerful than sunlight, a barrage of radioactive particles that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK401323/">shreds through DNA and proteins</a> like bullets puncture flesh. The damage it causes can trigger harmful mutations, destroy cells and kill organisms.</p><p>Along with the apparently radiotropic fungi, Zhdanova&#39;s surveys found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756208615026">36 other species of ordinary, but distantly related, fungi growing</a> around Chernobyl. Over the next two decades, her pioneering work on the radiotropic fungi she identified would reach far outside of Ukraine. It would add to knowledge of a potentially <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2677413/">new foundation of life</a> on Earth – one that thrives on radiation rather than sunlight. And it would lead scientists at Nasa to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/ames/could-future-homes-on-the-moon-and-mars-be-made-of-fungi/">consider surrounding their astronauts in walls of fungi</a> for a durable form of life support.</p><p>At the centre of this story is a pigment found widely in life on Earth: melanin. This molecule, which can range from black to reddish brown, is what leads to different skin and hair colours in people. But it is also the reason why the various species of mould growing in Chernobyl were black. Their cell walls were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756209810575">packed</a> with melanin.</p><p>Just as darker skin protects our cells from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, Zhdanova suspected that the melanin of these fungi was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1369527408001306?via%3Dihub">acting as a shield</a> against ionising radiation.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><div><p><span>Just as those black moulds colonised an abandoned world at Chernobyl, perhaps they could one day protect our first steps on new worlds elsewhere in the Solar System</span></p></div><p>It wasn&#39;t just fungi that were harnessing melanin&#39;s protective properties. In the ponds around Chernobyl, frogs with higher concentrations of melanin in their cells, and so darker in colour, were <a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/chernobyl-black-frogs-reveal-evolution-in-action-191034">better able to survive and reproduce</a>, slowly turning the local population living there black.</p><p>In warfare, a shield might protect a soldier from an arrow by deflecting the projectile away from their body. But melanin doesn&#39;t work like this. It isn&#39;t a hard or smooth surface. The radiation – whether UV or radioactive particles – is <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2677413/">swallowed by its disordered structure</a>, its energy <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2671032/">dissipated rather than deflected</a>. Melanin is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459156/">also an antioxidant</a>, a molecule that can turn the reactive ions that radiation produces in biological matter and return them to a stable state.</p><p>In 2007, Ekaterina Dadachova, a nuclear scientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, added to Zhdanova&#39;s work on Chernobyl&#39;s fungi, revealing that their growth wasn&#39;t just directional (radiotropic) but actually <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17520016/">increased</a> in the presence of radiation. Melanised fungi, just like those inside Chernobyl&#39;s reactor, grew 10% faster in the presence of radioactive Caesium compared to the same fungi cultured without radiation, she found. Dadachova and her team also found that the melanised fungi that were irradiated appeared to be using the energy to help drive its metabolism. In other words, they were using it to grow.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Elsevier/ Zhdanova et al. 2000 Cultures found in the fourth unit at Chernobyl, including Cladosporium sphaerospermum.

These fungi weren&#39;t just growing towards radiation for warmth or some unknown reaction between radiation and its surroundings as Zhdanova had suggested. Dadachova believed the fungi were actively feeding on the radiation&#39;s energy. She called this process &#34;<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17520016/">radiosynthesis</a>&#34;. And melanin was central to the theory.</p><p>&#34;The energy of ionising radiation is around one million times higher than the energy of white light, which is used in photosynthesis,&#34; says Dadachova. &#34;So you need a pretty powerful energy transducer, and this is what we think melanin is capable of doing – to transduce [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ionizing-radiation-and-health-effects">ionising radiation</a>] into usable levels of energy.&#34; </p><p>Radiosynthesis is still just a theory, as it can only be proven if the precise mechanism between melanin and metabolism is discovered. Scientists would need to find the exact receptor – or a particular nook in melanin&#39;s convoluted structure – that is involved in converting radiation into energy for growth.</p><p>In more recent years, Dadachova and her colleagues have started to identify some of the <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32389299/">pathways</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33425251/">proteins</a> that might underlie the fungi&#39;s increase in growth with ionising radiation. </p><p>Not all melanised fungi show a tendency for radiotropism and positive growth in the presence of radiation. A 2006 <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16821711/">study</a> from Zhdanova and her colleagues, for example, found that only nine of the 47 species of melanised fungi they collected at Chernobyl grew towards a source of radioactive caesium (caesium-137). </p></div></div></div></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><div><div><p>Similarly, in 2022, scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16063-z">found no difference in growth</a> when two species of fungi (one melanised, one not) were exposed to UV radiation and caesium-137.</p><p>But that same year, the same tendency for fungal growth when exposed to radiation <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.877625/full">was found again –</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.877625/full"> in space</a>.</p><p>Different from the radioactive decay found at Chernobyl, so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/why-space-radiation-matters/">galactic cosmic radiation</a> is an invisible storm of charged protons, each travelling near the speed of light through the Universe.
