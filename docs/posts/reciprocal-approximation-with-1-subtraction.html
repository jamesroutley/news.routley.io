    <h1>Reciprocal Approximation with 1 Subtraction</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today&#39;s find: You can get a floating-point approximation of 1/x that&#39;s accurate to 3 bits with a single integer subtraction instruction.</p><pre><code>  float fast_reciprocal(float x)
  {
    unsigned i = *(unsigned *) &amp;x; 
    i = 0x7effffffU - i;
    return *(float *) &amp;i;
  }
</code></pre><p>
The magic number 0x7effffff accomplishes two things:</p><p>1) The exponent is calculated as 253-e, which effectively negates the exponent and subtracts 1.</p><p>2) The mantissa is approximated as a 1st order polynomial in the interval [1, 2).</p><p>Interesting, but perhaps not very useful (as most CPU:s have more accurate reciprocal approximations these days).</p></div></div></div>
