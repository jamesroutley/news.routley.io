    <h1>Ask HN: How are pull requests integrated in a repo with high commit frequency?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>So let&#39;s assume we open a pull request, merged current main into our feature branch and are running tests. The full acceptance test suite takes 5 minutes to complete.
Meanwhile, in those 5 minutes, 10 other commits have been made. If we merge now, we can&#39;t be sure that we won&#39;t break stuff right?<p>So after merging the pull request, are you supposed to perform another set of regression tests? Hard to find info about that</p></td></div></div>
