    <p>I read an article yesterday, stating that on average, people spend 4 hours and 37 minutes on their phones per day<sup><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/smartphone-usage-stats/#time-spent-using-smartphones-annually" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, with South Africans coming in fourth highest in the world at a whopping 5 hours and 11 minutes<sup><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/smartphone-usage-stats/#time-spent-using-smartphones-by-region" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This figure seems really high to me. If we assume people sleep roughly 8 hours per day, that means that one third of their day is spent on their phones. If we also assume people work 8 hours per day (ignoring the fact that they may be using their phones during work hours), that suggests that people spend over half of their free time (and up to 65% of it) glued to their screens.</p>
<p>I never wanted to carry the internet around in my pocket. It&#39;s too distracting and pulls me out of the present moment, fracturing my attention. I&#39;ve tried switching to old-school black and white phones before, but always begrudgingly returned to using a smartphone due to the utility of it. The problem, however, is that it comes with too many attention sinks tucked in alongside the useful tools.</p>
<p>I care about living an intentional and meaningful life, nurturing relationships, having nuanced conversations, and enjoying the world around me. I don&#39;t want to spend this limited time I have on earth watching short form video and getting into arguments on Twitter.</p>

<small>This is what I enjoy. Picture taken yesterday in Scarborough, South Africa.</small></p>
<p>I&#39;ve written at length about how I manage my digital consumption, from <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/notifications/">turning off notifications</a> to <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/slow-social-media/">forgoing social media entirely</a>. The underlying premise here is that if you&#39;re trying to lose weight, you shouldn&#39;t carry cookies around in your pockets. And my phone is the bag of cookies in this metaphor.</p>
<p>We&#39;re wired to seek out distraction, novel information, and entertainment, and avoid boredom at all costs. But boredom is where creativity and self-reflection do their best work. It&#39;s why &#34;all the best ideas come when you&#39;re in the shower&#34;—we don&#39;t usually take our phones with us into the shower (yet).</p>
<p>According to Screen Time on my iPhone, on average I spend 30 minutes per day on it, which I think is reasonable, especially considering the most-used apps are by-and-large utility apps like banking and messages. This isn&#39;t because I have more self-control than other people. I don&#39;t think I do. It&#39;s because I know myself, and have set up my digital life to be a positive force, and not an uninspired time-sink.</p>
<p>There are many apps and systems to incentivise better relationships with our phones, mostly based around time limits. But these are flawed in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;m an adult, I know how to circumvent these limits, and I will if motivation is low.</li>
<li>Time limits don&#39;t affect the underlying addiction. You don&#39;t quit smoking by only smoking certain hours of the day.</li>
<li>The companies that build these apps have tens of thousands of really smart people (and billions of dollars) trying to get me hooked and keep me engaged. The only way to win this game isn&#39;t by trying to beat them (I certainly can&#39;t), but by not playing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only way I&#39;ve found to have a good relationship with my phone is to make it as uninteresting as possible. The first way is to not have recommendation media (think Instagram, TikTok, and all the rest). I&#39;m pro deleting these accounts completely, because it&#39;s really easy to re-download the apps on a whim, or visit them in-browser. However some people have found that having them on a dedicated device works by isolating those activities. Something like a tablet at home that is &#34;the only place you&#39;re allowed to use Instagram&#34;. I can&#39;t comment too much on this route, but it seems reasonable.</p>
<p>My biggest time sink over the past few years has been YouTube. The algorithm knew me too well and would recommend video after engaging, but ultimately useless video. I could easily burn an entire evening watching absolute junk—leaving me feeling like I&#39;d just wasted what could have otherwise been a beautiful sunset or a tasty home-cooked lasagne. However, at the beginning of this year I learnt that you can turn off your YouTube watch history entirely, which means no recommendations. Here&#39;s what my YouTube home screen now looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/45-1.webp" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-11 at 08"/></p>
<p>Without the recommendations I very quickly run out of things to watch from the channels I&#39;m subscribed to. It&#39;s completely changed my relationship with YouTube since I only watch the videos I actually want to watch, and none of the attention traps. You can turn off your YouTube watch history <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history">here</a>, and auto delete your other Google history (like historic searches and navigation) <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols/">here</a>, which I think is just good practice.</p>
<p>I also used my adblocker, AdGuard on Safari which has a useful &#34;block element&#34; feature, to block the recommended videos on the right of YouTube videos. I use this feature to hide shorts as well, since I have no interest in watching them either, and YouTube intentionally makes them impossible to remove. If you&#39;re interested in a similar setup, here are the selectors I use to block those elements:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>youtube.com###items &gt; ytd-item-section-renderer.style-scope.ytd-watch-next-secondary-results-renderer:last-child
youtube.com###sections
youtube.com##[is-shorts]
youtube.com###secondary
</pre></div>
<p>The only media that I do sometimes consume on my phone are my RSS feeds, but it&#39;s something I&#39;m completely comfortable with since it&#39;s explicitly opt-in by design and low volume.</p>
<p>While I still have the twitch to check my phone when I&#39;m waiting for a coffee, or in-between activities—because my brain&#39;s reward system has been trained to do this—I&#39;m now rewarded with nothing. Over time, I find myself checking my phone less and less. Sometimes I notice the urge, and just let it go, instead focusing on the here and now.</p>
<p>I think that while the attention-span-degrading effects of recommendation media are getting most of the headlines, what isn&#39;t spoken about as much is the sheer number of hours lost globally to our phones (3.8 million years per day, according to my back-of-the-napkin-math). And while people may argue that this could involve productive work or enjoyable leisure, I suspect that the vast (vast!) majority of that time is short-form entertainment.</p>
<p>My solution may sound overkill to many people, but I can say with absolute certainty that it has turned me into a more present, less distracted, and more optimistic person. I have much more time to spend in nature, with friends, or on my hobbies and projects. I can&#39;t imagine trading it in for a tiny screen, ever.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p>
