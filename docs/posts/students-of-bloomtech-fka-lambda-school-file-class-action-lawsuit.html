                        <p>Four students at the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coding-bootcamps-worth-it-how-to-code-tech-careers-2022-1" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">coding boot camp</a> Bloom Institute of Technology, formerly known as Lambda School, have filed a class-action lawsuit against the school.</p><p>The National Student Legal Defense Network, along with cocounsel Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland and Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy, filed the lawsuit Thursday on behalf of the students. The school, known as BloomTech for short, offers students the option to pay up-front tuition, or to pay no up-front tuition fees and instead pay back their tuition through an <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/tuition/income-share-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">income-share agreement</a>, meaning that when a student lands a job paying $50,000 or more, they must pay back 14% of their income for four years or until they hit a cap of $40,000. </p><p>The students, who attended from March 2020 until the present, say in the lawsuit that they enrolled because they were attracted by the high job-placement rates in tech. They allege that the school had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-graduation-placement-rate-2020-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">false and misleading information</a> about job-placement rates on its website and on CEO Austen Allred&#39;s Twitter account. </p><p>What&#39;s more, they say that BloomTech engaged in unlicensed lending and point out that the school operated <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-california-bppe-2019-8" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">without California state approval</a> until August 2020. The students are asking for equitable relief, such as canceling their income-share agreements or getting a refund.</p>
                        
                        <p>While students have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-arbitration-misrepresenting-job-rates-2021-5" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">previously taken legal action</a> against BloomTech, this is the first class-action lawsuit against it. </p><p>Alex Elson, the vice president of Student Defense, said the organization has received many complaints about the school, particularly about the misleading job-placement rates, as well as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">dissatisfaction with the quality of education</a>. </p><p>&#34;They wouldn&#39;t have gone if they didn&#39;t know what the true rates are,&#34; Elson told Insider. </p><p>BloomTech has raised over $129 million from investors like GV (formerly Google Ventures), Stripe, and Ashton Kutcher. </p>
                        
                        <p>Former BloomTech students said that the school fell short of its promise, with underqualified instructors and an incomplete curriculum, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-y-combinator-cult-2019-10" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Insider first reported</a>. They said they often had to rely on self-teaching and were brushed off when they voiced concerns about the program or complained about harassment. Leaked documents also showed that BloomTech&#39;s job-placement rates were much lower than advertised, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">Insider previously reported</a>.</p><p>Income-share agreements have become popular <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coding-bootcamps-outcomes-lambda-school-bloomtech-flatiron-2021-12" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">among coding boot camps</a> because students don&#39;t have to pay tuition up front. But income-share agreements can be risky because they&#39;re not clearly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/isa-income-share-agreements-lambda-school-purdue-2020-4" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel="">regulated by federal laws</a>, which focus on consumer loans.</p><p>BloomTech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><em><strong>Got a tip?</strong> Contact this reporter via email at <a href="mailto:rmchan@businessinsider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link">rmchan@insider.com</a>, Signal at 646.376.6106, or Telegram at @rosaliechan. (PR pitches by email only, please.)
