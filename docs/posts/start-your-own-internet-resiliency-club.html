        <p>Thanks to war, geopolitics, and climate change, Europe will have more
frequent and more severe <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2025/05/09/russia-preparing-war-europe-dutch-pm-activities-finnish-border">internet
disruptions</a>
in the very near future. Governments and businesses need to prepare
for catastrophic loss of communications. Unfortunately, the necessary
changes are risky and expensive, which means they won’t do it until a
<a href="https://layeraleph.com/">crisis</a> is already here. However, small
groups of volunteers with a little bit of time and money can provide
crucial initial leadership to bootstrap recovery.</p>
<p>An Internet Resiliency Club is a group of internet experts who can
communicate with each other across a few kilometers without any
centralized infrastructure using cheap, low-power, unlicensed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a> radios and open source
<a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> text messaging software. These
volunteer groups can use their radios, technical skills, and personal
connections with other experts to restore internet connectivity.</p>
<p>This page is a quick-start guide to forming your own Internet
Resiliency Club. You can also join a <a href="https://lists.bowshock.nl/mailman/listinfo/irc">mailing
list</a> for general
questions and discussion about internet resiliency clubs:</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerieaurora/">Valerie Aurora</a>, a
systems software engineer with 25 years of experience in open source
software, operating systems, networking, file systems, and volunteer
organizing. When I moved from San Francisco to Amsterdam in 2023, I
started looking for ways to give back to my new home. In addition to
systems consulting, I am a special rapporteur for the EU’s Cyber
Resilience Act, serve as a RIPE Meeting program committee member, and
speak at European technical conferences.</p>

<p>One of my nightmares is waking up one morning and discovering that the
power is out, the internet is down, my cell phone doesn’t work, and
when I turn on the emergency radio (if you have one), all you hear is
“Swan Lake” on repeat.</p>
<p>As a recent immigrant to Amsterdam, I began to realize that this
nightmare was increasingly likely. Russia regularly knocks out
communications and power in Ukraine, using both bombs and hackers. In
2022, German windmills were disabled by malware aimed at Ukraine.
Dubious tankers continue to “accidentally” drag their anchors and cut
undersea cables in the Baltic. The head of NATO advised everyone to
keep three days of supplies at home.</p>
<h2 id="ukraines-advice-on-network-resilience">Ukraine’s advice on network resilience</h2>
<p>What made me finally take action is watching a video created by
<a href="https://1-ix.net/en/poslugy-en-translation/ua-exchange/">Ukrainian IXP
1-IX</a> to
teach other European countries what Ukrainian internet operators have
learned about hardening and repairing internet infrastructure leading
up to and following the 2022 Russian invasion. The practical realities
of keeping networks operating during war were sobering: building
camoflouged router rooms with 3 days of generator power, replacing
active fiber optic cable with passive, getting military service
exemptions for their personnel, etc.. You can watch the most recent
version, <a href="https://ripe90.ripe.net/archives/video/1582/">“Network Resilience: Experiences of survival and development
during the war in
Ukraine”</a>, a 30 minute
presentation at RIPE 90.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-dutch-government-doing-to-prepare">What is the Dutch government doing to prepare?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the government of the Netherlands is not following
Ukraine’s lead. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">Bert Hubert’s blog post</a>
describes the Netherlands’ cloud-based “emergency communications”
system, which will definitely not work in any emergency that affects
power or internet connectivity.</p>
<p>I have asked many Dutch network operators if there is any official
plan for the communications equivalent of a “black start” of the
electrical grid. If there is one, it isn’t being shared with the
people who will have to implement it.</p>
<h2 id="crisis-engineering-to-the-rescue">Crisis engineering to the rescue</h2>
<p>The final piece of the idea came from a class I took on <a href="https://layeraleph.com/event/">Crisis
Engineering</a> from Layer Aleph, on how
organizations facing an existential crisis either swiftly transform
themselves into a more functional form, or they fail and become even
more dysfunctional. Our class’s first question was, “How do you
convince an organization that a crisis is coming and they need to
prepare for it?”</p>
<p>Their answer was both depressing and freeing: “You can’t. All you can
do is be prepared with tools and a plan for when the crisis arrives.
That’s when the organization will listen.”</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-personally">What can I do personally?</h2>
<p>I started thinking about what I could personally do without any help
from government or businesses. What if I could organize a group of
volunteer networking experts who could communicate without any
centralized infrastructure? We could effectively bootstrap
communications recovery with just a few volunteers and some cheap
hardware.</p>
<h2 id="ham-radio-is-too-expensive-difficult-and-power-hungry">Ham radio is too expensive, difficult, and power-hungry</h2>
<p>Initially I looked into ham radio, but it is just too expensive,
difficult, and power-hungry to be practical. Then Alexander Yurtchenko
told me about LoRa (Long Range) radio and Meshtastic, a cheap,
low-power method of sending text messages across a few kilometers.</p>
<p>After a few months of part-time research and organizing, the Amsterdam
Internet Resiliency Club was born. This page exists to make it easier
for other people to start Internet Resiliency Clubs in their area.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-volunteer-internet-resiliency-organizations">We need volunteer internet resiliency organizations</h2>
<p>The evidence that Internet Resiliency Clubs are necessary keeps
growing. Since I started this project, the city of Amsterdam announced
that it is planning for three weeks without electricity. Spain and
Portugal lost power for most of a day. The U.S. re-elected Donald
Trump, who may at some point realize that he can hold Europe hostage
by threatening to cut off access to U.S.-owned internet services like
AWS and Microsoft Exchange. Simultaneously, large parts of Dutch
government are migrating to email hosted by Microsoft, and major Dutch
technology firms continue to migrate to AWS and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>If you and I don’t do this, dear reader, no one will.</p>

<p>How to form an Internet Resiliency Club:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect a group of internet-y people within ~10 km of each other</li>
<li>Decide how to communicate normally (Signal, Matrix, email, etc.)</li>
<li>Buy everyone LoRa (Long Range) radios and a powerbank with trickle charge</li>
<li>Install Meshtastic on the LoRa radios</li>
<li>Choose a LoRa channel to communicate on</li>
<li>Organize meetups, send messages over Meshtastic, have fun</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work for a internet infrastructure company, you can suggest
giving interested employees a LoRa radio, a mobile phone powerbank,
and maybe even a small solar panel for their personal use (perhaps as
part of an annual gift or bonus).</p>

<p>LoRa radios have several advantages for use in emergency
communications:</p>
<ul>
<li>no centralized infrastructure needed</li>
<li>no license needed</li>
<li>cheap (starting at ~€20)</li>
<li>low-power (&lt; 1W, can power with an ordinary mobile phone powerbank)</li>
<li>runs open source Meshtastic firmware</li>
<li>can send text messages across several line-of-sight hops (several kms)</li>
<li>can connect via Bluetooth or WiFi to phones/computers</li>
<li>many urban areas have a good Meshtastic network already</li>
</ul>
<p>Amateur ham radio can transmit at higher bandwidth for longer
distances, but requires extensive training, licensing, larger
antennas, and more power. Ideally, both would be available in an
emergency.</p>

<p>With a LoRa radio running the Meshtastic firmware, anyone can send
text messages to anyone else with a Meshtastic node as long as it
takes three or fewer forwards from other Meshtastic nodes to get from
source to destination (usually around ~10 km but highly dependent on
local terrain and weather).</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a> is a
proprietary technique for sending low bit-rate radio messages (~1 - 25
kbps) using very low power (&lt; 1W), derived from chirp spread spectrum
techniques. <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> is open source
firmware for LoRa radios that uses a flood-forward mesh protocol to
send message across up to three line-of-sight hops between LoRa nodes
running Meshtastic.</p>
<p>LoRa radios are for sale online. The cheapest versions are development
boards, intended for companies to use while building a product, often
without batteries, cases, or good antennas. To use them, you must
connect to them from a phone or computer, either over Bluetooth via
the Meshtastic app or over WiFi using a web browser. The more
expensive systems may include an enclosure, battery, solar panel,
larger screen, keyboard, etc. Some can be used without an additional
phone or computer.</p>

<p>LoRa radios use relatively little power, often in the range of 100 -
200 mA. A normal mobile phone power bank with a capacity of 10000 -
20000 mAh can power a LoRa radio approximately 2 - 8 days, depending
on chipset, time spent transmitting, whether WiFi or Bluetooth are in
use, etc. The powerbank should support “trickle charging”; without
this, many powerbanks will stop supplying power because the power draw
of many LoRa radios is so low that the powerbank thinks nothing is
connected and stops supplying power.</p>

<p>LoRa radios can be powered by directly plugging them into a small
solar panel with USB output, or by charging a battery used by the LoRa
radio. A small folding 800 cm^2 solar panel generating 15w with a
5W/500 mA max output is sufficient to power many LoRa radios. With
this small of a setup, you don’t need fuses, charge controllers,
buck/boost converters, or anything other than the solar panel and an
optional mobile phone power bank.</p>

<p>LoRa radios are available in a huge range of capabilities and
features. For an Internet Resiliency Club, we recommend one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heltec V3: no case, no battery, WiFi/Bluetooth, OLED display, USB-C</li>
<li>LILYGO T-Echo: case, built-in battery, Bluetooth, e-ink display, USB-C</li>
</ul>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: Never turn on a LoRa device without an antenna attached!
The power sent to the antenna can destroy the device if there is no
antenna attached to radiate it.</em></p>
<p>Note: While many LoRa devices have USB-C ports, they often don’t
implement USB-C PD (Power Delivery) and won’t charge their battery
correctly on USB-C to USB-C cables. Use a USB-A to USB-C cable (often
supplied with the device).</p>
<h2 id="heltec-v3-series">Heltec V3 series</h2>
<p>If you have more time than money, try the latest Heltec V3, currently
one of the cheapest boards available at around €20. It has a
postage stamp-sized OLED screen, a couple of tiny buttons,
WiFi/Bluetooth, and USB-C input/power (but use a USB-A to USB-C
cable). Received messages are displayed on the OLED and can be cycled
through with tiny buttons. Sending messages requires connecting to it
via WiFi or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>It has no case, but the little plastic box it comes in can easily be
turned into one with a sharp pen knife. It also has no battery, but it
is a good idea to have a separate power bank anyway since you need a
working phone or computer to send messages. It has no GPS.</p>

<h2 id="lilygo-t-echo">LILYGO T-Echo</h2>
<p>If you have more money than time, I recommend the LILYGO T-Echo, a
simple small low-power ready-to-use handheld device for about
€80. It has ~3cm square e-ink display, a case with a few buttons,
Bluetooth, GPS, and about a day’s worth of battery.
Input/output/charging is via USB-C (but use a USB-A to USB-C cable).
Received messages are displayed on the e-ink screen and can be cycled
through with the buttons. Sending messages requires connecting with
another device via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/lilygo/techo/">Meshtastic
page on this
board</a>
includes links to purchase from in Europe. I bought mine from

<h2 id="lilygo-t-deck">LILYGO T-Deck</h2>
<p>If you want a standalone device that doesn’t require a separate phone
or computer to send messages, the <a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/nl/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/met-lora/lilygo-t-deck-esp32-s3-toetsenbord-met-2.8-inch-ips-display-en-touchscreen-lora-868mhz-zwart">LILYGO
T-Deck</a>
includes a keyboard, trackball, and touch screen for about €70 -
80, depending on whether it includes a case and whether the antenna is
internal or external. It has about 8 hours of battery. I’m not a fan
because the screen and keyboard aren’t as good as the one on your
phone and take extra battery to run. It is often out of stock,
especially if you’re looking for a case and external antenna.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading-the-antenna">Upgrading the antenna</h2>
<p>Most of the antennas that ship with evaluation boards are not very
good. One option for an upgrade if you’re using the recommended 868
MHz network is the <a href="https://eleshop.eu/868-mhz-antenne-met-sma-connector.html">Taoglas
TI.08.A</a>.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: Never turn on a LoRa device without an antenna attached!
The power sent to the antenna can destroy the device if there is no
antenna attached to radiate it.</em></p>

<p>Some boards ship with Meshtastic already installed, but it’s
undoubtedly several months out of date. Flashing LoRa boards is
relatively easy; it can be as simple as using the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/">Meshtastic web
browser
flasher</a>
(requires Chrome or Edge) or dragging and dropping a file into a
mounted USB drive presented by the device. A command line tool using a
serial interface is also an option, but may require some fiddling with
a Python env.</p>

<p>In Europe, two frequencies are available for use by LoRa: <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/region-by-country/">868 MHz and
433
MHz</a>.
868 MHz is the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/radio-settings/">most popular for Meshtastic users in
Europe</a>. Several
modem presets are available; use the default mode <code>LONG_FAST</code> unless you
have a specific reason not to.</p>
<p>LoRa has
<a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/channels/">channels</a>,
a stream of messages using the same encryption key and channel name.
Each device is configured with a default primary channel shared by all
Meshtastic nodes. You can also configure secondary channels that can
only be accessed by nodes with the same key and channel name. Choose
an encryption key and channel name for a shared secondary channel. You
can share a QR code to configure a device with the appropriate
channels and settings.</p>

<p>The best time to learn how to work together with a group of people is
before a crisis, not during it. Crisis engineering tells us that a
team is more likely to be successful if everyone has already worked
together.</p>
<p>Since this is a volunteer group, “working” together has to be fun.
Invite your group to do fun things together, changing up what activity
you are doing, where it is located, and what time it is held so that
a wide variety of people can participate.</p>
