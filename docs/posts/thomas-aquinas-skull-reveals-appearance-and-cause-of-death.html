The scientists said as much, and said they also depended on iconic images of Aquinas. The representation they reproduced looks very similar to Carlo Crivelli’s 15th century painting of him. Still, having another image of Aquinas that accords with our collective imagination of him is not a bad thing.&#34;</p> <!-- EMBED START Image {id: "editor_10"} -->

Aquinas stopped to rest after the accident, first in Maenza and also at the Abbey of Fossanova. However, his situation did not improve, and he died a few weeks later. </p>

Aquinas was not ill prior to the head injury, and the violent collision with the tree on the <i>Via Latina</i> marked the beginning of his demise.”</p>

But as I began to study Aquinas, I discovered a profound Christian wisdom that helped me make sense of the world in a new way and understand how the Gospel can be proclaimed in a secular world — and especially how to answer the questions of secular students much more effectively and powerfully than any other thinker or ideology on offer in the contemporary university.”</p>

And can I know him?’ ‘How should I live in order to be happy?’”</p>

And we’ve been amazed and edified to see how much it has grown and how much it has changed the lives of many thousands of students who are seeking the truth.”</p>
