    <h1>Exploring phonics with OpenAI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><time datetime="2025-06-12">June 12th, 2025</time> • ~500 words • 2 minute read</p></header><p>As a child of the 80s and 90s, I have the vaguest memory of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfuGoVgCkJ8">Hooked on Phonics</a> commercials on television. More specifically their catchphrase &#34;hooked on phonics worked for me!&#34; Reconciling this message in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEG8j0lgeE">D.A.R.E</a> era felt like mixed-messaging. Do you or <em>don&#39;t</em> you want me hooked on things?</p><p>Today I was reminded of this musical sign-off—for Hooked on Phonics, not D.A.R.E—after an introductory conversation with an ed-tech organization for an engineering leadership position. They described the product and platform and how it teaches kids to read. &#34;Oh, I&#39;m old enough to remember phonics being a thing that was pushed in schools,&#34; I said.</p><p>It turns out old ideas never stray far.</p><p>An interesting thing that came out of that conversation was noting that the text-to-speech models don&#39;t do a great job with the phonetic sounds.</p><p>This makes some sense to me. I imagine the way the models are built, they&#39;re going to do a better job of producing entire words. Phonemes—distinct units of sound that make-up a word—probably don&#39;t map well to tokens, even if tokens themselves can map to parts of words.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a researched take—it&#39;s just my intuition at the moment.</p><p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer"><img src="https://georgemandis.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/phonics-tokens.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing how word to token mapping via OpenAI&#39;s tokenizer tool"/></a></p><p>I&#39;ll have to dig deeper if I&#39;m curious, but if the TTS models are using tokens in a way similar to how LLMs do, I could see how they would map more cleanly to words and partial words than the distinct sounds that necessarily comprise them.</p><p>After the call I immediately thought of a way to leverage AI shenanigans to try and create a tool that would:</p><ul><li>Identify distinct phonemes within a word, mapping them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> (IPA) symbols</li><li>Provide them back as a list via <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=responses#introduction">structured outputs</a></li><li>Iterate through the list and feed those individual phonemes back into <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio">OpenAI&#39;s TTS offering</a> to generate the sounds</li><li>Stitch it all together in a cute little web interface and see how it does</li></ul><p>I hacked together a quick demo to test this out. Behold, my mediocre exploration of phonics via OpenAI:</p><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VaMN-YTJL-M?si=H1FEjGN2q-DZlRYw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>You can view the source code for my phoneme explorer here on GitHub:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/georgemandis/openai-phoneme-exploration">https://github.com/georgemandis/openai-phoneme-exploration</a></li></ul><p>The actual structured output of phonemes, to my extremely untrained eye, didn&#39;t seem that bad! It seemed to map to the way words were presented in various Wikipedia articles as I compared them. That&#39;s an extremely unrigorous test, but it surpassed my expectations.</p><p>The audio however <em>met</em> my expectations, which is to say it was fairly... mediocre. It handled my name with aplomb, which seemed promising at first. A a relatively simple but multi-syllabic word like &#34;continental&#34; was a borderline disaster.</p><p>If I want to keep exploring this idea I think the next step might be to look for a more canonical reference set of audio samples out there that map to the IPA. Cursory searching didn&#39;t lend itself to an obvious source, but I&#39;ll be shocked if something like that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>--<p><em>Published on Thursday, June 12th 2025.
