    <h1>From web developer to database developer in 10 years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Last month I completed my first year at EnterpriseDB. I&#39;m on the team
that built and maintains
<a href="https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pglogical">pglogical</a> and who, over
the years, contributed a good chunk of the logical replication
functionality that exists in community Postgres. Most of my work, our
work, is in C and Rust with tests in Perl and Python. Our focus these
days is a descendant of pglogical called <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/">Postgres
Distributed</a> which
supports replicating DDL, tunable consistency across the cluster, etc.</p>
<p>This post is about how I got here.</p>
<h3 id="black-boxes">Black boxes</h3><p>I was a web developer from 2014-2021†. I wrote
JavaScript and HTML and CSS and whatever server-side language: Python
or Go or PHP. I was a hands-on engineering manager from 2017-2021. I
was pretty clueless about databases and indeed database knowledge was
not a serious part of any interview I did.</p>
<p>Throughout that time (2014-2021) I wanted to move my career forward as
quickly as possible so I spent much of my free time doing educational
projects and writing about them on this blog (or previous incarnations
of it). I learned how to write primitive HTTP servers, how to write
little parsers and interpreters and compilers. It was a virtuous cycle
because the internet (Hacker News anyway) liked reading these posts
and I wanted to learn how the black boxes worked.</p>
<p>But I shied away from data structures and algorithms (DSA) because
they seemed complicated and useless to the work that I did. That is,
until 2020 when an inbox page I built started loading more and more slowly as
the inbox grew. My coworker pointed me at <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/">Use The Index,
Luke</a> and the DSA scales fell from my
eyes. I wanted to understand this new black box so I <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/database-basics.html">built a little
in-memory SQL
database</a> with
support for indexes.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a college dropout so even while I was interested in compilers and
interpreters earlier in my career I never dreamed I could get a job
working on them. Only geniuses and PhDs did that work and I was
neither. The idea of working on a database felt the same. However, I
could work on little database side projects like I had done before on other
topics, <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/tags/databases.html">so I
did</a>. Or a <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/tags/raft.html">series of
explorations</a> of Raft
implementations, others&#39; and my own.</p>
<h3 id="startups">Startups</h3><p>From 2021-2023 I tried to start <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation">a
company</a> and when that
didn&#39;t pan out I joined TigerBeetle as a cofounder to work on
marketing and community. It was during this time I started the
<a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Software Internals Discord</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/">/r/databasedevelopment</a>
which have since kind of exploded in popularity among professionals
and academics in database and distributed systems.</p>
<p>TigerBeetle was my first job at a database company, and while I
contributed bits of code I was not a developer there. It was a <a href="https://letters.eatonphil.com/2023-01-01-letter-to-a-frontend-developer-asking-about-database-development.html">way
into the
space</a>. And
indeed it was an incredible learning experience both on the cofounder
side and on the database side. I wrote articles with King and Joran
that helped teach and affirm for myself the basics of databases and
consensus-based distributed systems.</p>
<h3 id="holding-out">Holding out</h3><p>When I left TigerBeetle in 2023 I was still not sure if I
could get a job as an actual database developer. My network had
exploded since 2021 (when I started my own company that didn&#39;t pan out)
so I had no trouble getting referrals at database companies.</p>
<p>But my background kept leading hiring managers to suggest putting me
on cloud teams doing orchestration in Go <em>around</em> a database rather than
working on the database itself.</p>
<p>I was unhappy with this type-casting
so I held out while unemployed and continued to write posts and <a href="https://eatonphil.com/archive.html">host
virtual hackweeks</a> messing with
Postgres and MySQL. I started the <a href="https://eatonphil.com/2024-database-design-and-implementation.html">first
incarnation</a>
of the Software Internals Book Club during this time, reading
Designing Data Intensive Applications with 5-10 other developers in
Bryant Park. During this time I also started the <a href="https://eatonphil.com/nyc-systems-coffee-club.html">NYC Systems Coffee
Club</a>.</p>
<h3 id="postgres">Postgres</h3><p>After about four months of searching I ended up with three good
offers, all to do C and Rust development on Postgres (extensions) as
an individual contributor. Working on extensions might sound like the
definition of not-sexy, but Postgres APIs are so loosely abstracted
it&#39;s really as if you&#39;re working on Postgres itself.</p>
<p>You can mess with almost anything in Postgres so you have to be
very aware of what you&#39;re doing. And when you can&#39;t mess with
something in Postgres because an API doesn&#39;t yet exist, companies have
the tendency to just fork Postgres so they can. (This tendency isn&#39;t
specific to Postgres, almost every open-source database company seems to have a
long-running internal fork or two of the database.)</p>
<h3 id="enterprisedb">EnterpriseDB</h3><p>Two of the three offers were from early-stage startups and after more
than 3 years being part of the earliest stages of startups I was happy
for a break. But the third offer was from <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/Which-Companies-Supporting-PostgreSQL-Development">one of the biggest
contributors</a>
to Postgres, a 20-year old company called EnterpriseDB. (You can probably come up with
different rankings of companies using different metrics so I&#39;m only
saying EnterpriseDB is <em>one</em> of the biggest contributors.)</p>
<p>It seemed like the best place to be to learn a lot and contribute
something meaningful.</p>
<p>My coworkers are a mix of Postgres veterans (people who
contributed the WAL to Postgres, who contributed MVCC to Postgres, who
contributed logical decoding and logical replication, who contributed
parallel queries; the list goes on and on) but also my
developer-coworkers are people who started at EnterpriseDB on
technical support, or who were previously Postgres administrators.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite a mix. Relatively few geniuses or PhDs, despite what I used
to think, but they certainly work hard and have hard-earned
experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve now been working at EnterpriseDB for over a year so I
wanted to share this retrospective. I also wanted to cover what it&#39;s
like coming from engineering management and founding companies to
going back to being an individual contributor. (Spoiler: incredibly
enjoyable.) But it has been hard enough to make myself write this much so
I&#39;m calling it a day. :)</p>
