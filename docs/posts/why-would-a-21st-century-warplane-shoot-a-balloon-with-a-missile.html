<p>I am not necessarily referring to current events, but you can if you want. Presuppose a balloon is within altitude, and range, of the guns of a warplane made in the 2000&#39;s.</p>
<p>Particularly if a military wants to salvage and deconstruct a balloon, then why not use bullets? Leaving something behind to be analyzed! An air-to-air missile is both more expensive and leaves less to be salvaged!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.king.edu/people/gail-helt/" rel="noreferrer">Gail Helt</a>, a former CIA analyst suggests that due to the huge size of the balloon (and almost zero pressure difference between inside and outside) that shooting the balloon full of bullet holes would not bring it down quickly. It would just continue to drift very slowly to lower and lower altitudes (right into commercial aviation traffic) before landing.</p>
<p>From DW News&#39; February 4, 2023 <a href="https://youtu.be/kpD9LYP-41I?t=103" rel="noreferrer">China&#39;s spy balloons: What&#39;s the geopolitical fallout?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These balloons are so huge that even that kind of - that number of ammunitions - that amount of ammunition set towards it is only going to cause a very very slow leak, and it&#39;s not going to come down immediately.</p>
<p><strong>You can&#39;t just pop the balloon and it&#39;s going to go away.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably the balloon&#39;s payload is both of great interest and deserving of some caution. It could have defenses, a self-destruct mechanism, or other undesirable materials so one might not want to simply destroy the payload with a missile, and yet one might not want it landing on the population either.</p>
<p>Thus once it&#39;s over the Atlantic an air recovery operation might occur, or now that the balloon is having its &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_minutes_of_fame" rel="noreferrer">15 minutes of fame</a>&#34; US authorities might even just let it continue and irritate/traumatize other countries for political benefit.</p>
<p><strong>update:</strong> Then again, maybe not: <a href="https://youtu.be/cRYflEfWdaI" rel="noreferrer">Video appears to show suspected Chinese spy balloon being shot down</a> reportedly an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor" rel="noreferrer">F-22</a> fired a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder" rel="noreferrer">AIM-9 Sidewinder missile</a> and apparently the blast fragmentation pattern from a proximity detonation was enough to rip the balloon wide open and allow the payload to fall into the ocean, and a recovery mission is on its way.</p>

<p>One reason that likely factors into this seemingly odd decision is that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/268893fddde785d029d5a51b136951eb" rel="noreferrer">Canada tried and failed to shoot down one of their wayward weather balloons using only guns in 1998</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A runaway weather balloon floating toward Britain over the North Atlantic is proving a tough target for some of Canada’s top guns.</p>
<p>Jet fighters trying to bring the balloon down fired more than 1,000 rounds into it Thursday, but it remained aloft. The air force hopes the now-leaking balloon will eventually come down.</p>
<p>The CF-18 fighters that caught up with the balloon over Newfoundland and failed to bring it down were equipped with air-to-air missiles, but Lavoie said the pilots refrained from using heavier firepower.</p>
<p>&#34;Citizens would not have appreciated having a missile blowing over their heads,″ he said. &#34;Also, it might be overkill _ spending a couple of hundred thousand dollars on a missile to shoot down a balloon that’s drifting away.″</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also the fact that nobody was worried about a Canadian balloon drifting over the UK (they used to be the same country). The US would clearly like to know what the Chinese were getting with this balloon. A guided missile with a touchy detonation trigger likely was a better bet.</p>

<p>Aside from the (good) answer that, because of lifting gas at the same pressure might only slowly vent through even numerous bullet holes, leading to a potentially slow uncontrolled descent through air traffic lanes, one might be a bit disappointed by a lack of creativity in the response to a drifting balloon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why not capture it with another balloon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rigid airship, like the Zeppelin/Goodyear blimps could be modified for stratospheric flight with <em>external</em> expanding balloons.  Pilots would wear SR-71/astronaut type suits.  Balloons have flown to over 120,000 feet.  This one was sailing along at half that <a href="https://newatlas.com/highest-airship-flight-record/20379/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">height</a>.</p>
<p>The dirigible could even be remotely controlled.  It would only have to latch on to the wayward balloon, release its own lifting gas, and drag it down.</p>
<p>Inspecting and returning it relatively intact to its owners with a mild admonishment of &#34;please be more careful next tine&#34; would seem far more appropriate and diplomatic instead of blasting it out of the sky with a missle.</p>
