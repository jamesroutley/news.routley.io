  <section><p>Today I spent some toy throwing together a toy music generator in Python, <a href="https://github.com/dmoerner/badbach">Bad
Bach</a>. Counterpoint is a musical style
with roots in the Renaissance which follows a strict set out of rules. I set out to deliberately write bad
counterpoint, or what I later learned is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint#Dissonant_counterpoint">dissonant
counterpoint</a>, which breaks as many of those rules as possible. I initially approached this as a puzzle solver problem, with the goal of maximizing under a set of constraints. However, I realized this music would be too deterministic for my taste. So instead I constructed a set of weights for (breaking) each rule, and then randomly generate rule-breaking harmonies based on those weights.</p>
<p>You can see a little demo here: <a href="https://moerner.com/awful-twinkle.html">Awful Twinkle</a>. This takes a variation of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star and provides an example of one of the counterpoint lines that my code generated.</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn when throwing this demo together that HTML5 seems to
have removed easy support for embedding MIDI on a webpage. A long time ago I
remember doing something like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>embed</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;file.mid&#34;</span> <span>autostart</span><span>=</span><span>true</span> <span>repeat</span><span>=</span><span>true</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This no longer works (although this abuse of autostart and repeat definitely
brings back memories)! HTML5 does have an
<code>audio</code> tag, but it does not seem to support MIDI.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s this really cool project <a href="https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player">https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player</a> which embeds a nice JS player and visualizer for MIDI files. Check it out in <a href="https://moerner.com/awful-twinkle.html">my demo</a> or on their home page!</p>
