                        <p>Charlie Javice, the 31-year-old founder of financial aid startup Frank, has been charged by federal prosecutors with financial fraud after JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. alleged in a civil suit last year that Javice had faked millions of Frank customers to convince the bank to buy her company for $175 million.</p><p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Javice with wire fraud affecting a financial institution, securities fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy on Tuesday. They said she was arrested Monday night in New Jersey. </p><p>The criminal charges have a maximum sentence of 30 years, but defendants in federal fraud cases are typically sentenced to much less than the maximum sentence. </p><p>Javice&#39;s attorney in the civil case, Alex Spiro, declined to comment.</p>
                        
                        <p>Spiro <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-claims-frank-leaders-jcharlie-javice-inflated-customer-numbers-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">previously told Insider</a> that Javice disputes the bank&#39;s claims. Javice filed her own suit against the bank asking it to advance her legal fees, and alleging JPMorgan fired her &#34;in bad faith&#34; to avoid having to pay a $20 million retention bonus.</p><p>Javice has a pattern of exaggerating her success, an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-javice-frank-fintech-startup-jp-morgan-fraud-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Insider investigation found</a>. As a teenager, the young entrepreneur rose to acclaim as the founder of a microfinance startup that raised $300,000 but never disbursed a loan. </p><p>It&#39;s also unclear how Frank could have accomplished some of what it claimed to do on behalf of students. The startup has said its users received an average of $28,000 in financial aid, roughly twice the average amount of aid awarded to college students, and that Frank could get students &#34;thousands off their tuition.&#34; A college-aid expert who spoke to Insider said those claims were dubious.  </p><p>JPMorgan <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-javice-frank-jpmorgan-settlement-department-education-2018-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">acquired Frank</a> in 2021 for $175 million, but began to question the authenticity of the startup&#39;s purported 4 million users after an email marketing campaign ended in &#34;disaster,&#34; according to the bank&#39;s lawsuit and a filing by prosecutors. Out of 400,000 emails sent to Frank users, more than 70% bounced back and only 103 were opened, the bank claimed.</p>
                        
                        <p>An internal investigation revealed that Javice and Frank chief growth officer Olivier Amar — referred to as &#34;CC-1&#34; in the federal charges — paid a New York data science professor $18,000 to create nearly 4 million fake accounts in order to juice Frank&#39;s user numbers, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-claims-frank-leaders-jcharlie-javice-inflated-customer-numbers-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">JPMorgan alleged in its lawsuit</a>. Amar later bought a list of student email addresses from a marketing firm for $105,000 in order to make those accounts seem more credible, JPMorgan alleged.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have a tip or insight to share? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Contact reporter Katherine Long via phone or the encrypted messaging app Signal (+1-206-375-9280), or at <a href="mailto:klong@insider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="7c3512c659c44b2f824fc5c8e45a3a5e" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">klong@insider.com</a>. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Contact reporter Jack Newsham via Signal (+1-314-971-1627), or at <a href="mailto:jnewsham@insider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="379202bd6304f2336c60bf702a1bd3b7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">jnewsham@insider.com</a>.</strong></em></p>
