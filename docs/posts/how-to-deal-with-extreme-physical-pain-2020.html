It&#39;s hard to say that, especially considering that everyone experiences pain be it emotional or physical. I don&#39;t want to make unneeded comparisons or consider my pain as being more important than anyone else&#39;s. I&#39;m not burned. I&#39;m not dying of cancer. I am blessed. </p> <p>But I&#39;m hurting. A lot. It&#39;s mine and it&#39;s now and it&#39;s not clear when it will stop.</p> <p>It&#39;s hard to think. It&#39;s hard to move. I can&#39;t sleep. Oxycodone makes me feel sick. Advil does nothing. </p> <p>I&#39;ve just had my second frozen shoulder surgery (adhesive capsular release) in 4 years. Frozen shoulder is idiopathic (who knows why it happen) and it&#39;s known to be quite painful. I can attest that it is. I&#39;ve been unable to move my right arm for nearly a year. Not just that <strong>I </strong>couldn&#39;t move it, I mean it couldn&#39;t be moved by anyone. I couldn&#39;t fit the deodorant in to my armpit because the whole joint was hardened.</p> <p>I had cortisone shots. No result. I finally had formal capsular release surgery where the surgeon goes in there and tidies up, removes scar tissue. </p> <p>Then the months of physical therapy and forced stretching starts. </p> <p>I&#39;m going to physical therapy five days a week for an hour a day, and working at home stretching myself for an other 1-2 hours. It&#39;s overwhelming and consuming. I just want to be able to pick up a cup from a high shelf. I have basic arm-usage requirements. This is going to be a marathon, and this is the second time this has happened.</p> <h3>Why am I telling you this? </h3> <p>A few reasons. I need the outlet. It&#39;s my blog. Because I appreciate you all and you&#39;ve been here, some of you, for nearly 20 years. Not everything is code.</p> <p>I had a nerve block in my neck that turned off my right side for a week. That was an extraordinary experience as it was an opportunity to experience a significant, albeit temporary, physical disability. Before I had no ability to move my arm but I had feeling. Now I had zero use of my right arm. It was a numb cadaver arm - dangerously dead weight. I used the time to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjE4I1XNzRs&amp;t=61s">play Xbox with my feet using the Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>.</p> <p>This nerve block is wearing off and it&#39;s gone from itching, to tingling, to the feeling of an ice pick shoved into my deltoid and armpit every few minutes. </p> <p>I burst into tears at physical therapy today. The year just hit me all at once. It hurts. Between diabetes and this temporary paralysis, it’s been a week. 2020 is ass. It’s OK. Happens a few times a decade. Maybe it happens to you twice a week. Let it out, listen to your body.</p> <h3>Why am I telling you this?</h3> <p>It&#39;s OK to tell people you hurt. You&#39;re human. Talk about your pain. Cry. Yell. Sob. Talk some more. </p> <p>When I&#39;m done yelling, I&#39;m trying to sit quietly and meditate about this pain. What is it trying to tell me? Can I mentally follow the nerve from the location (referred pain or otherwise) to my brain and determine what the body wants me to know? Am I being told there&#39;s danger? </p> <p>I&#39;m finding that there is soft tissue tolerance - what I can handle - and that doesn&#39;t always line up with what I&#39;m feeling. I&#39;m feeling near intolerable pain in PT (physical therapy). Like torture with an unknown end date, it&#39;s taken me to the level of pain where vomiting is the only escape and then it starts again. However, I persist. I breathe. I try to listen and trust the process and know that if I want to regain the full use of my arms, this is a medically known and studied process. Physical therapy works if you do it.</p> <p>The cognitive dissonance is overwhelming. Your body says you&#39;re actively dying but your conscious brain can - must - override it and let the pain flow freely. You observe it, rather than obstruct it. </p> <p>I hate this process but I&#39;m going to learn from it. I&#39;m learning and listening to my body and how I react to something so extreme.</p> <p>The pain is important to acknowledge because this pain is gonna make me better and stronger. But it still hurts. Here we go.</p> <p>I hope that you, Dear Reader, are not in pain. But if you are, I hope it passes and that you come out better on the other side. I&#39;m going to use this Bad Input for Good.</p> <p><em>BTW: Thanks to Volterra for sponsoring the blog this week.
