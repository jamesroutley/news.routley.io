    <h1>Passing the Reins on Panfrost</h1>

<header><p>10 Apr 2023</p></header><p>Today is my last day at <a href="https://www.collabora.com/">Collabora</a> and my last day leading the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/panfrost.html">Panfrost</a> driver.</p>
<p>It’s been a wild ride.</p>
<p>In 2017, I began work on the <code>chai</code> driver for Mali T (Midgard). <code>chai</code> would later be merged into <a href="https://queer.party/@Lyude">Lyude Paul</a>’s and Connor Abbott’s BiOpenly project for Mali G (Bifrost) to form Panfrost.</p>
<p>In 2019, I joined Collabora to accelerate work on the driver stack. The initial goal was to run GNOME on a Mali-T860 Chromebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2019/06/26/gnome-meets-panfrost/">Huge success</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Today, Panfrost supports a broad spectrum of Mali GPUs, conformant to the OpenGL ES 3.1 specification on Mali-G52 and Mali-G57. It’s hard to overstate how far we’ve come. I’ve had the thrills of architecting several backend shader compilers as well as the Gallium-based OpenGL driver, while my dear colleague Boris Brezillon has put together a proof-of-concept Vulkan driver which I think you’ll hear more about soon.</p>
<p>Lately, my focus has been ensuring the project can stand on its own four legs. I have every confidence in other Collaborans hacking on Panfrost, including Boris and Italo Nicola. The project has a bright future. It’s time for me to pass the reins.</p>
<p>I’m still alive. I plan to continue working on Mesa drivers for a long time, including the common infrastructure upon which Panfrost relies. And I’ll still send the odd Panfrost patch now and then. That said, my focus will shift.</p>
<p>I’m not ready to announce what’s in store yet… but maybe you can read between the lines!</p>
