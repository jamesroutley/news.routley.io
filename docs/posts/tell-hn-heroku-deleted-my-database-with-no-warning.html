    <h1>Tell HN: Heroku deleted my database with no warning</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Last December, Heroku nuked the database on one of my active projects.  I was travelling at the end of the year and did not catch wind of this until I returned and saw messages about an issue with the app.  Sure enough, I checked and noticed that the database was gone and detached on December 9th.</p><p>Before the hate comes out, yes I know Heroku deprecated free tiers.  However, I did not understand this would affect my projects on paid dynos.  The real issue here is that I never received a single email or notice of any kind to my email about this.  From researching, it appears most people received SEVERAL notices about this.  I did not think there was an issue with my setup because I received zero communication.</p><p>Upon reaching out, Heroku has told me that they cannot recover the database.  They also admitted that there was &#34;an issue&#34; sending out notifications to me, and confirmed that none were sent.</p><p>So I guess just a warning to all - your database might be nuked at any time.  I learned my lesson about not doing an offsite backup regularly.  I guess the bigger lesson though is that Heroku should really be a last resort option for projects these days. RIP.</p></div></div></div>
