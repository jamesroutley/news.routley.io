<p>Sam Bankman-Fried received about $2.2 billion in payments and loans from FTX entities, mainly from Alameda Research, FTX and its affiliated debtors said yesterday. Bankman-Fried&#39;s fellow executives received another $951 million combined, including $839 million to three executives who already pleaded guilty to fraud, FTX and its debtors said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-file-schedules-and-statements-of-financial-affairs-with-bankruptcy-court-301773613.html">press release</a> describing a series of filings made in US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.</p>
<p>As summarized by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/562161ec-c771-46da-9d09-a99620a8e142">Financial Times</a>, &#34;Bankman-Fried and five members of his inner circle transferred $3.2 billion in total to their personal accounts in the form of &#39;payments and loans,&#39; the funds primarily coming from Alameda Research, a crypto trading hedge fund affiliated with FTX.&#34; John Ray, the new CEO leading FTX through bankruptcy proceedings, &#34;has been seeking to identify the location of cryptocurrency and other assets that can be eventually returned to the millions of FTX customers whose accounts have been frozen since its collapse,&#34; the Financial Times noted.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried, who faces criminal fraud and conspiracy charges, is accused of improperly diverting billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to Alameda.</p>
<p>The other payment and loan totals described by FTX yesterday were $587 million to Nishad Singh, $246 million to Zixiao &#34;Gary&#34; Wang, $87 million to Ryan Salame, $25 million to John Samuel Trabucco, and $6 million to Caroline Ellison. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftxs-singh-agrees-plead-guilty-us-criminal-charges-lawyer-says-2023-02-28/">Singh</a>, Wang, and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/united-states-attorney-announces-extradition-ftx-founder-samuel-bankman-fried-united">Ellison</a> have pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges and are cooperating with government prosecutors.</p>
<h2>SBF faces 12 charges for fraud and conspiracy</h2>
<p>In November, an FTX lawyer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/founder-ran-ftx-as-personal-fiefdom-many-assets-stolen-or-missing-court-hears/">said at a Bankruptcy Court hearing</a> that Bankman-Fried ran the failed cryptocurrency exchange as his &#34;personal fiefdom&#34; and that &#34;a substantial amount of assets have either been stolen or are missing.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Bankman-Fried was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-bahamas-charged-with-massive-crypto-fraud-in-us/">arrested in December</a> and faces 12 criminal charges. They include charges for defrauding FTX customers, investors, and lenders, as well as conspiracy to commit those frauds. The 12 charges also include conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p>The criminal case is in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty and is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/sbf-tries-to-revise-bail-conditions-after-judge-noted-suspicious-vpn-use/">out on bail</a>. In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.80.0.pdf">indictment</a>, US prosecutors said &#34;Bankman-Fried stole FTX customer deposits, and used billions of dollars in stolen funds for a variety of purposes, including, among other things, to support the operations and investments of FTX and Alameda; to fund speculative venture investments; to make charitable contributions; to enrich himself; and to try to purchase influence over cryptocurrency regulation in Washington, DC by steering tens of millions of dollars of illegal campaign contributions to both Democrats and Republicans.&#34;</p>
<h2>FTX doesn’t know how much money it can recover</h2>
<p>FTX&#39;s press release yesterday said the $3.2 billion transferred to Bankman-Fried and fellow executives &#34;exclude over $240 million spent to purchase luxury property in the Bahamas, political and charitable donations made directly by the FTX Debtors, and substantial transfers to non-Debtor subsidiaries in the Bahamas and other jurisdictions.&#34;</p>
<p>FTX said it hasn&#39;t yet determined how much money it will be able to return to customers. &#34;Although some of the property purchased with the proceeds of these transfers is already in the control of the FTX Debtors or governmental authorities with whom the FTX Debtors are cooperating, the amount and timing of eventual monetary recoveries cannot be predicted at this time. The FTX Debtors are investigating causes of action against the recipients of these transfers and their subsequent transferees,&#34; FTX said.</p>
<p>Future court filings are expected to identify more &#34;assets, liabilities and transfers, including a description of intercompany claims among the FTX Debtors and their subsidiaries,&#34; FTX said.</p>
