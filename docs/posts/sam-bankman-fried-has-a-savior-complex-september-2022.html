<p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Update: November 9, 2022 </b><em>A liquidity crunch has created solvency risk for FTX and its future is uncertain. Many have been affected by this unexpected turn of events. For Sequoia, our fiduciary responsibility is to our LPs. To that end, we shared <a href="https://twitter.com/sequoia/status/1590522718650499073"><strong>this </strong><strong>letter</strong></a> with them today regarding our investment in FTX. For FTX, we believe its fiduciary responsibility is first to its customers, and second to its shareholders. As such, FTX is exploring all opportunities to ensure its customers are able to recover their funds as quickly as possible.</em></p>
