          <section><p>I signed up to the Stacking the Bricks newsletter. They tell you how to build a business in <i>a way you too can do</i>.</p>
<p>They have <i>one central idea</i>: Visit forums of professionals known to pay for things, see what they want, and make that. I think this idea is <i>valid</i>.</p>
<p><b>They also bold every third paragraph and write in short sentences.</b></p>
<p><span></span>
This style makes me feel like I’m reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://smidgeo.com/"><b><span>SMIDGEO</span></b></a></li>
<li><a href="https://timmyfailure.com/total-failure-inc/">Timmy Failure</a></li>
<li>Matt Furey, a 2010s (and maybe current?) fitness grifter <i>who wrote exactly like this</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Much like <b>Cal Newport</b>, Stacking the Bricks have taken one good idea and <i>stretched</i> it. Have you ever read a Cal Newport book? It is like someone took a tweet and asked <b>ChatGPT</b> to expand it to <i>50,000 words</i>.</p>
<p><b>Anyway, what they’re going is not the worst, considering, but the scam vibe does their single good idea a disservice.</b></p>
<p>Want to know what I think is a <i>good way of imparting information</i>?</p>
<p><b>☛ <u>Download this pdf to find out!</u> ☚</b></p>
<p>(I’m <b>kidding</b>, but reading those emails right after watching a <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/resources/lecture-2-elimination-with-matrices/">traditional lecture on linear algebra</a> is quite a <i>contrast</i>.)</p>
