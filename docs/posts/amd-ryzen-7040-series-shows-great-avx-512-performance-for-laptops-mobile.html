    <h1>AMD Ryzen 7040 Series Shows Great AVX-512 Performance for Laptops / Mobile</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Similar to what I have shown with the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-avx512">Ryzen 9 7950X AVX-512 desktop performance</a> and <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-epyc-avx512">AMD EPYC 9004 series AVX-512 server performance</a>, the new Ryzen 7040 series mobile processors are exhibiting great AVX-512 performance for laptops. In today&#39;s article is a look at the performance impact when toggling AVX-512 capabilities for a <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen7-7840u">Ryzen 7 7840U</a> &#34;Phoenix&#34; SoC compared to toggling AVX-512 with prior Intel Tiger Lake and Ice Lake laptops that offer AVX-512.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen7040-avx512&amp;image=amd_7840u_avx512_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen7040-avx512&amp;image=amd_7840u_avx512_1_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 7 7840U laptop running AVX-512 software"/></a></p>
<p>Intel&#39;s Ice Lake mobile processors were the first to exhibit AVX-512 support on the client side (well, besides the very limited Cannon Lake) and then further refined with the Tiger Lake mobile processors. Intel&#39;s AVX-512 implementation has come a long way from its earliest days in Skylake-X workstation/server processors where its usage was plagued by excessive heat/power and in turn lower CPU clock speeds when AVX-512 was engaged. However, AVX-512 is now only found on the workstation/server side -- thus why in this AVX-512 laptop comparison article, Tigerlake is the most recent to be used on the Intel side (for those wanting recent Alder Lake vs. AMD Ryzen 7040 series, that is covered separately <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-avx512">in this earlier article</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen7040-avx512&amp;image=amd_7840u_avx512_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen7040-avx512&amp;image=amd_7840u_avx512_2_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 7 7840U on Linux with AVX-512 present"/></a></p>
<p>With the AVX-512 implementation on the AMD side with Zen 4, it spans the entire product portfolio from EPYC 9004 series server processors down to the recently-shipping Ryzen 7040 series mobile processors. This article has AVX-512 on/off on the Ryzen 7 7840U compared to the Core i7 1065G7 Ice Lake and Core i7 1165G7 Tiger Lake CPUs. Under Linux the AVX-512 support can be hidden from user-space querying /proc/cpuinfo and the like via clearcpuid=304 as a universal way of hiding the support from software not explicitly checking the CPU ID bits. For all the workloads tested they were successfully compiled and used with and without AVX-512 on all three test platforms.</p>
<p>With the laptops I had available the Ryzen 7 7840U was tested within an Acer Swift Edge 16, the Core i7 1165G7 Tiger Lake within a Dell XPS 13 9310 (Dell 0GG9PT) and the Core i7 1065G7 within a Dell XPS 7390 (Dell 06CDVY). Ubuntu 23.04 with the Linux 6.2 kernel was used across all of the AVX-512 testing on the different devices.</p>

<p>During the benchmarking process the CPU peak frequency, CPU power consumption, and CPU temperatures were monitored for further insight into this AVX-512 comparison.</p>
