    <h1>iNaturalist strikes out on its own</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		
<p>This summer, iNaturalist, the global social network for recording and collectively identifying the biodiversity around us, went independent. With the help of a $10 million startup grant, the organization that started as a UC Berkeley master’s project separated from the California Academy of Sciences and National Geographic Society and became its own 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.</p>



<p>“This is a necessary step in order for us to really reach our potential,” says Scott Loarie, co-director of iNaturalist. “We’re so grateful for them to give a home for the last nine years and help us through this process of finding our feet as an independent organization.”</p>



<p>iNaturalist is both a social network and “the world’s most powerful biodiversity data set,” according to Alison Young, iNaturalist board member and co-director of California Academy of Sciences’s Center for Biodiversity and Community Science. It’s an online platform—as Bay Nature has written—where a <a href="https://baynature.org/2021/06/03/new-colony-of-a-rare-stingless-bee-once-presumed-absent-from-california-found-by-a-four-year-old-in-palo-alto/">backyard bee</a> spotted by a four-year-old was identified by a bee expert living thousands of miles away; a place where <a href="https://baynature.org/2022/09/23/two-young-researchers-two-new-scorpions/">two teenagers</a> identified two new scorpion species. Its users have pitched headfirst into the world of <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/blog/83909-identifier-profile-gallformers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plant galls</a>, and tracked the impacts of the harmful algal blooms that took over San Francisco Bay in <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/aggregating-sf-bay-harmful-algal-bloom-2022" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/sf-bay-harmful-algae-bloom-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2023</a>. And it is a place where people can find new friends, as Young has, among those who are interested in the same parts of the outside world. </p>

<p>Data from iNaturalist have been used in more than 4,000 research publications, and users have identified new species through browsing its observations. “We have a better understanding of current biodiversity than we have ever had because of iNaturalist—hands down,” says Young. In total, more than 2.8 million observers have uploaded more than 150 million verifiable observations to iNaturalist, and in July, an average of 124 observations were uploaded per minute. </p>



<p>Every month, around 350,000 people record observations. But Loarie recalls a time when he considered 50 regular iNaturalist users a triumph. Like any critter on its site, iNaturalist has gone through a number of life stages. </p>



<p>In 2008, iNaturalist was born through its cofounder Ken-Ichi Ueda and fellow master’s students Nate Agrin and Jessica Kline’s joint final project. After Loarie joined in 2011, it grew into a limited liability company, and three years later, iNaturalist’s staff and office moved to the California Academy of Sciences as the two organizations joined forces. In 2017, the National Geographic Society came in as a partner, and iNaturalist became a joint initiative of these two nonprofits, funded by a combination of grants and small individual donations.</p>
