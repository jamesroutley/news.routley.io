    <h1>A server that wasn&#39;t meant to exist</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Yesterday I read a piece of news that brought back an important - and painful - episode from my career.</p><p>About 16 years ago, I was contacted by an old friend. He was worried about a situation involving some mutual acquaintances.</p><p>The main issue was the complete lack of information flow: no digital systems of any kind were in place.</p><p>&#34;If we keep going like this, we’ll be bankrupt in just a few years&#34;, I was told.</p><p>I planned - and got immediate approval for - the purchase of routers, switches, various networking devices and a server with several disks.</p><p>As usual in those days, I added a caching proxy (Squid) and a content filter (DansGuardian), to ensure proper usage.</p><p>As often happens, not everyone was happy. </p><p>One figure in particular - the late owner&#39;s former right-hand man - opposed the new system in every possible way.</p><p>Once everything was up and running, we trained the employees to use the new system.</p><p>Since all of this was far from where I lived at the time, I went back to my life once the system was stable and everything in place.</p><p>&#34;Good morning, this is XYZ - I handle some technical aspects of a software suite used by the company where you&#39;ve just installed everything.</p><p>I explained that it wasn’t a Windows machine, as he assumed (without even having seen it), but NetBSD, running NetBSD and Linux VMs.</p><p>A few seconds of silence.</p><p>&#34;I see. Then I’ll have to wipe it and install Windows. I need Windows, and I don’t have time to wait for a new server - I’ll proceed tomorrow morning&#34;.</p><p>I froze. I told him that was not possible - the entire workflow now depended on that machine, and erasing it would be catastrophic.</p><p>&#34;I’ll speak with the owners&#34;, I said, &#34;and I’m sure they’ll provide you with a separate server within hours&#34;.</p><p>No use. He started to backpedal.</p><p>I immediately called the owners. Sadly, due to inexperience and inability to handle the situation, they panicked.</p><p>I called that man back and told him clearly: the server I’d built wasn’t to be shut down.</p><p>At that point, he finally spoke more openly:</p><p>&#34;You don’t get it, do you? I need <em>that</em> server. Not <em>a</em> server.</p><p>And other similar, &#34;nice&#34; sentences. I replied calmly:</p><p>No way through. He kept pushing - confident in his own sense of &#34;power&#34; - until I said what I had been trying to avoid.</p><p>Because I had recognized who he was.</p><p>&#34;Excuse me, but why are you talking to me like this? You’ve known me since I was a child. Don’t you remember? I’m the nephew of...&#34;</p><p>He froze.</p><p>That person had helped him greatly over the years. So much so that he folded:</p><p>&#34;Oh... I’m so sorry... I didn’t recognize you. I’ll find another solution. Sorry again&#34;.</p><p>He hung up.</p><p>I informed the owners that the issue was resolved (leaving out most of the details), but it didn’t last long.</p><p>It was dead.</p><p>But there was one thing nobody (but the owners) knew.</p><p>I handed all the data to the owners and asked what they intended to do.</p><p>I never heard more about it.</p><p>But then came a tempting offer:</p><p>&#34;Come work for us. Manage our network infrastructure and help us overhaul our internal procedures.</p><p>They would’ve done it, too.</p><p>I didn’t think twice. </p><p><strong>I turned it down</strong>.</p><p>I like my work.</p><p>Because sometimes, dishonest people <em>do</em> win.</p><p>I’ve never regretted declining that offer.</p><p>They made another request later on, which I tried to fulfill — but even that was blocked, just when everything was ready.</p><p>At some point, I had to walk away.</p><p>And of course, I’ve left out the worst parts of the story.</p><p><em>(Author&#39;s note: Many readers, understandably struck by the severity of the events, have speculated about the involvement of organized crime. I want to clarify that, while the situation was extremely problematic and dishonest, that wasn&#39;t the case. The &#34;worst parts&#34; I alluded to referred to other internal dynamics, abuses of trust, and improprieties that I prefer not to detail further for privacy reasons and to avoid weighing down the narrative.)</em></p><p>That’s when I realized:</p><p>And that’s okay.</p><p><a href="https://it-notes.dragas.net/2024/10/03/i-solve-problems-eurobsdcon/">I solve problems</a> - it’s what I do best.</p><p>But I can’t solve <strong>every</strong> problem.</p></div></div></div>
