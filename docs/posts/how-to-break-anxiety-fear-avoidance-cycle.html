    <h1>Ask HN: How to break anxiety/fear-avoidance cycle?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>For years anxiety/fear-avoidance cycle defined my life. I tend to procrastinate to a such extent that causes problems in my day to day functioning, and generally my life.<p>For example, i have to submit 2 fairly simple assignments, in 2 and 3 days respectively. If i don&#39;t pass the next 4 assignments i will fail the lab, but i keep avoiding sitting down with all of my power. I feel pure fear and a sense of &#34;i will certainly fail if i try&#34;.</p><p>The above example is with these assignments, but this type of behavior extends to everything in my life.</p></td></div></div>
