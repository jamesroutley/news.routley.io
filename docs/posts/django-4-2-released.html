<p><span>Posted by <strong>Mariusz Felisiak</strong> on April 3, 2023 </span></p><p>The Django team is happy to announce the release of Django 4.2.</p>
<p>This version has been designated as a long-term support (LTS) release, which
means that security and data loss fixes will be applied for at least the next
three years. It will also receive fixes for crashing bugs, major functionality
bugs in newly-introduced features, and regressions from older versions of
Django for the next eight months until December 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/">The release notes</a>
cover the farrago of new features in detail, but a few highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/#psycopg-3-support">psycopg version 3 support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/#comments-on-columns-and-tables">Comments on columns and tables</a></li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/#requests-and-responses">asynchronous streaming responses</a>, and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/#models">async interfaces for related managers and Model</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get Django 4.2 from <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">our downloads page</a> or from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/4.2">the
Python Package Index</a>. The PGP key ID used for this release is Mariusz Felisiak: <a href="https://github.com/felixxm.gpg">2EF56372BA48CD1B</a>.</p>
<p>With the release of Django 4.2, Django 4.1 has reached the end of mainstream
support. The final minor bug fix release, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/4.1.7/">4.1.7</a>, was issued on February 14, 2023.
Django 4.1 will receive security and data loss fixes until December 2023. All
users are encouraged to upgrade before then to continue receiving fixes for
security issues.</p>
<p>Django 4.0 has reached the end of extended support. All Django 4.0 users are encouraged to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/upgrade-version/">upgrade</a> to Django 4.1
or later.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions">downloads page</a> for a table of
supported versions and the future release schedule.</p>
