            The US Securities and Exchange Commission fined six major credit rating organizations a total of $49 million for their “significant failures” to keep electronic communications.

            Moody’s Investor Services and S&amp;P Global Ratings agreed to pay the heftiest fines, a $20 million civil penalty each. Fitch Ratings agreed to pay $8 million, A.M. Best Rating Services agreed to pay $1 million, HR Ratings de México, S.A. de C.V. $250,000, and Demotech agreed to pay $100,000, respectively.

            The firms admitted to the facts in the SEC orders, which said they violated recordkeeping provisions of federal securities laws, the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-114" target="_blank">said</a>.

            For example, Moody’s Ratings Employees – including at the senior level – were communicating about credit ratings activities via text messages and WhatsApp on their personal devices, according to an SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2024/34-100906.pdf" target="_blank">order</a>. That included an associate managing director making off-channel comments about credit rating clients.

            “We have seen repeatedly that failures to maintain and preserve required records can hinder the staff’s ability to ensure that firms are complying with their obligations and the Commission’s ability to hold accountable those that fall short of those obligations, often at the expense of investors,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, in a statement Tuesday.

            With the exception of A.M. Best and Demotech, the firms must also hire a compliance consultant. The SEC said A.M. Best and Demotech “engaged in significant efforts” to comply with the requirements and cooperated with the investigation.
