    <h1>Air Canada is responsible for chatbot&#39;s mistake: B.C. tribunal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     
    <p>
	Air Canada has been ordered to compensate a B.C. man because its chatbot gave him inaccurate information.</p>
<p>
	The Civil Resolution Tribunal&#39;s decision on the dispute was <a href="https://decisions.civilresolutionbc.ca/crt/crtd/en/item/525448/index.do" target="_blank">posted online Wednesday</a>, finding in favour of a man who relied on information provided by the bot about fares when he was booking a flight to attend his grandmother&#39;s funeral.</p>
<p>
	&#34;I find Air Canada did not take reasonable care to ensure its chatbot was accurate,&#34; tribunal member Christopher C. Rivers wrote, awarding $650.88 in damages for negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p>
	&#34;Negligent misrepresentation can arise when a seller does not exercise reasonable care to ensure its representations are accurate and not misleading,&#34; the decision explains.</p>
<p>
	Jake Moffatt was booking a flight to Toronto and asked the bot about the airline&#39;s bereavement rates – reduced fares provided in the event someone needs to travel due to the death of an immediate family member.</p>
<p>
	Moffatt said he was told that these fares could be claimed retroactively by completing a refund application within 90 days of the date the ticket was issued, and submitted a screenshot of his conversation with the bot as evidence supporting this claim.</p>
<p>
	He submitted his request, accompanied by his grandmother&#39;s death certificate, in November of 2022 – less than a week after he purchased his ticket. But his application was denied and the tribunal decision said emails submitted as evidence showed that Moffatt&#39;s attempts to receive a partial refund continued for another two-and-a-half months.</p>
<p>
	The airline refused the refund because it said its policy was that bereavement fare could not, in fact, be claimed retroactively.</p>
<p>
	In February of 2023, Moffatt sent the airline a screenshot of his conversation with the chatbot and received a response in which Air Canada &#34;admitted the chatbot had provided &#39;misleading words.&#39;&#34;</p>
<p>
	But Moffatt was still unable to get a partial refund, prompting him to file the claim with the tribunal.</p>
<p>
	Air Canada, for its part, argued that it could not be held liable for information provided by the bot.</p>
<p>
	&#34;In effect, Air Canada suggests the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions. This is a remarkable submission. While a chatbot has an interactive component, it is still just a part of Air Canada’s website,&#34; Rivers wrote.</p>
<p>
	&#34;It should be obvious to Air Canada that it is responsible for all the information on its website. It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot.&#34;</p>
<p>
	The airline also argued that the chatbot&#39;s response to Moffatt&#39;s inquiry included a link to a section of its website that outlined the company&#39;s policy and said that requests for a discounted fare are not allowed after someone has travelled.</p>
<p>
	Rivers rejected this argument as well.</p>
<p>
	&#34;While Air Canada argues Mr. Moffatt could find the correct information on another part of its website, it does not explain why the webpage titled &#39;Bereavement travel&#39; was inherently more trustworthy than its chatbot. It also does not explain why customers should have to double-check information found in one part of its website on another part of its website,&#34; he wrote.</p>
<p>
	&#34;Mr. Moffatt says, and I accept, that they relied upon the chatbot to provide accurate information. I find that was reasonable in the circumstances. There is no reason why Mr. Moffatt should know that one section of Air Canada’s webpage is accurate, and another is not.&#34;</p>
<p>
	The compensation the tribunal awarded was the equivalent of the difference between what Moffatt paid for his flight and a discounted bereavement fare.</p>
<p>
	In addition, the airline was ordered to pay $36.14 in pre-judgment interest and $125 in fees.</p>
