            <h3>Want to publish interactive musical scores on the Internet? Want to collaborate with other musicians who use different music applications?</h3>
<p><strong>MusicXML offers the solution.</strong></p>
<p>MusicXML was designed from the ground up for sharing sheet music files between applications, and for archiving sheet music files for use in the future. You can count on MusicXML files being readable and usable by a wide range of music notation applications, now and in the future. MusicXML complements the native file formats used by Finale and other programs, which are designed for rapid, interactive use.</p>
<p>Just as MP3 files have become synonymous with sharing recorded music, MusicXML files have become the standard for sharing interactive sheet music. With MusicXML you can create music in one program and share your results – back and forth – with people using other programs. Today more than <a href="https://www.musicxml.com/software/">260 applications</a> include MusicXML support.</p>
<p>Save your music as a MusicXML file, and watch your audience grow.</p>
