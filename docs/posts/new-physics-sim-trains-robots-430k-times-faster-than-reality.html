    <h1>New physics SIM trains robots 430k times faster than reality</h1>

<p>The AI-generated worlds will reportedly include realistic physics, camera movements, and object behaviors, all from text commands. The system then creates physically accurate ray-traced videos and data that robots can use for training. Of course, we have not tested this, so these claims should be taken with a grain of salt at the moment.</p>

<p>This prompt-based system may let researchers create complex robot testing environments by typing natural language commands instead of programming them by hand. &#34;Traditionally, simulators require a huge amount of manual effort from artists: 3D assets, textures, scene layouts, etc. But every component in the workflow can be automated,&#34; wrote Fan.</p>
<p>Using its engine, Genesis could also generate character motion, interactive 3D scenes, facial animation, and more, which may allow for the creation of artistic assets for creative projects, but may also lead to more realistic AI-generated games and videos in the future, constructing a simulated world in data instead of operating on the statistical appearance of pixels as with a video synthesis diffusion model.</p>

<p>While the generative system isn&#39;t yet part of the currently available <a href="https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io/">code on GitHub</a>, the team plans to release it in the future.</p>
<h2>Training tomorrowâ€™s robots today (using Python)</h2>
<p>Genesis remains under active development <a href="https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis">on GitHub</a>, where the team accepts community contributions.</p>
<p>The platform stands out from other 3D world simulators for robotic training by using Python for both its user interface and core physics engine. Other engines use C++ or CUDA for their underlying calculations while wrapping them in Python APIs. Genesis takes a Python-first approach.</p>
<p>Notably, the non-proprietary nature of the Genesis platform makes high-speed robot training simulations available to any researcher for free through simple Python commands that work on regular computers with off-the-shelf hardware.</p>
<p>Previously, running robot simulations required complex programming and specialized hardware, says Fan in his post announcing Genesis, and that shouldn&#39;t be the case. &#34;Robotics should be a moonshot initiative owned by all of humanity,&#34; he wrote.</p>
