             By &#34;augmenting human intellect&#34; we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by &#34;complex situations&#34; we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations.  We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human &#34;feel for a situation&#34; usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.

            Man&#39;s population and gross product are increasing at a considerable rate, but the 
<span>complexity</span> of his problems grows still faster, and the 
<span>urgency</span> with which solutions must be found becomes steadily greater in response to the increased rate of activity and the increasingly global nature of that activity. Augmenting man&#39;s intellect, in the sense defined above, would warrant full pursuit by an enlightened society if there could be shown a reasonable approach and some plausible benefits.

            This report covers the first phase of a program aimed at developing means to augment the human intellect. These &#34;means&#34; can include many things—all of which appear to be but extensions of means developed and used in the past to help man apply his native sensory, mental, and motor capabilities—and we consider the whole system of a human and his augmentation means as a proper field of search for practical possibilities. It is a very important system to our society, and like most systems its performance can best be improved by considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the components in isolation.

            This kind of system approach to human intellectual effectiveness does not find a ready-made conceptual framework such as exists for established disciplines. Before a research program can be designed to pursue such an approach intelligently, so that practical benefits might be derived within a reasonable time while also producing results of longrange significance, a conceptual framework must be searched out—a framework that provides orientation as to the important factors of the system, the relationships among these factors, the types of change among the system factors that offer likely improvements in performance, and 
            the sort of research goals and methodology 
            that seem promising.<sup>*<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Note-1">1</a>*</sup>

            In the first (search) phase of our program we have developed a conceptual framework that seems satisfactory for the current needs of designing a research phase. <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#II">Section II</a> contains the essence of this framework as derived from several different ways of looking at the system made up of a human and his intellect-augmentation means.

            The process of developing this conceptual framework brought out a number of significant realizations: that the intellectual effectiveness exercised today by a given human has little likelihood of being intelligence limited—that there are dozens of disciplines in engineering, mathematics, and the social, life, and physical sciences that can contribute improvements to the system of intellect-augmentation means; that any one such improvement can be expected to trigger a chain of coordinating improvements; that until every one of these disciplines comes to a standstill <i>and</i> we have exhausted all the improvement possibilities we could glean from it, we can expect to continue to develop improvements in this human-intellect system; that there is no particular reason not to expect gains in personal intellectual effectiveness from a concerted system-oriented approach that compare to those made in personal geographic mobility since horseback and sailboat days.

            The picture of how one can view the possibilities for a systematic approach to increasing human intellectual effectiveness, as put forth in <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#II">Section II</a> in the sober and general terms of an initial basic analysis, does not seem to convey all of the richness and promise that was stimulated by the development of that picture. Consequently, <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#III">Section III</a> is intended to present some definite images that illustrate meaningful possibilities deriveable from the conceptual framework presented in <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#II">Section II</a>—and in a rather marked deviation from ordinary technical writing, a good portion of <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#III">Section III</a> presents these images in a fiction-dialogue style as a mechanism for transmitting a feeling for the richness and promise of the possibilities in one region of the improvement space&#34; that is roughly mapped in <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#II">Section II</a>.

            In <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#IV">Section IV</a> (Research Recommendations) we present a general strategy for pursuing research toward increasing human intellectual effectiveness.  This strategy evolved directly from the concepts presented in Sections <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#II">II</a> and <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#III">III</a>; one of its important precepts is to pursue the quickest gains first, and use the increased intellectual effectiveness thus derived to help pursue successive gains. We see the quickest gains emerging from (1) giving the human the minute-by-minute services of a digital computer equipped with computer-driven cathode-ray-tube display, and (2) developing the new methods of thinking and working that allow the human to capitalize upon the computer&#39;s help. By this same strategy, we recommend that an initial research effort develop a prototype system of this sort aimed at increasing human effectiveness in the task of computer programming.

            To give the reader an initial orientation about what sort of thing this computer-aided working system might be, we include below a short description of a possible system of this sort. This illustrative example is not to be considered a description of the actual system that will emerge from the program. It is given only to show the general direction of the work, and is clothed in fiction only to make it easier to visualize.

            <p><a name=""></a>
            Let us consider an augmented architect at work. He sits at a working station that has a visual display screen some three feet on a side; this is his working surface, and is controlled by a computer (his &#34;clerk&#34;) with which he can communicate by means of a small keyboard and various other devices.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#1a11">1a11</a></span></p>
          </div>
          <div id="014" hs:createdby="" hs:createdon="" hs:label="" hs:left-label-delim="" hs:nid="014" hs:right-label-delim="">
            <p><a name=""></a>
            He is designing a building. He has already dreamed up several basic layouts and structural forms, and is trying them out on the screen. The surveying data for the layout he is working on now have already been entered, and he has just coaxed the clerk to show him a perspective view of the steep hillside building site with the roadway above, symbolic representations of the various trees that are to remain on the lot, and the service tie points for the different utilities. The view occupies the left two-thirds of the screen. With a &#34;pointer,&#34; he indicates two points of interest, moves his left hand rapidly over the keyboard, and the distance and elevation between the points indicated appear on the right-hand third of the screen.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#1a12">1a12</a></span></p>
          </div>
          <div id="015" hs:createdby="" hs:createdon="" hs:label="" hs:left-label-delim="" hs:nid="015" hs:right-label-delim="">
            <p><a name=""></a>
            Now he enters a reference line with his pointer, and the keyboard. Gradually the screen begins to show the work he is doing—a neat excavation appears in the hillside) revises itself slightly, and revises itself again. After a moment, the architect changes the scene on the screen to an overhead plan view of the site, still showing the excavation. A few minutes of study, and he enters on the keyboard a list of items, checking each one as it appears on the screen, to be studied later.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#1a13">1a13</a></span></p>
          </div>
          <div id="016" hs:createdby="" hs:createdon="" hs:label="" hs:left-label-delim="" hs:nid="016" hs:right-label-delim="">
            <p><a name=""></a>
            Ignoring the representation on the display, the architect next begins to enter a series of specifications and data—a six-inch slab floor, twelve-inch concrete walls eight feet high within the excavation, and so on. When he has finished, the revised scene appears on the screen. A structure is taking shape. He examines it, adjusts it, pauses long enough to ask for handbook or catalog information from the clerk at various points, and readjusts accordingly. He often recalls from the &#34;clerk&#34; his working lists of specifications and considerations to refer to them, modify them, or add to them. These lists grow into an evermore-detailed, interlinked structure, which represents the maturing thought behind the actual design.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#1a14">1a14</a></span></p>

            <p><a name=""></a>
            Prescribing different planes here and there, curved surfaces occasionally, and moving the whole structure about five feet, he finally has the rough external form of the building balanced nicely with the setting and he is assured that this form is basically compatible with the materials to be used as well as with the function of the building.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#1a15">1a15</a></span></p>

            <p><a name=""></a>
            Now he begins to enter detailed information about the interior. Here the capability of the clerk to show him any view he wants to examine (a slice of the interior, or how the structure would look from the roadway above) is important. He enters particular fixture designs, and examines them in a particular room. He checks to make sure that sun glare from the windows will not blind a driver on the roadway, and the &#34;clerk&#34; computes the information that one window will reflect strongly onto the roadway between 6 and 6:30 on midsummer mornings.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#1a16">1a16</a></span></p>

            <p><a name=""></a>
            Next he begins a functional analysis. He has a list of the people who will occupy this building, and the daily sequences of their activities.  The &#34;clerk&#34; allows him to follow each in turn, examining how doors swing, where special lighting might be needed. Finally he has the &#34;clerk&#34; combine all of these sequences of activity to indicate spots where traffic is heavy in the building, or where congestion might occur, and to determine what the severest drain on the utilities is likely to be.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#1a17">1a17</a></span></p>

            <p><a name=""></a>
            All of this information (the building design and its associated &#34;thought structure&#34;) can be stored on a tape to represent the design manual for the building. Loading this tape into his own clerk, another architect, a builder, or the client can maneuver within this design manual to pursue whatever details or insights are of interest to him—and can append special notes that are integrated into the design manual for his own or someone else&#39;s later benefit.

            In such a future working relationship between human problem-solver and computer &#39;clerk,&#39; the capability of the computer for executing mathematical processes would be used whenever it was needed. However, the computer has many other capabilities for manipulating and displaying information that can be of significant benefit to the human in nonmathematical processes of planning, organizing, studying, etc. Every person who does his thinking with symbolized concepts (whether in the form of the English language, pictographs, formal logic, or mathematics) should be able to benefit significantly.

            The objective of this study is to develop a conceptual framework within which could grow a coordinated research and development program whose goals would be the following: (1) to find the factors that limit the effectiveness of the individual&#39;s basic information-handling capabilities in meeting the various needs of society for problem solving in its most general sense; and (2) to develop new techniques, procedures, and systems that will better match these basic capabilities to the needs&#39; problems, and progress of society. We have placed the following specifications on this framework:

            Two points need emphasis here. First, although a conceptual framework has been constructed, it is still rudimentary. Further search, and actual research, are needed for the evolution of the framework. Second, even if our conceptual framework did provide an accurate and complete basic analysis of the system from which stems a human&#39;s intellectual effectiveness, the explicit nature of future improved systems would be highly affected by (expected) changes in our technology or in our understanding of the human being.

            The conceptual framework we seek must orient us toward the real possibilities and problems associated with using modern technology to give direct aid to an individual in comprehending complex situations, isolating the significant factors, and solving problems. To gain this orientation, we examine how individuals achieve their present level of effectiveness, and expect that this examination will reveal possibilities for improvement.

            The entire effect of an individual on the world stems essentially from what he can transmit to the world through his limited motor channels. This in turn is based on information received from the outside world through limited sensory channels; on information, drives, and needs generated within him; and on his processing of that information. His processing is of two kinds: that which he is generally conscious of (recognizing patterns, remembering, visualizing, abstracting, deducing, inducing, etc.), and that involving the unconscious processing and mediating of received and self-generated information, and the unconscious mediating of conscious processing itself.

            The individual does not use this information and this processing to grapple directly with the sort of complex situation in which we seek to give him help. He uses his innate capabilities in a rather more indirect fashion, since the situation is generally too complex to yield directly to his motor actions, and always too complex to yield comprehensions and solutions from direct sensory inspection and use of basic cognitive capabilities. For instance, an aborigine who possesses all of our <span>basic</span> sensory-mental-motor capabilities, but does not possess our background of indirect knowledge and procedure, cannot organize the proper direct actions necessary to drive a car through traffic, request a book from the library, call a committee meeting to discuss a tentative plan, call someone on the telephone, or compose a letter on the typewriter.

            Our culture has evolved means for us to organize the little things we can do with our basic capabilities so that we can derive comprehension from truly complex situations, and accomplish the processes of deriving and implementing problem solutions. The ways in which human capabilities are thus extended are here called <span>augmentation means</span>, and we define four basic classes of them:

            The system we want to improve can thus be visualized as a trained human being together with his artifacts, language, and methodology. The explicit new system we contemplate will involve as artifacts computers, and computer-controlled information-storage, information-handling, and information-display devices.  The aspects of the conceptual framework that are discussed here are primarily those relating to the human being&#39;s ability to make significant use of such equipment in an integrated system.

            Pervading all of the augmentation means is a particular structure or organization. While an untrained aborigine cannot drive a car through traffic, because he cannot leap the gap between his cultural background and the kind of world that contains cars and traffic, it is possible to move step by step through an organized training program that will enable him to drive effectively and safely. In other words, the human mind neither learns nor acts by large leaps, but by steps organized or structured so that each one depends upon previous steps.

            Although the size of the step a human being can take in comprehension, innovation, or execution is small in comparison to the over-all size of the step needed to solve a complex problem, human beings nevertheless do solve complex problems. It is the augmentation means that serve to break down a large problem in such a way that the human being can walk through it with his little steps, and it is the structure or organization of these little steps or actions that we discuss as <span>process hierarchies</span>.

            Every process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes. Let us consider such examples as making a pencil stroke, writing a letter of the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete muscle movements are organized into the making of a pencil stroke; similarly, making particular pencil strokes and making a plan for a letter are complex processes in themselves that become sub-processes to the over-all writing of an alphabetic character.

            Although every sub-process is a process in its own right, in that it consists of further sub-processes, there seems to be no point here in looking for the ultimate bottom of the process-hierarchical structure. There seems to be no way of telling whether or not the apparent bottoms (processes that cannot be further subdivided) exist in the physical world or in the limitations of human understanding.

            In any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in discussing particular process hierarchies. No person uses a process that is completely unique every time he tackles something new. Instead, he begins from a group of basic sensory-mental-motor process capabilities, and adds to these certain of the process capabilities of his artifacts. There are only a finite number of such basic human and artifact capabilities from which to draw. Furthermore, even quite different higher order processes may have in common relatively high-order sub-processes.&#34;

            When a man writes prose text (a reasonably high-order process), he makes use of many processes as sub-processes that are common to other high-order processes. For example, he makes use of planning, composing, dictating.  The process of writing is utilized as a sub-process within many different processes of a still higher order, such as organizing a committee, changing a policy, and so on.

            What happens, then, is that each individual develops a certain repertoire of process capabilities from which he selects and adapts those that will compose the processes that he executes. This repertoire is like a tool kit, and just as the mechanic must know what his tools can do and how to use them, so the intellectual worker must know the capabilities of his tools and have good methods, strategies, and rules of thumb for making use of them. All of the process capabilities in the individual&#39;s repertoire rest ultimately upon basic capabilities within him or his artifacts, and the entire repertoire represents an inter-knit, hierarchical structure (which we often call the 
<span>repertoire hierarchy</span>).

            We find three general categories of process capabilities within a typical individual&#39;s repertoire. There are those that are executed completely within the human integument, which we call  
<span>explicit-human</span> process capabilities; there are those possessed by artifacts for executing processes without human intervention, which we call  
<span>explicit-artifact</span> process capabilities; and there are what we call the  
<span>composite</span> process capabilities, which are derived from hierarchies containing both of the other kinds.

            We assume that it is our <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#HLAMT-Defined-Detail">H-LAM/T system</a> (Human using Language, Artifacts, Methodology, in which he is Trained) that has the capability and that performs the process in any instance of use of this repertoire. Let us look within the process structure for the LAM/T ingredients, to get a better &#34;feel&#34; for our models. Consider the process of writing an important memo. There is a particular concept associated with this process—that of putting information into a formal package and distributing it to a set of people for a certain kind of consideration—and the type of information package associated with this concept has been given the special name of  
<span>memorandum</span>.  Already the system language shows the effect of this process—i.e., a concept and its name.

            <p><a name=""></a>
            The memo-writing process may be executed by using a set of process capabilities (in intermixed or repetitive form) such as the following planning, developing subject matter, composing text, producing hard copy, and distributing.  There is a definite way in which these sub-processes will be organized that represents part of the system methodology. Each of these sub-processes represents a functional concept that must be a part of the system language if it is to be organized effectively into the human&#39;s way of doing things, and the symbolic portrayal of each concept must be such that the human can work with it and remember it.
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2a15">2a15</a></span></p>

            <p><a name=""></a>
            If the memo is simple, a paragraph or so in length, then the first three processes may well be of the explicit-human type (i.e., it may be planned, developed) and composed within the mind) and the last two of the composite type. If it is a complex memo, involving a good deal of careful planning and development, then all of the sub-processes might well be of the composite type (e.g., at least including the use of pencil and paper artifacts)&#39; and there might be many different applications of some of the process capabilities within the total process (i.e., successive drafts, revised plans).
            <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2a16">2a16</a></span></p>

            The set of sub-process capabilities discussed so far, if called upon in proper occasion and sequence, would indeed enable the execution of the memo-writing process. However, the very process of organizing and supervising the utilization of these sub-process capabilities is itself a most important sub-process of the memo-writing process. Hence, the sub-process capabilities as listed would not be complete without the addition of a seventh capability—what we call the  
<span>executive</span> capability. This is the capability stemming from habit, strategy, rules of thumb, prejudice, learned method, intuition, unconscious dictates, or combinations thereof, to call upon the appropriate sub-process capabilities with a particular sequence and timing. An executive process (i.e., the exercise of an executive capability) involves such sub-processes as planning, selecting, and supervising, and it is really the executive processes that embody all of the methodology in the H-LAM/T system.

            To illustrate the capability-hierarchy features of our conceptual framework, let us consider an artifact innovation appearing directly within the relatively low-order capability for composing and modifying written text, and see how this can affect a (or, for instance, your) hierarchy of capabilities.  Suppose you had a new writing machine—think of it as a high-speed electric typewriter with some special features. You could operate its keyboard to cause it to write text much as you could use a conventional typewriter.  But the printing mechanism is more complicated; besides printing a visible character at every stroke, it adds special encoding features by means of invisible selective components in the ink and special shaping of the character.

            As an auxiliary device, there is a gadget that is held like a pencil and, instead of a point, has a special sensing mechanism that you can pass over a line of the special printing from your writing machine (or one like it). The signals which this reading stylus sends through the flexible connecting wire to the writing machine are used to determine which characters are being sensed and thus to cause the automatic typing of a duplicate string of characters. An information-storage mechanism in the writing machine permits you to sweep the reading stylus over the characters much faster than the writer can type; the writer will catch up with you when you stop to think about what word or string of words should be duplicated next, or while you reposition the straightedge guide along which you run the stylus.

            This writing machine would permit you to use a new process of composing text. For instance, trial drafts could rapidly be composed from re-arranged excerpts of old drafts, together with new words or passages which you stop to type in. Your first draft could represent a free outpouring of thoughts in any order, with the inspection of foregoing thoughts continuously stimulating new considerations and ideas to be entered. If the tangle of thoughts represented by the draft became too complex, you would compile a reordered draft quickly. It would be practical for you to accommodate more complexity in the trails of thought you might build in search of the path that suits your needs.

            <p><a name=""></a>
            You can integrate your new ideas more easily, and thus harness your creativity more continuously, if you can quickly and flexibly change your working record. If it is easier to update any part of your working record to accommodate new developments in thought or circumstance, you will find it easier to incorporate more complex procedures in your way of doing things.  This will probably allow you to accommodate the extra burden associated with, for instance, keeping and using special files whose contents are both contributed to and utilized by any current work in a flexible manner—which in turn enables you to devise and use even-more complex procedures to better harness your talents in your particular working situation.

            The important thing to appreciate here is that a direct new innovation in one particular capability can have far-reaching effects throughout the rest of your capability hierarchy. A change can propagate  
<span>up</span> through the capability hierarchy; higher-order capabilities that can utilize the initially changed capability can now reorganize to take special advantage of this change and of the intermediate higher-capability changes. A change can propagate  
<span>down</span> through the hierarchy as a result of new capabilities at the high level and modification possibilities latent in lower levels.  These latent capabilities may previously have been unusable in the hierarchy and become usable because of the new capability at the higher level.

            The writing machine and its flexible copying capability would occupy you for a long time if you tried to exhaust the reverberating chain of associated possibilities for making useful innovations within your capability hierarchy. This one innovation could trigger a rather extensive redesign of this hierarchy; your way of accomplishing many of your tasks would change considerably. Indeed this process characterizes the sort of evolution that our intellect-augmentation means have been undergoing since the first human brain appeared.

<span>entire</span> capability hierarchy (calling for a system approach). It is also important to realize that we must be oriented to the  
<span>synthesis</span> of new capabilities from reorganization of other capabilities, both old and new, that exist throughout the hierarchy (calling for a &#34;system-engineering&#34; approach).

            Individuals who operate effectively in our culture have already been considerably &#34;augmented.&#34; Basic human capabilities for sensing stimuli, performing numerous mental operations, and for communicating with the outside world, are put to work in our society within a system—an H-LAM/T system—the individual augmented by the language, artifacts, and methodology in which he is trained. Furthermore, we suspect that improving the effectiveness of the individual as he operates in our society should be approached as a system-engineering problem—that is, the H-LAM/T system should be studied as an interacting whole from a synthesis-oriented approach.

            This view of the system as an interacting whole is strongly bolstered by considering the repertoire hierarchy of process capabilities that is structured from the basic ingredients within the H-LAM/T system. The realization that any potential change in language, artifact, or methodology has importance only relative to its use within a process&#39; and that a new process capability appearing anywhere within that hierarchy can make practical a new consideration of latent change possibilities in many other parts of the hierarchy—possibilities in either language, artifacts, or methodology—brings out the strong interrelationship of these three augmentation means.

            Increasing the effectiveness of the individual&#39;s use of his basic capabilities is a problem in redesigning the changeable parts of a system. The system is actively engaged in the continuous processes (among others) of developing comprehension within the individual and of solving problems; both processes are subject to human motivation, purpose, and will. To redesign the system&#39;s capability for performing these processes means redesigning all or part of the repertoire hierarchy. To redesign a structure, we must learn as much as we can of what is known about the basic materials and components as they are utilized within the structure; beyond that, we must learn how to view, to measure, to analyze, and to evaluate in terms of the functional whole and its purpose. In this particular case, no existing analytic theory is by itself adequate for the purpose of analyzing and evaluating over-all system performance; pursuit of an improved system thus demands the use of  
<span>experimental</span> methods.

Essentially any of the processes utilized by a representative human today—the processes that he thinks of when he looks ahead to his day&#39;s work—are composite processes of the sort that involve external composing and manipulating of symbols (text, sketches, diagrams, lists, etc.). Many of the external composing and manipulating (modifying, rearranging) processes serve such characteristically &#34;human&#34; activities as playing with forms and relationships to ask what develops, cut-and-try multiple-pass development of an idea, or listing items to reflect on and then rearranging and extending them as thoughts develop.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2b4">2b4</a></span></p>

They could manipulate these concepts within their minds to a certain extent, and think about situations in the abstract. Their mental capabilities allowed them to develop general concepts from specific instances, predict specific instances from general concepts, associate concepts, remember them, etc.  We speak here of concepts in their raw, unverbalized form. For example, a person letting a door swing shut behind him suddenly visualizes the person who follows him carrying a cup of hot coffee and some sticky pastries.  Of all the aspects of the pending event, the spilling of the coffee and the squashing of the pastry somehow are abstracted immediately, and associated with a concept of personal responsibility and a dislike for these consequences.  But a solution comes to mind immediately as an image of a quick stop and an arm stab back toward the door, with motion and timing that could prevent the collision, and the solution is accepted and enacted. With only non-symbolic concept manipulation, we could probably build primitive shelter, evolve strategies of war and hunt, play games, and make practical jokes. But further powers of intellectual effectiveness are implicit in this stage of biological evolution (the same stage we are in today).<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c4b1">2c4b1</a></span></p>

              It is undoubtedly true that concepts which people found useful ended up being symbolized in their   language, and hence that the evolution of language was   affected by the concepts the people developed and   used. However,

              (among others) have   argued that the language we use affects our thinking to a   considerable extent. They say that a lack of words for some   types of concepts makes it hard to express those concepts, and   thus decreases the likelihood that we will learn much about   them. If this is so, then once a language has begun to grow   and be used, it would seem reasonable to suspect that the   language also affects the evolution of the new concepts to be   expressed in that language.

The first class (those in use) can be     found in a methodical manner by analyzing present capability hierarchies. For example, select a given capability, at any     level in the hierarchy, and ask yourself if it can be usefully changed by any means that can be given     consideration in the augmentation research contemplated. If it can, then it is not basic but it can be decomposed into     an eventual set of basic capabilities.

Perhaps &#34;purposeful&#34; structuring (or       organization) would serve us as well, but since we aren&#39;t       sure yet how the structuring concept must mature for our       needs, we shall tentatively stick with the special       modifier, &#34;synergetic.&#34; We are developing a growing       awareness of the significant and pervasive nature of such       structure within every physical and conceptual thing we       inspect, where the hierarchical form seems almost       universally present as stemming from successive levels of       such organization.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5c1a">2c5c1a</a></span></p>

There are dynamic       electro-optical-mechanical processes associated with the       function of our artifacts (as well as metabolic, sensory,       motor) and cognitive processes of the human, which we find       to be relatively fundamental components within the       structure of our H-LAM/T system—and each of these seems       truly to be ultimately based (to our degree of       understanding) upon the above mentioned basic physical       processes. The elements that are organized to give fixed       structural form to our physical objects—e.g., the       &#34;element&#34; of tensile strength of a material-are also       derived from what we could call synergetic structuring of       the most basic physical processes.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5c1b">2c5c1b</a></span></p>

Tentatively we have isolated five such types—although we are not sure how many we shall ultimately want to use in considering the problem of augmenting the human intellect, nor how we might divide and subdivide these different manifestations of physical-process structuring.

<span>Mental structuring</span> is what we call the internal organization of conscious and       unconscious mental images, associations, or concepts (or       whatever it is that is organized within the human mind)       that somehow manages to provide the human with understanding and the basis for such as judgment,       intuition, inference, and meaningful action with respect       to his environment.  There is a term used in psychology,       cognitive structure, which so far seems to represent just       what we want for our concept of mental structure, but we will not adopt it until we become more sure of what the       accepted psychological meaning is and of what we want for       our conceptual framework.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5c2a">2c5c2a</a></span></p>

We feel reasonably safe in assuming that       learning involves some kind of meaningful organization       within the brain, and that whatever is so organized or       structured represents the operating model of the       individual&#39;s universe to the mental mechanisms that derive       his behavior. And further, our assumption is that when the       human in our H/LAM system makes the key decision or action       that leads to the solution of a complex problem, it will       stem from the state of his mental structure at that       time. In this view then, the basic purpose of the system&#39;s       activity on that problem up to that point has been to       develop his mental structure to the state from which the       mental mechanisms could derive the key action.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5c2b">2c5c2b</a></span></p>

Our working assumption also considers that some concept structures would be better for this purpose than others, in that they would be more easily mapped by the       individual into workable mental structures, or in that the resulting mental structures enable a higher degree of       comprehension and better solutions to problems, or       both.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5c3b">2c5c3b</a></span></p>

                  Essentially everything that goes on within the H-LAM/T system and that is of direct interest here involves the manipulation of concept and symbol structures in service to the mental structure. Therefore, the processes within the H-LAM/T system that we are most interested in developing are those that provide for the manipulation of all three types of structure.  This brings us to the fourth category of structuring,  
<span>process</span> structuring.

                  <p><a name=""></a>A very important feature to be       noted from the discussion in this section bears upon the       interdependence among the various types of structuring       which are involved in the H-LAM/T system, where the       capability for doing each type of structuring is dependent       upon the capability for doing one or more of the other       types of structuring. (Assuming that the physical       structuring of the system remains basically unchanged       during the system&#39;s operation, we exclude its dependence       upon other factors in this discussion.)<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5c7a">2c5c7a</a></span></p>

                  <p><a name=""></a>This interdependence actually       has a cyclic, regenerative nature to it which is very       significant to us. We have seen how the capability for       mental structuring is finally dependent, down the chain,       upon the process structuring (human, artifact, composite)       that enables symbol-structure manipulation.  But it also       is evident that the process structuring is dependent not       only upon basic human and artifact process capabilities,       but upon the ability of the human to learn how to execute       processes—and no less important, upon the ability of the       human to select, organize, and modify processes from his       repertoire to structure a higher-order process that he can       execute.  Thus, a capability for structuring and executing       processes is partially dependent upon the human&#39;s mental       structuring, which in turn is partially dependent upon his       process structuring (through concept and symbol       structuring), which is partially dependent upon his mental       structuring, etc.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5c7b">2c5c7b</a></span></p>

Today this individual cannot     be depended upon to have any special training for many of     these roles; he is likely to have learned them by cut and     try and by indirect imitation.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5e4">2c5e4</a></span></p>

                <p><a name=""></a>A complex process is often     executed by the H-LAM/T system in a multi-pass fashion     (i.e., cut and try). In really complex situations,     comprehension and problem solutions do not stand waiting at     the end of a straightforward path; instead, possibilities     open up and plans shift as comprehension grows.  In the     model using a network of contractors, this type of procedure     would entail a great deal of extra work within the     superstructure—each contractor involved in the process     would have the specifications upon which he bid continually     changed, and would continually have to respond to the     changes by restudying the situation, changing his plans,     changing the specifications to his subcontractors, and     changing his records. This is a terrific additional burden,     but it allows a freedom of action that has tremendous     importance to the effectiveness the system exhibits to the     outside world.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5e5">2c5e5</a></span></p>

An important     aspect of the multi-role activity of the human in the system     is the development and manipulation of the symbol structures     associated with <i>both</i> his direct-contributive roles     and his executive roles.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5f1">2c5f1</a></span></p>

But executive     roles in a complex problem situation also require conceptual     activity—e.g., comprehension, selection, supervision—that     can benefit from well-designed symbol structures and fast,     flexible means for manipulating and displaying them. For     complex processes, the executive problem posed to the human     (of gaining the necessary comprehension and making a good     plan) may be tougher than the problem he faced in the role     of direct-contributive worker. If the flexibility desired     for the process hierarchies (to make room for human     cut-and-try methods) is not to be degraded or abandoned, the     executive activity will have to be provided with fast and     flexible symbol-structuring techniques.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5f2">2c5f2</a></span></p>

Also,     the kind of generous flexibility that would be truly helpful     calls for added symbol structuring just to keep track of the trials, branches, and reasoning thereto that are involved in     the development of the subject structure; our present     symbol-manipulation means would very soon bog down     completely among the complexities that are involved in being     more than just a little bit flexible.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5f3">2c5f3</a></span></p>

This     view increases our respect for the essential importance of     the basic capability of composing and modifying efficient     symbol structures.

The augmentation means employed today     have generally evolved among large statistical populations,     and no attempt has been made to fit them to individual needs     and abilities. Each individual tends to evolve his own     variations, but there is not enough mutation and selection     activity, nor enough selection feedback, to permit very     significant changes. A good, automated H-LAM/T system should     provide the opportunity for a significant adaptation of the     augmentation means to individual characteristics. The     compounding effect of fundamental human cognitive powers     suggests further that systems designed for maximum     effectiveness would require that these powers be developed     as fully as possible—by training, special mental tricks,     improved language, new methodology.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#2c5g2">2c5g2</a></span></p>

In the     future systems, for instance, it should be possible to have     computer processes provide direct and significant help in     his processes at many levels. We thus expect the effect of     the computer in the system to be very much compounded. A     great deal of richness in the future possibilities for     automated H-LAM/T systems is implied here—considerably more     than many people realize who would picture the computer as     just helping them do the things they do now.

                Another factor can exert this type     of compound effect upon over-all system performance: the human&#39;s unconscious processes. Clinical psychology seems to     provide clear evidence that a large proportion of a human&#39;s everyday activity is significantly mediated or basically     prompted by unconscious mental processes that, although &#34;natural&#34; in a functional sense, are not rational. The     observable mechanisms of these processes (observable by     another, trained person) includes masking of the     irrationality of the human&#39;s actions which are so affected,     so that few of us will admit that our actions might be     irrational, and most of us can construct satisfying     rationales for any action that may be challenged.

It would   seem that he also wished to induce a general recognition of a   growing problem—storage, retrieval, and manipulation of   information for and by intellectual workers—and to show the   possibilities he foresaw for scientific development of   equipment which could significantly aid such workers in facing   this problem. He summarized the situation: &#34;...There is a   growing mountain of research...The investigator is staggered   by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers.   Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the   results of research are generations old...truly significant   attainments become lost in the mass of the   inconsequential...The summation of human experience is being   expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for   threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily   important item is the same as was used in the days of   square-rigged ships.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a5a">3a5a</a></span></p>

Extension of existing photographic   techniques to give each individual a continuously available   miniature camera for recording anything in view and of   interest, and to realize a high-quality 100:1 linear reduction   ratio for micro-record files for these photographs and   published material; voice-recognition equipment (perhaps   requiring a special language) to ease the process of entering   new self-generated material into the written record—these are   to provide the individual with information-generating aid.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a5c">3a5c</a></span></p>

He suggests that new notation for our verbal   symbols (perhaps binary) could allow character recognition   devices to help even further in the information-manipulation   area, and also points out that poor symbolism (&#34;...the   exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their   relationships. They employ a symbolism which grew like Topsy   and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most   logical field.&#34;) stands in the way of full realization of   machine help for the manipulations associated with the human&#39;s   real time process of mathematical work.

Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so     that he seldom consults his code book; but when he does, a     single tap of a key projects it for his use.  Moreover, he     has supplemental levers. On deflecting one of these levers     to the right he runs through the book before him, each page     in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a     recognizing glance at each. If he deflects it further to the     right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still     further at 100 pages at a time.

When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of     available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he     branches off on a side trail which takes him through     textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants.

              <p><a name=""></a>There are many significant items in   the article, but the main ones upon which we shall comment   here will be those relative to the use and implications of his   Memex. The associative trails whose establishment and use   within the files he describes at some length provide a   beautiful example of a new capability in symbol structuring   that derives from new artifact-process capability, and that   provides new ways to develop and portray concept structures.   Any file is a symbol structure whose purpose is to represent a   variety of concepts and concept structures in a way that makes   them maximally available and useful to the needs of the   human&#39;s mental-structure development—within the limits   imposed by the capability of the artifacts and human for   jointly executing processes of symbol-structure   manipulation. The Memex allows a human user to do more   conveniently (less energy, more quickly) what he could have   done with relatively ordinary photographic equipment and   filing systems, but he would have had to spend so much time in   the lower-level processes of manipulation that his mental time   constants of memory and patience would have rendered the   system unusable in the detailed and intimate sense which Bush   illustrates.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a6a">3a6a</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>The Memex adds a factor of speed and   convenience to ordinary filing-system (symbol-structuring)   processes that would encourage new methods of work by the   user, and it also adds speed and convenience for processes not   generally used before. Making it easy to establish and follow   the associative trails makes practical a new   symbol-structuring process whose use can make a significant   difference in the concept structuring and bssic methods of   work. It is also probable that clever usage of   associative-trail manipulation can augment the human&#39;s process   structuring and executing capabilities so that he could   successfully make use of even more powerful symbol-structure   manipulation processes utilizing the Memex capabilities. An   example of this general sort of thing was given by Bush where   he points out that the file index can be called to view at the   push of a button, which implicitly provides greater capability   to work within more sophisticated and complex indexing   systems<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a6b">3a6b</a></span></p>

Not only do my own thoughts produce     results in this fashion, but when I digest the writings of     another person, I find generally anyway that I have     extracted from his structure and integrated into my own a     specific selection of facts, considerations, ideas,     etc. Often these different extracted items fit into     different places in my structure, or become encased in     special substructures as I modify or expand his     concepts.

                First, let me relate what has been     described to the special terms brought out in previous     sections. The writing contained on each notecard is a     small-sized symbol structure, representing or portraying to     me a small structure of concepts. The notches on the edges     of the cards are symbols that serve to tie these card-sized     symbol sub structures into a large symbol structure (the     notedeck). One aspect of the structure is the physical     grouping of the cards at a given time—which happens to be     the only aspect of the over-all structuring that my human     capabilities can make direct use of—and in this respect I     can execute processes which produce restructuring (that is,     physical re grouping) that helps me considerably to perceive     and assimilate the concepts of worth to me. This     restructuring is effected by composite processes involving     me, a master code card, a sorting needle, and a work     surface. I can add to the symbol structure by executing     other composite processes which involve me, writing     instruments (pen, pencil, or typewriter), a master code     card, and a card notcher.

                If my mental processes were more     powerful, I could dispense with the cards, and hold all of     the card-sized concept structures in my memory, where also     would be held the categorization linkages that evolved as I     worked (with my feet up on the artifacts and my eyes     closed). As it is, and as it probably always will be no     matter how we develop or train our mental capabilities, I     want to work in problem areas where the number and     interrelationship complexity of the individual factors     involved are too much for me to hold and manipulate within     my mind. So, my mind develops conscious sets of concepts, or     recognizes and selects them from what it perceives in the     work of others, and it directs the organization of an     external symbol structure in which can be held and portrayed     to the mind those concepts I cannot (reliably) remember or     whose manipulations I cannot visualize. The price I pay for     this augmentation shows up in the time and energy involved     in manipulating artifacts to manipulate symbols to give me     this artificial memory and visualization of concepts and     their manipulation.

                <p><a name=""></a>But let us go further with     discussing specific examples of means for augmenting our     intellects. In using the edge-notched-card system described,     I found several types of structuring which that system could     not provide, but which would both be very useful and     probably obtainable with reasonably practical artifact     means. One need arose quite commonly as trains of thought     would develop on a growing series of note cards. There was     no convenient way to link these cards together so that the     train of thought could later be recalled by extracting the     ordered series of notecards. An associative-trail scheme     similar to that out lined by Bush for his Memex could     conceivably be implemented with these cards to meet this     need and add a valuable new symbol-structuring process to     the system. Straightforward engineering development could     provide a mechanism that would be able to select a specific     card from a relatively large deck by a parallel edge-notch     sort on a unique serial number notched into each card, and     the search mechanism could be set up automatically by a hole     sensing mechanism from internal punches on another card that     was placed in the sensing slot. An auxiliary notching     mechanism could automatically give succeeding serial-number     encoding to new notecards as they are made up.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a7d1">3a7d1</a></span></p>

                <p><a name=""></a>Suppose that one wants to link     Card B to Card A, to make a trail from A to B. He puts Card     B into a slot so that the edge-notched coding of the card&#39;s     serial number can automatically be sensed, and slips Card A     under a hole-punching head which duplicates the     serial-number code of Card B in the coding of the holes     punched in a specific zone on Card A. Later, when he may     have discovered Card A, and wishes to follow this particular     associative trail to the next card, he aligns that zone on     Card A under a hole-sensing head which reads the serial     number for Card B therein and automatically sets up the     sorting mechanism. A very quick and simple human process     thus initiates the automatic extraction of the next item on     the associative trail. It&#39;s not unreasonable to assume that     establishing a link would take about three seconds, and     tracing a link to the next card about three to five     seconds.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a7d2">3a7d2</a></span></p>

I first developed a set of cards upon each     of which I described a separate consideration, possibility,     or specification about the memo—in the disorderly sequence     in which they occurred to me as my thoughts about the basic     features of the memo evolved. Right off the bat I noticed     that there were two distinct groups—some ideas were about     what the memo ought to accomplish, what time period it     should cover, when it should be finished, what level and     style of presentation should be used, etc., and some ideas     were about the subject of the memo. As more thoughts     developed, I found that the latter group also divided into     ideas representing possible content and those representing     possible organization.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a7e1">3a7e1</a></span></p>

I started with the Specification group (it being the     &#34;highest&#34; in nature), and immediately found that there were     several types of notes within that group Just as there had     been in the total group. Becoming immediately suspicious, I     sorted through each of the other two main groups and found     similar situations in each. In each group there was finally     to emerge a definite set of statements (product statements)     that represented that group&#39;s purpose—e.g., the     specifications currently accepted for the design of the     memo—and some of the cards contained candidate material for     this.  But there were also considerations about what these     final statements might include or exclude or take into     account, or conditions under which inclusion or modification     might be relevant, or statements that were too bulky or     brief or imprecise to be used as final statements.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a7e2">3a7e2</a></span></p>

I realized that I was being     rather philosophically introspective with all of this     analysis, but I was curious as to the potential value of     future augmentation means in allowing me to deal explicitly     with these types of structuring. So I went ahead, keeping     the groups and sub-groups of cards separated, and trying to     organize and develop them.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a7e3">3a7e3</a></span></p>

This type of device should not be too hard to develop     and produce for a price that a professional man could     justify paying, and it would certainly facilitate some     valuable symbol-structuring pro<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a7e4">3a7e4</a></span></p>

A little familiarity with computer technology,   enough to help considerably in understanding the augmentation   possibilities discussed in this report, can be gained by the   uninitiated.  For those already familiar with the technology,   the following discussion can perhaps help them gain more   understanding of our concepts of process and symbol   structuring.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8a">3a8a</a></span></p>

There may be from ten to over a hundred   different primitive processes which a particular machine can   execute, and all of the computer&#39;s more sophisticated   processes are structured from these primitive processes.  It   takes a repertoire of surprisingly few such primitive   processes to enable the construction of any   symbol-manipulation process that can be explicitly described   in any language.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8b">3a8b</a></span></p>

Actually, in every commercial digital   computer, there are only two primitive symbols. Usually these   are dealt with in standard-sized packets (called &#34;words&#34;) of   from eighteen to forty-eight primitive symbols, but arbitrary   use can be made of individual primitives or of subgroups of   the word.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8c">3a8c</a></span></p>

The computer   successively examines the symbol substructure representing   each primitive process in the program and executes that   process—which usually alters the total internal symbol   structure of the machine in some way. Lt makes no difference   to the computer whether the symbols involved in the   re-structuring represent part of the computer program or part   of the information upon which the program is operating. The   ability to have the computer modify its own process structure   (program) has been a very important factor in the development   of its power.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8d">3a8d</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>Thus, some very sophisticated   techniques for process and symbol structuring have evolved in   the computer field, as evidenced by the very sophisticated   processes (e.g., predicting election returns, calculating   orbits, translating natural languages) that can be structured   to manipulate very complex structures of symbols. Among the   more interesting computer-process structures that have evolved   are those that can automatically develop a structure of   primitive computer processes to accomplish symbol manipulation   tasks that are specified on a relatively high level of   abstraction. Special languages have been evolved in several   fields (e.g., ALGOL and FORTRAN for scientific calculations,   COBOL for business processing) that enable explicit   prescription of complex manipulation processes in a rapid and   concise manner by a human, thinking about the processes in a   rather natural manner, so that special computer programs or   process structures (called Translators, Compilers, or   sometimes in a slightly different sense, Interpreters) can   construct the necessary structures of primitive processes and   symbols that would enable the computer to execute the   prescribed processes. This development has extended immensely   our capability for making use of computers—otherwise the   specification of a complex process would often occupy a   formidable number of man hours, and be subject to a great many   errors which would be very costly to find and correct.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8e">3a8e</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>Computers have been used to simulate   dynamic systems for which we humans had none but descriptive   models, from which we otherwise could gain little feel for the   way the system behaves. A very notable instance of this, for   our consideration, has been in the area of the human thought   processes.  Newell, Shaw, and Simon initiated this approach)   from which there has derived a number of features of interest   to us. For one, they discovered that the symbol structures and   the process structures required for such simulation became   exceedingly complex, and the burden of organizing these was a   terrific impediment to their simulation research. They devised   a structuring technique for their symbols that is basically   simple but from which stem results that are very   elegant. Their basic symbol structure is what they call a   &#39;list,&#34; a string of substructures that are linked serially in   exactly the manner proposed by Bush for the associative trails   in his Memex—i.e., each substructure contains the necessary   information for locating the next substructure on the   list. Here, though, each substructure could also be a list of   substructures, and each of these could also, etc. Their   standard manner for organizing the data which the computer was   to operate upon is thus what they term &#34;list structuring.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8f">3a8f</a></span></p>

              They also developed special languages   to describe different basic processes involved in   list-structure manipulation. The most widely used of their   languages, IPL-V (the fifth version of their Information   Processing Languages), is described in a recent book

               In these languages, both   the data to be worked upon and the symbols which designate the   processes to be executed upon that data are developed in   list-structure form.

              The application of these techniques   has been mainly of two types—one of modelling complex   processes and systems (e.g., the human thought processes),   where the emphasis is upon the model and its behavior, and the   other of trying to get computer behavior that is intelligent   whether or not the processes and behavior resemble those of a   human. The languages and techniques used in both types of   application promise to be of considerable value to the   development of radical new augmentation systems for human   problem solvers, and we shall deal later with them in more   detail.

              <p><a name=""></a>Computers have various means for   storing symbols so that they are accessible to it for   manipulation. Assuming that the human might want to have a   repertoire of sixty-four basic symbols (letters, numbers,   special symbols), we can discuss various forms of storage in   terms of their capacity for storing these kinds of symbols   (each of which would be structured, in the computer and   storage devices, as a group of six primitive computer   symbols). Fast access to an arbitrary choice of a few   neighboring symbols (of the human&#39;s repertoire) can be had to   perhaps 100,000 such symbols within the period in which the   computer can execute one of its primitive processes (from two   to ten millionths of a second, depending upon the computer   involved).  This is the so-called high-speed, random-access   working store, where space for the human&#39;s symbols might cost   between sixty cents and $1.50 per symbol.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8i">3a8i</a></span></p>

A   continuously rotating magnetic drum can hold perhaps a million   of these symbols, for which access to a random storage   position may average a thirtieth of a second (waiting for the   drum to come around to bring that storage position under the   magnetic reading head). This is short in the human&#39;s time   scale, but a reasonably fast computer could execute about   3,000 of its primitive processes during that time. Generally,   information transfer between a drum and fast-access working   storage takes place in blocks of data which are stored in   successive positions around the drum. Such block-transfer is   accomplished by a relatively small structure of primitive   computer processes that cyclically executes the transfer of   one word at a time until the designated block has been transferred. Drum storage costs about 5 cents per each of the basic   symbols used by the human in our example.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8j">3a8j</a></span></p>

A   transport unit, connected to the computer, might cost $30,000,   with tape reels at $50 each holding about five million of the   human&#39;s basic symbols. For one reel, storage space for each   such symbol cost about two-thirds of a cent, but for twenty   full reels in a &#34;library&#34; the cost comes down to about   one-thirtieth of a cent per symbol space.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8l">3a8l</a></span></p>

Occasionally, of course, much   larger periods of computer time will be needed by an   individual, and then the other users might get their periodic   milliseconds of service slipped in during these longer   processes.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a8v">3a8v</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>When we began our search, we found a   great deal of literature which put forth thought and work of   general significance to our objective—frankly, too   much. Without having a conceptual framework, we could not   efficiently filter out the significant kernels of fact and   concept from the huge mass which we initially collected as a   &#34;natural first step&#34; in our search. We feel rather unscholarly   not to buttress our conceptual framework with plentiful   reference to supporting work, but in truth it was too   difficult to do. Developing the conceptual structure   represented a sweeping synthesis job full of personal   constructs from smatterings picked up in many places.  Under   these conditions, giving reference to a backup source would   usually entail qualifying footnotes reflecting an unusual   interpretation or exonerating the other author from the   implications we derived from his work. We look forward to a   stronger, more comprehensive, and more scholarly presentation   evolving out of future work.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3a9a">3a9a</a></span></p>

              However, we do want to acknowledge thoughts and work we have come across that bear most directly upon the possibilities of using a computer in real-time   working association with a human to improve his working   effectiveness.  These fall into two categories. The first category, which would include this report, presents speculations and possibilities but does not include reporting of significant experimental results. Of these, 
               Bush<sup>[<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-6">6</a>]</sup>  
is the earliest and one of the most directly stimulating. 
               Licklider<sup>[<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-15">15</a>]</sup>  
provided the most general clear case for the modern computer, and coined the expression, &#34;man-computer symbiosis&#34; to refer to the close interaction   relationship between the man and computer in mutually beneficial cooperation. 
               Ulam<sup>[<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-16">16</a>]</sup>   
has specifically recommended close man-computer interaction in a chapter entitled, &#34;synergesis,&#34; where he points out in considerable detail the types of mathematical work which could be aided. 
               Good<sup>[<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
includes some conjecture about possibilities of intellectual aid to the human by close cooperation with a computer in a rather general way, and also presents a few interesting thoughts about a   network model for structuring the conceptual kernels of   information to facilitate a sort of self-organizing retrieval   system. Ramo has given a number of talks dealing with the   future possibilities of computers for &#34;extending man&#39;s   intellect,&#34; and 
               wrote several articles.<sup>[<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-18">18</a>, <a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-19">19</a>]</sup>  
His projections seem slanted more toward larger bodies of humans interacting with computers, in less of an intimate personal sense than the above papers or than our initial goal. 
               Fein<sup>[<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-20">20</a>]</sup>  
in making a comprehensive   projection of the growth and dynamic inter-relatedness of   &#34;computer-related sciences,&#34; includes specific mention of the   enhancement of human intellect by cooperative activity of men,   mechanisms, and automata. He coined the term &#34;synnoetics&#34; as   applicable generally to the cooperative interaction of people,   mechanisms, plant or animal organisms, and automata into a   system whose mental power is greater than that of its   components, and presented a good picture of the integrated way   in which many currently separate disciplines should be   developed and taught in the future to do justice to their   mutual roles in the important metadiscipline defined as   &#34;synnoetics.&#34;

reports on the plans and current development of a large time-sharing system at MIT, which is planned to provide direct computer access for a number of outlying stations located in scientists&#39; offices, giving each of these users a chance for real-time utilization of the computer.

              There are several efforts that we   have heard about, but for which there are either no   publications or for which none have been discovered by us.   Mr. Douglas Ross, of the Electronic Systems Laboratory at MIT   has, we learned by direct conversation, been thinking and   working on real-time man-machine interaction problems for some   years. We have recently learned that a graduate student at   MIT, 
              Glenn Randa,<sup>[<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Ref-25">25</a>]</sup>  
has developed the design of a remote display console under Ross   for his graduate thesis project. We understand that another   graduate student there, Ivan Sutherland, is currently using   the display-computer facility on the TX-2 computer at Lincoln   Lab to develop cooperative techniques for engineering-design   problems. And at RAND, we have learned by personal discussion   that Cliff Shaw, Tom Ellis, and Keith Uncapher have been   involved in implementing a multi-station time-sharing system   built around their JOHNNIAC computer.  Termed the JOHNNIAC   Open-Shop System (JOSS for short), it apparently is near   completion, and will use remote typewriter stations.

We assume that you   approach this demonstration-interview with a background   similar to what the previous portion of this report   provides—that is, you will have heard or read a set of   generalizations and a few rather primitive examples, but you   will not yet have been given much of a feel for how a   computer-based augmentation system can really help a   person.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b3a">3b3a</a></span></p>

He suggests that you sit and watch him for a while as he   pursues some typical work, after which he will do some   explaining. You are not particularly flattered by this, since   you know that he is just going to be exercising new language   and methodology developments on his new artifacts—and after   all, the artifacts don&#39;t look a bit different from what you   expected—so why should he keep you sitting there as if you   were a complete stranger to this stuff? It will just be a   matter of &#34;having the computer do some of his   symbol-manipulating processes for him so that he can use more   powerful concepts and concept-manipulation techniques,&#34; as you   have so often been told.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b3b">3b3b</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>Joe has two display screens side by   side, but one of them he doesn&#39;t seem to use as much as the   other. And the screens are almost horizontal, more like the   surface of a drafting table than the near-vertical picture   displays you had somehow imagined. But you see the reason   easily, for he is working on the display surface as intently   as a draftsman works on his drawings, and it would be awkward   to reach out to a vertical surface for this kind of work. Some   of the time Joe is using both hands on the keys, obviously   feeding information into the computer at a great rate.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b3c">3b3c</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>Another slight surprise, though—you   see that each hand operates on a set of keys on its own side   of the display frames, so that the hands are almost two feet   apart. But it is plain that this arrangement allows him to   remain positioned over the frames in a rather natural   position, so that when he picks the light pen out of the air   (which is its rest position, thanks to a system of jointed   supporting arms and a controlled tension and rewind system for   the attached cord) his hand is still on the way from the   keyset to the display frame. When he is through with the pen   at the display frame, he lets go of it, the cord rewinds, and   the pen is again in position. There is thus a minimum of   effort, movement, and time involved in turning to work on the   frame. That is, he could easily shift back and forth from   using keyset to using light pen, with either hand (one pen is   positioned for each hand), without moving his head, turning,   or leaning.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b3d">3b3d</a></span></p>

It is in this type   of working mode that the images on the display frames changed   most dynamically. You receive another real surprise as you   realize how much activity there is on the face of these   display tubes. You ask yourself why you weren&#39;t prepared for   this, and you are forced to admit that the generalizations you   had heard hadn&#39;t really sunk in—&#34;new methods for manipulating   symbols&#34; had been an oft-repeated term, but it just hadn&#39;t   included for you the images of the free and rapid way in which   Joe could make changes in the display, and of meaningful and   flexible &#34;shaping&#34; of ideas and work status which could take   place so rapidly.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b3e">3b3e</a></span></p>

You   could recognize many words, but there were a good number that   were obviously special abbreviations of some sort. During the   times when a given image or portion of an image remained un   changed long enough for you to study it a bit, you rarely saw   anything that looked like a sentence as you were used to   seeing one. You were beginning to gather that there were other   symbols mixed with the words that might be part of a sentence,   and that the different parts of what made a full-thought   statement (your feeling about what a sentence is) were not   just laid out end to end as you expected. But Joe suddenly   cleared the displays and turned to you with a grin that   signalled the end of the passive observation period, and also   that somehow told you that he knew very well that you now knew   that you had needed such a period to shake out some of your   limited images and to really realize that a &#34;capability   hierarchy&#34; was a rich and vital thing.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b3f">3b3f</a></span></p>

You&#39;ve read the stuff   about process and process-capability hierarchies, I&#39;m sure. I   know from past experience in explaining radical augmentation   systems to people that the new and powerful higher-level   capabilities that they are interested in—because basically   those are what we are all anxious to improve—can&#39;t really be   explained to them without first giving them some understanding   of the new and powerful capabilities upon which they are   built. This holds true right on down the line to the type of   low-level capability that is new and different to them all   right, but that they just wouldn&#39;t ordinarily see as being   &#39;powerful.&#39; And yet our systems wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near as   powerful without them, and a person&#39;s comprehension of the   system would be rather shallow if he didn&#39;t have some   understanding of these basic capabilities and of the   hierarchical structure built up from them to provide the   highest-level capabilities.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b3g">3b3g</a></span></p>

This   low-level composition task is just what you normally do with a   pen or pencil or typewriter on a piece of paper—that is,   assemble a bunch of symbols before your eyes in order to   portray something which you have in mind.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b4a">3b4a</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>You listened and watched as Joe   showed you some of the different ways in which the composition   of straightforward text was made easier for him in this   system. With either hand, Joe could &#34;type&#34; (the keysets didn&#39;t   look at all like typewriter keyboards) individual letters and   numbers, and if he had directed it to do so, the computer   would put each successive symbol next to its predecessor just   as a typewriter does—only here there was completely automatic   &#34;carriage return&#34; service. This didn&#39;t impress you very much,   since an automatic carriage-return feature was sort of a   trivial return on the investment behind all of this   equipment—but then you reflected that, as long as the   computer was there anyway, to help do all the flashy things   you had witnessed earlier, one might as well use it in all of   the little helpful ways he could.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b4b">3b4b</a></span></p>

This also   seemed sort of trivially obvious, and Joe seemed to know that   you would feel so. &#34;It turns out that this simple capability   makes it feasible to do some pretty rough tasks in the upper   levels of the capability hierarchy—where precise use of   special terms really pays off, where the human just couldn&#39;t   be that precise by depending upon his unaided memory for   definitions and &#39;standards,&#39; and where using dictionary and   reference-book lookup in the normal fashion would be so   distracting and time-consuming that the task execution would   break down. We&#39;ve tried taking this feature away in some of   these processes up there, and believe me, the result was a   mess.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b4c">3b4c</a></span></p>

At any later time (until he chose to discard   that particular abbreviation from his working vocabulary) the   typing of the abbreviation term would call forth automatically   the &#34;printing&#34; on the display of the entire object string. Joe   showed you another way in which this abbreviation feature   might work. He &#34;arranged&#34; for the computer to print the   abbreviation on the display, just the way he typed it in. At a   subsequent reading, if he had for gotten what the abbreviation   stood for, he could call for substitution of the full object   string to refresh his memory.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b4d">3b4d</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>Then he showed you how this sort of   facility had been extended, in a refined way, to provide a   rather powerful sort of shorthand. He could hit a great many   combinations of keys on his keyset—i.e., any one stroke of   his hand could depress a number of keys, which gave him over a   thousand unique single-stroke signals to the computer with   either hand. Some of these signals were used as abbreviations   for entire words. It seems that, for instance, the 150 most   commonly used words in a natural language made up about half   of any normal text in that language. Joe said that it was thus   quite feasible to learn and use the single-stroke   abbreviations for about half of the words he used, but beyond   that each added percent began to require him to have too many   abbreviations under his command. But he said that there were a   lot of word endings, letter pairs (diagrams), and letter   triplets (trigrams) that were so common as to make it pay to   abbreviate them to a single stroke. A whole word so   abbreviated saved typing all the letters as well as the spaces   at either side of the word, and a word-ending abbreviated by a   single stroke saved typing the letters and the end-of-word   space. He claimed that he could comfortably rattle off about   180 words a minute—faster than he could comfortably talk. You   believed him after he transcribed your talking for a minute or   so, and it gave you an eerie feeling to see the near   instantaneous appearance of your words and sentences in neat   printed form.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b4e">3b4e</a></span></p>

He made some brief   references to statistical predictions that the computer could   make regarding what you were going to type next, and that if   you got reasonably skillful you could &#34;steer through the   extrapolated prediction field&#34; as you entered your information   and often save energy and time. You gathered that he thought   you would saturate about there on this particular subject,   because he went on to the next.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b4f">3b4f</a></span></p>

The frame   full of your transcribed speech was still showing, and it   represented the clumsy phrasing and illogical progression of   thought so typical of extemporaneous speech. Joe took the   light gun in his right hand, and with a deft flick of it,   coordinated with a stroke of his left hand on its keyset,   caused the silent and instantaneous deletion of a superfluous   word. The word disappeared from the frame, and the rest of the   text simultaneously readjusted to present the neat, no-gap,   full-line appearance it had had. <span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b5a">3b5a</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>With but slightly more motion of his   light pen, he could similarly delete any string of words or   letters. He demonstrated this by cutting out what I thought to   be some relevant prose, and then he showed how the system   allowed for second thoughts about such human-directed   processes—those words were automatically saved for a brief   period in case he wanted to call them back. Leaving his light   pen pointed at the space where a deleted symbol string used to   be, Joe could reinstate it instantaneously with one stroke of   his left hand.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b5b">3b5b</a></span></p>

Again it would disappear instantaneously from   where it had been, but now the modified display would show the   old text to have been spread apart just enough at the   indicated point to hold this string. The text would all still   look as neat as if freshly retyped. With similar types of   keyset and light-pen operations, Joe could change paragraph   break points, transpose two arbitrary symbol strings (words,   sentences, paragraphs, etc., or fragments thereof), readjust   margins of arbitrary sections of text—essentially being able   to affect immediately any of the changes that a proofreader   might want to designate with his special marks, only here the   proofreader is always looking at clean text as if it had been   instantaneously retyped after each designation had been   made.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b5c">3b5c</a></span></p>

Also, he could arbitrarily set   the margins between which any section of text must appear, and   its line lengths and number of lines would automatically be   adjusted. He showed how this was useful in displaying parallel   or counter arguments—although he said that actual use of   this feature was a bit more sophisticated—by squeezing each   into half width and putting them side by side (with a vertical   line suddenly separating them). One of the sections of text   was about a third longer than the other—but two quick strokes   with Joe&#39;s left hand caused the computer to adjust the display   automatically. The middle separator line was moved toward the   shorter piece of text, and the line lengths of the two   sections were adjusted so that they occupied the same length   along the display frame.

Confused? Well, take the   simple case where an argument leads to a single product   statement. For instance, you come to a particular point in   your work where you have to decide what to do for the next   step. You go through some reasoning process—usually involving   statements—and come up with a statement specifying that next   step. That final statement is the product statement, and it   represents the product of the argument or reasoning process   which led to it.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6a">3b6a</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;You usually think of an argument as   a serial sequence of steps of reason, beginning with known   facts, assumptions, etc., and progressing toward a   conclusion. Well, we do have to think through these steps   serially, and we usually do list the steps serially when we   write them out because that is pretty much the way our papers   and books have to present them—they are pretty limiting in   the symbol structuring they enable us to use. Have you even   seen a &#39;scrambled-text&#39; programmed instruction book? That is   an interesting example of a deviation from straight serial   presentation of steps.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6b">3b6b</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;Conceptually speaking, however, an   argument is not a serial affair.  It is sequential, I grant   you, because some statements have to follow others, but this   doesn&#39;t imply that its nature is necessarily serial. We   usually string Statement B after Statement A, with Statements   C, D, E, F, and so on following in that order—this is a   serial structuring of our symbols.  Perhaps each statement   logically followed from all those which preceded it on the   serial list, and if so, then the conceptual structuring would   also be serial in nature, and it would be nicely matched for   us by the symbol structuring.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6c">3b6c</a></span></p>

See, sequential but not serial?   A conceptual network but not a conceptual chain. The old paper   and pencil methods of manipulating symbols just weren&#39;t very   adaptable to making and using symbol structures to match the   ways we make and use conceptual structures.  With the new   symbol-manipulating methods here, we have terrific flexibility   for matching the two, and boy, it really pays off in the way   you can tie into your work.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6d">3b6d</a></span></p>

He said that most links   possessed a direction, i.e., they were like an arrow pointing   from one substructure to another, so that in setting up a link   he must specify the two substructures in a given order.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6q">3b6q</a></span></p>

Some good methods,   plus a bit of practice, and you&#39;d be surprised how much a   diagrammatic breakdown can help you to scan a complex   statement and untangle it quickly.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6r">3b6r</a></span></p>

But some of these previous statements are much more   significant than others to this search for understanding. Let   us use what we call &#39;antecedent links&#39; to point to these, and   I&#39;ll give you a basic idea of how we structure an argument so   that we can quickly track down the essential basis upon which   a given statement rests.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6u">3b6u</a></span></p>

He told you, though, that you   soon get so you aren&#39;t very much interested in seeing the   serial listing of all of the statements, and he made another   request of the computer (via the keyset) that eliminated all   the prior statements, except the direct antecedents, from the   screen.

(This choosing was remarkably helped by having only the   remainder statements to study for each new choice—another   little contribution to effectiveness, you thought.) He   mentioned that you could designate orderings under several   different criteria, and later have the display show whichever   ordering you wished. This, he implied, could be used very   effectively when you were building or studying an argument   structure in which from time to time you wanted to strengthen   your comprehension relative to different aspects of the   situation.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6w">3b6w</a></span></p>

When we had established the   antecedent links for all the statements in the argument, the   question &#39;So what?&#39; that you might ask when looking at a given   statement would be answered by looking for the statements for   which the given statement was an antecedent. We already have   links to these consequents—just turn around the arrows on the   antecedent links and we have consequent links. So we can   easily call forth an uncluttered display of consequent   statements to help us see why we needed this given statement   in the argument.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6x">3b6x</a></span></p>

Once the antecedent-consequent   links have been established, the computer can automatically   construct such a display for us.&#34; So, Joe spent a few minutes   (with your help) establishing a reasonable set of links among   the statements you had originally listed.  Then another   keyed-in request to the computer, and almost instantaneously   there appeared a network of lines and dots that looked   something like a tree—except that sometimes branches would   fuse together. &#34;Each node or dot represents one of the   statements of your argument, and the lines are   antecedent-consequent links. The antecedents of one statement   always lie above that statement—or rather, their nodes lie   above its node. When you get used to using a network   representation like this, it really becomes a great help in   getting the feel for the way all the different ideas and   reasoning fit together—that is, for the conceptual   structuring.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6y">3b6y</a></span></p>

Call the   antecedents forth on the second screen, and select one of   special interest—deleting the others. Follow back down the   antecedent trail a little further, using one screen to look at   the detail at any time, and the other to show you the larger   view, with automatic node-brightening indication of where   these detailed items fit in the larger view.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6z">3b6z</a></span></p>

I can   do this several ways. For one thing, I can tell the computer   to number the statements in the order in which you originally   had them listed, and have the labelling done automatically.&#34;    This took him a total of five strokes on the keyset, and   suddenly each node was made into a circle with a number in   it. The statements that were on the second screen now each had   its respective serial number sitting next to it in the left   margin.  &#34;This helps you remember what the different nodes on   the network display contain. We have also evolved some handy   techniques for constructing abbreviation labels that help your   memory quite a bit.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6aa">3b6aa</a></span></p>

It is a lot like using zones of variable magnification as   you scan the structure—higher magnification where you are   inspecting detail, lower magnification in the surrounding   field so that your feel for the whole structure and where you   are in it can stay with you.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b6ab">3b6ab</a></span></p>

There may be many levels of   substructuring between the level of individual symbols and   that represented by the entire collection. You and I have been   working with some of the lower-ordered substructures—the   individual statements and the multistatement arguments—and   have skimmed through some of the ways to build and manipulate   them. The results of small arguments are usually integrated in   a higher level network of argument or concept development, and   these into still higher-level networks, and so on. But at any   such level, the manner in which the interrelationship between   the kernels of argument can be tagged, portrayed, studied and   manipulated is much the same as those which we have just been   through.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b7a">3b7a</a></span></p>

Substructures that represent graphs, curves,   engineering drawings, and other graphical forms can likewise   be integrated. One can also append special substructures, of   any size, to particular other substructures.  A frequent use   of this is to append descriptive material—something like   footnotes, only much more flexible. Or, special messages can   be hung on that offer ideas such as simplifying an argument or   circumventing a blocked path—to be uncovered and considered   at some later date. These different appended substructures can   remain invisible to the worker until such time as he wants to   flush them into view. He can ask for the cue symbols that   indicate their presence (identifying where they are linked and   what their respective types are) to be shown on the network   display any time he wishes, and then call up whichever of them   he wishes If he is interested in only one type of appended   substructure, he can request that only the cues associated   with that type be displayed.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b7b">3b7b</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;You should also realize that a   substructure doesn&#39;t have to be a hunk of data sitting neatly   distinct within the normal form of the larger structure. One   can choose from a symbol structure (or substructure,   generally) any arbitrary collection of its substructures,   designate any arbitrary structuring among these and any new   substructures he wants to add, and thus define a new   substructure which the computer can untangle from the larger   structure and present to him at any time. The associative   trails that Bush suggested represent a primitive example of   this. A good deal of this type of activity is involved during   the early, shifting development of some phase of work, as you   saw when you were collecting tentative argument chains. But   here again, we find ever more delightful ways to make use of   the straightforward-seeming capabilities in developing new   higher-level capabilities—which, of course, seem sort of   straightforward by then, too.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b7c">3b7c</a></span></p>

It is rather like having to project   three-dimensional images onto two-dimensional frames and to   work with them there instead of in their natural   form. Actually, it is much closer to the truth to say that it   is like trying to project n-dimensional forms (the concept   structures, which we have seen can be related with many many   nonintersecting links) onto a one-dimensional form (the serial   string of symbols), where the human memory and visualization   has to hold and picture the links and relationships. I guess   that&#39;s a natural feeling, though. One gets impatient any time   he is forced into a restricted or primitive mode of   operation—except perhaps for recreational purposes.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b7d">3b7d</a></span></p>

Well, when you ever   get handy at roaming over the type of symbol structure which   we have been showing here, and you turn for this purpose to   another person&#39;s work that is structured in this way, you will   find a terrific difference there in the ease of gaining   comprehension as to what he has done and why he has done it,   and of isolating what you want to use and making sure of the   conditions under which you can use it. This is true even if   you find his structure left in the condition in which he has   been working on it—that is, with no special provisions for   helping an outsider find his way around. But we have learned   quite a few simple tricks for leaving appended road signs,   supplementary information, questions, and auxiliary links on   our working structures—in such a manner that they never get   in our way as we work—so that the visitor to our structure   can gain his comprehension and isolate what he wants in   marvelously short order.

A number of people, outside our research group here,   maintain stoutly that a practical augmentation system should   not require the human to have to do any computer   programming—they feel that this is too specialized a   capability to burden people with. Well, what that means in our   eyes, if translated to a home workshop, would be like saying   that you can&#39;t require the operating human to know how to   adjust his tools, or set up jigs, or change drill sizes, and   the like. You can see there that these skills are easy to   learn in the context of what the human has to learn anyway   about using the tools, and that they provide for much greater   flexibility in finding convenient ways to use the tools to   help shape materials.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8e">3b8e</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;It won&#39;t take too much time to give you a feel for the helpful methods we have for working on   computer-process structures—or programs—because there is   quite a bit of similarity in concept to what you have seen in   the symbol-structuring techniques. No matter what   
<span>language</span> you use—whether machine language, list language, or   ALGOL, for instance—you build up the required process   structure by organizing statements in that language. Each   statement specifies a given process to your computer. Well,   you have already seen how you can get help in developing   precise and powerful statements, or in gaining quick   comprehension of statements, by charting or diagramming them and using special links between the different parts.  &#34;Look   here.&#39;&#34; And he went after what he said was a typical process   structure, to give you an example of what he was talking   about. In several brief, successive frame displays, before he   got to the one he wanted, you got glimpses of network   schematics that reminded you of those used in symbol   structuring. But, what he finally had on the display frame was   quite different from the argument statements you had seen.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8f">3b8f</a></span></p>

Here, in process structuring,   corresponding questions about a statement might be: &#39;What does   it say to do?&#39; &#39;What effect will that have?&#39; and &#39;Why do we   want that done?&#39; Let&#39;s take a quick look at some of the ways   you can get help in answering them.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8g">3b8g</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;The language used to compose these   process-description statements for the computer is considerably   more compact and precise than is a natural language, such as   English, and there is correspondingly less advantage to be   gained by appending special links and tags for giving us   humans a better grasp of their meaning. However, as you see in   this left-hand section of the statement portrayal, geometrical   grouping, linking, and positioning of the statement components   are used in the blown-up statement display.  But this   portrayal doesn&#39;t stem from special appended information, it   can be laid out like this automatically by the computer, just   from the cues it gets from the necessary symbol components of   the statement. The different significant relationships are   more perceptible to a human in this way of laying it out, and   an experienced human thus gets quite a bit of help in   answering the first question: &#39;What does it say to do?&#39;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8h">3b8h</a></span></p>

Other   symbols here provide keys which a light-pen selection can   activate to bring to you displays of that symbol structure,   usually a choice of several relevant views at different levels   of the structure. Then I can use the keyset to ask for the   preceding statement, if I&#39;m a little puzzled about the   detailed manipulation—or, I can request a specific   higher-level view of the process structure by light-pen   selection on one of these remaining symbols here.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8i">3b8i</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>So saying, Joe selected one of these   symbols with his pen, and a new and different display popped   into view. &#34;This is the next level up in the process   structure. It consists of lists of compactly abbreviated   statements, and some condensed notes about their effects. If   we want, we can blow up one at a time as we study over the   list. In this context, one can get some answer to the larger   picture of what effect will a given statement have, and also   some answer to the question about why we want a given effect   produced. But this is a sort of a holdover from old programming habits, and most of us nowadays are making   considerably more use of the schematic techniques that evolved   out of the program flow-charting techniques and out of our   symbol-structuring techniques.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8j">3b8j</a></span></p>

He flashed a   few on the screen, and indicated how some of the different   features could give the human a quick appreciation of how   different component processes were cooperating to produce a   more sophisticated process. You could appreciate some of the   tricks of linking in explanatory and descriptive substructure   and the general means of using all the different   symbol-structuring tricks for representing to the human the   considerations, critical features, and interdependencies   involved in the process structure.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8k">3b8k</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;Most of this portrayal technique   actually represents special structuring of what we previously   defined in a loose way as arguments. The human who wants to   approach an established process structure in order to modify   it, needs to gain comprehension of the relevant features both   of the functioning and of the design of the structure. You saw   how this could be facilitated by our symbol-structuring   techniques. And if he is building a new process structure or   changing an existing one, he needs to structure the argument   or reasoning behind the design. We have developed a number of   special symbol-structuring techniques that allow us to match   especially well to the concepts involved in designing   processes.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8l">3b8l</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;But there is a very significant   feature involved in this particular type of process   structuring that I should tell you about. It is based upon the   fact that the process-description language for the computer is   formal and precise. Because of this fact, we can establish   explicit rules for treating statements in this language, and   for treating symbol structures composed of these statements,   such that computer processes based upon these rules can be   said to extract meaning from these statements and to do   operations based upon this meaning. The result is that the   computer is able to find answers to a much wider range of   questions about a specified process structure than it could if   only the structural characteristics were discernible to   it.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8m">3b8m</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;In our studying and designing   process structures, we have found many ways to capitalize upon   this more sophisticated question-answering capability now   possessed by the computer. We are learning, for instance, how   to get the computer to decide whether or not some types of   design specifications are met, and if not, where the   limitation exists. Or, perhaps we approach an already designed   process structure which we think we can modify, or from which   we can extract some useful sub-process that we contemplate   incorporating into another process we are designing. We are   getting terrific help in this type of instance, since we can   now ask the computer direct questions about types of   capability and limitation in this structure. The computer can   even lead us directly to the particular design features from   which these capabilities or limitations stem, and it is simple   then to examine the descriptive and explanatory arguments   linked thereto in order to see why these features were   designed into the structure.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8n">3b8n</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;But I don&#39;t want to spend a   disproportionate amount of time on the computer processes. The   augmented man is engaged more often in structuring what we   call composite processes than he is in structuring computer   processes.  For instance, planning a research project, or a   day&#39;s work, are examples of structuring composite processes. A   composite process, remember, is organized from both human   processes and computer processes—which includes, of course,   the possible inclusion of lower-order composite processes. The   structuring here differs from that of a computer process   mainly in the sophistication of the sub-processes which can be   
<span>specified</span> for the human to do. Some of these specifications have to be given in a language which matches the human&#39;s rich working framework of concepts—and we have been demonstrating here with English for that purpose—but quite a few   human-executed processes can be   
<span>specified</span> in the   high-level computer-processing language even though we don&#39;t   know how to   
<span>describe</span> them in that language.  This means that there are quite a few composite-process structures about which the computer can answer very useful questions for us.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8o">3b8o</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;But to be more specific—we find   that setting up objectives, designing a method of approach,   and then implementing that method are of course our   fundamental operating sequence—done over and over again in   the many levels of our activity. We mentioned above what the   characteristic structural difference was between computer   processes and composite processes. But perhaps more important   to us is the difference in the way we work with   composite-process structures. Here is a crude but succinct way   to put this.  With the human contributing to a process, we   find more and more as the process becomes complex that the   value of the human&#39;s contribution depends upon how much   freedom he is given to be disorderly in his course of action.   For instance, we provide him as much help as possible in   making a plan of action. Then we give him as much help as we   can in carrying it out.  But we also have to allow him to   change his mind at almost any point, and to want to modify his   plans. So, we provide augmentation help to him for keeping   track of his plans where he is in them, what has been   happening in carrying them out to date—and for evaluating   possibilities that might occur to him for changing the   plans. In fact, we are even learning how the computer can be   made to watch for some kinds of plan-change possibilities, and   to point them out to the human when they arise.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8p">3b8p</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;Here&#39;s a simple example of this sort   of help for the human. Last winter, we designed a computer   process that can automatically monitor the occurrence of   specified types of computer usage over a specified period of   time, and which, from the resulting data, can deduce a   surprising amount of information regarding how the human made   use of that time. This was quite helpful to us for evaluating   our ways of doing things. Then we added more features to the   program, in which the computer occasionally interrupts the   human&#39;s activity and displays some questions to be   answered. From these answers, together with its normal   monitoring data, the program can provide evaluative data   regarding the relative success of his different work methods.   Our augmentation researchers became intrigued by this angle   and bore down a little on it. They came up with a package   process which gives the human many different types of feedback   about his progress and way of doing things.  Now, as part of   my regular practice, I spend about five minutes out of each   hour exercising with this package. This almost always reveals   things to me that change at least the slant of my approach   during the next hour, and often stimulates a relatively   significant change in my short-range plans.

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;Our way of structuring the statement   of our objectives, the arguments which lead to the design of   our plans, and the working statements of our plans, has been   influenced by this review process. We found special types of   tags and descriptive codes which we could append to these   respective planning structures as we developed them which   later facilitated our man-computer cooperative review of   them. Also, our methods of developing these structures have   evolved to facilitate their later modification. For instance,   every basic consideration upon which a given planning   statement is based is linked to that statement as a matter of   standard argument structuring. But we have taken to linking   special tagging codes into these argument structures involving   our planning, to identify for the computer some of the   different types of dependency relationships in the antecedent   linkages. Later, if we consider changing the plan, these   special tags often enable us to make use of some special   computer processes that automatically isolate the   considerations relevant to a particular type of change we have   in mind.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8s">3b8s</a></span></p>

There is a plan I am currently using for the way I go   about entering miscellaneous scraps of information into my   total symbol structure. It is designed so that there will be a   good chance for these scraps later to be usefully   integrated. It turns out that this plan is closely coupled in   its design argument to the general plan for reviewing process   structures—and symbol-structures, too, for that   matter. Recently, I got an idea as to how I might add a little   feature to that process that specially suited my particular   way of wanting to deal with miscellaneous thoughts that I   get. By various means, I very quickly learned that this would   be easy to do if I could but reverse the order in which I   execute the sub-process Steps A and B, when I enter a piece of   information. I had to find out if I could safely reverse their   order without getting into trouble someplace in my system.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8t">3b8t</a></span></p>

There   is, in fact, a semi-automatic processes available to me for   speeding just such searches. The computer keeps track of where   I have looked, where I&#39;ve marked things as yes, or no, or   possible, and does the bookkeeping and calculating necessary   to guide me through an optimum search strategy. But the   special tagging we do when we make a process structure lets   this search be fully automatic when certain kinds of   relationships are involved—and relative timing happens to be   one of these relationships.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8u">3b8u</a></span></p>

But anyway, the   computer discovered a relevance trail that ended up showing   that reversing the order of Steps A and B during the   information-scrap entry process would cripple a certain   feature in the planning-review process, where miscellaneous   thoughts and possibilities are gleaned from this store to be   considered relative to the planning.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8v">3b8v</a></span></p>

It is an intellectual   one, where the processing and shaping done is of conceptual   material rather than physical material. But between these two   types of working domains we nonetheless find closely analogous   conditions relative to the variety and sophistication of the   processes and techniques applicable to what nonroutine workers   do. Consider the intellectual domain of a creative problem   solver, and listen to me rattle off the names of some   specialized disciplines that come to mind. These esoteric   disciplines could very possibly contribute specialized   processes and techniques to a general worker in the   intellectual domain: Formal logic—mathematics of many   varieties, including statistics—decision theory—game   theory—time and motion analysis—operations   research—classification theory—documentation theory—cost   accounting, for time, energy, or money—dynamic   programming—computer programming. These are only a few of the   total, I&#39;m sure.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8ab">3b8ab</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;This implies the range of   potentially applicable processes. Realize that there is also a   correspondingly large list of specialized materials   potentially usable in the fabrications of the intellectual   worker. I speak, of course, about the conceptual material in   the many different fields of human interest. The things that I   have been demonstrating to you this afternoon were designed   to increase significantly the range of both processes and   materials over which a human can practically operate within   this intellectual domain. You might say that we do this by   providing him with a very fast, agile vehicle, equipped with   all sorts of high-performance sensory equipment and   navigational aids, and carrying very flexible, powerful,   semi-automatic devices for operating upon the materials of   this domain. Not only that, but to provide an accurate   analogy, we have to give him a computer to help him organize   and monitor his activity and assess his results. We get direct   help on many levels of activity in our system, you see.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8ac">3b8ac</a></span></p>

Our augmented intellectual worker gets essentially   this same kind of service, only more so—a compounding of this   kind of service. Structuring our processes with care and   precision enables the computer to answer limited questions, to   guide you to relevant descriptions and specifications within   its structure, to execute complex but limited-grasp processes   on its own, and to take care of complex rule and   procedure-following bookkeeping in guiding the execution of   sophisticated composite processes. This actually makes it   practical to use many specialized processes and techniques   from very esoteric fields—to assess their applicability and   limitations quickly, to incorporate them intelligently into   the design and analysis of possible courses of action, and to   execute them efficiently.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8ad">3b8ad</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;Our specialized processes represent   a beautiful collection of special tools. These tools are   designed by specialists, and they come equipped with operating   instructions, trouble-shooting hints, and complete design   data. Furthermore, we are provided with other tools that help   us determine the applicability of these tools by automatically   operating upon the instruction manual for us. Further, if   something goes wrong with one of these tools, if we want to   design a new tool of our own and make use of one of its   modular components, or if we want to rearrange some of its   adjustable features, we get considerable help in learning what   we have to know about its design, and in making adjustments or   coupling a part of it to another tool. Our shop contains an   efficient tool-making section, where we can design and build   our own tools from scratch, or by incorporating parts or all   of any other tools we have.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8ae">3b8ae</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;Let me tell you of an interesting   feature stemming from my using such improved   Process-structuring techniques. An effective job of breaking   down a complex problem into humanly manageable steps—and this   is essentially what we seek in our process structuring—will   provide the human with something to do at every turn. This may   be to ponder or go searching, true enough—we aren&#39;t saying   that the steps are necessarily straightforward. But the point   I want to make is that no longer am I ever at a loss as to   what to do next.  I get stuck at times, to be sure, but when I   do I have clean and direct ways to satisfy myself that I   should just beat away at that roadblock for the time   being.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8af">3b8af</a></span></p>

What&#39;s more, I&#39;m not generating reams of   cyclic arguments, lists, calculations, or the like—either I&#39;m   checking the validity of what I&#39;ve already structured, or I am   correcting or expanding the structure. In other words, it   seems that the growth of my comprehension is sure and steady   up to the point at which I succeed or give up. If I give up, I   leave a structure which is very well organized to accommodate   a subsequent revisit with new data, possibilities,   assumptions, objectives, or tools. Also, I set up a sentinel   process that will operate in the future to help alert me to   concepts which may clear the block.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8ag">3b8ag</a></span></p>

And I can turn right around and apply   this toward improving my ability for structuring arguments and   processes. The initial, straightforward capabilities for   manipulating symbol structures, that were more or less   obviously availed me by the computer have given to me a power   to participate in more sophisticated processes that capitalize   more fully upon the computer&#39;s capability—processes which are   very significant to my net effectiveness, and yet which   weren&#39;t particularly apparent to us as either possible or   useful in the days before we started harnessing computers to   the human&#39;s workaday activities in this direct way.&#39;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b8ai">3b8ai</a></span></p>

We have experimented with   having several people work together from working stations that   can provide inter-communication via their computer or   computers.  That is, each person is equipped as I am here,   with free access to the common working structures. There   proves to be a really phenomenal boost in group effectiveness   over any previous form of cooperation we have experienced.   They can all work on the same symbol structure, wherever they   might wish.  If any two want to work simultaneously on the   same material, they simply duplicate and each starts reshaping   his version—and later it is easy to merge their   contributions. The whole team can join forces at a moment&#39;s   notice to &#39;pull together&#39; on some stubborn little problem, or   to make a group decision. Most points of contention are   resolved quite naturally, over a period of time, as the   developing structure of argument bears out one, or the other,   or neither stand.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b9a">3b9a</a></span></p>

One can   either take immediate personal issue with another about some   feature, anywhere in the structure where he might find   something done by the other to which he wants to take issue,   or he can append his objection and the associated argument   there where the disagreement lies, and tag this with a special   cue that signals a point of contention that must ultimately be   resolved. Any idea of the moment by any member can easily be   linked to where it can do some good. It gets to be like a real   whing-ding free-for-all—tremendously stimulating and   satisfying, and things really get done.

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;We have been experimenting with   multi-disciplinary teams and are becoming especially excited   over the results. For instance, there is a great reduction of   the barrier that their different terminologies used to   represent, where one specialist couldn&#39;t really apply his   experience, intuition, or conceptual feel very well unless   the situation could be stated and framed in his accustomed   manner, and yet the others couldn&#39;t work with his   terminology. Here, they meet at their concept and terminology   interface and work out little shifts in meaning and use which   each can find digestible in his system, and which permit quite   precise definitions in each system of the terms and concepts   in the others. In studying the other&#39;s structuring then,   either of them can have his own definitions automatically   substituted for the other&#39;s special terms. Reduce this   language barrier, and provide the feature of their being able   to work in parallel independence on the joint structure, and   what seems to result is amplification of their different   capabilities.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b9c">3b9c</a></span></p>

Three people   working together in this augmented mode seem to be more than   three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is   one augmented person working alone—and perhaps ten times as   effective as three similar men working together without this   computer-based augmentation.  It is a new and exhiliarating   experience to be working in this independent-parallel fashion   with some good men. We feel that the effect of these   augmentation developments upon group methods and group   capability is actually going to be more pronounced than the   effect upon individuals methods and capabilities, and we are   very eager to increase our research effort in that   direction.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b9d">3b9d</a></span></p>

But I have selected the sample   features to present to you with an eye toward giving you a   maximum chance to identify these as being something   significant to your own type of work. I avoided discussing   techniques applicable to esoteric problem-solving   processes—although some of them display especially   stimulating possibilities to those with appropriate   backgrounds. The ability to structure arguments organized in   English-language statements, and to make use of the linking   and tagging capabilities at all levels of the structure, can   be seen to lead to many interesting and promising new   capabilities for organizing your thoughts and actions. I think   you could picture learning these tricks and using them in your   own work.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10a">3b10a</a></span></p>

It is true that the more of the   sophisticated tricks you learn, the more computer power you   can harness and the more powerful you become—but very   significant and personally thrilling practical problem-solving   capabilities have been developed by quite a few subjects who   were given only fifteen hours of training at one of these   stations. The training, incidentally, was all provided by the   computer without the presence of a human instructor. And the   people were of such diverse fields as sociology, biology,   engineering management, applied mathematics, and law. These   were all relatively high-level people, and they were   completely and unreservedly unanimous in their faith that   their increased capability would easily justify the capital   and operating outlay that we predicted for work stations of   this sort in five years, if the computer industry really were   to take this type of potential market seriously.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10b">3b10b</a></span></p>

<span>evolved</span> is a good word to use here,   because our appreciation for the potential worth of   possibilities to be developed had to evolve too, and only came   with the experience and perspective gained in our earlier   work.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10d">3b10d</a></span></p>

              &#34;For instance, we initially felt that defining categories and relationships, and making a plan   for action, were things to be done as quickly as possible so   that we could get on with the work. But, as our means   developed for dealing with definitions and plans more   precisely, easily, and flexibly, we began to realize that they   in reality might be the most significant part of that   work. With our immensely increased capability for complex   bookkeeping relative to our interlaced hierarchies of   objectives, plans, and arguments, we found that defining a new   category, searching for members or instances of it, or   applying its selection criteria were becoming ever conscious   and specific tasks.

              &#34;For instance, we began to find it   more and more useful to distinguish different categories or   types of process, different types of arguments, different   types of relationships, and different types of descriptions.   For a specific example, 
              Ranganathan<sup>*<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Note-2">2</a>*</sup> 
once cited five specific relationships that could obtain between two terms, where one   modifies the other. He called these   
<span>phase</span> relations, and named how one term could relate to the other as either   biasing it, being a tool used to study it, being an aspect of   it, being in comparison with it, or influencing it. Vickery   gave more examples, saying one could also have an effect on the other, be a cause of it, be a use for it, be a substitute   for it, a source for it, an implication of it, be an explanation of it, or be a representation of it. There are   even more categories mentioned in the literature.

It turned out to be a   very invigorating innovation, and we began to take more pains   with our structuring. It took longer to set up links and   nodes in our structures, to be sure, but we found on the one   hand that the structures became much cleaner and required   fewer members, and on the other hand that we could get   considerably more sophisticated help from the computer in   doing significant chores for us.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10g">3b10g</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;We began to work up processes that   would help us establish categories, give them good   definitions, check their relationship with other established   categories, decide whether something fit a given category or   not, search for all possible members of it within a given   substructure, and so forth.  The very fact of using this   careful classification within our structures allowed us to   get more powerful help from the computer in these   classification processes. I should mention that the   relationships among the terms in a sentence—the syntax if you   wish—had been given further specification tags than those I   showed you earlier, to remove ambiguities that hindered the   computer from going back to a statement and resolving the   syntactical structure. Also, ambiguities in the meaning of the   terms began to limit us, and we developed methods for removing   a good deal of this semantic ambiguity. This slowed us down,   as I&#39;ve mentioned, but not as much as you&#39;d think.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10h">3b10h</a></span></p>

One of   these other developments stems from the concepts and   techniques of the semantic differential, as first introduced   
              by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum<sup>*<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Note-3">3</a>*</sup>  
back in 1957, and from some subsequent work 
              by Mayer and Bagley<sup>*<a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#Note-4">4</a>*</sup>  
on what they called semantic   models. These offered useful possibilities for establishing   quite precisely what meaning a concept has to an individual,   relative to his general conceptual framework, and for   representing this meaning in a specific way that was amenable   to computer manipulation.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10i">3b10i</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;The other development upon which   this process to be exhibited is based, was stimulated by our   realizing that flexible cooperation with the computer was   calling for lots of little interactions. Our working   repertoire of small-task requests for computer service was   getting quite large, and it was proving to be extremely   valuable to use them and to be able to remember automatically   their procedures and designation codes. One of our research   psychologists had worked on human-memory phenomena before he   came with us, and had interested himself in mnemonic aids of   all sorts. He has developed some useful techniques for us to   use in connection with this, and other problems. Now let me   demonstrate this example of an advanced process for helping   work with categories.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10j">3b10j</a></span></p>

In fact, I want a definition that the   computer can later work with. Look, I&#39;ll dig up a description   that is awaiting such a definition, and you can watch what   happens.&#34; So saying, Joe drummed on his keysets for a moment,   with one interruption when the computer flashed something on   the screen that was apparently a question about what he was   asking the computer to find for him. He finally had a network   display on one screen and a set of &#34;exploded&#34; statements on   the upper half of the other.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10k">3b10k</a></span></p>

Watch what happens.&#34; A few more strokes on the   keyset, and he picked up his light pen in anticipation and   waited a few moments. A statement appeared in the lower half   of the second frame. He studied it a moment, then looked at   the statements above, picked out a node on the network with   the pen, and hit the keyset a few strokes. Another statement   flashed on almost immediately, with two familiar adjectives   placed below and a graduated line between them. Joe studied   this, referred to the statements above, flipped through   several levels of network portrayals, through a few statements   representing a couple of low-level nodes, reflected a moment,   and then pointed his light pen at a point on the graduated   line, part way between the adjectives, and pressed its   button.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10l">3b10l</a></span></p>

This   process is applying some very sophisticated criteria and using   some very sophisticated analytical techniques, and it is set   up so that it is actually the computer that is now in the   executive seat. I called for the process, but its execution   essentially involves the computer&#39;s asking me questions, and   feeding me successive questions according to how I&#39;ve answered   the previous ones. It also is doing a lot of work on the   symbol structure that represents my description. It, with some   small help from me, is proceeding through a quite complex   analysis of the meaning that this incipient concept has to me,   and of certain types of mental associations that I may have   with it. I don&#39;t have to remember the special rules and forms   of analysis involved—nevertheless, a very sophisticated   little capability is mine to use at will, taxing neither me   nor the computer.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10m">3b10m</a></span></p>

The first term is a newly coined formal   name, while the remaining three terms represent a compound   expression, involving established concepts, that can be used   also as a designation of the new category. The second line   furnishes me with an association chain to use for a mnemonic   aid in remembering the new name—linking the name to several   characteristics of the concept. The name itself was selected   under mnemonic criteria, as well as to have a structure that   goes with its syntactic and semantic categories.  The third   line lists the names of some previously defined categories or   concepts that are the closest to this in meaning—these before   the break were found to overlap, and the rest are just   close.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10n">3b10n</a></span></p>

It&#39;s in a special language and I won&#39;t try to   explain. I&#39;ll just mention that I can now study it, take it   apart, check its references, so to speak, and perhaps even see   if the computer and I might work out any changes or   improvements.

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;This special language, in which I   said the definition was stated, is a recent development. We   had found that the types of structuring we were developing had   a lot of extra tags and links that were traceable to the   complexity of the rules and combinatorial possibilities of the   English language with which the statements were construct We   finally got a clear enough picture of the requirements we   place upon a language in our use here that we could consider   designing our own special language. It turned out to be a   straightforward and rather simple language compared with   English, but much more precise and powerful. It proves rather   inflexible and awkward to use for speaking, but it provides   plenty of flexibility and power for expressing things in the   visual-symbol forms that we use. Its precision leaves no   syntactic ambiguity in a well-formed statement, and makes it   much easier to reduce semantic ambiguity to the point where   the computer can deal with our statements much as it can with   mathematical or formal-logic expressionc<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10p">3b10p</a></span></p>

              <p><a name=""></a>&#34;It is worth mentioning, too, that   we are experimenting with standard ways of structuring   arguments at levels higher than the statements—sort of a   super grammar or syntax, with rules for assembling argument   modules of different function into what becomes a well-formed   higher-level argument module. There are some mixed feelings   around here about this possibility, but I myself have become   very much excited by it.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10q">3b10q</a></span></p>

If it can get   hold of and manipulate important aspects of the meaning that   is contained in our structures, it can develop answers to some   questions for which there existed only conceptually implicit   data. With practice and good strategy, asking questions like   this proves to be a tremendously effective way to gain   comprehension about a structure. We even have special   processes and symbol-structuring methods to help organize the   questioning and the answers. Some of the answers are a bit   costly, however—in computer time and charges—and we have to   watch the way we ask questions. Some of our researchers are   studying the language and structuring techniques relative to   this problem, and they think they see ways to change them to   make question answering generally more efficient. But this   sort of thing will likely always have its cost problems, as   far as we can see now.&#34;<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10s">3b10s</a></span></p>

The Clerk can also point out some of the   weaknesses in the statement, as well as some of the effects of   the statement upon the rest of the structure. They find that   they need to give less and less human concern for the details   of structure building—in fact, the roles have reversed a   little. Where the human used to set up tags and links so the   computer could find its way around the structure as it ran   errands for him, they now have the computer studiously   installing similar things that are for the benefit of the   human when he is studying the structure.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b10t">3b10t</a></span></p>

This process, and some of the   past data collected by its use, were becoming an important   addition to the planning review sessions, as well as to the   continuing development of improved methods.

On the other hand, if no gains are really obvious after a year or so, then it is time to begin incorporating more science in their approach.

For instance, key concepts held initially, that would have been laboriously riveted into the well-engineered structure, could well be rendered obsolete by the &#34;view&#34; obtained from higher in the hierarchy. And besides, it seems best to get the quick and rough improvements built and working first, so that the research will benefit not only from the orientation obtained, but from the help that these improvements will provide when used as tools and techniques to tackle the tougher or slower possibilities.

            A few words about the subject matter through which Activity A 1 may progress. The researchers will think of simple innovations and try them in short order—and perhaps be stimulated in the process by realizing how handy some new feature would be that would help them whip up trial processes in a hurry. They will know of basic capabilities they want to work toward for structuring their arguments, their planning, their factual data, etc., so that they can more easily get computer help in developing them, in analyzing and pursuing comprehension within them, and in modifying or extending them. They will try different types of structuring, and see how easy it is to design computer processes to manipulate them or composite processes to do total useful work with them.

            They can work up programs that can search through other programs for answers to questions about them—questions whose answers serve the processes of debugging, extending, or modifying. Perhaps there will be ways they adopt in the initial structuring of a program—e.g., appending stylized descriptive cues here and there—that have no function in the execution of that program, but which allow more sophisticated fact retrieval therein by the computer. Perhaps such cue tagging would allow development of programs which could automatically make fairly sophisticated modifications to a tagged program. Maybe there would evolve semi-automatic &#34;super-compilers,&#34; with which the programmer and the computer leap-frog over the obstacles to formulating exact specifications for a computer (or perhaps composite) process and getting it into whatever programming language they use.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#4f10">4f10</a></span></p>

To the human, the computer represents a special instrument which can display to him a comprehensible image of any characteristic of this structure that may be of interest. From our conceptual viewpoint, this would be a source of tremendous power for the human to harness, but it depends upon the computer being able to &#34;read&#34; all of the stored information (which would be in a form essentially incomprehensible to a human). Now, if this conjecture is borne out there would be considerably less value in micro-image information-storage systems than is now generally presumed. In other words, we now conjecture that future reference information will be much more valuable if stored in computer-sensible form.

Give CAUG-I to a real-world problem solver in almost any discipline, and he has the basic capabilities for structuring his arguments and plans, organizing special files, etc., that almost anyone could expect to need.  In addition to these direct-application on capabilities, however, are provided those capabilities necessary for analyzing problem tasks, developing and evaluating new process capabilities, etc., as would be required for him to extend the CAUG-I system to match to the special features of his problem area and the way he likes to work.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#4g9">4g9</a></span></p>

            <li><a name=""></a>An approach has been outlined for testing the hypothesis of Item (1) and for pursuing the &#34;rich and significant gains&#34; which we feel are promised. This approach is designed to treat the redesign of a capability hierarchy by reworking from the bottom up, and yet to make the research on augmentation means progress as fast as possible by deriving practically usable augmentation systems for real-world problem solvers at a maximum rate. This goal is fostered by the recommendation of incorporating positive feedback into the research development—i.e., concentrating a good share of the basic-research attention upon augmenting those capabilities in a human that are needed in the augmentation-research workers. The real-world applications would be pursued by designing a succession of systems for specialists, whose progression corresponds to the increasing generality of the capabilities for which coordinated augmentation means have been evolved. Consideration is given in this rather global approach to providing potential users in different domains of intellectual activity with the basic general-purpose augmentation system from which they themselves can construct the special features of a system to match their job, and their ways of working—or it could be used on the other hand by researchers who want to pursue the development of special augmentation systems for special fields.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#5a4">5a4</a></span></li>

          <p><a name=""></a>Three principal conclusions may be drawn concerning the significance and implications of the ideas that have been presented.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#6a">6a</a></span></p>

          <p><a name=""></a>First any possibility for improving the effective utilization of the intellectual power of society&#39;s problem solvers warrants the most serious consideration. This is because man&#39;s problem-solving capability represents possibly the most important resource possessed by a society. The other contenders for first importance are all critically dependent for their development and use upon this resource. Any possibility for evolving an art or science that can couple directly and significantly to the continued development of that resource should warrant doubly serious consideration.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#6b">6b</a></span></p>

        <div id="0460" hs:createdby="" hs:createdon="" hs:label="" hs:left-label-delim="" hs:nid="0460" hs:right-label-delim="">
          <p><a name=""></a>Second, the ideas presented are to be considered in both of the above senses: the direct-development sense and the &#34;art of development&#34; sense.  To be sure, the possibilities have long-term implications, but their pursuit and initial rewards await us now. By our view, we 
<span>do not</span> have to wait until we learn how the human mental processes work, we 
<span>do not</span> have to wait until we learn how to make computers more &#34;intelligent&#34; or bigger or faster, we 
<span>can</span> begin developing powerful and economically feasible augmentation systems on the basis of what we now know and have. Pursuit of further basic knowledge and improved machines will continue into the unlimited future, and will want to be integrated into the &#34;art&#34; and its improved augmentation systems—but getting started now will provide not only orientation and stimulation for these pursuits, but will give us improved problem-solving effectiveness with which to carry out the pursuits.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#6c">6c</a></span></p>

          <p><a name=""></a>Third, it becomes increasingly clear that there should be action now—the sooner the better—action in a number of research communities and on an aggressive scale. We offer a conceptual framework and a plan for action, and we recommend that these be considered carefully as a basis for action If they be considered but found unacceptable, then at least serious and continued effort should be made toward developing a more acceptable conceptual framework within which to view the over-all approach, toward developing a more acceptable plan of action, or both.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#6d">6d</a></span></p>

          <p><a name=""></a>This is an open plea to researchers and to those who ultimately motivate, finance, or direct them, to turn serious attention toward the possibility of evolving a dynamic discipline that can-treat the problem of improving intellectual effectiveness in a total sense. This discipline should aim at producing a continuous cycle of improvements—increased understanding of the problem, improved means for developing new augmentation systems, and improved augmentation systems that can serve the world&#39;s problem solvers in general and this discipline&#39;s workers in particular. After all, we spend great sums for disciplines aimed at understanding and harnessing nuclear power. Why not consider developing a discipline aimed at understanding and harnessing &#34;neural power?&#34; In the long run, the power of the human intellect is really much the more important of the two.<span><a href="https://reserialised.routley.io/pubs/augment-3906.html#6e">6e</a></span></p>

            This is an initial summary report of a project taking a new and 
            systematic approach to improving the intellectual effectiveness of the 
            individual human being. A detailed conceptual framework explores the 
            nature of the system composed of the individual and the tools, concepts, 
            and methods that match his basic capabilities to his problems. One of 
            the tools that shows the greatest immediate promise is the computer, 
            when it can be harnessed for direct on-line assistance, integrated with 
            new concepts and methods.
