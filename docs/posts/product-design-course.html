    <h1>Product design course</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Learn the skills a junior product designer needs, starting from the basics, the principles and elements of design, taking a comprehensive tour through methodologies and proper product planning and management, research, interaction and information design, and ending with tracking metrics and next iterations.</p></div></div><div><div><p>This course is entirely self-managed by you, thanks to hundreds of authors who have contributed quality teaching material to the internet.</p></div></div><div><p>The main objective is simple, that you get a junior position by learning the whole tree of skills that companies require.

Once done, I will publish a schedule proposal for hours per week to complete the course in 6 months, 1 year or 2 years, in order for you to set a goal and achieve that job position.</p></div><div><div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e88981dbebe7d3e92fe7f4f/6175a1153d76f91733b78134_millo.jpeg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 94vw, (max-width: 991px) 95vw, 192px" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e88981dbebe7d3e92fe7f4f/6175a1153d76f91733b78134_millo-p-500.jpeg 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e88981dbebe7d3e92fe7f4f/6175a1153d76f91733b78134_millo.jpeg 727w" alt="Author Picture, a very sensual one, Juan Jesús Millo"/></p></div></div></div></div>
