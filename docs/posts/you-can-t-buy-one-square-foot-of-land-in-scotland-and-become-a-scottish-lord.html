    <h1>You can’t buy one square foot of land in Scotland and become a Scottish lord</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve been on the internet much, you’ve probably encountered an advertisement at some point claiming that, if you own any amount of land in Scotland, even if it is only one square foot, then you legally qualify for the title of “lord” or “lady.” Numerous companies have promoted this assertion, purporting that, if you buy one square foot of land from them, then you can call yourself a Scottish lord or lady and they will send you a certificate to indicate your new title. A few of the companies of this sort that you may have heard of include Highland Titles, Scotland Title, Scotland Title<em>s</em> (which is apparently a different company), Established Titles, Laird Title, The Scottish Gift, and so on.</p>



<p>All the titles these companies are selling are fake and they are not worth the paper they are printed on. For one thing, under current Scots law, it is not actually possible to transfer legal ownership rights to a single square foot of land in the first place. Furthermore, even if it were possible, merely owning one square foot of land would not make anyone a “lord” or “lady” in any sense.</p>



<p><strong>Why I am writing about this issue</strong></p>



<p>Regular readers of my blog are aware that I normally write posts about ancient history, so this post about the business of fake Scottish titles is a bit of a departure from my usual content. There are, however, a couple of reasons why I have decided to write this post.</p>



<p>The first reason is because, a couple of days ago, I watched a video by a history YouTuber (whose name I will not disclose here) in which he was promoting one of these companies for a sponsorship. After watching that video, it occurred to me that the target market for these fake title companies overlaps considerably with the online history community.</p>



<p>The second reason is because, as some readers may have guessed from my last name <em>McDaniel</em>, I have some Scottish ancestry on my father’s side. Admittedly, my ancestors bearing the name <em>McDaniel</em> came over to the British colonies in North America way back in the 1700s, before the United States was even a country, and have been living here continuously ever since. My most recent McDaniel ancestor who actually lived in Scotland is John McDaniel, who was born in Scotland in around 1760. By 1776, he was living in Frederick County, Maryland. I myself have lived my whole life in the United States and have never even visited Scotland. I do not consider myself Scottish and instead consider myself only an American.</p>



<p>My only connection to my Scottish ancestry other than my last name is my hair, which is reddish blond. (The color changes somewhat depending on the light, so sometimes the blond is more evident and sometimes the red is more evident.) My mother is blond, so I’ve clearly inherited the blond in my hair from her. I know that I’ve inherited the red from the McDaniel line because my father and father’s father both have red in their beards and I have an aunt and four cousins on the McDaniel side who all have red hair.</p>



<p>It’s generally people like me who have some remote Scottish ancestry, but who are thoroughly removed from Scotland itself, that companies try to target with these fake title shenanigans. As it happens, I would personally make for a very poor target for this particular kind of shenanigan, since I am strongly opposed to all royal and noble titles. I firmly believe that such titles should not exist in any contemporary society that claims to be free and democratic. Nonetheless, I feel that I should try to make other people aware of the truth about this whole fake-title-selling charade.</p>

<p><strong>Why you can’t actually buy one square foot of land in Scotland</strong></p>



<p>Like Roman law, Scots law holds that real property ownership is absolute, meaning the owner of a piece of property owns all rights whatsoever to that property and they cannot transfer some rights to the piece of property to another person without transferring <em>all</em> the rights to it.</p>



<p>A sale of land in Scotland is only legal if it is officially registered with the Land Register and, in order to register a sale of land, the sale must abide by all the requirements of Scots law. As it happens, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/22/enacted/data.htm">Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012, Section 22</a>(1)(b), specifically prohibits the sale of “souvenir plots” of land, which Section 22(2) defines as follows:</p>



<blockquote><p>“In subsection (1)(b), ‘s<strong>ouvenir plot</strong>‘ means a plot of land which—</p><p>(a) is of inconsiderable size and of no practical utility, and</p><p>(b) is neither—</p><p>(i) a registered plot, nor</p><p>(ii) a plot the ownership of which has, at any time, separately been constituted or transferred by a document recorded in the Register of Sasines.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, it is not possible under current Scots law for anyone to transfer any form of legal ownership over a single square foot of land because such a plot of land “of inconsiderable size and no practical utility” obviously fits the legal definition of a “souvenir plot” and therefore cannot be registered with the Land Register of Scotland.</p>



<p>Because of this, companies that claim to “sell” souvenir plots of this kind will typically have a disclaimer somewhere saying that making a purchase with them does not imply any legal transfer of ownership and that they will merely “dedicate” a piece of land to the buyer, or some other similar wording.</p>



<p>These disclaimers sometimes use sneaky language that disguises or obfuscates what they are really saying. For instance, the company Scotland Title, which is owned by the larger corporation Highland Titles OU, has <a href="https://scotlandtitle.com/frequently-asked-questions/">a “Frequently Asked Questions” page </a>on their website, which lists the question “Must I register my land?” Here is their answer to that question:</p>



<blockquote><p>“No. You cannot register your land, because this is such a small plot; specifically it is defined as a ‘souvenir plot’.”</p><p>“‘Souvenir’ plots of land have been sold in Scotland for over 30 years. The sale of these plots is governed by the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979, recently revised as the Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012. Please note that this act does not permit souvenir plots of land to be added to the Land Register.”</p><p>“Details of your personal rights in your plot will be recorded in a Register of Land maintained by Highland Titles and details of each plot can be viewed online using our website.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, if you “buy” a souvenir plot of land from them, they will retain all legal ownership of the land. The land will never really be yours and they retain the right to “sell” that exact same plot of land to anyone else who happens to come along. (Highland Titles insists that they do not do this, but there is still absolutely nothing to stop them from doing it.)</p>



<p><strong>Why owning one square foot of land would not make you a “Scottish lord” anyway</strong></p>



<p>In the U.K., the U.S., Canada, Australia, and most other western countries, anyone can legally call themself anything they want, as long as they are not committing fraud or identity theft. Thus, in the same way that anyone can legally use the courtesy title of “doctor,” even though only some people actually possess the legal right to practice medicine, anyone can legally call themself a “lord” or “lady,” even though only some people possess the legal recognition, privileges, and protections associated with those titles.</p>



<p>In the United Kingdom, “lord” and “lady” are peerage titles, meaning a person can only hold the legal recognition, privileges, and protections associated with those titles if they rightfully inherit them, if they marry into a noble family, or if the queen grants them a peerage. Since the only hereditary peerages the queen has granted in decades have been to members of the royal family, realistically, the only ways a person can become a lord or lady are either by inheritance or by marrying into a noble family. It is not possible for someone to buy their way into lordship or ladyship.</p>



<p>Companies that sell souvenir plots with the claim of granting titles often rely on a conflation of the titles “lord” and “lady” with “laird,” which is<em> not</em> a peerage title, but rather solely a courtesy title akin to the English phrase “lord of the manor.” In Scotland, this title is traditionally applied to a member of the landed gentry who owns a large estate that has a long history and who generally has servants and tenants. Because “laird” is merely a courtesy title, it has no legal significance; there are no special privileges or protections under U.K. law for being a laird.</p>



<p>Although it is legal for anyone to call themself a “laird,” merely owning some small amount of land in Scotland does not actually <em>make</em> someone a laird. In order to actually be a laird, a person must own a large estate with a long history. It is possible to buy one’s way into lairdship, but one has to buy a whole heck of a lot more than just one square foot of land. If you want to do it, you’ll have to buy an entire historic Scottish mansion.</p>



<p>One example of a person who has become a laird is the British novelist J. K. Rowling, who is best known as both the author of the bestselling series of children’s novels <em>Harry Potter</em> and also arguably the most influential proponent of transphobia in the English-speaking world today. In 2001, having become outlandishly wealthy through the success of the first four <em>Harry Potter</em> novels, Rowling purchased the sprawling, historic country estate of Killiechassie, located on the bank of the River Tay near the town of Weem in the historic county of Perthshire, Scotland.</p>



<p>The Killiechassie estate dates at least as far back as the twelfth century CE, but the current mansion on the property was built in 1865. A columbarium (i.e., a building meant to house pigeons or doves) on the estate grounds is a Category B listed structure, which means that it is officially recognized as a major historic monument. The estate itself is so famous and historically important that it even has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killiechassie">its own article on Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to owning Killiechassie, Rowling also owns a very large seventeenth-century mansion in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, which is surrounded by enormous thirty-foot Leylandii hedges. The city of Edinburgh has to close the entire road in front of Rowling’s mansion every year or so in order for her hedges to be trimmed. This inevitably results in traffic chaos and is frequently reported in both local and national news outlets.</p>



<p>On account of her ownership of these large, historic properties, Rowling can accurately describe herself as a “laird.”</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Aerial photograph showing the exterior of the historic Scottish country estate Killiechassie, which is currently owned by J. K. Rowling</em></p>



<p>Before the twentieth century, upper-middle-class landowners in Scotland who owned and cultivated rural estates that were smaller than those of true lairds, but that were still of a significant size, were informally known as “bonnet lairds.” This appellation is roughly equivalent to the term “yeoman” in English parlance, signifying a person who is of a social and economic status just beneath that of the landed gentry or true lairds.</p>



<p>The phrase “bonnet laird” is etymologically derived from the fact that, in Scotland before the twentieth century, such small-time landowners often still wore bonnets, a kind of hat that was associated with the lower classes and not with the landed gentry.</p>



<p>Although this term is largely historical and is seldom used nowadays, one could at least argue that people who own smaller estates in Scotland may still accurately call themselves “bonnet lairds” and that becoming one may be easier than becoming a laird proper. Being a bonnet laird, though, would still require someone to own a house and a significant plot of land in Scotland. Merely owning one square foot of land obviously would not qualify someone for the title.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Huber_zugeschr.%2C_Peter_David_St%C3%BCrler.JPG/405px-Huber_zugeschr.%2C_Peter_David_St%C3%BCrler.JPG?20140610073757" alt="" width="550"/></figure></div>



<p><em>ABOVE: Portrait painted c. 1720, attributed to the Swiss painter Johann Rudolf Huber, showing Peter David Stürler, a citizen of Glasgow, wearing traditional Scottish clothing, including a bonnet, the kind of hat from which the “bonnet lairds” of premodern rural Scotland took their informal name</em></p>



<p>Many companies that claim to “sell” souvenir plots of land conveying titles have disclaimers somewhere in which they explain that fake ownership of a souvenir plot of land does not actually grant someone a true title of nobility. For instance, Scotland Title’s “Frequently Asked Questions” page lists the question “How can you sell me a title?” with the following answer:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We cannot sell you a title. We are simply acknowledging your right to use the title of Laird, Lord or Lady of Glencoe, which is trademarked by HT. If you prefer not to assume a title, you will be given that option when you make your land purchase. Advice published by Scottish Solicitors is ‘in Scotland anyone can, subject to requirements of good faith, call themselves whatever they like, including “Laird”, “Lord” or “Lady”.’ We do not know of any jurisdiction where this is not true.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, they don’t actually sell real titles.</p>



<p><strong>Scottish Prescriptive Baronies by Tenure: the only genuine U.K. titles of nobility that can be bought and sold</strong></p>



<p>There is only one kind of genuine, legally recognized title of nobility in the U.K. that can be bought and sold, which is a Scottish Prescriptive Barony by Tenure. Until 2004, a Scottish barony was defined by ownership of a <em>caput</em> (i.e., a castle or estate that a Crown Charter had erected into a barony). In 2004, however, the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 abolished the system of feudal land tenure, which resulted in major changes to how Scottish baronies work.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/63">Section 63</a>(1) of the act declares that ownership of a caput no longer conveys a barony, but stipulates “nothing in this Act affects the dignity of baron or any other dignity or office (whether or not of feudal origin).” Section 63(2) further stipulates:</p>



<blockquote><p>“When, by this Act, an estate held in barony ceases to exist as a feudal estate, the dignity of baron, though retained, shall not attach to the land; and on and after the appointed day any such dignity shall be, and shall be transferable only as, incorporeal heritable property (and shall not be a right as respects which a deed can be registered in the Land Register of Scotland or recorded in the Register of Sasines).”</p></blockquote>



<p>This means that titles of Scottish Prescriptive Baron by Tenure can now be freely bought and sold independent of the real properties to which those titles were once attached.</p>



<p>Genuine Scottish baronies, however, only come up for sale very rarely and, when they do, they always end up selling for the equivalent of many tens of thousands of dollars at least. They are well outside the price range of what any person who is not already a member of the top 1% can afford.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Photograph <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ayton_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_813849.jpg">from Wikimedia Commons</a> showing Ayton Castle in the Scottish Borders, built in 1851, the traditional caput of the Scottish barony of Ayton</em></p>



<p><strong>What about the whole “nature reserve” thing?</strong></p>



<p>Some companies that “sell” souvenir plots in Scotland, such as Highland Titles, claim that they maintain the land they use for souvenir plots as a “nature reserve” and that, by “buying” a souvenir plot from them, you are helping to restore and preserve the natural environment of Scotland.</p>



<p>The European news network Euronews, however, conducted an investigation into Highland Titles and their purported “nature reserves” and published their findings in <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/04/21/the-dark-side-of-fake-scottish-titles-an-inside-look-at-the-plots-of-land-being-gifted-to-">a news article earlier this year</a>. The news article notes that, although Highland Titles does indeed own multiple nature reserves, the company has never disclosed their finances and it is not clear how much of the apparently vast money they bring in actually goes toward conservation efforts. The article also quotes an anonymous source at a major non-government organization in Scotland as saying:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The environment sector in Scotland generally does not hold a high opinion of the work carried out by Highland Titles. But their reputation for running to court means that people don’t feel comfortable speaking out. Scots with a wider cultural awareness find the whole proposition of selling titles ludicrous and insulting. As you would find with any brief trawl through social media on the subject.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, it is actually not clear to what extent, if at all, the “purchase” of a souvenir plot from Highland Titles or any of the various other companies in the business actually contributes to nature restoration and conservation work. Moreover, the actual quality of this work is very much in doubt.</p>
