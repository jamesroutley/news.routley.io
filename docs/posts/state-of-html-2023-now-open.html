<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> the brand new State of HTML survey is finally open!</p>
<p><a href="https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023/?source=leaverou" target="_blank">Take State of HTML 2023 Survey</a></p>
<p>Benefits to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey results are <strong>used by browsers to prioritize roadmaps</strong> ‚Äî the reason Google is funding this.
Time spent thoughtfully filling them out is an investment that can come back to you tenfold
in the form of seeing features you care about implemented, browser incompatibilities being prioritized, and gaps in the platform being addressed.</li>
<li>Learn about new and upcoming features you may have missed</li>
<li>Get a personalized score and see how you compare to other respondents</li>
<li>Learn about the latest trends in the ecosystem and what other developers are focusing on</li>
</ul>

<p>This is likely the most ambitious <a href="https://www.devographics.com/">Devographics</a> survey to date.
For <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/design-state-of-html/">the past couple of months</a>, I‚Äôve been hard at work leading a small product team spread across three continents (2am to 8am became my second work shift üòÖ).
We embarked on this mission with some uncertainty about whether there were <em>enough</em> features for a State of HTML survey,
but quickly found ourselves with the opposite problem:
there were too many, all with good reasons for inclusion!
To help weigh the tradeoffs and decide what makes the cut we consulted both <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/discussions/categories/state-of-html-2023-features?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22State+of+HTML+2023+Features%22+sort%3Atop">the developer community</a>,
as well as stakeholders across browsers, standards groups, community groups, and more.</p>
<p>We even designed new UI controls to facilitate collecting the types of complex data that were needed without making the questions too taxing,
and did original UX research to validate them.
Once the dust settles, I plan to write separate blog posts about some of these.</p>
<h2 id="faq" tabindex="-1"><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<h3 id="can-i-edit-my-responses%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#can-i-edit-my-responses%3F">Can I edit my responses?</a></h3>
<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong> Do not worry about filling it out perfectly in one go.
If you create an account, you can edit your responses for the whole period the survey is open, and even split filling it out across multiple devices (e.g. start on your phone, then fill out some on your desktop, etc.)
Even if you‚Äôre filling it out anonymously, you can still edit responses on your device for a while.
You could even start anonymously and create an account later, and your responses will be preserved (the only issue is filling it out anonymously, then logging in with an existing account).</p>
<p>So, perhaps the call to action above should be‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="why-are-there-js-questions-in-an-html-survey%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#why-are-there-js-questions-in-an-html-survey%3F">Why are there JS questions in an HTML survey?</a></h3>
<p>For the same reason there are JS APIs in the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">HTML standard</a>:
many JS APIs are intrinsically related to HTML.
We mainly included JS APIs in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIs used to manipulate HTML dynamically (DOM, form validation, etc.)</li>
<li>Web Components APIs, used to create custom HTML elements</li>
<li>APIs used to create web apps that feel like native apps (e.g. Service Workers, Web App Manifest, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don‚Äôt write any JS, we absolutely still want to hear from you!
In fact, I would encourage you to fill out the survey <strong>even more</strong>: we need to hear from folks who don‚Äôt write JS, as they are often underrepresented.
Please feel free to skip any JS-related questions (all questions are optional anyway) or select that you have never heard these features.
There is a question at the end, where you can select that you only write HTML/CSS:</p>

<h3 id="is-the-survey-only-available-in-english%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#is-the-survey-only-available-in-english%3F">Is the survey only available in English?</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely not! Localization has been an integral part of these surveys since the beginning.
Fun fact: Nobody in the core <a href="#acknowledgements">State of HTML team</a> is a native English speaker.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/languages.png" alt="Screenshot showing dozens of languages"/></p>
<figcaption>
<p>Each survey gets (at least partially) translated to over 30 languages.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, since translations are a community effort, they are not necessarily complete, especially in the beginning.
If you are a native speaker of a language that is not yet complete, please consider <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/locale-en-US">helping out</a>!</p>
<h3 id="why-is-my-score-lower-than-i-expected%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#why-is-my-score-lower-than-i-expected%3F">Why is my score lower than I expected?</a></h3>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/my-score.png" alt="80% score, 105/131 heard or used"/></p>
<figcaption>
<p>If it makes you feel better, this was my own score, and I <em>created</em> the darn survey üòÖ
Our engineer, <a href="https://sachagreif.com/">Sacha</a> who is also the founder of <a href="https://www.devographics.com/">Devographics</a> got 19%!</p>

<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It asks about <em>a lot</em> of cutting edge features, more than the other surveys.
As I mentioned above, we had a lot of difficult tradeoffs to make,
and had to cut a ton of features that were otherwise a great fit.
We err‚Äôed on the side of more cutting edge features, as those are the areas the survey can help make the most difference in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>To save on space, and be able to ask about more features, we used a new compact format for some of the more stable features, which only asks about usage, not awareness.
Here is an example from the first section of the survey (Forms):
<img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/form-validation.png" alt="Form validation question screenshot"/>
This has the downside that features you do know about but haven‚Äôt used do not count towards the final score.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/discussions/217">exploring ways to improve this experience</a>, such as displaying a rank among other respondents,
and/or displaying separate usage and awareness scores that combine to form the overall score.</p>
