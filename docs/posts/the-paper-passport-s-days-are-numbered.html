    <h1>The paper passport&#39;s days are numbered</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>In a matter of years, no matter where you live or travel, your face will likely be your new passport.</p><p>For centuries, people have used some form of passport while moving from place to place. But the widespread standardization of passports as we know them today didn’t really begin until after <a data-offer-url="https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/portalfiles/portal/36018821/WP19_Kalm.pdf" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/portalfiles/portal/36018821/WP19_Kalm.pdf&#34;}" href="https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/portalfiles/portal/36018821/WP19_Kalm.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">World War 1</a>, when passports were commonly used as a security measure and to deter spies entering a country. Even then, <a data-offer-url="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/passport-question" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/passport-question&#34;}" href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/passport-question" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">some considered</a> passports to be an “anachronism in the modern world.”</p><p>But the use of paper passports—which were first <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-border-patrol-epassport-verification/">digitized as “e-Passports” with NFC chips in 2006</a>—is slowly undergoing one of its biggest transformations to date. The travel industry, airports, and governments are working to remove the need to show your passport while flying internationally. Eventually, you may not need to carry your passport at all.</p><p>Instead, face recognition technology and smartphones are increasingly being used to check and confirm your identity against travel details before you can fly. These systems, advocates claim, can reduce the amount of waiting time and “friction” you experience at airports. But privacy experts caution that there is little transparency about the technologies being deployed, and their proliferation could lead to data breaches and greater levels of surveillance.</p><p>The push to remove paper passports is happening worldwide. So far, airports in Finland, <a data-offer-url="https://www.klm.ca/information/travel-documents/travel-canada/dtc-pilot" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.klm.ca/information/travel-documents/travel-canada/dtc-pilot&#34;}" href="https://www.klm.ca/information/travel-documents/travel-canada/dtc-pilot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Canada</a>, the Netherlands, the <a data-offer-url="https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/you-may-soon-be-able-to-board-flights-at-abu-dhabi-airport-without-a-passport-and-ticket-101725004066448.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/you-may-soon-be-able-to-board-flights-at-abu-dhabi-airport-without-a-passport-and-ticket-101725004066448.html&#34;}" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/you-may-soon-be-able-to-board-flights-at-abu-dhabi-airport-without-a-passport-and-ticket-101725004066448.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">United Arab Emirates</a>, the United Kingdom, <a data-offer-url="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2023/11/06/iata-trials-first-fully-integrated-digital-identity-travel-experience/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2023/11/06/iata-trials-first-fully-integrated-digital-identity-travel-experience/&#34;}" href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2023/11/06/iata-trials-first-fully-integrated-digital-identity-travel-experience/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Italy</a>, the United States, <a data-offer-url="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/india-to-pilot-digi-yatra-for-foreign-nationals-in-2025" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/india-to-pilot-digi-yatra-for-foreign-nationals-in-2025&#34;}" href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/india-to-pilot-digi-yatra-for-foreign-nationals-in-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">India</a>, and elsewhere have been trialing various levels of passport-free travel or the technology needed to make it happen. In October, officials in Singapore <a data-offer-url="https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/newsroom/media-release/passport-less-clearance-fully-rolled-out-at-changi-airport#:~:text=Since%2030%20September%202024%2C%20the,need%20to%20present%20their%20passport." data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/newsroom/media-release/passport-less-clearance-fully-rolled-out-at-changi-airport#:~:text=Since%2030%20September%202024%2C%20the,need%20to%20present%20their%20passport.&#34;}" href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/newsroom/media-release/passport-less-clearance-fully-rolled-out-at-changi-airport#:~:text=Since%2030%20September%202024%2C%20the,need%20to%20present%20their%20passport." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that its residents can fly to and from the country without using their documentation, and foreign visitors can “enjoy the convenience of passport-less clearance when they depart Singapore.” More than 1.5 million people have used the systems, officials claim.</p><p>“It’s probably going to become the mainstream way of traveling, as I understand, in the near future,” says Athina Ioannou, a lecturer in business analytics at the University of Surrey in the UK, who has researched the privacy implications that come with different types of travel. Ioannou says the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated contact-free travel, and many efforts are driven by trying to get passengers moving quickly through airports.</p><p>While trials around the world are at different stages and use different technical infrastructure, they broadly work in similar ways: Information historically stored in your passport’s NFC chip, including facial data, is instead stored digitally and linked to your phone. The EU is planning to build an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5047">official travel app</a> for this. When you are at an airport, the phone can be shown, and a face recognition camera will try to match you to the passport photo.</p></div></div></div></div>
