<p>Home Assistant 2023.11! üéÉ</p>
<p>It seems like I forgot to come up with a release title for this release and left
a placeholder in the title. If I only could have it on a to-do list somewhere‚Ä¶ ü§î</p>
<p>Before we dive into this pretty massive release, I want to quickly look back
at two amazing things that happened in the past month.</p>
<p>First, we presented <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/12/year-of-the-voice-chapter-4-wakewords/">chapter 4 of the Year of the Voice</a>,
which introduced the new wake word feature in Home Assistant. This really
brings the voice assistant experience to the next level, and we are super
excited about it! Like have you seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7Hmeume9g" rel="external nofollow">R5-based voice assistant droid</a>? üòç</p>
<p>Second, we had a security audit performed on Home Assistant by one of the top
security auditors in the world! You can read all about it in the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/19/security-audits-of-home-assistant/">blog post</a>.
A big shout out to everybody subscribed to <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com" rel="external nofollow">Home Assistant Cloud</a>,
as you enable us to do these things! ü•∞</p>
<p>Alright, about this release! It is huge! I love the tile card, and the ability
to easily customize the information it shows now is just. ü§© But mostly, I‚Äôm
super stoked about the new to-do lists, which will probably become a very
central part of my household.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>
<a name="there-is-a-lot-to-do" href="#there-is-a-lot-to-do"></a> There is a lot to-do!</h2>
<p>There are many things to do in our lives, which is what
<a href="https://github.com/allenporter" rel="external nofollow">@allenporter</a> realized too! We now have a new entity type
in Home Assistant: <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/todo">To-do list entities</a>!</p>
<p>A to-do list entity represents a list of tasks, and its state is the amount of
uncompleted tasks that are still open. You can create one or more (fully local)
to-do lists and view and manage them by selecting the new <strong>To-do lists</strong>
item in the sidebar.</p>
<img src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/blog/2023-11/todo-local.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new to-do lists dashboard, where you can manage multiple to-do lists and even create new ones."/>
<p>Besides the entities, there are also new services available allowing you
to automate on your to-do lists as well. Use automations to create, complete, or
clean up tasks on your to-do lists.</p>
<p>So, what can you do with all of this? A lot! For example, you can create
a to-do list for your groceries, automate a list of house chores for your kids
or other household members, or automatically put a task on a list to replace
the batteries of a sensor when it is low. You could even send a push notification
to your phone when you are near the home improvement store and have items on
a to-do list that you need to buy there.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://github.com/allenporter" rel="external nofollow">@allenporter</a>, and everyone involved, for this amazing addition to
Home Assistant! We can now check this one off from our wishlist! ‚úî</p>
<h2>
<a name="shopping-lists-are-now-to-dos-too" href="#shopping-lists-are-now-to-dos-too"></a> Shopping lists are now to-do‚Äôs too!</h2>
<p>These to-do lists look a lot like the shopping list, right? Correct!</p>
<p>They are very much alike, and that is why we have moved the shopping list
to a to-do list as well! Once you upgrade to this release, your existing
shopping list will be automatically converted to a to-do list.</p>
<img src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/blog/2023-11/todo-shopping-list.png" alt="Screenshot showing the shopping list, which now is a to-do list."/>
<p>But that is not all; we also updated the <strong>Shopping list</strong> card for your
dashboards, now fittingly named <strong>To-do list card</strong>, to support multiple
to-do lists. You can now select which to-do list you want to show on the card
you‚Äôve put in your dashboard.</p>
<img src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/blog/2023-11/todo-list-card.png" alt="Screenshot showing configuration of a to-do list card, that allows selecting the to-do list to display."/>
<h2>
<a name="integrations-providing-your-to-dos" href="#integrations-providing-your-to-dos"></a> Integrations providing your to-dos</h2>
<p>But wait! There is more besides local to-do lists and shopping lists.
Now that we have a to-do list entity, we can also start using it with other
integrations that, for example, can get your to-do lists from an external service.</p>
<p>As of this release, you can bring in your <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/todoist">Todoist</a> and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_tasks">Google Tasks</a>
to-do lists to Home Assistant as well!</p>
<p>This is awesome, as it brings all these to-do lists together in one place, and
above all, provides you with the power of Home Assistant to automate on them.</p>
<h2>
<a name="matter-12-is-here" href="#matter-12-is-here"></a> Matter 1.2 is here!</h2>
<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance has launched
<a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-2-arrives-with-nine-new-device-types-improvements-across-the-board/" rel="external nofollow">version 1.2 of the Matter specification</a>,
together with a new version of the Official Matter SDK, which is not only
prepared for new device types but also contains all kinds of smaller
stability- and bug fixes.</p>
