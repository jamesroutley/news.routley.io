    <h1>Carl Braun on communicating like a grown-up (2016)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>“Man is a gregarious animal. We work in herds, in teams. The bear can do exactly as he pleases, for he works alone. We do not work alone. We depend throughout our lives on the goodwill of other men. If a man does not learn to bend, to be friendly and considerate, and to respect his brother’s ego—in things both big and little—he’ll find himself disliked and locked up in his own unhappiness.”</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Carl Franklin (C.F.) Braun</strong> graduated from Stanford with an engineering degree in 1907 and within two years had opened his own engineering firm. Braun’s company would go on to manufacture and engineer products ranging from water filters to petroleum processing plants; large, complicated projects involving manpower and precision. He eventually employed 6,000 people and built over 250 petrochemical plants, well respected as the leader in his field for many years.</p>
<p>Braun had a unique corporate policy: If you were going to issue a directive, you had to tell the person Who, What, When, Where, and most importantly, <em>Why</em> someone was to do it. So strong was his belief in using <em>why,</em><em> </em>it was said that Braun could fire you on the spot if he found you not issuing reasons. Many years later, Charlie Munger would come to sing Braun’s praises, in his talk on <a href="https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/"><em>The Psychology of Human Misjudgment</em></a>, for this approach to <strong>Reason-Respecting Tendency</strong>.</p>
<p>One of Braun’s approaches to maintaining a productive corporate environment was by writing and issuing short books to all of his employees. They had barn-burning titles like <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013GL5DG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0013GL5DG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=farnamstreet-20&amp;linkId=43UI6RKTGUI3KB6I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letter Writing in Action</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007F8IKM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0007F8IKM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=farnamstreet-20&amp;linkId=SYHH3ZTBLYU4VLZS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corporate Correspondence</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1258034999/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1258034999&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=farnamstreet-20&amp;linkId=SG32GIDRPH647HCS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presentation for Engineers and Industrialists</a></em>. They’re all out of print, but you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1258137666/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1258137666&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=farnamstreet-20&amp;linkId=QFEPUWW6UPIDERF2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find them if you look</a>. And look we did.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007FH452/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0007FH452&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=farnamstreet-20&amp;linkId=36DB6TMCNH7VGIII" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fair Thought and Speech</a></em>; it’s a short primer on <strong>how to communicate in an organization in a way that gains and keeps respect and gets people to go along with good ideas and work together productively</strong>. It’s a simple idea, but Braun lays out the task:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t I get along better? I know my work. I know how to present things clearly and logically. I work hard. And yet, something holds me back. This is the quandary of many and many a capable man. The answer too often is that he lacks a generous and kindly way of thinking, a considerate and objective view, and a friendly way of writing and speaking.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s more here than meets the eye. Braun saw the way a man communicated as reflective of how he <em>thought</em>.</p>
<p>Get a man to write and speak more objectively, and you get him to think more objectively. Braun was focused, above all, on <strong>what worked</strong>. He needed to get complicated oil refineries built, and built well. He was also an astute student of human nature, and that comes across in his writing. It’s the simplest and most straightforward writing style imaginable; short, declarative statements one after another. (He studied his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020530902X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=020530902X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=farnamstreet-20&amp;linkId=T6HHPLLUP2WPUTJW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strunk &amp; White</a>.) But he’s also witty and to the point, which is enjoyable to read.</p>

<p><strong>These are really a guide to communicating and working with others like a mature grown-up</strong>. Like a man. Like a woman. Not like a petulant child, which we all do at times.</p>
<p>We won’t reprint the whole of the book here, but here are some of our favorite dictums from Braun. I try to look them over once in a while and see which ones I’m committing most frequently.</p>
<p><em>Assume Good Motives</em></p>
<blockquote><p>No matter how clear and fair a case may seem to us, somebody is apt to disagree. And this is good, for we need the stimulation of disagreement. Let’s question his information, his reasoning, his conclusions — but never his motives. If we start assuming or imputing ill motives, we lose all chance of influencing our listener. But even worse, we degrade ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Remind, Not Tell</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Even if we are sure somebody had overlooked a bet, or is overlooking it, let’s tender our advice as though we are reminding him of something that he had intended to do, but that something else has crowded out. Let’s lean over backwards in giving to others the credit for ideas. This is the generous thing. It’s the thing that wins respect, both for us and for our ideas.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Put Error to Work</em></p>
<blockquote><p>But let’s never, never, cover up error with the misguided thought that we must protect someone — either our brother, or our department, or our own pet ego. The recognition of error and its examination, if openly talked of, is a sure way to avoid its being repeated, either by the same man or by others. Everyone errs at one time or another. <strong>The Company pays for it. Okay. But the Company should not have to pay twice. </strong>Nor should other men be denied the benefit of warning-signs.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Overt Respect</em></p>
<blockquote><p>In all this matter of respect for others, of consideration, tolerance, interest, it is not enough that we feel these things. They cannot be effective if we carry them about locked up within us. We must plainly show them in word, in expression, in countenance, in bearing, in act. We cannot help others, encourage them, or be understood by them, or get willing help from them, if we leave them to guess at our thoughts and intentions.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Invite Acceptance</em></p>
<blockquote><p>If we want our opinions or beliefs to be accepted, the worst thing that we can do is to press too hard for them, or to make a personal issue of them. <strong>Better not crowd for acceptance, but rather invite it.</strong> Better tender our advice with a softening <em>It seems to me. </em>Or an <em>It appears.</em> Or a <em>Perhaps.</em> Or with some similar concession to the ideas of our listener. True, there are times when we must speak as authorities in no uncertain terms. Even then, reasonable humility is seldom amiss.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Easy Does It</em></p>
<blockquote><p>If we want to observe how others feel about being rushed, or crowded, or pushed into a corner, just look at a pet of any kind, or at a child. Try to make friends with one of these by being forceful, abrupt, intense. The child will run. The dog will bristle. The cat will jump up on a rafter. Better place yourself or your wares where they can be seen. Then lay off. <strong>Give interest, curiosity, and natural friendliness, a chance to work. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Grudging Assent</em></p>
<blockquote><p>And when we do give assent (to others), let’s give it cheerfully. No moaning because we lost out. No suggesting that other people are unreasonable, or that they do not understand us. No intimating that we are merely out-argued. <strong>We had our fair chance to speak up like a man. No hinting, then, that we merely bow to higher authority.</strong> We must all bow to higher authority — to weightier considerations perhaps, or to expediency, or to public opinion, or to our client. If we are stiff-necked about it, we are on the road to ruin.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Writing for the Record</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Some men have an irresistible desire to justify their every action. Some like to magnify themselves. Others like to provide an alibi ready for use if needed. Some, perhaps, just don’t think. In any event, they write a letter to some other department or to the boss. The letter first tells how much the writer or his group are doing. Then it puts the finger on others. <strong>Just write a few letters like this with plenty of copies sent around, and you’ll dig a grave you’ll never get out of.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Unwise Citing</em></p>
<blockquote><p>We have all been approached at some time or other by the Unwise Citer. He asks us to take some action, or refrain from one, solely because certain other people have done so under supposedly like circumstances. The citer, lacking good arguments, has sought to substitute secondhand opinions. <strong>This is unfair. It is not helpful. And it directly assaults our ego.</strong> We are not given credit for having brains and judgment of our own. Bad stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Air of Prejudice</em></p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t have to use words, either, to be unfair. Did you have to sit in court and listen to a prejudiced witness? He’s too intense. He’s too vehement. Quite evidently, he’s not satisfied with stating the facts as he knows them. No, sir! He’s out to prove the other fellow wrong. Result — nobody pays attention to him. Well, let’s be sure when we sit around a conference-table, we’re not like him. Better state our facts clearly, or our views. But let’s not be too anxious. <strong>Let’s not try to push either judge or jury. It doesn’t work.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Negation</em></p>
<blockquote><p>We all know the chap who is quick to tell us when we are wrong. He probably doesn’t know too much about the subject himself, and hasn’t the confidence to take a positive position. His ego prods him into a negative one. He corrects us with great assurance on the tuning of radios, on the eating of spinach, on other matters of opinion. <strong>Let’s feel sorry for his difficulty with his ego. But let’s be sure first, that we’re not perhaps a wee bit like him.</strong> We always are.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Refinement</em></p>
<blockquote><p>A somewhat more subtle form of negation, is refinement of measurement. One man says that a tank weights ninety tons. And for that particular discussion, accuracy is of no consequence. Yet someone’s ego speaks up and says, Ninety-two tons. <strong>Maybe he’s right at that. But he’s wrong just the same.</strong> […] This is a favorite husband-and-wife game. Let’s be on guard against it.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Claim-Jumping</em></p>
<blockquote><p>One irritating form of pretending is that of claiming priority. Someone suggests a desirable precaution, or action, or change. Up jumps our ego. We had thought of that, we say. We’d intended to do it tomorrow. Maybe we had. Maybe we hadn’t, though — for our imagination at times plays strange tricks on us. In any event, we didn’t come up with it first. We’d better keep quiet, or we’ll surely be suspected of bluffing.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Repetition</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Here is an easy trap to fall into. Someone comes out with an idea. It sounds good to us. Our ego grabs hold of it, dresses it in slightly different language, and puts the idea out as our own. We act as though we’d independently arrived at the same conclusion. Maybe so, maybe not — for we cannot trust our memories as to when we first thought a thing, or what it was that started the train of thought. <strong>Let’s restrain our egos from grabbing credit. All we wind up with is discredit.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>All-Knowing</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The worst trick our ego can play on us, is to demand that we know everything.</strong> Let’s discipline ourselves until it’s easy to say, I don’t know. And let’s keep out of discussions when they’re on subjects outside of our recognized sphere. Our lack of real knowledge and experience is bound to display itself, and bring resentment from those who are really qualified to speak. Let’s slap our ego down whenever it starts laying claim to knowledge that’s too various.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Don’t Beg</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Another thing. Don’t beg. People don’t like it.</strong> If then we speak up for some better job that’s open, let’s not till our talk with such words as <em>hoping, thanking, eagerly, favor</em>. If we are really worthy of the job, the Company will benefit by giving it to us every bit as much as we will profit by getting it. The thing works both ways. Why then use begging words that suggest we are thinking of ourselves, not of the Company? And why suggest that we’re not too confident in our ability?</p></blockquote>
<p><em>He’s Partly Right at Least</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>With our eye on our brother’s ego, we’ll see that concession is the very cornerstone of good human relations.</strong> We cannot reach human agreements without mutual concession. The self-respect that every man feels impelled to maintain, demands that he appear at least partly right. Therefore, let’s not ever try to prove anyone wholly wrong. Let’s find something herein we can feel that he’s right. Then let’s say so. We simply must not build up our own ego at any unnecessary expense of our brother’s ego. Let’s keep an eye on concession.</p></blockquote>
