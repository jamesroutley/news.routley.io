    <h1>Top science fiction short stories published in August</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
It&#39;s that time of month again — the random time when I belatedly put out reviews and choose favorites from two months ago. Here are my top picks for the month of August! These are the top 5 out of the 26 stories I read. August was a lighter month than July because some of the bimonthlies aren&#39;t out in August:

<ol>
        <li><b><i><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/vaughn_08_22/">Polly and (Not) Charles Conquer the Solar System</a></i></b>, by Carrie Vaughn (published by clarkesworldmagazine.com)</li>
        <li><b><i><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/oreilly_08_22/">Pollatomish</a></i></b>, by Finbarr O’Reilly (published by clarkesworldmagazine.com)</li>
        <li><b><i><a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/my-future-self-refused/">My Future Self, Refused</a></i></b>, by Adam-Troy Castro (published by www.lightspeedmagazine.com)</li>
        <li><b><i><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/balder_08_22/">The Pirate&#39;s Consigliere</a></i></b>, by Bo Balder (published by clarkesworldmagazine.com)</li>
        <li><b><i><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02769-7">Selected reviews of the Repro-Pro Artificial Womb</a></i></b>, by Kara Lee (published by www.nature.com)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
So <b><i>Polly and (Not) Charles Conquer the Solar System</i></b> by Carrie Vaughn is our winner for August! Martian politics, spaceship crews working together, a sibling kidnapped, and some allusions to some interesting economics made this story unique and thought-provoking.
</p>
<p><b><i>Pollatomish</i></b> by by Finbarr O’Reilly was a close second for the month of August. Starting a story with an act of terrorism tends to seize the attention, as long as you can follow it up with a strong plot and good characterizations. I&#39;m always interested in stories that have details about economic systems, and I&#39;d have been interested in even more details here.
</p>
<p><b><i>My Future Self, Refused</i></b>, by Adam-Troy Castro was an intense look at a science fiction author who has seen more than his share of hard times. It was not a pleasant story, but it was a compelling story — the emotion was raw in a way that you don&#39;t often see from SF shorts.
</p>
<p><b><i>The Pirate&#39;s Consigliere</i></b>, by Bo Balder was — let&#39;s face it — driven by outrageous violence. It was fun though, and the main character was a believable version of a person doing their best in a brutal culture. I love culture-clash stories, and this was a good one.
</p>
<p><b><i>Selected reviews of the Repro-Pro Artificial Womb</i></b>, by Kara Lee isn&#39;t a story in the classical sense, but it did a great job of building a world using the modern epistolary approach of product reviews. It&#39;s tiny and fun, go take a look!
</p>
<p>
As always I want to point out that the magazines that publish these stories operate on a shoestring budget and immense amounts of passion, and if you&#39;ve been meaning to get a subscription to support their work you should go do it right now!
</p>
<p>
And I have a favor to ask. I&#39;m mostly reading Clarkesworld, Analog, Lightspeed, tor.com, and Nature Futures, with some other browsing, so I know I&#39;ll miss a good hard SF story here and there. If you run across a short story outside those magazines for September/October that you&#39;d think fits the Compelling Science Fiction ethos, please send it to me! If it gets on my top list I&#39;ll call you out in that month&#39;s post, and you will have my gratitude. And if you think there are other hard SF magazines I should be reading cover-to-cover let me know that too!

Shirts for the Compelling Science Fiction Appreciation Award are in production! The design that won from last month&#39;s poll is above. I&#39;m excited to start wearing that astronaut. I&#39;ll be sending one of these shirts to the winner of the CSF appreciation award every month. I&#39;m not putting them up on a web store or anything, but for you readers who subscribe here and live in the US I&#39;ll mail you one if you paypal $30 to <a href="https://paypal.me/compellingsf">https://paypal.me/compellingsf</a>. Sorry for the high price point, manufacturing and shipping were higher than normal on these. If you&#39;re outside the country and really want one send me a note and I&#39;ll get a quote for shipping. I didn&#39;t print very many this time around, so it&#39;s first come first served. They should go out in November sometime. Take care everyone, I&#39;ll be getting the September reviews up soon.
