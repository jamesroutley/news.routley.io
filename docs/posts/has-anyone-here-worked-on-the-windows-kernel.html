    <h1>Ask HN: Has anyone here worked on the Windows kernel?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Or any other kernel, professionally?<p>I&#39;ve been offered a position at Microsoft to do kernel development work. This would be a big transition to me, coming from a services background (backend only).</p><p>The job&#39;s main draw to me is doing low-level work. I did some in my very first job, but for the past 10+ years, due to a number of circumstances, I&#39;ve been in the services world. I really liked being a C programmer and I&#39;ve kept an eye on things over the years, and did some hobby projects (on x86 and some embedded stuff as well).</p><p>There&#39;s a lot about my current job that I treasure, despite the work itself not being interesting to me about 99% of the time. It&#39;s a remote job, the work-life balance is stellar, and I get 25 days of vacation a year (this is in the US), which allows me to spend a lot of quality time with my wife.</p><p>However, I&#39;m considering leaving because I&#39;ve been having significant motivation and performance[0] issues for the last two years. Through a lot of soul searching and even help from a therapist, I&#39;ve identified that the source of my issues is the nature of the work itself. Building services is just something that doesn&#39;t give me a sense of accomplishment, and I&#39;m not attracted to the stuff at all. Some issues I&#39;ve identified are:</p><p>1. Infrastructure complexity, especially since moving to Kubernetes. I refuse to touch it at this point.</p><p>2. Debugging exclusively via metrics and logs, since I can&#39;t just attach a debugger to a running server.</p><p>3. Designing systems in general. Some people love the challenge of distributed transactions, eventual consistency and all that jazz, but it just rubs my brain the wrong way. I&#39;m not interested at all in that problem space [1].</p><p>4. The insane amount of work required to stand up even the smallest microservice: infrastructure provisioning, certificates, security reviews, GDPR compliance, etc.</p><p>5. Anything I build will end up paging some poor soul at 3am some day when something is down or under heavy traffic.</p><p>So, what I&#39;m wondering is: what are the things that would make me say &#34;ugh&#34; on the day-to-day as a kernel developer? Is there a chance I&#39;ll be happier, or would I just be trading one miserable set of problems for other equally miserable problems?</p><p>I tried asking that to every person who interviewed me, but I only got somewhat vague answers like &#34;the build can take a long time depending on what you&#39;re doing&#34;, etc. Someone complained about windbg.</p><p>[0] Even though my reviews have been good, I know deep inside I&#39;m not doing even 10% of the good work I could do before.</p><p>[1] Ironically, I&#39;ve acquired a ton of knowledge about it and I&#39;m one of the &#34;go to&#34; people within my org.</p></div></div>
