           Beneath the utilitarian purpose of computation, computing is also a <a href="https://arbesman.substack.com/p/the-magic-of-code">source of delight and wonder</a>. Software is not just databases and mail merges or SaaS and spreadsheets; it&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding">creative coding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">simulated cities</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_poetry">code poetry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">bulletin board systems</a>. It&#39;s websites that dazzle and iPhone apps that make the heart sing. And it&#39;s sometimes even spreadsheets, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/unusual-uses-of-excel/ba-p/3576867">coerced to dance and do all manner of weirdness</a>. All of these approaches to computing are what am collecting here, and bundling under the term &#34;<a href="https://arbesman.net/computationaldelights/">garden of computational delights</a>.&#34;  This is a list of places that collect or catalyze sources for being enraptured by the web, programming, and the wider world of computing. Or, as per Tim Hwang and Omar Rizwan, this is a garden of all the different places you might discover where <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QbPa3URLo5cp07bi6U-vTFjX_4btORAlwSnSRxEapsk/edit">&#34;the computer is a feeling.&#34;</a>
