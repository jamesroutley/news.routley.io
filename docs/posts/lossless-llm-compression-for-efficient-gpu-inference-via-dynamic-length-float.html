<p>Computers exist to connect humans, your writings exist to help people find you.</p>
<p>Advertise your awesome!</p>

<p>Everyone knows something I don’t know, that will benefit me once I know it.</p>
<p>I can find some of those things in your writing.</p>

<p>When I write about my nifty projects, I include things I did not try but could be interesting.</p>
<p>Many of my later fun projects come from me re-reading those “this might work?” points and deciding to try it.</p>

<p><a href="https://press.stripe.com/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering">Hamming</a> says roughly “You will be most remembered from your expository works”.</p>
<p>That is, the world will remember you by how you communicated with other humans.</p>
<p>Expose the awesome things!</p>

<p>Write up something new to you or your group of people. Understanding flows unevenly, your explanation could be the thing that helps someone have that spark of realization.</p>

<p>This blog post reads like a pale shadow of what’s in my head, but it’s here for you to read.</p>
<p>I’m publishing it so you gain something from what I’ve written. Maybe I’ll write something that communicates more effectively after I’ve had time to think about this one?</p>
