    <h1>Tell HN: Uber has blocked my account for years, won&#39;t tell me why</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Until 2019, I used uber everytime I traveled abroad. Then one day, suddenly I login and it logs me out, says my account is blocked. There was no way for me to reach support or figure out why. We&#39;ve been using my wife&#39;s account since then. I&#39;m just account to travel again, for the first time since 2019, and tried to login to uber, still blocked. I fill the support form, and get an email saying they won&#39;t send my request to a support rep until I verify my email. So I click the link and verify.</p><p>One day later I get an email from a rep saying &#34;I&#39;m contacting them from my second uber account&#34;. I had no idea you could have 2 accounts with same email. And if that is the case, it&#39;s clearly an accident and I have no idea which account they refer to. And they won&#39;t help, no way to reach a human. I don&#39;t get how a ride hailing company thinks is&#39;t cool to behave like a bank. Any tips on how I can resolve this?</p></div></div></div>
