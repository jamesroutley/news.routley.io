	    The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide To Forum Spies (spooks, feds, etc.)</p><p>
	    22. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s),
	    leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific,
	    investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably.
	    In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively.
	    </p><p>
	    23. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working
	    to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage
	    of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat
	    them as such) to distract the multitudes.
	    </p><p>
	    24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing
	    opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to
	    address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and
	    detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail
	    information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely
	    damaging their health.
	    </p><p>
	    25. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated
	    and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the
	    kitchen.
	    </p><p>
	    ______________________________________________________________________________________
	    </p><p>
	    Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist
	    </p><p>
	    1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive
	    input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather,
	    they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their
	    presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without
	    any further justification for credibility.
	    </p><p>
	    2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either
	    applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of
	    opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to
	    directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any
	    success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well.
	    </p><p>
	    3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally
	    with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation
	    in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise
	    tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were
	    likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the
	    reason.
	    </p><p>
	    4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary
	    packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum,
	    but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this
	    sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will
	    infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics
	    designed to dilute opponent presentation strength.
	    </p><p>
	    5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for &#39;conspiracy
	    theorists&#39; and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed
	    by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists,
	    do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on
	    conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of
	    everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or,
	    one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions
	    in going out of their way to focus as they do.
	    </p><p>
	    6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of &#39;artificial&#39; emotionalism and an unusually
	    thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of
	    overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence
	    community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything,
	    and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo
	    artist is that emotions can seem artificial.
	    </p><p>
	    Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity
	    throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining
	    the &#39;image&#39; and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their
	    usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It&#39;s just a job, and
	    they often seem unable to &#39;act their role in character&#39; as well in a
	    communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face
	    conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation
	    one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo.
	    </p><p>
	    With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them
	    from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo
	    patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that
	    they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what
	    others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance,
	    and so forth, or simply give up.
	    </p><p>
	    7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their
	    true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or
	    it may be somewhat &#39;freudian&#39;, so to speak, in that perhaps they really root
	    for the side of truth deep within.
	    </p><p>
	    I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information
	    which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed
	    to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar,
	    incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I&#39;m not aware
	    of too many Navy pilots who don&#39;t have a college degree. Another claimed
	    no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand
	    knowledge of it.
	    </p><p>
	    8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the
	    response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially
	    when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up
	    operation:
	    </p><p>
	    a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE
	    response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people
	    to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO
	    IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or
	    the visitor may be swayed towards truth.
	    </p><p>
	    b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email,
	    DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay.
	    This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect,
	    and even enough time to &#39;get permission&#39; or instruction from a formal chain
	    of command.
	    </p><p>
	    c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns
	    are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach
	    in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their
	    comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal
	    truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin.
	    </p><p>

	    </p><p>
	    How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent)
	    </p><p>
	    One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group
	    that does all the wrong things. Why?
	    </p><p>
	    1) The message doesn&#39;t get out.
	    </p><p>
	    2) A lot of time is wasted
	    </p><p>
	    3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged
	    </p><p>
	    4) Nothing good is accomplished.
	    </p><p>
	    FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they
	    have phoney activist organizations established.
	    </p><p>
	    Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from
	    developing in this country.
	    </p><p>
	    Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background.
	    They can be male or female.
	    </p><p>
	    The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant.
	    It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the
	    spies and saboteurs.
	    </p><p>
	    This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up,
	    destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists.
	    </p><p>
	    It is the agent&#39;s job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus
	    keeping him/her under control.
	    </p><p>
	    In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist:
	    </p><p>
	    &#34;You&#39;re dividing the movement.&#34;
	    </p><p>
	    [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works
	    to control people]
	    </p><p>
	    This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The
	    agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of
	    &#34;dedication to the cause.&#34; Because of their often declared dedication, (and
	    actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or
	    she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow,
	    any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends
	    to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate
	    and lie like that &#34;on purpose.&#34; It&#39;s amazing how far agents can go in
	    manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses
	    for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even
	    if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over
	    their own eyes by rationalizing: &#34;they did that unconsciously... they didn&#39;t
	    really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting &#34; and
	    so on and so forth.
	    </p><p>
	    The agent will tell the activist:
	    </p><p>
	    &#34;You&#39;re a leader!&#34;
	    </p><p>
	    This is designed to enhance the activist&#39;s self-esteem. His or her narcissistic
	    admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or
	    she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of
	    the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist.
	    </p><p>
	    This is &#34;malignant pseudoidentification.&#34; It is the process by which the
	    agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the
	    activist&#39;s identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist&#39;s
	    vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle
	    self-concepts of the activist.
	    </p><p>
	    Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable
	    to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when
	    the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or
	    knowledge.
	    </p><p>
	    The goal of the agent is to increase the activist&#39;s general empathy for the
	    agent through pseudo-identification with the activist&#39;s self-concepts.
	    </p><p>
	    The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist
	    for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle
	    level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which
	    promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of &#34;twinship&#34;. It is not
	    unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence
	    of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps,
	    even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler.
	    </p><p>
	    The activist&#39;s &#34;felt quality of perfection&#34; [self-concept] is enhanced, and
	    a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation
	    and simulation of the victim&#39;s own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts]
	    That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the
	    cause, they will project that onto the agent who is &#34;mirroring&#34; them.
	    </p><p>
	    The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling
	    of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the
	    adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the
	    establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting
	    so that &#34;twinship alliances&#34; between activist and agent may render whole
	    sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally &#34;lose
	    touch with reality.&#34;
	    </p><p>
	    Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good
	    idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously
	    perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be &#34;helpers&#34; endowed with
	    a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective
	    (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent.
	    </p><p>
	    Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible
	    affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse,
	    and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of
	    compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist&#39;s narcissistic investment
	    in self as the embodiment of goodness.
	    </p><p>
	    The agent&#39;s expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling
	    to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion.
	    </p><p>
	    It can usually be identified by two events, however:
	    </p><p>
	    First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is
	    aware of his/her own potential for being &#34;emotionally hooked,&#34; will be able
	    to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent.
	    </p><p>
	    As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur:
	    The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective
	    expression leaving the activist with the impression that &#34;the play has ended,
	    the curtain has fallen,&#34; and the imposture, for the moment, has finished.
	    The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim.
	    </p><p>
	    The fact is, the movement doesn&#39;t need leaders, it needs MOVERS. &#34;Follow
	    the leader&#34; is a waste of time.
	    </p><p>
	    A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk
	    a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved
	    discussions.
	    </p><p>
	    Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner:
	    </p><p>
	    1) To disrupt the agenda
	    </p><p>
	    2) To side-track the discussion
	    </p><p>
	    3) To interrupt repeatedly
	    </p><p>
	    4) To feign ignorance
	    </p><p>
	    5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person.
	    </p><p>
	    Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a
	    person in the eyes of all other group members.
	    </p><p>

	    Saboteurs
	    </p><p>
	    Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will ....
	    </p><p>
	    1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites)
	    </p><p>
	    2) Print flyers in English only.
	    </p><p>
	    3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares.
	    </p><p>
	    4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support
	    </p><p>
	    5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing.
	    </p><p>
	    6) Confuse issues.
	    </p><p>
	    7) Make the wrong demands.
	    </p><p>
	    Cool Compromise the goal.
	    </p><p>
	    9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone&#39;s time. The agent may accompany
	    the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to
	    slow down the activist&#39;s work.
	    </p><p>
	    ______________________________________________________________________________________
	    </p><p>
	    Provocateurs
	    </p><p>
	    1) Want to establish &#34;leaders&#34; to set them up for a fall in order to stop
	    the movement.
	    </p><p>
	    2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble.
	    </p><p>
	    3) Encourage militancy.
	    </p><p>
	    4) Want to taunt the authorities.
	    </p><p>
	    5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values.
	    </p><p>
	    6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent.
	    </p><p>
	    7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with
	    the reaction of the authorities to such violence.
	    </p><p>
	    ______________________________________________________________________________________
	    </p><p>
	    Informants
	    </p><p>
	    1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything.
	    </p><p>
	    2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data).
	    </p><p>
	    3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend.
	    </p><p>
	    4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or
	    her beliefs, goals, and level of committment.
	    </p><p>
	    ______________________________________________________________________________________
	    </p><p>
	    Recruiting
	    </p><p>
	    Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog.
	    Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves.
	    </p><p>
	    Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties
	    or movements set up by agents.
	    </p><p>
	    ______________________________________________________________________________________
	    </p><p>
	    Surveillance
	    </p><p>
	    ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance.
	    </p><p>
	    At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good
	    activist!
	    </p><p>
	    ______________________________________________________________________________________
	    </p><p>
	    Scare Tactics
	    </p><p>
	    They use them.
	    </p><p>
	    Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected
	    or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological
	    tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony
	    against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the
	    activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set
	    up &#34;exposure,&#34; they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name
	    of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow.
	    </p><p>
	    This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives
	    of sincere an dedicated activists.
	    </p><p>
	    If an agent is &#34;exposed,&#34; he or she will be transferred or replaced.
	    </p><p>
	    COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is
	    no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom
	    of information act.
	    </p><p>
	    The FBI counterintelligence program&#39;s stated purpose: To expose, disrupt,
	    misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize
	    as opposed to the National Interests. &#34;National Security&#34; means the FBI&#39;s
	    security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation
	    of people&#39;s civil liberties.

	    Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression
	    </p><p>
	    Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down
	    a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense,
	    other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends
	    heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party.
	    </p><p>
	    1. Dummy up. If it&#39;s not reported, if it&#39;s not news, it didn&#39;t happen.
	    </p><p>
	    2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the &#34;How dare you?&#34; gambit.
	    </p><p>
	    3. Characterize the charges as &#34;rumors&#34; or, better yet, &#34;wild rumors.&#34; If,
	    in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the
	    suspicious facts, it can only be through &#34;rumors.&#34; (If they tend to believe
	    the &#34;rumors&#34; it must be because they are simply &#34;paranoid&#34; or &#34;hysterical.&#34;)
	    </p><p>
	    4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest
	    charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or
	    plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all
	    the charges, real and fanciful alike.
	    </p><p>
	    5. Call the skeptics names like &#34;conspiracy theorist,&#34; &#34;nutcase,&#34; &#34;ranter,&#34;
	    &#34;kook,&#34; &#34;crackpot,&#34; and, of course, &#34;rumor monger.&#34; Be sure, too, to use
	    heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and
	    defending the &#34;more reasonable&#34; government and its defenders. You must then
	    carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus
	    maligned. For insurance, set up your own &#34;skeptics&#34; to shoot down.
	    </p><p>
	    6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly
	    that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing
	    a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to
	    over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not).
	    </p><p>
	    7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can
	    be very useful.
	    </p><p>
	    8. Dismiss the charges as &#34;old news.&#34;
	    </p><p>
	    9. Come half-clean. This is also known as &#34;confession and avoidance&#34; or &#34;taking
	    the limited hangout route.&#34; This way, you create the impression of candor
	    and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal
	    &#34;mistakes.&#34; This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position
	    quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control,
	    the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully
	    limited markets.
	    </p><p>
	    10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately
	    unknowable.
	    </p><p>
	    11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly
	    rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely
	    free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster &#34;suicide&#34; note was forged,
	    they would have reported it. They haven&#39;t reported it so there is no such
	    evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy
	    leaker and a press who would report the leak.
	    </p><p>
	    12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was
	    murdered, who did it and why?
	    </p><p>
	    13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing
	    distractions.
	    </p><p>
	    14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This
	    is sometimes referred to as &#34;bump and run&#34; reporting.
	    </p><p>
	    15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute
	    the &#34;facts&#34; furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous,
	    source.
	    </p><p>
	    16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges &#34;expose&#34;
	    scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents
	    and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job
	    who will pretend to spend their own money.
	    </p><p>
	    17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, &#34;What
	    could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news
	    groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?&#34;
	    Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines,
	    radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters
	    and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would
	    be control enough, but, obviously, it is not.
