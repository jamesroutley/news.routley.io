    <h1>Metric Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>

					<h3>A metric minute is broken into 100 seconds. </h3>

				<h2>Rationale for Metric Time</h2>
				<p>
					What makes metric time so cool is that would make all the mental math we have to do when adding and subtracting time so much easierâ€”especially when it comes to different timezones. Working with base-10 numbers is so much easier than trying to think in base-60, base-12, and base-24.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no AM or PM with metric time. Just 10 hours in the day. To get a good night sleep (8 standard hours) you&#39;d sleep for 3.33 metric hours. If you go to bed at 9:50 metric time (about 10:45pm in standard time), wanting to get a good night sleep, you&#39;d wake up at 2:75 metric time (roughly 6:45am standard time). Remember, a half hour in metric time is 50 minutes, and a full hour is 100 minutes. One metric minute before &#34;midnight&#34; (10:00 on the metric clock) would be 9:99 in metric time.
				</p>
				<h2>Time is Money</h2>
				<p>
					The logic you use to tell time with metric time is very similar to how you think about money (assuming US Dollars). One metric hour is like a 100-dollar bill. One metric minute is a 1 dollar bill. And each metric second is a penny. Each day (10 metric hours), has 1,000 minutes, and 100,000 seconds. It&#39;s an interesting way to think about the time we get to spend each day.
