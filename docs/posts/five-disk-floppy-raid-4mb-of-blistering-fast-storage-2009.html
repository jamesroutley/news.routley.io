    <h1>Five-Disk Floppy RAID: 4MB of Blistering Fast Storage (2009)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p><img src="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2009/05/floppy-disk-raid.jpg" alt="floppy-disk-raid" title="floppy-disk-raid"/></p><p>A “Floppy RAID” might sound like the title of a frustrating niche adult movie, but it isn’t. Instead, it is a homebrew project by Daniel Blade Olson* which cobbles together five 3.5” floppy drives into a redundant disk array.</p><p>RAID means either extra speed or extra data security, but Olson’s version offers neither. The setup gives a mere 3.9MB of usable space and runs at a speed that makes dialup look quick. Daniel says “I was able to transfer “DEVO Uncontrolable Urge.mp3″ which is 3.6 MB in 32 seconds. Which is pretty good I think.”</p><p>The project was ridiculously simple. Or at least, it was simple on a 500MHz Bondi Blue iMac. Attempting the same thing on a modern-day Dell machine running Windows XP was impossible. Olson grabbed a bunch of returned but functioning USB floppy drives from his place of work and simply hooked them up to the iMac: four into a USB hub and one directly to a USB port. OS X’s Disk Utility was used to make the RAID in about six minutes, and Daniel was good to go.</p><p>Why not bigger? “I would have connected more units together, but I ran out of USB ports” says Olson. And he’s still going. Already built are a 2X speed floppy RAID (” It was able to transfer the same awesome DEVO song in just 16 seconds! KICK ASS!!!”) and a Sony Memory Stick RAID.</p><p>Next up: A RAID made from 127 floppy drives.</p><p><a data-offer-url="http://ohlssonvox.8k.com/fdd_raid.htm" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://ohlssonvox.8k.com/fdd_raid.htm&#34;}" href="http://ohlssonvox.8k.com/fdd_raid.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">USB Floppy Disk Striped RAID Under OS X</a> [Ohlssonvox via <a data-offer-url="http://www.everyjoe.com/thegadgetblog/totally-awesome-but-useless-floppy-raid/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://www.everyjoe.com/thegadgetblog/totally-awesome-but-useless-floppy-raid/&#34;}" href="http://www.everyjoe.com/thegadgetblog/totally-awesome-but-useless-floppy-raid/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Every Joe</a> and <a data-offer-url="http://www.ohgizmo.com/2009/05/25/floppy-raid-doesnt-manage-to-make-floppy-disks-useful-again/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;http://www.ohgizmo.com/2009/05/25/floppy-raid-doesnt-manage-to-make-floppy-disks-useful-again/&#34;}" href="http://www.ohgizmo.com/2009/05/25/floppy-raid-doesnt-manage-to-make-floppy-disks-useful-again/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oh Gizmo!</a>]</p><p>Photos: Daniel Olson</p><p>*Porn-star name: Daniel “Blade” Olson</p></div></div></div></div>
