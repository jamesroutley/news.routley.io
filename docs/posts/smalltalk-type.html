<p>Like so many, I have been fascinated by Smalltalk, particularly because of the vision of computing it represents.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I am also very fond of those early PARC GUIs and their aesthetic. After playing around with Smalltalk-80 recently, I wanted to know more about its typefaces and have versions of them for my own use.</p>
<h2>The Typefaces of Smalltalk-80</h2>
<p>Somewhat ironically, the fonts used in Smalltalk-80 (which was the “release version”, the first variant made available outside of PARC) were a substantial <em>regression</em> from the bespoke designs and elaborate features the PARC Learning Research Group had going on for the Alto and earlier versions of Smalltalk. The Alto not only supported raster/bitmap fonts, but also high-quality “spline fonts”, where the <em>outline</em> of a glyph shape is represented with a series of curves: Essentially the ancestor of how we use fonts today. PARC had built interactive font editors both for outline (“Fred”) and raster (“PrePress”) type.<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Several <a href="https://xeroxalto.computerhistory.org/Indigo/AltoFonts/.index.html">Alto fonts</a> were proportionally-spaced, and included numerous special characters.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of Smalltalk included <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08/page/n119/mode/2up">a number of typefaces</a>, perhaps the most memorably is <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/174352/cream-apple"><em>Cream</em></a> by Bob Flegal, based on a design by Alan Kay.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Cream later gained additional fame when Bill Atkinson converted it to the Lisagraf font format and it became <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Busy_Being_Born,_Part_2.txt">the first system font of the Macintosh</a>. Apple’s Smalltalk implementation also used Cream:</p>

<p>For the Smalltalk-80 release, these all were axed. Alan Kay notes in <em>The Early History of Smalltalk</em>:<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only a few changes had to be made to the NoteTaker Smalltalk-78 to make a releasable system. Perhaps the change that was most ironic was to turn the custom fonts that made Smalltalk more readable (and were a hallmark of the entire PARC culture) back into standard pedestrian ASCII characters. According to Peter Deutsch this “met with heated opposition within the group at the time, but has turned out to be essential for the acceptance of the system in the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “heated opposition” of which Kay writes becomes more understandable when we realise how the move back to ASCII was not a matter of typographic flourishes of the interface. It directly impacted the Smalltalk <em>language</em>.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> What Kay glosses over here as “more readable” has nothing to do with a nice type design. The custom fonts of the Alto had a function. For example, in Smalltalk-76, you would copy an element from an array to another like this:</p>
<p><code>a • i ← b • i</code></p>
<p>Very elegant and visually expressive. With no special characters available, the syntax had to be changed. In Smalltalk-80, this statement would eventually look like this:</p>
<p><code>a at: i put: (b at: i)</code></p>
<p>Less “readable” indeed.</p>
<p>I don’t yet know why the earlier typeface <em>designs</em> were not kept with a reduced ASCII character set. The four simple fonts that shipped with Smalltalk-80 have generic names, perhaps reflecting the team’s opinion on them: Sans-Serif10, Sans-Serif12, Serif10, and Serif12. They all have regular, italic and bold variants. The letters are proportional, not fixed-width:</p>

<p>I quite like these <em>pedestrian ASCII character</em> glyphs, and I believe they deserve to be converted for contemporary use. They somehow have a wonderfully <em>friendly</em> character.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I could not yet find out who actually designed them. My guess would be that they were made by Robert Flegal as well (Please <a href="https://moritzfuerst.net/meta/email-contact">email me</a> if you have any information!)</p>
<h2>Restoration</h2>
<p>The project builds on <a href="https://leahneukirchen.org/fonts/">Leah Neukirchen’s BDF release</a> of the regular weight of Sans-Serif10 in 2021. Leah was also kind to confirm a trace of the glyphs to be more practical than trying to decode whatever format these fonts are in in the Smalltalk-80 environment.</p>

        “Sans-Serif10” typed out for subsequent redrawing from the screenshot. Curiously, I also found two <em>ligatures</em> by accident. While ‘fl’ does not differ from simply printing the ‘f’ and ‘l’ characters after each other in Sans10, the ‘ffi’ is custom: the ‘f’ crossbars are connected!            </figcaption></figure>
<p>The glyph shapes and spacing widths were reconstructed from the <a href="http://www.wolczko.com/st80/">original Xerox virtual image tape shared by Mario Wolczko</a>, using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/dbanay/Smalltalk">Smalltalk-80 implementation by Dan Banay</a>. After consulting – what else – <a href="https://archive.org/details/smalltalk80langu00gold">Adele Goldberg’s documentation</a> to remind myself how to change fonts in the editor, I sampled the typefaces.</p>

<p>Eventually, I hope to have time to restore all four of them, and also make extended character sets available— This is a work in progress.</p>

<h3>Smalltalk Sans10</h3>

<p>Smalltalk Sans10 is a faithful restoration of the “Sans-Serif10” 10px typeface. The character set covers  the original printable ASCII. Compared to <a href="https://leahneukirchen.org/fonts/">Leah’s BDF version of the regular weight</a>, Smalltalk Sans10 Regular differs in a few glyph shapes and spacings (most notably ‘P’ and ‘R’, which are 1px wider in her version than what I reconstructed from Smalltalk-80).</p>

<h3>Smalltalk Sans10 Extended</h3>
<p>This version of Sans10 features an extended character set. I have tried my best to match the style and spirit of the original in the design of the additional glyphs. Extended supports ISO-Latin-1, plus a few extra characters (mostly based on my own needs). In Extended, the arrows that represent the circumflex and the underscore in the original character set have been moved to the arrows block (<a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2191">U+2191</a> and <a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2190">U+2190</a>), replaced by proper circumflex and underscore glyphs. The grave accent also has been replaced, the glyph shape has been moved to <a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2018">U+2018</a>. Extended comes with special glyphs: The <a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2038">caret (U+2038)</a> is Smalltalk-80’s cursor, and the <a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1F4BB">Personal Computer (U+1F4BB)</a> is, of course, the Alto.</p>
<p>I’m not fully happy with all the glyphs yet, but you can already test drive the Regular:</p>
