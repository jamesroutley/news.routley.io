<p>My insight into corporate legal disputes is as meaningful as my opinion on Quantum Mechanics. What I do know is that, when given the chance this week to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/159-employees-are-leaving-automattic-as-ceos-fight-with-wp-engine-escalates/?zeldman">leave my job with half a year’s salary paid in advance</a>, I chose to stay at <a href="applenotes:note/e336c252-1a41-4523-9974-ddd94bfa772b?ownerIdentifier=_ab35500906b57133eafa73464d88463e">Automattic</a>.</p>
<p>I also know that the <a href="https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem">Maker-Taker problem</a> is an issue in open source, just as I know that a friend you buy lunch for every day, and who earns as much money as you do, is supposed to return the favor now and then. If a friend takes advantage, you’re supposed to say or do something about it. Addressing these imbalances is rarely pretty. Doing it in public takes its own kind of courage. Now it’s for the lawyers to sort out. </p>
<p>On May 1, 1992, a man who’d been horribly beaten by the L.A. police called for calm in five heartfelt, memorable words: “Can’t we all get along?” We couldn’t then, and we aren’t, now, but my job at Automattic is about helping people, and that remains my focus at the conclusion of this strange and stressful week. I’m grateful that making the tough business decisions isn’t my responsibility. In that light, my decision to stay at Automattic was easy.</p>
