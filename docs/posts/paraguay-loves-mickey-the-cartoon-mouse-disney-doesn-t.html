    <h1>Paraguay Loves Mickey, the Cartoon Mouse. Disney Doesn&#39;t</h1>

An earlier conflagration, the War of the Triple Alliance (1864-70), had seen Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-the-Triple-Alliance" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wipe out</a> half of Paraguay’s population.</p><p>It was still reeling from both.</p><p>Ms. Blasco’s grandfather, Pascual, the son of Italian immigrants, saw an opportunity to spread some joy — and turn a profit. He opened a tiny shop selling fruit and homemade gelato. It was called Mickey.</p><p>Exactly where the idea came from, said Ms. Blasco, remains “something of a mystery.”</p><p>But Pascual, she said, often vacationed in Buenos Aires — Argentina’s cosmopolitan capital, <a href="https://www.iaa.fadu.uba.ar/publicaciones/critica/0012.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">known</a> for movie theaters showing international films. Mickey Mouse was making his silver-screen debut, including in “<a href="https://d23.com/this-day/the-gallopin-gaucho-is-released/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Gallopin’ Gaucho</a>” (1928).</p><p>“On one of his trips, he must have seen the famous mouse,” Ms. Blasco said.</p><p>Whatever its origins, Mickey was a hit. A few years later, Pascual <a href="https://mickey.com.py/nosotros/#historia" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opened</a> the Mickey Ice Cream Parlor, Café and Confectioners.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-13"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>The Mickey company sells a variety of products including spices, herbs, beans and bread ingredients.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-15"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mickey workers packaging a medicinal herb that is often consumed with yerba mate, at the company’s factory in Asunción.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>By 1969, Mickey was selling rice, sugar and baking soda in packages now decorated with the eponymous mouse.

Mickey grew in parallel to Walt Disney,” Ms. Blasco said, becoming “deeply implanted in Paraguayan culture.”</p><p>That affinity was evident at several stores that stock Mickey products in Luque, a working-class suburb of Asunción.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div><p>The Mickey mascot was taking photos with fans, including Lilian Pavón, 54, a pediatric nurse. “I’m a fanatic of Mickey products,” she said, praising, in particular, the company’s <a href="https://mickey.com.py/product/galleta-molida/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">breadcrumbs</a> and oregano.</p><p>But her feelings for the 7-foot felt rodent go beyond condiments, she added, as Mickey bumped fists with shoppers and distributed ring-shaped biscuits called <em>chipa</em>.</p><p>As children, she said, she and her friends hoarded Mickey Mouse pencil cases, notebooks and stickers. They dreamed of visiting Disneyland or Walt Disney World. But the cost of flying to <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/destinations/disneyland/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anaheim</a> or <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Orlando</a> made the pilgrimage “impossible,” even as an adult, Ms. Pavón said.</p><p>“I’m happy just to see Mickey in places like this,” she added, standing in the chilled meats aisle of El Cacique, a budget supermarket.</p><p>Mickey resonates with Paraguayans’ sense of nostalgia, said Euge Aquino, a TV chef and social media <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aquino_euge/?hl=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">influencer</a> who uses its ingredients to make comfort food like <em>pastel mandi’o</em> (yuca and beef empanadas).</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>Paraguay is not known for its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/07/travel/things-to-do-asuncion-paraguay.html?" title="">haute cuisine</a>, she admitted.</p><p>It’s flat, hot, and a long way from foreign foodie trends. </p><p>“Our climate is pretty difficult,” Ms. Aquino, 41 said, “so you cultivate and eat whatever grows.”</p><p>What grows is mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">yuca</a> or cassava and corn, which is sacred to the native Guaraní people. But what local dishes lack in pizazz, she said, they make up for in flavor and meaning.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-21"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Euge Aquino, a chef and social media influencer, using Mickey products to make  “sopa paraguaya,” a traditional dish that is a staple in Paraguayan cuisine, in her kitchen in Asunción.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Ms. Aquino pulled freshly baked “sopa paraguaya” from her oven.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><p>Paraguayans still knead yuca starch and milled corn to make <em>chipa</em> during Holy Week. They infuse their yerba mate with fragrant herbs like <em>boldo, burro, </em>and <a href="https://mickey.com.py/product/siempre-vive/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">begonias</a><em>. </em>They stuff their soups, stews and casseroles with aniseed, saffron, cloves, nutmeg, paprika and cilantro, all purveyed by Mickey in serving-size sachets.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>“A moment, a taste, an aroma is a memory,’’ said Ms. Aquino, as a <em>sopa paraguaya</em> — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/dining/sopa-paraguaya.html" title="">spongy “soup”</a> made with Mickey corn flour — turned golden-brown in her oven. “And that memory can generate so many emotions. It’s your mom’s or your grandmother’s cooking.’’</p><p>Mickey’s popularity, she said, also has a lot to do with the mascot handing out candy outside the factory gates every Christmas: a tradition dating back to 1983.</p><p>Ms Aquino recalled feeling goose bumps as she waited outside the factory during the annual festivity in the early 1990s.</p><p>“There was no social media, there were no cellphones, there was nothing,” Ms. Aquino said. “Then suddenly Mickey comes along, and you’re like, ‘Wow!’ It was madness.”</p><p>“He’s a rock star,” she said.</p><p>By now, a “peaceful coexistence” reigns between Mickey and its United States doppelgänger, said <a href="https://www.pstbn.com.py/en/elba-rosa-britez-ingles/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elba Rosa Britez</a>, 72, the smaller company’s lawyer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-28"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Elba Rosa Britez, 72, a lawyer who represented Mickey in a case against Walt Disney before the Paraguayan Supreme Court case in the 1990s.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-30"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Copies of the court documents and Mickey’s trademark registrations used in the case.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><div><p>This truce was hard-won.</p><p>In 1991, Disney filed a trademark violation claim with Paraguay’s Ministry of Business and Industry that was rejected.
