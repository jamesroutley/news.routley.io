    <h1>FLUX.1 Kontext [Dev] – Open Weights for Image Editing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Up until today, all capable generative image editing models were only available as proprietary tools. Today, that changes. We release FLUX.1 Kontext [dev], our developer version of <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bfl.ai/models/flux-kontext"><span>FLUX.1 Kontext [pro]</span></a>, which delivers proprietary-level image editing performance in a 12B parameter model that can run on consumer hardware.</p><p>Making model weights openly accessible is fundamental to technological innovation. <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev"><span>FLUX.1 Kontext [dev]</span></a> is now available as an open-weight model under the FLUX.1 Non-Commercial License, providing free access for research and non-commercial use. FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] is compatible with the existing FLUX.1 [dev] inference code and comes with day-0 support for popular inference frameworks like ComfyUI, HuggingFace Diffusers and TensorRT.</p><p>The model weights are available on <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev"><span>HuggingFace</span></a>. Our partners <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux-kontext/dev"><span>FAL</span></a>, <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-kontext-dev"><span>Replicate</span></a>, <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://runware.ai/models#flux"><span>Runware</span></a>, <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://datacrunch.io/managed-endpoints/flux-kontext"><span>DataCrunch</span></a> and <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.together.ai/models/flux-1-kontext-dev"><span>TogetherAI</span></a> and <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.comfy.org/"><span>ComfyUI</span></a> provide ready-to-use API endpoints and code for cloud-based and/or local inference.</p><p>The technical report is available <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15742"><span>on arxiv</span></a>.</p><h2>Setting New Standards in Open Image Editing</h2><p>FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] focuses exclusively on editing tasks. The model enables iterative editing, excels at character preservation across a diverse set of scenes and environments, and allows both precise local and global edits.</p><p><img alt="kontext dev edit sample" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/gsvmb6gz/production/bafe7b0153e2fa225bdf525367ca986fbc95aea8-2935x564.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format"/></p><p>At Black Forest Labs, we remain committed to providing researchers and developers with best-in-class open tools that are competitive with existing proprietary solutions. To validate the performance of FLUX.1 Kontext [dev], we conducted extensive evaluation across multiple image editing benchmarks.</p><p>Human preference evaluations on <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/black-forest-labs/kontext-bench"><span>KontextBench</span></a>, our newly released image editing benchmark, demonstrate that FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] outperforms existing open image editing models, (Bytedance Bagel, HiDream-E1-Full) and closed models (Google&#39;s Gemini-Flash Image) across many categories. Independent evaluations run by <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-image/arena?tab=leaderboard&amp;input=image"><span>Artificial Analysis</span></a> confirm these findings.</p><p><img alt="kontext evals" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/gsvmb6gz/production/d16816db56b4b7fe9ca65b7fa325789f329e83ea-3024x2529.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format"/></p><h2>Optimized for NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture</h2><p>We have collaborated with NVIDIA to build optimized TensorRT weights specifically designed for the new <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-139553"><span>NVIDIA Blackwell</span></a> architecture which brings greatly improved inference speed and reduces memory usage while maintaining high-quality image editing performance.</p><p><img alt="Nvidia speedup" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/gsvmb6gz/production/f2c2a0a29d912ffe75c7d42a0bacf70c9b8ce6d1-4737x2635.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format"/></p><p>Additionally to the original FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] weights, we’re making available these BF16, FP8 and FP4 TensorRT variants in our <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev-onnx"><span>Hugging Face repository</span></a>, giving developers the flexibility to balance speed, efficiency, and quality tailored to their use case. These optimized weights ensure that FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] can take full advantage of the latest hardware capabilities.</p><h2>Streamlined Commercial Access: The BFL Self-Serve Portal</h2><p>We are releasing a <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://bfl.ai/pricing/licensing"><span>self-serve licensing portal</span></a> with transparent terms and standardized commercials for simplifying commercial access to all of our open weights models. This includes the novel FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] as well as the FLUX.1 Tools [dev] and the popular text-to-image model FLUX.1 [dev].</p><p>Our self-serve portal provides transparent licensing terms that enable businesses to confidently integrate FLUX.1 models into their commercial products and services. Commercial Licenses to our open weights models can now be purchased with only a few clicks, accelerating the path from development to deployment.
