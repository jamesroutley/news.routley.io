      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>We&#39;re a ~40 person startup, about to scale post-series A. We have been using Google Suite since the beginning in 2015, and honestly it&#39;s just terrible software and feels like it has had zero updates in 7 years. One of the biggest problems for me with Gsuite is that there is no real offline support (I know there is supposed to be, but it has never worked for me, plus the drive isn&#39;t available offline). I work a lot on trains crossing Europe, or sometimes on flights. I just want to have my files accessible.<p>I use LibreOffice personally, and I&#39;m thinking about moving the team to it before we seriously grow.</p><p>Has anyone tried this in their companies? Was it successful? I&#39;m especially interested in companies of a similar size (or larger) than ours, and those where not everyone is super technical / a software engineer.</p><p>My big concerns are support and training, I think there are companies who offer this which would make it a lot easier.</p><p>(Edit: to be clear, our CFO will probably continue to use Excel, as will some of the team who build very complicated modelling sheets as that is what they&#39;re used to, but I&#39;m thinking for the rest of us who mostly need decent spreadsheets, and good word-processing and presentation tools).</p></td></tr>
