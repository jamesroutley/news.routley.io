<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Monterey" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Monterey">Project Monterey</a></strong> was an attempt to unify the fragmented Unix market in to a single cross vendor <strong>Unix</strong> that would run on <strong>Intel Itanium</strong>. The main collaborators were: <strong>IBM</strong> who brought it’s <strong>AIX</strong>, <strong>HP</strong> was supposed to bring some bits from <strong>HP-UX</strong>, <strong>Sequent </strong>from<strong> DYNIX/ptx</strong> and <strong>SCO</strong> from <strong>UnixWare</strong>. It appears that the project shared the fate of Itanium – it totally failed and in the end Linux took it’s spot as a single Unix. The main legacy of Project Monterey was the famous SCO vs IBM lawsuit.</p>
<p>IBM did however produce AIX version for IA64 architecture. According to Wikipedia, 32 copies were sold in 2001. Except of course no one has kept a copy and the famous OS was lost forever. </p>
<p>Some 21 years later friends of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NCommander" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/c/NCommander">NCommander</a> checked in with a set of <strong>AIX 5L IA64</strong> CDROMS! The CDs have been imaged and dumped. You can download them <a href="https://archive.org/details/aix-ia64" data-type="URL" data-id="https://archive.org/details/aix-ia64">here</a>. However downloading will not help much as there is no virtualization or emulation platform that can run these. Yes we did try Simics and everything else you can think of. In fact the OS will not even run on more modern <strong>Itanium 2</strong> CPUs. The only supported architecture is the “pre-release” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium#Itanium_(Merced):_2001" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium#Itanium_(Merced):_2001">Itanium 1 aka Merced</a>. And it’s very picky! The OS won’t even boot with wrong type keyboard. </p>
<p>It’s speculated that the AIX IA64 will work only on “Intel Engineering Sample” Itanium Workstation that was later sold in several OEM branded clones: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/overview-ibm-intellistation-z-pro-type-6894" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/overview-ibm-intellistation-z-pro-type-6894">IBM IntelliStation Z Pro 6894</a>, <a href="https://www.openpa.net/systems/hp_i2000.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.openpa.net/systems/hp_i2000.html">HP i2000 Workstation</a>, <a href="https://wiki.irixnet.org/SGI-750" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wiki.irixnet.org/SGI-750">SGI 750</a>, Dell Precision Workstation 730 and Fujitsu-Siemens Celsius 880. Yes they all look alike because these were all made by Intel with custom colors and badges.</p>

<p>I was able to score a working <strong>HP i2000 Workstation</strong>, install AIX and boot it up!</p>

<p>Unfortunately the system is not really functioning very well. It doesn’t support the onboard NIC and no graphics mode for X11. I’m digging in for supported NICs and GPUs. The graphic cards seem more abundant. There is a long list of supported RS/6000 GTXxxx cards. However the OS seem to only support these two NICs:</p>
<pre>devices.pci.23100020.rte - IBM PCI 10/100 Ethernet Adapter Software
devices.pci.ae120100.rte - Gigabit Ethernet PCI Adapter Software</pre>
<p>If you happen to know part numbers for these, or where to get them please do let me know.</p>
<p>You can find an interesting collection of documents and some tools on <a href="http://www.ibmfiles.com/pages/aixia64.htm" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.ibmfiles.com/pages/aixia64.htm">ibmfiles</a>. There also is a DDK available <a href="http://ftpmirror.your.org/pub/misc/ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/itanium/developer/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://ftpmirror.your.org/pub/misc/ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/itanium/developer/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The next step is to get GCC going as the system comes without C compiler which was a separate download. <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-patches/2001-07/msg00360.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-patches/2001-07/msg00360.html">This post </a>suggests that GCC and binutils did support <code>ia64-ibm-aix</code> at some point in 2001. If you are an expert in cross compiling gcc to oddball platform please let me know!</p>
