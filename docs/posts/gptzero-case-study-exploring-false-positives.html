    <h1>GPTZero Case Study – Exploring False Positives</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction"><span>Introduction</span><a href="#introduction"><i></i></a></h2><p>In this case study, I will be sharing the vast amounts of false positives current AI detection software gives, specifically for this case study I will be demonstrating GPTZero. I personally want to thank the supposed “Healthcare professional” who brought this to my attention via my contact <a href="https://simplex.chat/contact#/?v=1-2&amp;smp=smp%3A%2F%2F0YuTwO05YJWS8rkjn9eLJDjQhFKvIYd8d4xG8X1blIU%3D%40smp8.simplex.im%2F4dgDprEeyoZrmJCgU2GBv7zIIvjSg4Qt%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-2%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEAxLm3lJtPPwoIE3e-4eS2348cbjMIaVqEqVLDUDz0NDc%253D%26srv%3Dbeccx4yfxxbvyhqypaavemqurytl6hozr47wfc7uuecacjqdvwpw2xid.onion">link</a>. It has motivated me to look more into this issue rather than just posting bypasses to these popular AI detection software programs, it will be only more beneficial to highlight their real usability in general.</p><h2 id="what-is-gptzero"><span>What is <a href="https://gptzero.me/">GPTZero</a>?</span><a href="#what-is-gptzero"><i></i></a></h2><p>GPTZero is a tool that uses certain characteristics of AI to identify when AI is being used. It looks at things like how difficult it is for the AI to understand certain words or phrases, and uses this information to tell if the AI was involved in creating a piece of text. It’s like a “fingerprint” for AI, that can detect when it has been used.</p><h2 id="the-false-positives"><span>The False Positives</span><a href="#the-false-positives"><i></i></a></h2><p>From my own testing before even thinking about writing this case study on GPTZero, I have found that GPTZero gives very mixed results while OpenAI’s AI Classifier is usually more consistent but less informative about what is AI written and what is human written. After testing the medical paper on <code>&#34;Severe Outcomes Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) — United States, February 12–March 16, 2020&#34;</code> - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7725513/">Source</a></p><p>GPTZero states that more than 50% of this paper is AI written, and keep in mind this is only the <strong>first paragraph</strong> taken from the paper. Considering this is an official medical paper and that was written in 2020 by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7725513/#article-1aff-info">Multiple CDC Contributors</a>. It’s not AI written, it’s quite obvious this is a <strong>false positive</strong>.</p><p><code>Note: Even after testing the maximum amount of words (5,000 characters) against GPTZero, the false positives still scored above 50%</code></p><p><a href="https://gonzoknows.com/assets/img/gptzero%20case%20study/gptzero.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/gptzero%20case%20study/gptzero.png" alt="Image display&#39;s a false positive in GPTZero detection method" data-proofer-ignore=""/></a></p><p><code>Thank you to the supposed &#34;Healthcare professional&#34; for sharing this link</code></p><h3 id="pie-chart"><span>Pie Chart</span><a href="#pie-chart"><i></i></a></h3><p>The following pie chart follows these rules below.</p><ul><li>All papers tested will be under the “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=neurology">neurology</a>” topic</li><li>All papers that are flagged as AI or low perplexity counts will be marked as false positive</li><li>All papers abstracts will only be tested</li></ul><p>The Results are shocking, as GPTZero marks 11 of the 20 medical papers as having AI written portions.

Far too many problems to simply state in a single blog post. The biggest problem I personally can see it having and one that can relate to my life is plagiarism in the education field. If a student is wrongfully accused of plagiarism due to the institution following a flawed AI detection program, it could be detrimental to any student. At my institution, plagiarism carries a huge impact on your character. My university labels it as “Academic dishonesty, therefore, is a serious breach of university standards and will result in substantial penalties.”</p></div><div><div><p> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</p></div></div></div>
