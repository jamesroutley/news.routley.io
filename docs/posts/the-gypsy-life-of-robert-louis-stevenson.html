<div><p>For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go.</p></div>

<p>With time people become the stories we tell about them. Then, except in the rarest cases, oblivion. Time whittled Sappho down to fragments. Others have not survived at all. If we take the cosmic view, no one will.</p>

<p>*</p>


<blockquote><p>Under the wide and starry sky,</p></blockquote>

<p>Never mind the use Philip Larkin made of one of its lines for “This Be the Verse.” Damrosch’s placement of “Requiem” in his penultimate chapter is narrative perfection. Maybe it’s the natural shape of Stevenson’s life, or maybe it’s Damrosch’s enthusiasm for his subject, but this is a dream biography.</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems he had been looking on watching my mother making a salad, and was dropping the oil for her with a perfectly steady hand. He suddenly said, “What is that?” or “What a pain!” and put both hands to his head. “Do I look strange?” he asked, and then he reeled and fell backwards. His favourite boy Sosimo [a Samoan servant] caught him and carried him into the big room, and he never was conscious after.</p></blockquote>

<p>“They had been in Samoa for just over four years,” Damrosch remarks, “—⁠the longest Louis ever lived in one place during his entire adult life.”</p>

<blockquote><p>To “my dear Fanny Stevenson” James sent a long and tender letter of sympathy, beginning with “What can I say to you that will not seem cruelly irrelevant and vain?” After praising her “courage and patience and fortitude,” which would be much needed, he went on to say, “To have lived in the light of that splendid life, that beautiful, bountiful being—only to see it, from one moment to the other, converted into a fable as strange and romantic as one of his own, a thing that <em>has</em> been and has ended, is an anguish into which no one can enter with you fully, and of which no one can drain the cup <em>for</em> you. You are nearest to the pain, because you were nearest the joy and the pride.”</p></blockquote>

<p>James went on, and I simply must quote it:</p>

<blockquote><p>He has gone in time not to be old—early enough to have been so generously young and late enough to have drunk deep of the cup. There have been—I think—for men of letters few deaths more romantically right. Forgive me, I beg you, what may sound cold-blooded in such words—and as if I imagined there could be anything for <em>you</em> “right” in the rupture of such an affection and the loss of such a presence. I have in my mind, in that view, only the rounded career and the consecrated work. When I think of your own situation I fall into a mere confusion of pity and wonder—with the sole sense of your being as brave a spirit as he was (all of whose bravery you endlessly shared) to hold on by.</p></blockquote>

<p>You may wonder that I have begun my review with this postmortem. I dwell on it not only because it touched me more than I have been touched by a biography in many years, but because Damrosch earns my tears. I should turn next to two crucial aspects of Stevenson’s life: the quality of his writing and the extraordinary woman he married, who made him a better writer and gave him his happiest years.</p>

<p>*</p>


<blockquote><p>From breakfast on through all the day</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same way, I remember my early childhood encounter with a dramatic recording of <em>Treasure Island</em> (1883), in which the deaths of Billy Bones and Old Pew scared the bejesus out of me. I found stalwart adulthood in Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey but, like everyone else, was most beguiled by Long John Silver and his parrot, Captain Flint. Any boy of my generation would have wanted to be Jim Hawkins. In a late poem, “In the Attic,” Seamus Heaney seems to have felt the same:</p>

<blockquote><p>As I age and blank on names,</p></blockquote>

<p>Just weeks ago, I re-read <em>Treasure Island</em> in a cheap paperback with a cheesy cartoon for a cover and was transported once again by its perfect plotting and the lucid exactitude of its prose: an island snake hisses “with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top,” and tropical foliage has “a kind of poisonous brightness.” Call it a children’s book or a young adult novel or what you will, it’s bloody great—and pretty bloody, too. When Stevenson met Mark Twain in New York, the two must have wondered at having found their biggest success writing for young people, but both excelled at conveying the violence that makes our moral choices important and difficult. They understood what it means to grow.</p>

<p>*</p>


<blockquote><p>She was one of the strangest people who have lived in our time, a sort of savage nature in some ways, but very lovable—extraordinarily passionate, and unlike everyone else in her violent feelings and unrestrained ways of expressing them—full of gaiety, and with a genius for expressing things picturesquely. .<b> </b>.<b> </b>. I think R.L.S. must have caught some of his ways of feeling from her.<b> </b></p></blockquote>

<p>Gosse would, according to Damrosch, come “to resent what he saw as Fanny’s power over Louis, but still he admired her.”</p>

<blockquote><p>More than any of Louis’s biographers, Richard Holmes does justice to this remarkable union. “When one considers other Victorian literary marriages—Hardy’s, say, or Dickens’s—Stevenson’s is something phenomenal, dynamic, explosive. It contained energies, tempests, fireworks, and sheer anarchic excitement that would have obliterated any conventional household. To find anything like his relationship with Fanny—and the comparison is significant in the largest way—one would have to look forward to Lawrence and Frieda.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a kind of person who despises enthusiasm, or fears it, and cannot abide happiness in others. I have seen this. The same sort of person looks at a Cassandra and does not believe a word she says. Fanny was a Cassandra figure, partly in her bouts of gloominess compared to Louis’s general “optimism.” Stevenson’s parents had been worried about their son’s liaison with an older woman, yet they fell in love with her when they met her, which speaks well of them. Louis’s father, Thomas, a wealthy engineer whose own father had devised the famous Stevenson lighthouses, nicknamed his daughter-in-law Cassandra, only partly in jest. Margaret, Louis’s mother, was a more joyful figure, and proved to be resilient after her husband’s death, sailing with Louis’s gypsy family to the South Seas. Louis had grown up with money, abandoned engineering for law, then abandoned law for literature, but he had always been able to depend on an allowance to keep him afloat. Fanny’s life had been more precarious, her risk-taking more remarkable.</p>

<blockquote><p>Opposite him sits Mrs. Stevenson, the tutelary genius of Skerryvore, a woman of small physical stature, but surely of heroic mould. Her features are clear-cut and delicate, but marked by unmistakable strength of character; her hair of an unglossy black, and her complexion darker than one would expect in a woman of Dutch-American race. I have heard her speak of a Moorish strain in her ancestry. .<b> </b>.<b> </b>. Beneath a placid though always alert and vivacious exterior, Mrs. Stevenson conceals much personal suffering and continual anxieties under which many a stronger woman might well break down.</p></blockquote>
