    <h1>The teen mental illness epidemic is international – Part 1: The Anglosphere</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>It is now widely accepted that an </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">epidemic of mental illness began among American teens in the early 2010s</a><span>. What caused it? Many commentators point to events in the USA around that time, such as a particularly horrific school shooting in 2012. But if the epidemic started in many nations at the same time, then such country-specific theories would not work. We’d need to find a global event or trend, and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis doesn’t match the timing at all, as </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197121000853" rel="">Jean Twenge and I</a><span> have </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">shown</a><span>.</span></em></p><p><em><span>In our 2018 book </span><a href="https://www.thecoddling.com/" rel="">The Coddling of the American Mind</a><span>, Greg Lukianoff and I presented evidence that the same trends were happening in Canada and the United Kingdom—not just the rise in depression and anxiety, but also the overprotection of children, the rise of “safetyism,” and the shouting down of speakers on university campuses when students deemed the speaker to be “harmful.”  It seemed that all the Anglo nations were setting up their children for failure in the same ways at the same time. </span></em></p><p><em><span>In 2019 I went on a speaking tour of Australia and New Zealand (thanks to </span><a href="https://thinkinc.org.au/" rel="">Think Inc</a><span>) and discovered that the same trends were coming, more slowly, to the Southern hemisphere Anglo nations too.  I then created two new collaborative review documents, one for </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19maacSq_DYIaQ-IccCS3psBAvCy24GNt709Tl_L5AhM/edit" rel="">Australia</a><span>, and one for </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vq10ex65igy5PP2IQYjnjvbGaGUFBBo8VLQRtaS2KGI/edit" rel="">New Zealand</a><span>, to gather all the empirical studies and journalistic accounts I could find. </span></em></p><p><em><span>In early 2020, just as COVID swept in, I hired </span><a href="https://zach-rausch.com/" rel="">Zach Rausch</a><span> as a research assistant to help me handle these collaborative review docs. I connected with Zach, who was finishing his master’s degree in Psychological Science at SUNY New Paltz, after reading his </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/202002/gendered-values-in-higher-education" rel="">blog post</a><span> about his research related to The Coddling. Zach and I created many more collaborative review docs for many more countries and topics, which you can find (and add to) </span><a href="http://jonathanhaidt.com/reviews" rel="">on this page</a><span>.</span></em><span> </span></p><p><em><span>In 2021, as I was beginning to work on the </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-after-babel-substack" rel="">Babel project</a><span>, I told Zach that it was urgent that we figure out just how international the mental illness epidemic was. Is it just happening in the five countries of what is sometimes called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere" rel="">The Anglosphere</a><span>? Is it all Western countries? Is it happening everywhere? Go figure it out and report back to me. </span></em></p><p><em>The rest of this post is Part 1 of Zach’s report, in his voice. I think his findings are momentous and should cause an immediate global rethinking of what children need to have a healthy childhood, and what obstacles to development arrived around the globe around 2012. </em><span> </span></p><p><strong>— Jon Haidt</strong></p><p>When Jon first asked me to figure out whether teen mental health had collapsed around the globe after 2012, I thought he was nuts. The task felt impossible and beyond what I thought I could accomplish. But it was precisely this kind of work that I aspired to do. I set aside my doubt, put my head down, and gathered every relevant study I could find on teen mental health trends across the globe. In a series of posts, I will share with you what I have found so far. I address the Anglosphere today. In future posts, I’ll show what I have learned about Scandinavia and other developed nations and what I have learned from five international surveys, each with data from dozens of nations. There is much more to be done, especially beyond Western countries.</p><p><span>The short answer to Jon’s question is: </span><em>Teen mental health plummeted across the Western world in the early 2010s, particularly for girls and particularly in the most individualistic nations.</em><span> The longer answer begins below and will continue in parts 2 and 3.</span></p><p><span>As Jon mentioned in the introduction to this post, he and Greg Lukianoff had already found evidence that the mental illness epidemic was occurring in Canada, the UK, and the USA. But it has been more than four years since the publication of </span><em>The Coddling of the American Mind, </em><span>and we now have access to a lot more data, so let me run through the five countries. </span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">two</a><span> </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls" rel="">previous</a><span> posts of the </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/" rel="">After Babel Substack</a><span>, Jon has shown the astounding rise of mental illness among American adolescents since 2010. Therefore, I won’t cover the United States in much detail. However, I will include a few figures to provide a baseline for the countries we explore in the rest of this post. For each country, I try to show at least one graph or study on mood disorders (anxiety and/or depression), which is usually self-reported, and one on something related to self-harm or psychiatric hospitalization, which is usually not based on self-reports from teens. (Note that I defer the discussion of suicide rates to a future post. You can find data and graphs about suicide rates in each of the Collaborative Review Docs that I link to.) </span></p><p>Figure 1 shows the percentage of US teens since 2004 who reported having a major depressive episode in the last year. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png" width="1092" height="690" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:690,&#34;width&#34;:1092,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year" title="Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong><span> Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year.

National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).</span></em></p><p>To summarize, four trends emerged in the data from the USA, which we will call the “basic pattern.” They include:</p><blockquote><p>A) A substantial increase in adolescent anxiety and depression rates begins in the early 2010s.</p><p>B) A substantial increase in adolescent self-harm rates or psychiatric hospitalizations begins in the early 2010s.</p><p>C) The increases are larger for girls than for boys (in absolute terms).</p><p>D) The increases are larger for Gen Z than for older generations (in absolute terms). </p></blockquote><p><span>Note that there are two ways to calculate increases. We can measure an increase in </span><em>absolute</em><span> terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% of teens with a diagnosis is a ten percentage-point increase, or we can report it in </span><em>relative</em><span> terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% is a 300% increase, relative to the anchor point. Both are important. From a utilitarian or public health point of view, we care more about the absolute increase, for it tells us the number of people affected. From a psychological research point of view, we also care about the relative increase since a large relative increase may alert us that something is changing for that group, even if its illness rate only moves from 2.1% to 4.3%. We decided to report the relative changes on our graphs since that is hard to calculate by eye. For example, as shown in Figure 1, the </span><em>absolut</em><span>e increase from 2010 to 2021 was much larger for girls (17.3%) than for boys (7.1%), and that jumps out at you as soon as you look at the graph. However, the </span><em>relative</em><span> increase was slightly larger for boys (161%) than for girls (145%), which tells us that whatever is happening, it’s also affecting boys quite a lot. </span></p><p><span>With this basic pattern in mind, let’s move north to see how Canadian teens are doing.

Since 2010, there has been a 138% increase in self-harm hospitalization for 13-17-year-old girls (from a low of 294.0 per 100,000 teens in 2010 to a high of 701.6 per 100,000 in 2017). The boys show an increase too, but from a much lower baseline, and there is no spike around 2012. Again, the pattern and timing are very similar to the USA: no sign of a problem before 2010, and then something terrible happens to Canadian teens in the early 2010s, especially to the girls. </p><p>Overall, Canada also shares the basic pattern. Although we do not have specific changes in rates of anxiety and depression, we see a significant decline in mental well-being among young Canadians.

The percentage of young females (16-24) who reported high or very high psychological distress grew from 14.2% in 2013 to 35.1% in 2020. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png" width="1188" height="786" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:786,&#34;width&#34;:1188,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:197237,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Persons aged 16+ reporting high or very high psychological distress by age group and sex, 2002 to 2020.&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Persons aged 16+ reporting high or very high psychological distress by age group and sex, 2002 to 2020." title="Persons aged 16+ reporting high or very high psychological distress by age group and sex, 2002 to 2020." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F073c5655-3e7e-48b5-ad3c-4d641c8d9fdd_1188x786.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 10.</strong><span> Persons aged 16+ reporting high or very high psychological distress by age group and sex, 2002 to 2020. </span><a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/ba6da461-a046-44ac-9a7f-29d08a2bea9f/aihw-aus-240_Chapter_8.pdf.aspx" rel="">Australia&#39;s Health Snapshots 2022: Mental Health of Young Australians (2022)</a><span>.

Figure 14, with data from the New Zealand Ministry of Health, shows that in 2007, the percentage of 15-24-year-old males and females who said they had been given an anxiety diagnosis was approximately </span><strong>3%</strong><span>. By 2020, the percentage of young females with an anxiety diagnosis had grown to 24.8% (a</span><em> </em><span>259% increase compared to 2011). Males also rose to 9% in 2020 (a 131%</span><em> </em><span>increase). </span></p><p>These increases are so large, and the starting numbers are so low (just 3% of girls had an anxiety diagnosis in 2007?) that we suspect that this graph shows, in part, changing diagnostic criteria and greater awareness of anxiety. We do not believe that the underlying rates of anxiety disorders increased as quickly as the lines in Figure 11 suggest. Nonetheless, given what we are seeing in all of the Anglosphere countries, and given the self-harm data below, we believe that much or most of the rise is real. In any case, in 2007, only one in 30 girls thought she had an anxiety disorder; by 2020, it was one in four.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png" width="1108" height="658" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:658,&#34;width&#34;:1108,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Percent of New Zealand teens diagnosed with an anxiety disorder&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Percent of New Zealand teens diagnosed with an anxiety disorder" title="Percent of New Zealand teens diagnosed with an anxiety disorder" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F939c852c-2942-407c-808e-0230c22fd801_1108x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 14.</strong><span> “Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have an anxiety disorder?

The timing of that event is exactly the </span><em>opposite</em><span> of what you’d expect, namely: the epidemic should have started in 2009 and then gotten progressively </span><em>better</em><span> after 2012 as the economy improved in the USA and other countries. In an </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/academic-pressure-social-media" rel="">earlier post, Jean Twenge showed</a><span> that it can’t be caused by rising academic pressure either. And it certainly can’t be caused by the most popular theory we hear in the USA: school shootings and other stress-inducing events. Why would school shootings or active shooter drills implemented only in the USA lead to an immediate epidemic across the entire English-speaking world?</span></p><p>At this point, there is only one theory we know of that can explain why the same thing happened to girls in so many countries at the same time: the rapid global movement from flip phones (where you can’t do social media) to smartphones and the phone-based childhood. The first smartphone with a front-facing camera (the iPhone 4) came out in 2010, just as teens were trading in their flip phones for smartphones in large numbers. (Few teens owned an iPhone in its first few years). Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, which gave the platform a huge boost in publicity and users. So 2012 was the first year that very large numbers of girls in the developed world were spending hours each day posting photos of themselves and scrolling through hundreds of carefully edited photos of other girls. </p><p><span>If you suddenly transform the social lives of girls, putting them onto platforms that prioritize social comparison and performance, platforms where we know that </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(18)30060-9/fulltext" rel="">heavy users are three times more likely to be depressed</a><span> than light users, might that have some impact on the mental health of girls around the world? We think so, but if anyone can offer another explanation that fits the graphs we’ve shown in this post, we’d love to hear it. </span></p><p><span>This concludes the first part of my report. In Part 2, I’ll examine the Scandinavian countries. In Part 3, I’ll examine studies that collected evidence from multiple countries, mostly in Europe. In later posts, I’ll examine the limited data we have from non-Western nations. To give you a sneak preview, there </span><em>are</em><span> cultural variations within the West, and the Anglosphere was hit a bit harder than other regions. Whatever it was that changed about childhood in the early 2010s, it took the greatest toll on teens in the most individualistic nations. </span></p><p>Please tune in next week, and subscribe to the After Babel Substack if you have not already done so. (It’s free.)</p><p>Here is the list of open-source collaborative review documents that Jon and I curate to track the mental illness epidemic around the globe.
