					<p>Arthur Whitney is an esteemed computer scientist who led the design on a few well-known pieces of software:</p><ul><li>The A, K, and Q programming languages</li><li>kdb, a high-performance database built on K used in fintech</li><li>Shakti, which is like kdb but faster, designed for trillion-row datasets.</li></ul><p>I&#39;ve never even seen a trillion numbers, much less calculated them, but kdb is apparently a standard tool on Wall Street. They probably care about money, so I&#39;ll assume kdb does its job well.
His languages take significantly after APL, which was a very popular language for similar applications before the invention of (qwerty) keyboards.</p><p>But I&#39;m not here to talk about boring things like &#34;using software to make incomprehensible amounts of money in finance&#34; or &#34;human beings and their careers&#34;, I&#39;m here to talk about how a guy writes C code weird.
For a very simple version of the programming language K, there&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/kparc/ksimple">publicly available interpreter</a> he wrote in a few days using about 50 lines of C to show the basics of interpreter writing.

Opinions on his coding style are divided, though general consensus seems to be that it&#39;s incomprehensible.
As daunting as it is, I figured I should give it a chance for a few reasons.</p><ul><li>As I work on larger and larger codebases, scrolling up and down to track information has become a more common annoyance. Whitney&#39;s talked about coding the way he does to avoid exactly that: he wants to keep his logic on one screen.
Perhaps learning to read code like this could give me ideas on writing my own code more compactly.</li><li>In a Hacker News comments section, somebody asked &#34;would you rather spend 10 days reading 100,000 lines of code, or 4 days reading 1000?&#34;, and that raises a good point.
The complexity of the code is because even a simple interpreter is pretty complex. Writing it in 500 lines wouldn&#39;t make the complexity go away, it just spreads it out.
Does writing in this more compact format feel more daunting because you&#39;re exposed to more of the complexity at once? I think so.
Does showing it all at once actually help you understand the whole thing <em>faster</em>? I don&#39;t know. </li><li>Reading code has become a more important part of my job than writing it, so I should challenge my reading skills, regardless.</li><li>It confuses people, and that&#39;s basically the same as being smart.</li></ul><p>So I&#39;m going to go line by line and explain my understanding. I tried to use the notes provided in the repo only when I was stuck, which was a few times early on, but by the end I could understand it pretty well.</p><h2>A reading of a.h</h2><pre><code data-language="C">typedef char*s,c;</code></pre><p>This already shows some funky C. It defines <code>s</code> as <code>char *</code>, and <code>c</code> as <code>char</code>, because the <code>*</code> attaches to the name, not the type. It&#39;s an oddity of C syntax that I&#39;ve never been a fan of. Otherwise this is pretty straight forward: <code>s</code> is for string, and <code>c</code> is for character.</p><pre><code data-language="C">s Q=(s)128;</code></pre><p>Fuck. Shit. He assigned 128 to a string named <code>Q</code>. What does it mean? <code>s</code> is <code>char *</code>. Why is Q a pointer to the address 128? I thought I must have misunderstood, and <code>s</code> was actually a character or something, but it&#39;s clearly specified as <code>char *</code>. <code>s</code> is for string!
I couldn&#39;t figure out the meaning, so I soon gave up and looked at the annotated code. The <code>char *</code> is <code>unsigned long long</code> in other versions, and they explain that the type is used for both integers and pointers. The code operates on vectors of 8-bit integers, either as ASCII or numbers, so it makes some sense to use <code>char *</code> from a memory layout perspective, but I don&#39;t use pointers as integers very often.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define _(e...) ({e;})
#define x(a,e...) _(s x=a;e)
#define $(a,b) if(a)b;else
#define i(n,e) {int $n=n;int i=0;for(;i&lt;$n;++i){e;}}</code></pre><p>These are all pretty straight forward, with one subtle caveat I only realized from the annotated code.
They&#39;re all macros to make common operations more compact: wrapping an expression in a block, defining a variable <code>x</code> and using it, conditional statements, and running an expression <code>n</code> times.</p><p>The subtle thing the annotations point out is the first macro, <code>({e;})</code>. The parentheses around curly brackets make this a <em>statement expression</em>, a non-standard C extension that allows you to treat a block of statements as a single expression, if the last statement is an expression that provides a value. In other words, <code>int x = ({int a = func1(); int b = func2(a); a+b;});</code> sets <code>x</code> to whatever <code>a+b</code> is. This is used everywhere in the code after this.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define Q(e) if(Q==(e))return Q;
#define Qs(e,s) if(e)return err(__func__,s);
#define Qr(e) Qs(e,&#34;rank&#34;)
#define Qd(e) Qs(e,&#34;domain&#34;)
#define Qz(e) Qs(e,&#34;nyi&#34;)</code></pre><p>These are error macros using that mysterious <code>Q</code> defined earlier. <code>Q</code> seems to have been used to represent errors, possibly short for &#34;Quit&#34;. The <code>Qr/d/z</code> functions seem to be types of errors. I have no idea what &#34;nyi&#34; means (I figure it out later).</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define _s(f,e,x...) s f(x){return _(e);}
#define _i(f,e) _s(f,e,c x)
#define f(f,e)  _s(f,e,s x)
#define F(f,e)  _s(f,e,s a,s x)</code></pre><p>These replace function declarations, and we can see that <code>_</code> macro being used to add an implicit return.
<code>_s</code> could be used like</p><pre><code data-language="C">_s(my_function, puts(&#34;I rock!!!&#34;); x*5+e, s x, int e)</code></pre><p>, which would create basically this standard C:</p><pre><code data-language="C">char *my_function(char *x, int e) {
	puts(&#34;I rock!!!&#34;);
	return x*5+e;
}</code></pre><p>All the macros except the base <code>_s</code> also add implicit arguments like <code>a</code> and <code>x</code> and you bet it&#39;s hard to tell them apart.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define ax (256&gt;x)</code></pre><p>This was another one that baffled me until I looked at the annotations. Remember how I said <code>s</code> values were either integers or pointers? 256 is the cutoff value for these integers, which the annotations call <em>atoms</em>, so ax means &#34;is <code>x</code> an atom?&#34;</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define ix (c)x
#define nx x[-1]
#define xi x[i]</code></pre><p>These aren&#39;t too confusing. <code>ix</code> casts <code>x</code> to a <code>char</code>. <code>nx</code> implies <code>x</code> is some sort of fat pointer, meaning there&#39;s probably a length at <code>x[-1]</code>, but we&#39;ll see. <code>xi</code> just indexes <code>x</code> as a normal pointer, using our implicitly defined <code>i</code> from the <code>i(...)</code> macro.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define aa x(a,ax)
#define ia x(a,ix)
#define na x(a,nx)</code></pre><p>These copy <code>ax</code>, <code>ix</code>, and <code>nx</code> respectively to work on the <code>a</code> variable, which is an implicit argument in functions defined using the <code>F(f,e)</code> macro. You remembered the <code>x(name, expression)</code> macro for assigning to a locally-scoped <code>x</code>, right?</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define oo w(&#34;oo\n&#34;)</code></pre><p>It prints <code>oo</code>. It&#39;s not used anywhere.</p><h2>a reading of a.c</h2><p>I wound up not needing to refer to the annotated code at all to understand this. The C code is mostly using everything in the headers to build the interpreter.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define r(n,e) _(s r=m(n);i(n,r[i]=e)r)</code></pre><p>We create a vector <code>r</code> from <code>m(n)</code> (which is defined later (it&#39;s malloc)), fill <code>r</code> with the results of <code>e</code>, and return it out of the statement expression.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(w,write(1,ax?&amp;x:x,ax?1:strlen(x));x)</code></pre><p>This defines <code>s w(s x)</code>, which is our print function. If <code>x</code> is an atom (<code>ax?</code>), we print it as a single character by getting its address (<code>&amp;x</code>) and providing a length of 1. If it&#39;s a vector, we print it as a string using <code>strlen</code> to calculate how long it is, so now we also know vectors must be null-terminated here.
<code>write</code> and <code>strlen</code> are standard functions that we call without including the headers, because fuck headers. Let the linker figure it out.</p><pre><code data-language="C">F(err,w(a);w((s)58);w(x);w((s)10);Q)</code></pre><p>Our fancy shmancy error printing function, <code>s err(s a, s x)</code>. The confusing thing is that <code>:</code> and the newline are represented by their ASCII numbers 58 and 10, respectively. This just prints a message in the format <code>{a}:{x}\n</code> and returns our special error value <code>Q</code>.</p><pre><code data-language="C">_i(wi,s b[5];sprintf(b,&#34;%d &#34;,x);w(b);0)</code></pre><p>Defines <code>s wi(c x)</code>, which takes <code>x</code> as a <code>char</code>, formats it as an integer in up to <code>5*sizeof(char*)/sizeof(char)</code> characters (40 on 64-bit machines), and writes that.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(W,Q(x)$(ax,wi(ix))i(nx,wi(xi))w(10);x)</code></pre><p>Another print function, <code>s W(s x)</code> either writes <code>x</code> as an integer or a list of integers. It also refuses to print the <code>Q</code> vector.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(srt,Qz(1)0) f(uni,Qz(1)0) F(Cut,Qz(1)0) F(Drp,Qz(1)0)</code></pre><p>I figured out what <code>nyi</code> means! It means &#34;Not yet implemented&#34;, as we can see from these function definitions.</p><pre><code data-language="C">_i(m,s a=malloc(1+x);*a++=x;a)</code></pre><p>And we find our previously-used function <code>s m(c x)</code>, which allocates our buffer and returns a fat pointer (with the size at <code>x[-1]</code>, hence the <code>1+x</code> and <code>a++</code>). <code>x</code> is the length we&#39;re allocating here, which means our vectors are limited to 255 bytes. The repo suggests upgrading capacity as an exercise to the reader, which could be fun.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define A(c) ((s)memchr(a,c,na)?:a+na)-a</code></pre><p>This macro finds the first occurence of the character <code>c</code> in our vector <code>a</code> as an index into the string (hence the <code>-a</code>, since <code>memchr</code> returns a pointer). If the result is null, it just returns the length of the string (<code>a+na - a</code>). We see another fun bit of non-standard syntax, <code>?:</code>, which <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3319075/ternary-conditional-operator-behaviour-when-leaving-one-expression-empty">I had to look up</a>. <code>a ?: b</code> is equivalent to <code>a ? a : b</code> without evaluating <code>a</code> twice. Pretty snazzy!</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define g(a,v) ax?255&amp;a:r(nx,v)</code></pre><p>Strange little operation, I&#39;ll have to see it in action. If <code>x</code> is an atom, it clamps <code>a</code> to be an atom with a simple mask (<code>255&amp;a</code>), otherwise it creates a new vector the same size as <code>x</code> filled with the result from <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(not,g(!ix,!xi)) f(sub,g(-ix,-xi)) F(At,Qr(aa)g(a[ix],a[xi])) F(_A,Qr(aa)g(A(ix),A(xi)))</code></pre><p>Ah, I see now. <code>g(a, v)</code> lets us define functions that work on <em>both</em> atoms and vectors. If <code>x</code> is an atom, it returns the atom result clamped within the correct bounds. Otherwise it allocates a new vector and computes the other expression.
All the above functions work either on <code>x</code> as an integer (<code>ix</code>), or on every element of <code>x</code> (<code>xi</code>).</p><ul><li><code>s not(s x)</code> does boolean negation.</li><li><code>s sub(s x)</code> does arithmetic negation.</li><li><code>s At(s a, s x)</code> indexes into <code>a</code>, either to get one value or to shuffle them into a new vector. <code>a</code> has to be a vector.</li><li><code>s _A(s a, s x)</code> searches a vector <code>a</code> for the value of <code>x</code> and gives us the index, either one value or every value in the vector.</li></ul><p>This is a lot of functionality in such a small bit of code.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(ind,Qr(!ax)0&gt;ix?r(-ix,-ix-1-i):r(ix,i))
F(Ind,Qr(!aa)Qd(1&gt;ia)g(ix%ia,xi%ia))</code></pre><p>These are some atom-only functions.</p><ul><li><code>s ind(s x)</code> creates a vector of length <em>|x|</em> containing <code>0, 1... x-1</code> if <code>x</code> is positive, otherwise it contains <code>-x-1, -x-2... 0</code>. </li><li><code>s Ind(s a, s x)</code> does <code>x</code> modulo <code>a</code>, either on <code>x</code> as an integer or every value of the vector <code>x</code>.</li></ul><p>Honestly, I can buy that this method of coding produces fewer bugs, once you can actually write it, since you work only on small building blocks of the logic and reuse them. Like, where could a bug for <code>ind</code> even be? Maybe an off-by-one in <code>-ix-1-i</code>, but it&#39;s hard to miss what&#39;s happening once you can see the trees through the forest.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define G(f,o) F(f,ax?aa?255&amp;ia o ix:Ltn==f?f(sub(x),sub(a)):f(x,a):r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))</code></pre><p>That&#39;s too many trees! I can&#39;t understand this many nested ternary operators at the same time because I&#39;m not the alien from <em>Arrival</em>. I process things in linear time. I have to chunk this up.</p><pre><code data-language="C">F(f, ax ?
		aa ?
			255 &amp; ia o ix
			: Ltn==f ? 
				f(sub(x),sub(a))
				: f(x,a)
		: r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))</code></pre><p>Okay, I see. It&#39;s 3 cases from 2 conditions: <code>x</code> is an atom or a vector, and <code>a</code> is an atom or a vector.</p><ul><li><code>x</code> and <code>a</code> are atoms: apply some operator <code>o</code> to both values and clamp to 8 bits. I also didn&#39;t realize the bitwize and (<code>&amp;</code>) had a lower precedence than the operators this macro is used on, meaning it&#39;s always 
<code>`C
255 &amp; (ia o ix)</code>`.</li><li><code>x</code> is an atom and <code>a</code> is a vector: run this function with the arguments swapped. If the function is <code>Ltn</code>, also negate the arguments, since less-than depends on argument order.</li><li><code>x</code> is a vector: create a new vector, either applying <code>a</code> or each value of <code>a</code> to <code>x</code> using the operator. It assumes vector <code>a</code> is at least as long as <code>x</code>, or it&#39;ll index past the end of <code>a</code>.</li></ul><pre><code data-language="C">G(Ltn,&lt;)G(Eql,==)G(Not,!=)G(Sum,+)G(Prd,*)G(And,&amp;)G(Or,|)</code></pre><p>Using our fancy new macro, we quickly define seven new functions for the vectors, where they&#39;re all element-wise applications of binary operators.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(cat,Qr(!ax)r(1,ix)) F(Cat,a=aa?cat(a):a;x=ax?cat(x):x;s r=m(na+nx);memcpy(r+na,x,nx);memcpy(r,a,na))</code></pre><p>I was confused by the first function, but I see now these are <code>cat</code> as in &#34;concatenate&#34;. For an atom, it creates a vector of length 1 containing that atom. <code>Cat</code> does the more complex work of joining two vectors together, running <code>cat</code> on each value if it&#39;s an atom to get a list.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(at,At(x,0)) f(rev,Qr(ax)At(x,ind(255&amp;-nx))) f(cnt,Qr(ax)nx)</code></pre><p>Some more simple functions. Lil <code>at</code> gets the first item of <code>x</code>; <code>rev</code> reverses the list using our <code>ind</code> function to generate the list of indeces in reverse, which is a little overkill but vectors are 256 bytes at max and memory is never freed so who cares; and <code>cnt</code> gets the size of <code>x</code>.</p><pre><code data-language="C">F(Tak,Qr(!aa||ax)Qd(0&gt;ia||ia&gt;nx)At(x,ind(a))) F(Sub,Sum(a,sub(x))) F(Mtn,Ltn(x,a)) f(qz,Qz(1)0)</code></pre><p>Some more simple functions. <code>Tak</code> returns the first <code>a</code> characters from the vector <code>x</code> as a new list; <code>Sub</code> subtracts; <code>Mtn</code> is &#34;more than&#34;; and <code>qz</code> returns our &#34;not yet implemented&#34; error.</p><pre><code data-language="C">#define v(e) ((strchr(V,e)?:V)-V)</code></pre><p>A shorthand to get the first occurence of a character from a string <code>V</code>, returning an offset into the array or zero if it&#39;s not present. This seems ambiguous, since that&#39;s also the result if we match with the first character, but we&#39;ll see.</p><pre><code data-language="C">s U[26],V=&#34; +-*&amp;|&lt;&gt;=~!@?#_^,&#34;,
(*f[])()={0,abs,sub,qz ,qz,rev,qz ,qz, qz ,not,ind,at,uni,cnt,qz ,srt,cat},
(*F[])()={0,Sum,Sub,Prd,And,Or,Ltn,Mtn,Eql,Not,Ind,At,_A ,Tak,Drp,Cut,Cat};</code></pre><p>Ah, we have seen. The first character of <code>V</code> is a space, and it looks like the arrays of function pointers match up with the characters of <code>V</code> to give us our functions, with space being null. However, I think <code>abs</code> is from the standard library here, since it&#39;s not defined anywhere else? That seems like a bug. It&#39;d work for atoms, but it&#39;d break vectors.
This also defines an array of 26 vectors, which I assume will be our variables. </p><pre><code data-language="C">_i(n, 10u&gt;x-48? x-48 : 26u&gt;x-97? U[x-97] : 0)</code></pre><p><code>s n(c x)</code> reads a char and returns one of several things. I&#39;ll have to consult an ASCII table.</p><ul><li>If <code>x</code> is between 48 and 57 (inclusive), we subtract 48 and return that. Meaning, if <code>x</code> is an ASCII character representing 0-9, we subtract 48 so it&#39;s the <em>integer</em> 0-9, rather than the character. It&#39;s phrased strangely, <code>10u &gt; x-48</code>, instead of the more obvious <code>x&gt;47&amp;&amp;58&gt;x</code>. Maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s two characters shorter. Maybe Arthur wanted to show the <em>length</em> of the span of characters (10) more than the start and end, which this does once you understand it. Maybe he just thought the underflow trickery was neat.</li><li>If <code>x</code> is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), it&#39;s a lowercase character of the alphabet in ASCII, in which case the function returns one of our variables from the <code>U</code> array, mapping &#39;a&#39; to &#39;z&#39;.</li><li>Otherwise, the function returns 0.</li></ul><p>So it looks like this function is specifically to read values, either numerals or variables, all of which are one character.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(e,s z=x;c i=*z++;!*z?n(i):v(i)?x(e(z),Q(x)f[v(i)](x)):x(e(z+1),Q(x)58==*z?U[i-97]=x:_(c f=v(*z);Qd(!f)F[f](n(i),x))))</code></pre><p>Uh, let&#39;s spread this out a little.</p><pre><code data-language="C">f(e, s z=x; c i=*z++; !*z ? n(i)
	: v(i) ? x(e(z), Q(x) f[v(i)](x))
		: x(e(z+1), Q(x) 58==*z ? U[i-97]=x 
			: _(c f=v(*z); Qd(!f) F[f](n(i),x))))</code></pre><p>Okay, easy. It&#39;s a recursive function that checks each character of vector <code>x</code>, called <code>i</code>.
If we&#39;re at the end of the string, we check if <code>i</code> is a value and return it.
Otherwise, we first check if it&#39;s an operator (from our <code>V</code> string). If it is, we evaluate the rest of the string, check for errors, and then apply the operation to the result from the rest of the evaluation.
If it wasn&#39;t an operation, we evaluate the rest of the string, skipping one character. If the skipped character is a colon (ASCII 58), we assign the result of the evaluation to one of the slots in <code>U</code> (if the character <code>i</code> is not a lowercase ASCII letter, this will corrupt memory, so don&#39;t write bugs).</p><p>I&#39;m pretty sure spaces are a syntax error in every location, and I don&#39;t see code to create array literals.
If the skipped character is an operator, we instead apply that binary operator on the evaluation result and <code>n(i)</code>, which is either a variable or a number.
This means code is executed from right to left, with no operator precedent, which is standard for APL-type languages from what I understand.
Because this language has only single-character variable names, numbers, and operators, this is all the tokenizing, parsing, and evaluation we need.</p><pre><code>C int main(){c b[99]; while(1) if(w(32),b[read(0,b,99)-1]=0,*b) 58==b[1] ? e(b) : W(e(b));}</code></pre><p>And finally, <code>main</code>.
In an infinite loop, we read up to 99 characters from a user, and then write the evaluated result of that text.</p><p><em>Et voila</em>. We have a tiny interpreter for a simple array language. It&#39;s not exactly production-ready, but it does quite a lot in its tiny footprint.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>I think I can say I understand this code pretty well, even more than most code I read. I don&#39;t know how much of that is because of the coding style, or because I spent eight hours writing several thousand words about fifty lines of code in a borderline-delusional fugue state brought on by drinking one small Starbucks™ Frapuccino® (Mocha® Flavored*) I bought from a gas station at 10 PM on a Thursday.</p><p>I had some fun dreams about macros with one-character names applying operations on scalars and vectors that morning (I went to sleep at 6:40 AM).</p><p>All in all, it was a fun exercise. To summarize my thoughts:</p><h3>Good ideas</h3><ul><li><strong>Well-considered primitives.</strong> I&#39;ve read and written a lot of macro-ridden C, but this feels like a proper little language designed with composable, useful macros that removed enough repetition to make common operations, like iteration, easy to decipher. In other languages, higher-order functions and similar constructs could be used the same way.</li><li><strong>Fewer lines</strong>. I didn&#39;t have to scroll so much when I forgot what a macro or a function did! I have a wide screen monitor, I don&#39;t need lines limited to 10-20 characters of actual code most of the time.
If people can read English in compact paragraphs, why not code?</li></ul><h3>Bad ideas</h3><ul><li><strong>Non-semantic types</strong>. I was completely baffled by the <code>char *</code> being treated as an integer at first, and simply assumed I was misunderstanding the code somehow until I checked the annotated version.
In my own code, I use types as one of the core building blocks. What the data <em>is</em> defines how I use it.
For a full interpreter, this would be a custom type anyway, since right now it assumes <code>malloc</code> will never give it a pointer to an address less than 256, which is probably true but not guaranteed, and also the integer 128 is reserved for invalid results, which is probably the bigger limitation.</li><li><strong>Code golf</strong>. I can understand the large gains to density like macros, and even the medium gains like short names, but there&#39;s a point where the code becomes significantly harder to follow for very minor gains, such as the use of ASCII codes like <code>58</code> instead of character literals like <code>&#39;:&#39;</code>, or the use of <code>10u&gt;x-48</code> instead of <code>x&gt;48&amp;&amp;58&gt;x</code> for checking if <code>x</code> is within a range.
And while I think more code can be put on a line, I&#39;m not throwing out my space key just yet, epecially between function declarations.</li></ul><h3>Ideas I&#39;m ambivalent about</h3><ul><li><strong>Non-standard syntax.</strong> There&#39;s some very interesting features in this code that utilize GCC-specific extensions, like <code>a ?: b</code> ternaries and statement expressions. I don&#39;t typically need to compile for everything on earth, so learning the tricks of one reasonably cross-platform compiler isn&#39;t a bad idea.
At the same time, even using clang, the same compiler Arthur was using, I had to include <code>stdio.h</code> due to not linking <code>sprintf</code> otherwise. If I wanted to build using Visual Studio I&#39;d just have to rewrite a bunch of stuff.
Also, compiling without <code>-w</code> generates almost three compiler warnings per line of code. Those are useful sometimes, if they aren&#39;t flooded!</li><li><strong>Implicit arguments</strong>. Many of the density gains in this code come from using the variables <code>x</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>i</code> in nearly every context, allowing macros to use them by default and skip listing other parameters. I didn&#39;t find it to be a problem after a brief adjustment, but it&#39;s also a very small codebase.
Implicit arguments are a feature in many dynamically typed languages, and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">&#34;point-free&#34; or &#34;tacit&#34; programming</a>, but it&#39;s fallen out of style due to its difficulty to parse at first glance.
Whitney&#39;s languages all being based around tacit programming is surely an influence on his tendency to make arguments implicit.</li><li><strong>Short names.</strong> Beyond the very first introduction, there&#39;d be virtually no benefit to renaming <code>ax</code> as <code>vector_is_atom(x)</code>, <code>_(...)</code> as &#39;execute(...)&#39;, or most other primitives after they&#39;re introduced.
Most are small enough that you can parse what it does right away.
However, this doesn&#39;t lend any signal as to <em>why</em> it does. You have to figure out what it does from context.
For code that&#39;s meant to be read by another person, there should probably be some explanation as to <em>why</em> a primitive does what it does, even if it has a short name. This is especially true of more complex operations, like the evaluation function <code>e</code>.</li><li><strong>Nested ternary operators</strong>. Too confusing for me to follow without parentheses, especially without whitespace.</li></ul><p>This coding style feels most appropriate for &#34;done&#34; code, or code that&#39;s been worked out on paper or some other environment and is now being written down in a compact way. It&#39;s more like finalized mathematical notation than typical code.
I don&#39;t see myself being able to effectively write code like this, since I tend to quickly jot down ideas, compile and run to validate, and edit what I&#39;ve done based on the results. Making a small set of good primitives and building heavily on those requires basically having solved the problem before writing a single line. Otherwise you get bad primitives that cause more confusion than help, and adjusting those primitives would involve rewriting all the code that depends on them, which is all the code.</p><p>But I think that&#39;s my key takeaway: I tend to work out problems <em>in the code</em>, which can lead to messy results. I write the dumbest possible solution, and then have to try and refactor as I develop a better mental model of the problem.
What I like most about this code isn&#39;t how few characters are used, or everything fitting in one screen. I like how it seems the code was well-understood <em>before</em> it was written. You can&#39;t refactor a 500-line jumble of C into code like this.</p><p>The real lesson is that I&#39;m probably too quick to jump into coding things. I could spend more time working out how I want to model a problem in a more free-form way, like writing notation on paper, before jumping into the rigid world of programming syntax.
With a clear mental model, I can then write code in terms of how I was <em>thinking</em> about the problem, instead of thinking about the problem in terms of how I wrote the code.</p><h2>Next time</h2><p>I think a fun exercise would be to extend this interpreter while maintaining its code style, to see how I fare actually working with it. The repository this came from <a href="https://github.com/kparc/ksimple">has various suggested exercises</a>, but my ideas would be adding the following:</p><ul><li>Swapping the bytes for float vectors</li><li>Vectors longer than 255 values</li><li>Multi-character numbers</li><li>Array literals (you can do it with comma, but that runs <code>cat</code> on every value, which isn&#39;t ideal)</li><li>Whitespace insensitivity</li><li>Memory management</li><li>The unimplemented functions</li><li>Multi-character variable names</li><li>Multi-character operators</li><li>Indication for syntax errors</li></ul>
