His monologue suggested Trump supporters were trying to reframe the shooter’s political ties, which drew backlash from the FCC and major ABC affiliates. ABC replaced the program with reruns, sparking accusations of censorship and igniting a boycott campaign against Disney, its parent company.</p><h2><strong>Overwhelming public reaction</strong></h2><p>The suspension triggered strong responses across social media and beyond. Hashtags like #CancelDisneyPlus and #CancelHulu trended as users shared screenshots of their canceled subscriptions.</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Disney+ streaming service logo against a blue gradient background" loading="lazy" width="960" height="502" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YYxA6N2NVbFT1zh7tJSvcw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUwMjtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/79e9a3b0-9507-11f0-adff-45492b5d7fc4"/></p><dialog aria-label="Modal Dialog" aria-modal="true"></dialog></div><figcaption><p>Disney+ faced cancellation surges after Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension sparked boycotts.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Lawmakers, unions, and advocacy groups joined the conversation, framing the move as an attack on free expression rather than a programming choice.</p><h2><strong>“The page … keeps crashing”</strong></h2><p>With cancellations surging, many subscribers reported technical issues. On <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1nkm8h9/disney_executives_and_jimmy_kimmel_are_meeting/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit’s r/Fauxmoi;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Reddit’s r/Fauxmoi</a>, one post read, “The page to cancel your Hulu/Disney+ subscription keeps crashing.”</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Hulu and Disney+ streaming service logos on a dark blue background" loading="lazy" width="955" height="489" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aDIWsizCeuH98yWYgsu5OQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ5MjtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/cc762590-9507-11f0-9fdf-ecc19123d063"/></p><dialog aria-label="Modal Dialog" aria-modal="true"></dialog></div><figcaption><p>Both Hulu and Disney+ saw spikes in cancellations as viewers protested Kimmel’s suspension.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Another added, “Already cancelled my <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://creators.yahoo.com/lifestyle/story/5-outfits-that-will-for-sure-get-you-kicked-out-of-disneyland-only-your-kids-are-allowed-to-wear-the-1st-one-170556131.html" data-ylk="slk:Disney;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;">Disney</a> subscription,” while others said they faced looping logins and stalled forms. These firsthand accounts suggest Disney’s systems struggled under the unusual traffic volume.</p><h2><strong>Affiliate pressure and scheduling changes</strong></h2><p>Affiliate owners played a direct role in the fallout. Sinclair announced it would air a Charlie Kirk tribute special during Kimmel’s slot and demanded an apology, while Nexstar also refused to broadcast new episodes.</p><p>Some local stations filled the timeslot with local news or alternative programming instead of reruns, widening the impact beyond one network show.</p><h2><strong>Why people are canceling</strong></h2><p>For many, the suspension represents a larger issue. Critics argue Disney and ABC bowed to political pressure at the expense of free speech.</p><p>A Reddit user summed up the sentiment: “If they don’t apologize to high heavens to him, we all need to continue to boycott all Disney &amp; ABC services, including Hulu.” Posts like this echo the frustration fueling subscription losses.</p><h2><strong>Next steps for subscribers and Disney</strong></h2><p>If you want to cancel, try clearing cookies, switching browsers, or using Disney’s live chat for confirmation if the cancellation flow freezes. Always keep screenshots of your request and watch billing cycles to confirm the change processed.</p><figure><div><p><img alt="Smartphone screen displaying the Disney+ logo on a blue background" loading="lazy" width="960" height="639" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/43Y_YZEn4VgLQ9IMrovY4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYzOTtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/f87b1be0-9508-11f0-9757-18700a000867"/></p><dialog aria-label="Modal Dialog" aria-modal="true"></dialog></div><figcaption><p>Disney+ subscribers reported cancellation pages crashing as they tried to quit in protest.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For Disney, the challenge is bigger: balancing affiliate demands, political scrutiny, and customer trust while subscription churn becomes public proof of consumer backlash.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>What began as a late-night monologue has escalated into a company-wide flashpoint. Disney now faces mounting cancellations, technical strain on its cancellation page, and reputational fallout tied to questions of censorship and free speech.</p><p>As one Reddit user noted, “I also cancelled my Disney+ today after deciding there is no way for me to return.” Whether Disney reinstates Kimmel or holds the line, the decision will shape not just its brand but its subscriber base moving forward.</p></div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2025-02%2Fdfcd4aa0-f5df-11ef-abcf-e3b6ca6ac21d&amp;thumbnail=160%2C160%2Cauto&amp;compress=1&amp;progressive=1&amp;quality=100&amp;client=hawkeye&amp;signature=481580a7359461964576287058cf57b785ed59dd"/></p></div></div><p><span>Hi there!
