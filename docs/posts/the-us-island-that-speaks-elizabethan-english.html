The people here just have their own way of speaking: it&#39;s like someone took Elizabethan English, sprinkled in some Irish tones and 1700s Scottish accents, then mixed it all up with pirate slang. But the Hoi Toider dialect is more than a dialect. It&#39;s also a culture, one that&#39;s slowly fading away. With each generation, fewer people play meehonkey, cook the traditional foods or know what it is to be &#34;mommucked&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>In an effort to put his &#34;America first&#34; stamp on the nation&#39;s speech, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order making <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgq5pzpllo">English the country&#39;s official language<!-- --></a>. It marks the first time in the US&#39;s nearly 250-year history that the nation has had an official language. Yet, on this small 9.6-square-mile island surrounded by the swirling waters of the Atlantic, residents still speak what is arguably the most English version of English in the country – and many Americans don&#39;t understand it.<!-- --></p><p>As the island&#39;s <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="with%20origins%20dating%20back%20to%20the%201600s,%20Ocracoke%20Brogue%20is%20about%20as%20American%20as%20it%20gets.https://www.visitocracokenc.com/island-brogue/">official website<!-- --></a> proudly proclaims: &#34;With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Located 20 miles from the North Carolina mainland, Ocracoke Island is fairly isolated. You can&#39;t drive there as there are no bridges, and most people can’t fly either as there are no commercial flights. If you want to go there, it has to be by boat. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, that meant Ocracoke was a perfect spot for pirates to hide, as no soldiers were going to search 16 miles of remote beaches and forests for wanted men.<!-- --></p><div data-component="ad-slot" data-testid="ad-unit"></div><p>William Howard was one of those outlaws, serving as quartermaster on Blackbeard’s ship Queen Anne’s Revenge. Leaving before Blackbeard’s final battle in 1718, Howard made his way to Virginia, eventually taking the general pardon offered by King George I to all pirates. But unlike some, Howard had a plan. For several decades, he dropped out of sight, only to reappear in 1759 when he bought Ocracoke Island for £105 from a man named Richard Sanderson, a justice and later a General Assembly member in mainland North Carolina.<!-- --></p><p>Howard settled down along with some other ex-pirates and started building a community with boat pilots who had been stationed on the island to help guide merchant ships around sandbars in the area. A mainland North Carolina Native American tribe also interacted with the early settlers. The Woccon tribe had set up fishing and hunting outposts on the island, which they called Woccocock. Through misspellings and mispronunciations, it became Wokokon, Oakacock and Okercock, before finally arriving at the current version of Ocracoke in the mid-1700s. So at this point, there were Native Americans, English sailors and pirates from a variety of places all in one location. And that isolated community of just under 200 started blending words and dialects, and eventually building its own way of speaking.  <!-- --></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s the only American dialect that is not identified as American,&#34; said Dr Walt Wolfram, a North Carolina State University professor who studied the Ocracoke dialect for more than 20 years and currently works as the director of NC State’s <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://languageandlife.org/">Language and Life Project<!-- --></a>. &#34;That&#39;s fascinating to me. You can find pronunciation, grammar structures and vocabulary on Ocracoke that are not found anywhere else in North America.&#34;<!-- --></p><div data-component="video-block" data-testid="fabl-video-container"><div></div></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>VIDEO: Click the play button above to watch &#34;The last British accent in the US&#34;<!-- --></figcaption></p><p>Howard&#39;s community lived in near-isolation for almost two centuries. Electricity didn&#39;t arrive at the island until 1938 and a ferry service didn&#39;t start until 1957, leaving the islanders cut off except for the occasional supply trip to the mainland. Even today, things are a bit different for the island&#39;s <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/north-carolina/ocracoke">676 residents<!-- --></a> than on mainland North Carolina.<!-- --></p><div data-component="ad-slot" data-testid="ad-unit"></div><p>&#34;You have to be a certain type of individual to enjoy living here,&#34; said Chip Stevens, an island resident directly descended from Howard and the former owner of the local hotel <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blackbeardslodge.com/">Blackbeard&#39;s Lodge<!-- --></a>. &#34;There isn&#39;t a Lowes or a Harris Teeter or any [supermarkets]. Rarely does anyone go off the island without a cooler [to bring back supplies]. You have to be almost a holistic person, capable of dealing with less of a hectic nightlife lifestyle.&#34;<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets</span></p></div></div><p>Yes, mobile phones and laptops still work here, and if you want to sit down and watch some Major League Baseball in a pub, there are plenty of options. But in many other ways, the island is a throwback to a time before internet and television. Instead of cinemas, there are outdoor theatre groups. Local teashops, spice markets and other family-owned stores take the place of chain supermarkets. Cars are allowed on the 16 mile-long island, but most people just park them and walk everywhere. The island&#39;s children all attend one school, while residents work as everything from fishermen to brewery owners to woodworkers.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s amazing how coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country,&#34; Stevens said, sitting on the hotel&#39;s front porch. &#34;You feel that separation. It&#39;s a really nice feeling, being able to give your kids some freedom. When I was a kid, we&#39;d leave [home] after breakfast, eat lunch at somebody else&#39;s house, walk to the beach, take a rowboat out in the water, and our parents never had to worry about us. We&#39;ve maintained a lot of that.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>And they&#39;ve still – just – maintained their unique way of speaking.<!-- --></p><div data-component="ad-slot" data-testid="ad-unit"></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://maxmynter.substack.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p07dqgdm.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="William Graham/Alamy The island’s isolation preserved the Hoi Toider dialect, a mix of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents, and pirate slang (Credit: William Graham/Alamy)"/><span>William Graham/Alamy</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>The island’s isolation preserved the Hoi Toider dialect, a mix of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents, and pirate slang (Credit: William Graham/Alamy)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>When older Ocracoke natives, or &#34;O&#39;cockers&#34; as they call themselves, speak, the &#34;I&#34; sound is an &#34;oi&#34;, so they say &#34;hoi&#34; instead of &#34;high&#34;. That&#39;s where the Hoi Toider name comes from: it&#39;s based on how the O&#39;cockers say &#34;high tide&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>Then there are the phrases and vocabulary, many of which are also kept over from the original British and Irish settlers. For example, when you&#39;re on Ocracoke, someone might &#34;mommuck a buck before going up the beach&#34;, which means &#34;to tease a friend before going off the island&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;We have a lot of words that have been morphed to make our own,&#34; said Amy Howard, another of William Howard&#39;s descendants, who runs the <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.villagecraftsmen.com/">Village Craftsmen<!-- --></a>, a local arts and crafts store. &#34;[Hoi Toider] is a combination from a whole blend of cultures. A lot of the early settlers were well travelled, so they ran into lots of different types of people. For example, the word &#34;pizer&#34; we use comes from [a European] word which means porch. So if you&#39;re going to be sitting on your pizer, you&#39;re sitting on your porch.&#34;<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>Coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country</span></p></div></div><div data-component="ad-slot" data-testid="ad-unit"></div><p>There&#39;s a long list of words in Ocracoke vocabulary that are taken from countries across the globe. &#34;Quamish&#34;, for example, means sick or nauseated. It comes from the 16th-Century English word &#34;qualm&#34;. Then there&#39;s &#34;buck&#34;, which means a male friend. You can trace that back to 13th-Century Germany, where it originally meant a male deer, as it does in most English-speaking places today.<!-- --></p><p>Locals even made up words in some cases. For example, early settler children played a game of hide and seek called meehonkey. Everyone would hide and call out &#34;meehonkey&#34; while one person tried to find them. According to island tradition, Amy told me, the kids believed meehonkey was the sound a goose made as it flew by. Then there&#39;s &#34;dingbatter&#34;, which is used for anyone who isn’t a native.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://maxmynter.substack.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw8z2g.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Ocracoke is home to a British cemetery and some residents still speak with an Elizabethan-esque brogue (Credit: Alamy)"/><span>Alamy</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Ocracoke is home to a British cemetery and some residents still speak with an Elizabethan-esque brogue (Credit: Alamy)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>But with each generation, the dialect is starting to disappear.

In the beginning, settlers often had to come up with alternatives when they didn&#39;t have the right ingredients for a recipe.
