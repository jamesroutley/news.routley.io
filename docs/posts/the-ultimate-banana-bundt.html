<p><span id="more-21294"></span>I often ask Mr Gochugaru what cake he would like me to make for him, and he often replies &#8216;coffee and walnut cake&#8217;. Then I head to the kitchen and make yet another banana cake. Two reasons: 1) I like banana cake and 2) I don&#8217;t like buttercream icing, with or without the coffee flavour.</p>
<p>My addition to <em>this</em> banana bundt (there are earlier versions: <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2023/11/gluten-free-banana-bundt/">gluten-free</a>, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2023/08/chocolate-chocolate-banana-bundt/">chocolate</a>, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2023/04/banana-bundt/">plain</a>, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2023/07/banana-and-poppy-seed-bundt/">poppy seeds</a>, <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2023/06/date-banana-and-tahini-bundt/">date and tahini</a> , <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2015/10/black-sesame-and-banana-cake/">black sesame</a> and <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2021/02/baby-banana-bundts/">in miniature</a>) was to pour on a chocolate ganache, then top with pecan nuts roasted with maple syrup and miso paste. The pecan nut topping was shown to me by Brasenose Girl, who had made the <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/miso-and-maple-pecan-butter-mochi-cake">Miso-and-Maple-Pecan Butter Mochi Cake</a> by <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com">Bon Appétit</a>. The chocolate ganache is what I use as a filling for my chocolate macarons (that&#8217;s another big project to write up).</p>
<p>The cake was so well received at one of our family Christmas meals that I only had the one photo of it. It is now the Chinese New Year, and with an extended family lunch this weekend I decided to make another one. It&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds as the bananas have to be ripened beyond recognition as a fruit worthy of eating. The problem is that we often have bananas with our breakfast cereal, and they disappear before I can use them for cake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The CNY banana bundt had a white chocolate ganache and the same pecan nut topping</p>

<p>A word of caution. In between the Christmas and CNY banana bundts I had made another bundt but using self-raising flour, instead of plain flour plus raising agents. That cake crashed into disaster territory and was unsalvageable. It went wholesale into the bin and I went back to the drawing board. My next two cakes, using double the recipe below, were baked in two <a href="https://www.usapan.com">USA Pan</a> <a href="https://www.usapan.com/9-x-4-x-4-pullman-loaf-pan-cover1170pm">Pullman loaf pans (small size)</a>. They came out all risen, springy to the touch and beautifully brown and fragrant. These loaves were for a church event and in my excitement that they did not bomb, I forgot to take any photos.</p>
<p>I often tinker with my banana-based cake recipes but have now decided to write a definitive recipe for a plain-without-any-additions banana bread/ cake. This is based on <a href="https://www.nigella.com/recipes/banana-bread">Nigella Lawson&#8217;s Banana Bread</a> i.e. page 33 of How to be a Domestic Goddess. I had to buy a whole new book as several pages in the original book were really worn out. Then I found another in a charity shop which I bought, just in case. The addition of the soured cream is to encourage a lift in the cake. I have tried buttermilk and Greek yoghurt, but soured cream gives the best cake results.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Bundt:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">130 g unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">350 g very ripe bananas, lightly crushed</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">150 g golden caster sugar</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2 large eggs</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">225 g plain flour</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</p>
<p>1 pinch fine sea salt</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">100 g sour cream</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
<p>10 g each softened butter and plain flour to line the Bundt pan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need a <a href="https://www.nordicware.com/products/6-cup-anniversary-bundt-pan/">6 Cup Anniversary Bundt Pan</a>. The cake can also be made in a 2 pound / 900 g loaf tin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C fan.</p>
<p>Brush 10 g of softened butter evenly over the entire inside of the Bundt pan, taking care to fill every corner.</p>
<p>Sift over 10 g of flour, moving the pan around to coat evenly. Remove the excess flour by turning the pan upside down and giving it a tap (do this over a sink). Set the pan aside.</p>
<p>Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt into a large bowl and set aside.</p>
<p>In a large mixing bowl (I use a KitchenAid with a flex edge beater), beat the butter and sugar until lighter in colour and texture.</p>
<p>Add in the flour mixture and eggs. Beat on a low speed until you get a smooth batter.</p>
<p>Add the bananas, soured cream and vanilla extract. Beat again on a low speed until everything looks homogenous i.e. there are no obvious lumps.</p>
<p>Remove the mixing bowl from the stand mixer and pour the cake mixture into the Bundt pan.</p>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes, or until the cake bounces back when touched. A metal skewer inserted in the centre should come out clean.</p>
<p>Make the ganache whilst the cake is baking (recipe below).</p>
<p>Leave the cake to cool slightly in the tin before turning out onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</p>
<p>Pour over the chocolate ganache.</p>
<p>Sprinkle over the pecan-miso-maple topping (see recipe next post).</p>
<p>The cake will slice into eight thin and eight thicker pieces – be prepared to have no leftovers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chocolate ganache: place 150 g of double cream in a small saucepan and bring to nearly boiling point then switch off the heat. Add 150 g of 70% dark chocolate OR white chocolate chips. Stir with a metal whisk until the chocolate has completely melted into the cream. Set aside until the cake is completely cold, give the ganache a quick stir then pour over the cake.</p>
