    <h1>Analyzing Carbon Dioxide levels while attending IETF-115 in London, UK</h1>

<p>
Just before this 6th-ish trip for the year I decided to purchase an
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aranet4&amp;oq=aranet4&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l2j69i60l3.2033j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><i>aranet4</i></a> \(CO_2\) sensor.  There is some belief that by measuring
\(CO_2\) you can indirectly measure your risk to airborne viruses,
since more \(CO_2\) means you may be around more exhaled air.  The
<i>aranet4</i> is a factory calibrated, Non-Dispersive InfraRed sensor
(NDIR), and is considered to be one of the more accurate sensors for
consumer use.  I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saf.aranetCube.android">aranet4 Android App</a> to configure and
gather the results from the sensor (using its csv export feature).
</p>

<p>
The meter is kept in a cheap padded case (it doesn&#39;t come with one
and is known to be fragile).  I either put it next to me where I&#39;m
sitting, or have it otherwise near the open air sticking out of a
backpack pocket or clothing pocket.  The picture below shows the
meter sitting in the Richmond 2 meeting room.

<p>
Generally, I had the sensor recording \(CO_2\) levels every minute or
two.  To analyze, produce and draw conclusions from the graphs
below, I ended up writing a <a href="https://github.com/hardaker/aranet4-graph">python program</a> that let me graph and
annotate the results.
</p>

<p>
For some level setting about what are reasonable numbers, I note
that my house itself (where just my wife and I live) has \(CO_2\)
levels of around 750 Parts Per Million (PPM) most of the time, while
walking around outside showed levels of 450-ish.  When sitting in my
home-office, the \(CO_2\) levels often slowly climb over a few hours
to reach 950 PPM (it turns out my office really needs a fan as the
single plant on the opposite side of the room is failing to keep up
even with my sedentary exhaling).
</p>

<p>
Note that \(CO_2\) sensors do suffer from <a href="https://sensorsandtransmitters.com/effects-of-weather-and-altitude-on-co2-sensors/">changes in altitude</a>, but the
math shows that you can <a href="http://www.co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN149-Senseair-Pressure-Dependence.pdf">adjust readings based on the altitude</a> such
that <a href="https://sensorsandtransmitters.com/effects-of-weather-and-altitude-on-co2-sensors/">sensor readings are lower than they should be at higher
altitudes</a>.  Note that <b>the graphs below aren&#39;t calculated for
altitude adjustment</b>.  Since planes are generally pressurized to an
equivalent of 8000 feet, and senor drift is typically \(3%\) per 1000
feet of elevation, it means that while in the air the \(CO_2\) levels
are likely <b>$24% higher than shown on the graph</b>.
