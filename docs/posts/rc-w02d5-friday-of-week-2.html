    <p>Today was Friday of my second week at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=24c53dc56ddd7af575ff67d7fa1194c4">Recurse Center</a> as a participant in this year’s Summer 2 batch!
I’m trying a new numbering scheme, but haven’t committed to it yet. Please message me with more ideas on Zulip, or <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@englishm">Hachyderm</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/englishm.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/123510893194510337">Discord</a>, or wherever else you can find me (even if it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/englishm_">Twitter</a>).</p>

<p>Today I spent a lot of time doing solo work. I did some troubleshooting of the test videos I’m using for testing our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/moq/about/">Media over QUIC (MoQ)</a> demo. I still haven’t determined exactly what issue is causing stuttering with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHOpb2fS-cM">Tears of Steel</a> clip, but not with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pSHGD7F83c">Big Buck Bunny</a>, but I did use <a href="https://github.com/gpac/mp4box.js/">mp4box.js</a> to make note of a number of difference between the two files. Once I determine what the primary issue is, I plan to write this process up in more detail.</p>

<p>After work on that for a while, I wanted to get some time in writing code so I dusted off an old project idea I had and put my new <a href="https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom"><code>nom</code></a> parsing experience to use. I’m starting on a Rust crate to parse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">Amateur Radio</a> <a href="https://www.adif.org/">ADIF</a> data. This is how information like completed contacts, contest logs, and reception reports are often stored. This is the same format used by the <a href="https://www.arrl.org/">ARRL</a>’s <a href="https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/">Logbook of the World (LoTW)</a> as well as <a href="https://pskreporter.info/">pskreporter.info</a>. I think such a library might be especialy useful for pulling data from various sources together into a database for later analysis of observed radio propagation conditions.</p>

<p>I also did a bit more testing of recent <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/moq/about/">MoQ</a> changes. Looking forward to digging into this more next week.</p>
