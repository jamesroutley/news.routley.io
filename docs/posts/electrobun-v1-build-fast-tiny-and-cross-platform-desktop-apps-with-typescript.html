    <h1>Electrobun v1: Build fast, tiny, and cross-platform desktop apps with TypeScript</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong>Build ultra fast, tiny, and cross-platform desktop apps with TypeScript.</strong></p> <p>Two years ago I paused <a href="https://blackboard.sh/colab/">co(lab)</a> to build the desktop app framework I wished existed. Now that I&#39;ve shipped a stable v1, this post is me reflecting on this two-year sidequest that had me learning Zig, C, C++, and Objective-C.</p> <h2>Why I Built This</h2> <p>My intro to programming was Visual Basic 6 in the early 2000s, building desktop apps. Then Adobe AIR changed my life—I built a few startups and shipped desktop apps to thousands of people. That was the golden age for me. Fast forward 20+ years of zero-to-one work at startups, building and scaling key systems as early eng at unicorns shipping to 10s of millions, and starting my own startup lab; somehow desktop development had gotten worse. I was building co(lab), a hybrid web browser + code editor + PTY terminal, and I just ran into one papercut too many.</p> <p>The first version was built in Electron. The DX was rough—figuring out code signing, notarization, distribution, and updates felt like fighting the framework instead of building my app. I wanted to ship like the web, continuously, but every piece of the toolchain made that harder than it needed to be.</p> <p>I tried Tauri but Rust is not for everyone. Bun was up and coming, still months away from 1.0. So I got to work.</p> <h2>From macOS to Everywhere</h2> <p>When Electrobun started, it only built macOS apps. Today it has first-class support for building on and distributing to <strong>macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu</strong>. Installers, auto-update artifacts, differential patches—all generated automatically. Bring your own static host (R2, S3, GitHub Releases) and you&#39;re done. The differential updates are powered by <a href="https://blackboard.sh/blog/introducing-zig-bsdiff">zig-bsdiff</a>, which I ported from C to Zig and optimized with SIMD and zstd.</p> <p>As Bun&#39;s FFI stabilized, I replaced most of the Zig FFI layer I&#39;d written and leaned on Bun directly. The architecture inverted in a good way—Bun uses shared memory when spinning up workers, so Electrobun stays efficient even with multiple processes.</p> <h2>What Shipped</h2> <p>Electrobun today is a complete framework: cross-platform window controls, menus, accelerators, global shortcuts, clipboard, dialogs, webview partitions, session storage, find-in-page, and solid tooling around bundling and updates.</p> <p>The OOPIF story is real now. Electron&#39;s <code>&lt;webview&gt;</code> tag was deprecated from Chromium and they still haven&#39;t fixed it. <a href="https://blackboard.sh/blog/building-a-better-oopif">Building a Better OOPIF</a> goes deep on how <code>&lt;electrobun-webview&gt;</code> evolved into a true &#34;super iframe&#34;—DOM positioning, process isolation, layering that actually works, and no cursor flicker nightmares. It works across platforms without patching browser engines.</p> <h2>What&#39;s Next</h2> <p>co(lab) is fully rewritten on Electrobun and I&#39;m doubling down on it now that v1 is real. The framework is stable enough to build ambitious, long-lived products without worrying about platform churn. That was always the goal.</p> <p>The community is growing. People in our Discord are building insanely cool apps. If you&#39;ve tested betas, filed issues, or sent feedback—thank you. Electrobun is the first major thing I&#39;m shipping from <a href="https://blackboard.sh/">Blackboard</a>, and you helped shape it.</p> </div></div>
