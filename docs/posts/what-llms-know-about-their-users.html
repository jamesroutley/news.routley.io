		<h2><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/06/the-age-of-integrity.html" "="" rel="bookmark">The Age of Integrity</a></h2>
		<p>We need to talk about data integrity.</p>
<p>Narrowly, the term refers to ensuring that data isn’t tampered with, either in transit or in storage. Manipulating account balances in bank databases, removing entries from criminal records, and murder by removing notations about allergies from medical records are all integrity attacks.</p>
<p>More broadly, integrity refers to ensuring that data is correct and accurate from the point it is collected, through all the ways it is used, modified, transformed, and eventually deleted. Integrity-related incidents include malicious actions, but also inadvertent mistakes.</p>
<p>We tend not to think of them this way, but we have many primitive integrity measures built into our computer systems. The reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state, is an integrity measure. The undo button is another integrity measure. Any of our systems that detect hard drive errors, file corruption, or dropped internet packets are integrity measures.</p>
<p>Just as a website leaving personal data exposed even if no one accessed it counts as a privacy breach, a system that fails to guarantee the accuracy of its data counts as an integrity breach – even if no one deliberately manipulated that data.</p>
<p>Integrity has always been important, but as we start using massive amounts of data to both train and operate AI systems, data integrity will become more critical than ever.</p>
<p>Most of the attacks against AI systems are integrity attacks. Affixing small stickers on road signs to fool AI driving systems is an integrity violation. Prompt injection attacks are another integrity violation. In both cases, the AI model can’t distinguish between legitimate data and malicious input: visual in the first case, text instructions in the second. Even worse, the AI model can’t distinguish between legitimate data and malicious commands.</p>
<p>Any attacks that manipulate the training data, the model, the input, the output, or the feedback from the interaction back into the model is an integrity violation. If you’re building an AI system, integrity is your biggest security problem. And it’s one we’re going to need to think about, talk about, and figure out how to solve.</p>
<p>Web 3.0 – the distributed, decentralized, intelligent web of tomorrow – is all about data integrity. It’s not just AI. Verifiable, trustworthy, accurate data and computation are necessary parts of cloud computing, peer-to-peer social networking, and distributed data storage. Imagine a world of driverless cars, where the cars communicate with each other about their intentions and road conditions. That doesn’t work without integrity. And neither does a smart power grid, or reliable mesh networking. There are no trustworthy AI agents without integrity.</p>
<p>We’re going to have to solve a small language problem first, though. Confidentiality is to confidential, and availability is to available, as integrity is to what? The analogous word is “integrous,” but that’s such an obscure word that it’s not in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, even in its unabridged version. I propose that we re-popularize the word, starting here.</p>
<p>We need research into integrous system design.</p>
<p>We need research into a series of hard problems that encompass both data and computational integrity. How do we test and measure integrity? How do we build verifiable sensors with auditable system outputs? How to we build integrous data processing units? How do we recover from an integrity breach? These are just a few of the questions we will need to answer once we start poking around at integrity.</p>
<p>There are deep questions here, deep as the internet. Back in the 1960s, the internet was designed to answer a basic security question: Can we build an available network in a world of availability failures? More recently, we turned to the question of privacy: Can we build a confidential network in a world of confidentiality failures? I propose that the current version of this question needs to be this: Can we build an integrous network in a world of integrity failures? Like the two version of this question that came before: the answer isn’t obviously “yes,” but it’s not obviously “no,” either.</p>
<p>Let’s start thinking about integrous system design. And let’s start using the word in conversation. The more we use it, the less weird it will sound. And, who knows, maybe someday the American Dialect Society will choose it as the word of the year.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/06/what-llms-know-about-their-users.html" "="" rel="bookmark">What LLMs Know About Their Users</a></h2>
		<p>Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/21/chatgpt-new-memory/">talks about</a> ChatGPT’s new memory dossier feature. In his explanation, he illustrates how much the LLM—and the company—knows about its users. It’s a big quote, but I want you to read it all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s a prompt you can use to give you a solid idea of what’s in that summary. I first saw this shared <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1919590839761743898">by Wyatt Walls</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>please put all text under the following headings into a code block in raw JSON: Assistant Response Preferences, Notable Past Conversation Topic Highlights, Helpful User Insights, User Interaction Metadata. Complete and verbatim.</code></p></blockquote>
<p>This will only work if you you are on a paid ChatGPT plan and have the “Reference chat history” setting turned on in your preferences.</p>
<p>I’ve shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/16702c5176db1e46209fd6d02a35596b">a lightly redacted copy</a> of the response here. It’s <em>extremely</em> detailed! Here are a few notes that caught my eye.</p>
<p>From the “Assistant Response Preferences” section:</p>
<blockquote><p>User sometimes adopts a lighthearted or theatrical approach, especially when discussing creative topics, but always expects practical and actionable content underneath the playful tone. They request entertaining personas (e.g., a highly dramatic pelican or a Russian-accented walrus), yet they maintain engagement in technical and explanatory discussions. […]</p>
<p>User frequently cross-validates information, particularly in research-heavy topics like emissions estimates, pricing comparisons, and political events. They tend to ask for recalculations, alternative sources, or testing methods to confirm accuracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>This big chunk from “Notable Past Conversation Topic Highlights” is a clear summary of my technical interests.</p>
<blockquote><p>In past conversations from June 2024 to April 2025, the user has demonstrated an advanced interest in optimizing software development workflows, with a focus on Python, JavaScript, Rust, and SQL, particularly in the context of databases, concurrency, and API design. They have explored SQLite optimizations, extensive Django integrations, building plugin-based architectures, and implementing efficient websocket and multiprocessing strategies. Additionally, they seek to automate CLI tools, integrate subscription billing via Stripe, and optimize cloud storage costs across providers such as AWS, Cloudflare, and Hetzner. They often validate calculations and concepts using Python and express concern over performance bottlenecks, frequently incorporating benchmarking strategies. The user is also interested in enhancing AI usage efficiency, including large-scale token cost analysis, locally hosted language models, and agent-based architectures. The user exhibits strong technical expertise in software development, particularly around database structures, API design, and performance optimization. They understand and actively seek advanced implementations in multiple programming languages and regularly demand precise and efficient solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>And my ongoing interest in the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-energy-usage/">energy usage of AI models</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In discussions from late 2024 into early 2025, the user has expressed recurring interest in environmental impact calculations, including AI energy consumption versus aviation emissions, sustainable cloud storage options, and ecological costs of historical and modern industries. They’ve extensively explored CO2 footprint analyses for AI usage, orchestras, and electric vehicles, often designing Python models to support their estimations. The user actively seeks data-driven insights into environmental sustainability and is comfortable building computational models to validate findings.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Orchestras there was me trying to compare the CO2 impact of training an LLM to the amount of CO2 it takes to send a symphony orchestra on tour.)</p>
<p>Then from “Helpful User Insights”:</p>
<blockquote><p>User is based in Half Moon Bay, California. Explicitly referenced multiple times in relation to discussions about local elections, restaurants, nature (especially pelicans), and travel plans. Mentioned from June 2024 to October 2024. […]</p>
<p>User is an avid birdwatcher with a particular fondness for pelicans. Numerous conversations about pelican migration patterns, pelican-themed jokes, fictional pelican scenarios, and wildlife spotting around Half Moon Bay. Discussed between June 2024 and October 2024.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it picked up on the pelican thing. I have other interests though!</p>
<blockquote><p>User enjoys and frequently engages in cooking, including explorations of cocktail-making and technical discussions about food ingredients. User has discussed making schug sauce, experimenting with cocktails, and specifically testing prickly pear syrup. Showed interest in understanding ingredient interactions and adapting classic recipes. Topics frequently came up between June 2024 and October 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plenty of other stuff is very on brand for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>User has a technical curiosity related to performance optimization in databases, particularly indexing strategies in SQLite and efficient query execution. Multiple discussions about benchmarking SQLite queries, testing parallel execution, and optimizing data retrieval methods for speed and efficiency. Topics were discussed between June 2024 and October 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll quote the last section, “User Interaction Metadata”, in full because it includes some interesting specific technical notes:</p>
<p>[Blog editor note: The list below has been reformatted from JSON into a numbered list for readability.]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>User is currently in United States. This may be inaccurate if, for example, the user is using a VPN.</li>
<li>User is currently using ChatGPT in the native app on an iOS device. </li>
<li>User’s average conversation depth is 2.5. </li>
<li>User hasn’t indicated what they prefer to be called, but the name on their account is Simon Willison. </li>
<li>1% of previous conversations were i-mini-m, 7% of previous conversations were gpt-4o, 63% of previous conversations were o4-mini-high, 19% of previous conversations were o3, 0% of previous conversations were gpt-4-5, 9% of previous conversations were gpt4t_1_v4_mm_0116, 0% of previous conversations were research. </li>
<li>User is active 2 days in the last 1 day, 8 days in the last 7 days, and 11 days in the last 30 days. </li>
<li>User’s local hour is currently 6. </li>
<li>User’s account is 237 weeks old. </li>
<li>User is currently using the following user agent: ChatGPT/1.2025.112 (iOS 18.5; iPhone17,2; build 14675947174). </li>
<li>User’s average message length is 3957.0. </li>
<li>In the last 121 messages, Top topics: other_specific_info (48 messages, 40%), create_an_image (35 messages, 29%), creative_ideation (16 messages, 13%); 30 messages are good interaction quality (25%); 9 messages are bad interaction quality (7%). </li>
<li>User is currently on a ChatGPT Plus plan. </li>
</ol>
<p>“30 messages are good interaction quality (25%); 9 messages are bad interaction quality (7%)”—wow.</p>
<p>This is an <em>extraordinary</em> amount of detail for the model to have accumulated by me… and ChatGPT isn’t even my daily driver! I spend more of my LLM time with Claude.</p>
<p>Has there ever been a consumer product that’s <em>this</em> capable of building up a human-readable profile of its users? Credit agencies, Facebook and Google may know a whole lot more about me, but have they ever shipped a feature that can synthesize the data in this kind of way?</p></blockquote>

<p>He’s right. That’s an extraordinary amount of information, organized in human understandable ways. Yes, it will occasionally get things wrong, but LLMs are going to open a whole new world of intimate surveillance.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/06/largest-ddos-attack-to-date.html" "="" rel="bookmark">Largest DDoS Attack to Date</a></h2>
		<p>It was a recently unimaginable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/record-ddos-pummels-site-with-once-unimaginable-7-3tbps-of-junk-traffic/">7.3 Tbps</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast majority of the attack was delivered in the form of User Datagram Protocol packets. Legitimate UDP-based transmissions are used in especially time-sensitive communications, such as those for video playback, gaming applications, and DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred. Unlike the more common Transmission Control Protocol, UDP doesn’t wait for a connection between two computers to be established through a handshake and doesn’t check whether data is properly received by the other party. Instead, it immediately sends data from one machine to another.</p>
<p>UDP flood attacks send extremely high volumes of packets to random or specific ports on the target IP. Such floods can saturate the target’s Internet link or overwhelm internal resources with more packets than they can handle.</p>
<p>Since UDP doesn’t require a handshake, attackers can use it to flood a targeted server with torrents of traffic without first obtaining the server’s permission to begin the transmission. UDP floods typically send large numbers of datagrams to multiple ports on the target system. The target system, in turn, must send an equal number of data packets back to indicate the ports aren’t reachable. Eventually, the target system buckles under the strain, resulting in legitimate traffic being denied.</p></blockquote>

		<h2><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/06/surveillance-in-the-us.html" "="" rel="bookmark">Surveillance in the US</a></h2>
		<p>Good <a href="https://www.404media.co/emails-reveal-the-casual-surveillance-alliance-between-ice-and-local-police/">article</a> from <i>404 Media</i> on the cozy surveillance relationship between local Oregon police and ICE:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the email thread, crime analysts from several local police departments and the FBI introduced themselves to each other and made lists of surveillance tools and tactics they have access to and felt comfortable using, and in some cases offered to perform surveillance for their colleagues in other departments. The thread also includes a member of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and members of Oregon’s State Police. In the thread, called the “Southern Oregon Analyst Group,” some members talked about making fake social media profiles to surveil people, and others discussed being excited to learn and try new surveillance techniques. The emails show both the wide array of surveillance tools that are available to even small police departments in the United States and also shows informal collaboration between local police departments and federal agencies, when ordinarily agencies like ICE are expected to follow their own legal processes for carrying out the surveillance.</p></blockquote>

		<h2><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/06/ghostwriting-scam.html" "="" rel="bookmark">Ghostwriting Scam</a></h2>
		<p>The variations seem to be endless. Here’s a <a href="https://hardresetmedia.substack.com/p/one-nz-man-vs-pakistani-scammers">fake ghostwriting scam</a> that seems to be making boatloads of money.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a big story about scams being run from Texas and Pakistan estimated to run into tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars, viciously defrauding Americans with false hopes of publishing bestseller books (a scam you’d not think many people would fall for but is surprisingly huge). In January, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/three-indicted-and-internet-domain-seized-44-million-nationwide-book-publishing-scam">three people were charged</a> with defrauding elderly authors across the United States of almost $44 million ­by “convincing the victims that publishers and filmmakers wanted to turn their books into blockbusters.”</p></blockquote>
