    <p>The following summary tables includes basic information about the hazard for this object.
The maximum Torino and Palermo Scale values are listed, as well as the number of tabulated
potential impacts and their corresponding cumulative Palermo Scale value and cumulative
impact probability (shown in the the first table).
Certain parameter values depend upon the specific impact event in question,
but they change little among the various table entries.
For this reason we tabulate only mean values for these parameters (shown in the second table).
The observation set used for the analysis is also listed.</p>
