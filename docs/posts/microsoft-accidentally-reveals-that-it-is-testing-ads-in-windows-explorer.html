<p>Windows 11 testers are regularly finding new Windows 11 features that Microsoft wasn&#39;t ready to show anyone yet. Sometimes that means digging up <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/developers-unearth-the-bones-of-an-overhauled-task-manager-for-windows-11/">a new Task Manager</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/a-mixed-bag-of-windows-11-beta-updates-includes-hidden-file-explorer-tabs/">tabs for the File Explorer</a>. And sometimes it means finding advertisements for other Microsoft products as you browse your own locally stored files.</p>
<p>Microsoft MVP Florian Beaubois <a href="https://twitter.com/flobo09/status/1502645866204704773">found an example of the latter</a> when he saw an ad promoting Microsoft Editor while viewing his Documents folder in a Windows 11 build. In a statement to The Verge, Microsoft Senior Program Manager Brandon LeBlanc <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979251/microsoft-file-explorer-ads-windows-11-testing">acknowledged</a> that the banner ad was genuine, but he said that it had been &#34;experimental&#34; and that it &#34;was not intended to be published externally and was turned off.&#34;</p>

<p>As The Verge notes, &#34;we didn&#39;t mean for anyone to see that&#34; is not a promise to never run ads in Windows Explorer, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/edge-is-a-good-browser-but-microsofts-heavy-handed-tactics-make-it-hard-to-love/">Microsoft&#39;s behavior around its Edge browser</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/new-preview-build-adds-microsoft-account-requirement-to-windows-11-pro/">Microsoft account requirements</a>, and prompts to try OneDrive and Microsoft 365 all indicate that the company has no problem with this kind of aggressive internal promotion of its own products and services. It&#39;s an unfortunate reality that comes with using a big company&#39;s products—you&#39;ll get promo notifications for Apple TV+ on your iPhone, suggestions that you switch to Chrome when you&#39;re using Gmail, or prominent ads for Alexa-based products every time you try to buy a $6 cable on Amazon.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>I don&#39;t particularly want to see prompts for Microsoft Editor in my Documents folder or a banner suggesting that I try Clipchamp in my Videos folder (that second one hasn&#39;t happened—just a possible example that comes to mind). But in my mind, there&#39;s a line between these kinds of generic system-folder-based suggestions and banners based on the actual files or file types I&#39;m working with in Explorer. A broad assumption like &#34;you&#39;re in your documents folder; let me suggest other things related to documents&#34; is annoying, but it doesn&#39;t feel particularly invasive. Any suggestion that Microsoft is gathering and using information about your locally stored files so it can better advertise to you could cross that line.</p>
