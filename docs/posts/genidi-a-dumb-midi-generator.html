    <h1>genidi: a dumb midi generator</h1>

<p>In 2026, I want to make a lot more music. Two areas where I really want to explore are composing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> and sequencing. I feel I have sound creation down, but putting those sounds together to make songs and compositions is not something I understand. So for my last<!-- --> <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/tag/decemberadventure">#decemberadventure</a> I figured I&#39;d try and make a midi generator for the command line I could use. I wanted it to be like babies first midi. I wanted it to tell me what was happening over the wire that was going from my computer to a <a href="https://busycircuits.com/pages/alm023">mmMidi</a> which then went to my smaller Eurorack system.</p>
<p>I wanted the code to be in Go and run on the cli. I wanted it to be a simple eight step sequencer. Each step should send an envelope (basically a voltage that defines what volume of the note is), and a note (A, B, C etc.). I also needed to define a clock signal, basically how fast the sequencer moved to the next step.</p>
<p>I decided to use Cursor&#39;s new Agent mode to generate this. The code it created is at <a href="https://github.com/icco/genidi">icco/genidi</a>. It did not create anything that worked. Some pieces it generated worked, mostly some of the UI, but it did not do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Properly send Midi</li>
<li>Generate steps as I wanted</li>
</ol>

<p>So now I&#39;ve started fixing the code and am heavily debating rewriting from scratch. That will be a project for January.</p>
