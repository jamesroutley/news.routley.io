    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Archaeologists have uncovered a groundbreaking <a title="&lt;h3 class=&#34;wpg-tooltip-title&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;wpg-tooltip-term-title&#34;&gt;Artifact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wpg-tooltip-content&#34;&gt;An artifact or artefact (British English) refers to any portable object or material that has been created, modified, or used by humans. It is the basic &#34;unit&#34; of archaeological analysis. Artifacts can vary widely in terms of size, material, and purpose. They can include tools, pottery, jewelry, weapons, clothing, and more. These diverse forms may at times be mistaken for ecofacts and features, with all three often coexisting within archaeological sites. Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the technological advancements,&lt;p class=&#34;wpg-read-more&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archaeologymag.com/encyclopedia/artifact/&#34;&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" href="https://archaeologymag.com/encyclopedia/artifact/" target="_blank">artifact</a> in a 3rd-century Roman grave near Frankfurt, Germany, which provides the earliest archaeological evidence of Christianity north of the Alps. The artifact, a silver amulet known as the “Frankfurt Silver Inscription,” dates back to approximately 230-270 CE and predates previously known Christian artifacts from this region by nearly 50 years.</p><figure id="attachment_44432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44432"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTA0OSIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDcwMCAxMDQ5Ij48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1.jpg.webp" alt="Silver amulet unearthed in Frankfurt grave Is the oldest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps" width="700" height="1049" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1.jpg.webp 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1-200x300.jpg.webp 200w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1-683x1024.jpg.webp 683w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1-768x1152.jpg.webp 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1-1024x1536.jpg.webp 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1-150x225.jpg.webp 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1-750x1125.jpg.webp 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-1-1140x1710.jpg.webp 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44432">3rd-century burial with silver amulet at the neck.

The burial ground, which contained 127 graves, was notable for its unusually high proportion of inhumation burials—a practice uncommon in other Roman cemeteries in Frankfurt. Among these graves, one stood out: the resting place of a man aged 35-45 years. Alongside grave goods such as an incense burner and pottery, archaeologists discovered a small rolled silver foil beneath the man’s chin. The amulet, likely worn on a ribbon around the neck, is classified as a phylactery—a container designed to protect the wearer through its contents.</p><p>The inscription etched into the amulet’s silver foil was deciphered using advanced computer tomography technology at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology (LEIZA) in Mainz. This non-invasive method allowed researchers to digitally “unroll” the fragile scroll, which would have disintegrated if manually handled. The digital imaging process revealed an 18-line Latin text containing exclusively Christian content—a rarity for its time.</p><figure id="attachment_44433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44433"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijk2MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgOTYwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2.jpg.webp" alt="Silver amulet unearthed in Frankfurt grave Is the oldest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps" width="1280" height="960" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2.jpg.webp 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2-300x225.jpg.webp 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2-1024x768.jpg.webp 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2-150x113.jpg.webp 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2-750x563.jpg.webp 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-2-1140x855.jpg.webp 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44433">Rolled silver amulet, ca. 230-260 CE.

Credit: LEIZA. / Prof. Dr. Markus Scholz</figcaption></figure><p>The text opens with a reference to St. Titus, a disciple of the Apostle Paul, and includes invocations such as “Holy, holy, holy!” and “In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of God.” It also incorporates elements of Christian liturgy, including a near-verbatim quotation from Paul’s letter to the Philippians (Phil. 2:10-11). Prof. Dr. Markus Scholz of Goethe University, Frankfurt, who led the deciphering process, remarked the text’s sophistication suggests it was crafted by an elaborate scribe, and its purely Christian content is extraordinary for this period, where religious syncretism was more common.</p><p>Typically, amulets from this era contained a blend of Christian, Jewish, and pagan elements. However, the absence of references to Yahweh, angels, or pagan deities in this inscription underscores its exclusively Christian nature. This uniqueness not only highlights the wearer’s devotion but also raises questions about the role of Christianity in Nida, a city that was once a cultural and administrative hub of Roman Germania.</p><h2>Broader Implications</h2><p>The discovery has significant implications for multiple fields, including archaeology, theology, and Roman history. It pushes back the timeline for evidence of Christianity in the region by several decades. Historical sources had hinted at Christian communities in Gaul and Upper Germania as early as the late 2nd century, but tangible proof north of the Alps was previously limited to the 4th century.</p><figure id="attachment_44435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44435"><a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMjgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijg1MyIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEyODAgODUzIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4.jpg.webp" alt="Silver amulet unearthed in Frankfurt grave Is the oldest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps" width="1280" height="853" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4.jpg.webp 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4-1024x682.jpg.webp 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4-150x100.jpg.webp 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4-750x500.jpg.webp 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-amulet-unearthed-in-frankfurt-grave-4-1140x760.jpg.webp 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44435">Uncovering the grave. Credit: Michael Obst, Monument Office of the City of Frankfurt am Main</figcaption></figure><h2>Technological Advances and Collaboration</h2><p>The meticulous preservation and analysis of the amulet exemplify the benefits of collaboration between institutions. The project involved several organizations and project partners, including the City of Frankfurt on the Main, the Archaeological Museum Frankfurt (AMF), the Frankfurt Department of Planning and Housing, LEIZA, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt, the University of Bonn, and the Rhine-Main Archaeology Network (VARM).</p><p>Dr. Ivan Calandra of LEIZA highlighted the challenges posed by the amulet’s age and condition, noting, “The challenge in analyzing the artifact was that the silver sheet was not only rolled but, after approximately 1,800 years, was also creased and compressed. Using the CT scanner, we were able to scan it in very high resolution and create a 3D model.”</p><h2>A Window into Early Christianity</h2><p>The discovery of the Frankfurt Silver Inscription provides the earliest archaeological evidence of Christianity north of the Alps and underscores the Roman Empire’s interconnectedness.</p><p>Nida, situated in the hinterland of the Upper Germanic Limes, was far from a peripheral outpost; it was a vibrant center influenced by diverse cultural and religious currents. The find invites further research into how Christianity emerged and thrived in such a dynamic environment during the 3rd century.</p><hr/></div></div>
