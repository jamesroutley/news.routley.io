Spanner is a fully managed relational database created by Google that provides the highest levels of consistency and availability at any scale. Developers love Spanner for its ease of use and its ability to automatically handle replication, sharding, disaster recovery, and strongly consistent transaction processing. Organizations across industries including finance, retail, gaming, and healthcare are using Spanner to modernize their tech stack, transform the end user experience, and innovate quickly to uncover new possibilities. Now any developer or organization can try Spanner hands-on at no cost with the Spanner free trial instance. Watch this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTzmAa9L7Oc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;short video&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the Spanner free trial and &lt;a href=&#34;https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=/spanner&#34;&gt;get started today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/free-trial-instance#:~:text=A%20Spanner%20free%20trial%20instance%20is%20available%20at%20no%20cost,for%20any%20Google%20Cloud%20resources.&#34;&gt;Spanner free trial&lt;/a&gt; provides a Spanner instance where users can create GoogleSQL or PostgreSQL-dialect databases, explore Spanner capabilities, and prototype an application to run on Spanner. To make it easier for developers to evaluate Spanner, the free trial instance comes with built-in guided tutorials in the Google Cloud console. These tutorials provide step-by-step guidance to create a database, load predefined schema and data, and run sample queries and transactions so that users can quickly get started with Spanner and learn key concepts.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Making Spanner more accessible for every developer and workload&amp;#160;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to make Spanner&amp;#8217;s unique benefits accessible to every developer and organization. So, we are making it easier, faster, and cost effective for everyone to use Spanner for applications big and small.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We launched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/postgresql-interface-for-spanner-now-ga&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL interface&lt;/a&gt; for Spanner so that users can build transformative applications with the fully managed experience of Spanner while using the familiar PostgreSQL dialect. We introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/spanner-committed-use-discounts-help-reduce-costs&#34;&gt;Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)&lt;/a&gt; that give up to 40% discount to help users reduce their database costs. We also reduced the cost of entry for production workloads with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/use-spanner-at-low-cost-with-granular-instance-sizing&#34;&gt;granular instance sizing&lt;/a&gt; to make enterprise-grade production-ready databases available starting at approximately $65 per month. Users can even lower the cost to $40 per month by combining granular instance sizing and committed use discounts! With the launch of the Spanner free trial instance, users now have the opportunity to explore its capabilities without any upfront costs. Further, we make it easy for users to seamlessly upgrade from the free trial instance to a paid instance and scale without requiring any re-architecture and downtime.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started with Spanner free trial in minutes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both existing and new Google Cloud users are eligible for the Spanner free trial. If you are an existing Google Cloud user (i.e. if you have an active Google Cloud Billing account), you are ready to create your Spanner free trial instance. If you are a new Google Cloud user, you need to create a Cloud Billing account first that gives you eligibility to create a Spanner free trial instance as well as receive $300 in free credits to use on one or a combination of Google Cloud products. A billing account is required for verification of identity. Don&amp;#8217;t worry, you are not charged until you choose to upgrade your Spanner free trial instance.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;Getting started takes just a few steps: you can create a free trial instance using Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI."><p>We are excited to announce Cloud Spanner free trial instances to give everyone an opportunity to try out Spanner at no cost for 90 days.
