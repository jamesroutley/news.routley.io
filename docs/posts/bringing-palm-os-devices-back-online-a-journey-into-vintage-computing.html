    <h1>Bringing Palm OS devices back online – A journey into vintage computing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div><section><div><div><p id="d676">As I watched vintage computing videos, I remembered the days when I used my Palm handheld devices such as the Palm III, Palm V and others. It got me in quite some nostalgic moments and feelings. I ended up on eBay and classifieds websites where I searched around. It did not take long and I found a completely new and unopened Palm m515 from 2002. In a moment of excitement and with a low cost of 20 €, I gave it a shot. A couple of days later a package arrived at my door.</p></div></div></section></div></div></article></div></div></div>
