        <p>The first sentence of my Week 6, Day 5 reads</p>
        <p>Removed a lot of coffee chat slots, limiting them to
        just Fridays from now on. Think I need to go more into deep work
        mode.<br/></p>
        <p>I think this sets the tone for the later part of the batch for me.
        The social aspect of RC has been great fun and I&#39;ve made loads of
        friends and connections, but it takes energy and janks you out of your
        flow doing all of these scheduled coffee chats. Once per week will be
        enough from here on.</p>
        <p>I will focus less on the social aspects of RC and more on getting
        better at coding. I want to finish my <a href="https://isakfalk.com/notes/RC-week-4.html#machine-learning-project">project</a> before the end of
        batch, and if I do it before that I want to maybe try to create a Jax
        package. Here&#39;s to the next year and the next RC batch!</p>
