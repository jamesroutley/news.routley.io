<p>Infinite canvas tools are a way to view and organize information spatially, like a digital whiteboard. Infinite canvases encourage freedom and exploration, and have become a popular interface pattern across many apps.</p>

<p>The JSON Canvas format was created to provide longevity, readability, interoperability, and extensibility to data created with infinite canvas apps. The format is designed to be easy to parse and give users <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">ownership over their data</a>. JSON Canvas files use the <code>.canvas</code> extension.</p>

<p>JSON Canvas was originally created for <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/json-canvas/">Obsidian</a>. JSON Canvas can be implemented freely as an import, export, and storage format for any app or tool. This site, and all the resources associated with JSON Canvas are <a href="https://github.com/obsidianmd/jsoncanvas">open source</a> under the MIT license.</p>
