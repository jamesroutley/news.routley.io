    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>A few days ago I updated Firefox to be greeted with a full page ad for &#39;Turning Red.&#39; I don&#39;t understand how they think this is acceptable.<p>Beside the moral issues, this undermines all the reason I would update altogether.
