<p>The <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm" id="CP___PAGEID=5602344,index.htm,30806|">NPS Data API</a> is open and accessible to all developers who wish to use NPS data in their projects.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s an API?</h2>
<p>An application programming interface (API) is a set of requirements that allows one application to talk to another.</p>
<p><strong>The NPS Data API allows official, authoritative data and content to be used not only on NPS.gov but also by internal and external developers in apps, maps, and websites.</strong> We create the data once but, through the API, it can be used many times and in many productsâ€”no matter who creates those products.</p>
<h2>What data is available?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm" id="/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm|">NPS API documentation</a> includes detailed information about the type of data available, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alerts </strong>- Announcements communicating information about hazardous, potentially hazardous, or changing conditions that may affect a visit to a national park</li>
<li><strong>Articles, People, and Places</strong> - Titles, images, and short descriptions about shared content articles</li>
<li><strong>Campgrounds</strong> - Location, contact, operating hours, site amenities, fee, and accessibility information for campgrounds in national parks</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - Date, time, fee, and description of events taking place in national parks</li>
<li><strong>Lesson Plans</strong> - Objectives, grade level, subject, duration, and standards information for lesson plans about national parks for teachers to use in their classrooms</li>
<li><strong>News Releases</strong> - Title, abstract, and link to national park news releases, as well as an optional image</li>
<li><strong>Parks</strong> - Location, contact, operating hours, and entrance fee/pass information for each national park, as well as at least five photos of each park</li>
<li><strong>Visitor Centers</strong> - Location, contact, and operating hours information for visitor centers and other visitor contact facilities in national parks</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can developers use the API?</h2>
<p>Developers can register for an API key, get familiar with the API request format, and review API resources on the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm" id="CP___PAGEID=5602344,index.htm,30806|">NPS Data API website</a>.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s the future of the API?</h2>
