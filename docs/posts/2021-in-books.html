<p>I was pretty lazy with writing longer book reviews in 2021, but
here’s a list with mini-reviews of what I’ve read last year.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-tis-cover.png" alt="Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donella Meadows"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/"><em>Thinking
in Systems: A Primer</em></a> by Donella Meadows</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We read this in one of book clubs we have at work. I found it to be
pretty dry, and it wasn’t straightforward to apply any learnings from it
to software engineering, or at least that’s how the discussions felt to
me. My favourite bits were the examples, but I don’t think I’ve taken
much with me that’s actionable, other than the good feeling of having
read this classic. Which also isn’t actionable.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.charlespetzold.com/code/"><em>Code: The Hidden
Language of Computer Hardware and Software</em></a> by Charles
Petzold</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My favourite read of the year! I’ve written a <a href="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/2021-05-24-code-book-review.html">longer review</a> about this. We
read it in our tech book club, and I’ve learned a lot from it. I’d love
to go deeper on the topic by either <a href="https://eater.net/8bit">building a CPU from first principles</a>,
do the <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris</a> courses,
or read <a href="https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/"><em>Computer Systems: A
Programmer’s Perspective</em></a>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-20-patterns-cover.png" alt="20 patterns to watch for in your engineering team"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/product/flow/20-patterns"><em>20
patterns to watch for in your engineering team</em></a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This book is meant to help better understand patterns you can observe
when using <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/product/flow">Pluralsight Flow</a>, an
engineering metrics tool. For my taste, it is biased too much towards an
environment where the expectation is that developers do nothing but
code, all day every day.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-tdoet-cover.jpg" alt="The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/don-norman/the-design-of-everyday-things/9780465050659/"><em>The
Design of Everyday Things</em></a> by Don Norman</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another work book club book; this has been on my “to read” list for a
long time. It was a real slog to get through, and though there’s a ton
of repetition in the text, reading it felt like hard work. My main
takeaway is the terminology coined by Norman, and being able to point
out when somebody mixes up signifiers and affordances. I also pay a lot
of attention to doors now.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-fosa-cover.png" alt="Fundamentals of Software Architecture: An Engineering Approach by Mark Richards and Neal Ford"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/"><em>Fundamentals
of Software Architecture: An Engineering Approach</em></a> by Mark
Richards and Neal Ford</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is probably the first use of the O’Reilly subscription I get
through work. As it turns out, they have basically everything!</p>
<p>True to its title, this book clarifies the fundamentals of software
architecture, and in doing so defines a lot of terms everybody seems to
have a different idea about. Now, if everybody would just read the
book…</p>
<p>Some examples are a bit hand-wavy, but I did like the quantitative
approach shown. Maybe the architects who produce a slide deck and then
move on without anything ever happening aren’t actually doing a great
job after all!</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://admin.com/"><em>UNIX and
Linux System Administration Handbook</em></a>, 5th ed., by Evi Nemeth
<em>et al.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to read ULSAH for a long time, and seeing it in the O’Reilly
catalogue was enough to get me started. It took me quite a long time to
get through, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot (DNS! Booting!
Virtualization!). Each chapter is a great overview of a topic, and
offers tons of references to go deeper if desired. And, unexpectedly,
the book was funny in a very subtle way.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-goal-cover.jpg" alt="The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement by Eliyahu M. Goldratt"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://northriverpress.com/the-goal-30th-anniversary-edition/"><em>The
Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement</em></a> by Eliyahu M.
Goldratt</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The one physical book I’ve read this year! I got this for a promotion
at work. I think it holds up extremely well, and it made me want to
re-read <em>The Phoenix Project</em>. Unlike the latter, <em>The
Goal</em> actually explains why it’s written as a first-person fictional
story, and why the main character has seemingly unrelated marriage
problems. Without knowing any of this, TPP was kind of strange to read,
though still entertaining.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-stip-cover.jpg" alt="Software Tools in Pascal by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/578272"><em>Software Tools in
Pascal</em></a> by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I have started reading old Kernighan books a while ago, but somehow
got stuck on <em>Software Tools</em>, mostly because I did the
exercises, in Pascal. On this second attempt, I didn’t do the exercises,
but I finally understand where you have to put semicolons in Pascal!</p>
<p>I found this a very instructional read, which has changed the way I
approach writing small programs myself, and my thinking about what
features belong where. It is also a masterclass in writing about
programs.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/"><em>Data Science at
the Command Line: Obtain, Scrub, Explore, and Model Data with Unix Power
Tools</em></a>, 2nd ed., by Jeroen Janssens</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first edition of this was part of a Humble Bundle I bought a
while back, but by the time I considered reading it, the second edition
was close to being finished, so I just waited for that.</p>
<p>DSatCL introduces a very structured approach to what I often do
already, and I’m excited to adopt some of the practices such as using
Makefiles to keep the chaos at bay. I also want to learn more about the
R/ggplot-based plotting tools, and use them in some of my projects.</p>

</figure>
<p>Work on my <a href="https://github.com/bewuethr/pandoc-bash-blog">Pandoc Bash Blog</a>
has stalled somewhat recently, but I have a bunch of things I’d like to
do with it, many of which require some frontend chops. Since the entire
library from <a href="https://abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a> is on
O’Reilly, why not read some of them? (Or all?)</p>
<p>This is the first book of the entire series, and I only realized when
I was done that there is a second edition. And even that one is a few
years old, but together with reading lots of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML">MDN
documentation</a>, I feel like I’m now more or less up to speed.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-css3-cover.jpg" alt="CSS3 for Web Designers, 2nd ed., by Dan Cederholm"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://abookapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers"><em>CSS3

</figure>
<p>The second book from A Book Apart. This time, I read the second
edition right away. I think browser support has improved quite a lot
since this book was written, but it definitely helped me better
understand transitions and animations.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-eocs-cover.jpg" alt="The Elements of Content Strategy by Erin Kissane"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://abookapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy"><em>The
Elements of Content Strategy</em></a> by Erin Kissane</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reading this was mostly because of completionsim, but it turned out
to be quite interesting nonetheless. I’m a little less confused about
“content strategy” now.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-mbc-cover.jpg" alt="Mastering Blockchain: Unlocking the Power of Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized Applications by Lorne Lantz and Daniel Cawrey"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-blockchain/9781492054696/"><em>Mastering
Blockchain: Unlocking the Power of Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts,
and Decentralized Applications</em></a> by Lorne Lantz and Daniel
Cawrey</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I read this mostly to understand all the buzzwords and getting an
idea of the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies. The book mostly got that
job done, and also confirmed my disinterest in the space—but now I can
better explain why! It also tremendously improved my understanding of
the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8074910/">crypto episode</a>
of <em>Silicon Valley</em>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-lbohccg-cover.jpg" alt="The Little Book of HTML/CSS Coding Guidelines by Jens Oliver Meiert"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-little-book/9781492048459/"><em>The
Little Book of HTML/CSS Coding Guidelines</em></a> by Jens Oliver
Meiert</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I thought I’d read this before, but apparently not… I was looking for
a CSS style guide, and this contains at least a sketch of one. It also
describes how to come up with and socialize coding guidelines more
generally.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://benjaminwuethrich.dev/images/2022-01-01-tdb-cover.jpg" alt="The Docker Book: Containerization is the New Virtualization by James Turnbull"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://dockerbook.com/"><em>The
Docker Book: Containerization is the New Virtualization</em></a> by
James Turnbull</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to much better understand how Docker works, and this helped
a bit, but the e-book formatting was so annoying that I almost stopped
reading. Docker has also evolved quite a bit since this was written, so
I’ll have to read some more anyway.</p>
