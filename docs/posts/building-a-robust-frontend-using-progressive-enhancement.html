    <h1>Building a robust frontend using progressive enhancement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<div data-module="govspeak">
      <p>For users to experience a quality service it must be built in a robust way.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites and applications based on the idea that you should make your page work with HTML first.</p>

<p>Only after this can you add anything else like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.</p>

<p>All government services must follow progressive enhancement, even if part of the service or a parent service needs JavaScript</p>

<p>Building your service using progressive enhancement will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure your service is robust and of a high quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make it more likely your service will work <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices">regardless of which browser or device is being used</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mean your service’s most basic functionality will work and meet the core needs of the user</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improve accessibility by encouraging best practices like <a rel="external" href="https://html.com/semantic-markup/">writing semantic markup</a>
help users with device or connectivity limitations to use your service</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using a ‘commercial off the shelf’ (COTS) solution or asking an external supplier to build the service, you should consider including this in your requirements as part of your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/define-your-purchasing-strategy">purchasing strategy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-html">Start with HTML</h2>

<p>Government services should be functional using only HTML. This includes services such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>transactional services, for example forms that let the user provide information to government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a rel="external" href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/10/27/making-it-easier-to-understand-smart-answer-logic/">smart answers</a>, for example the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-a-birth">Registering a birth abroad</a> service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>content-based websites, for example GOV.UK’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">foreign travel advice</a> page</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The HTML layer is fault-tolerant by design. The browser ignores markup that it does not understand and continues to parse it as best as it can.</p>

<p>This means that older browsers will be very likely to be able to load the HTML for your service, even if there are bugs in the HTML or you use features that only exist in more modern browsers.</p>



<h2 id="using-css">Using CSS</h2>

<p>You can style your service using CSS to make it look like GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The CSS layer is reasonably fault-tolerant. This means the browser will ignore individual declarations that it does not understand, for example if you use a property that only exists in newer browsers.</p>

<p>Be aware that the browser will ignore the entire ruleset if it encounters a selector that it does not understand.</p>

<p>There are also <a href="#css-fail">other reasons why the CSS may fail to load</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid techniques such as ‘CSS-in-JS’ to ensure that your site still looks correct even if the JavaScript fails to load.</p>

<h2 id="using-javascript">Using JavaScript</h2>

<p>JavaScript can be used to add interactive elements to your service.</p>

<p>The JavaScript layer is not fault-tolerant. If your JavaScript uses a syntax or calls an API that is not supported in the user’s browser, it will error and the rest of the JavaScript will not run.</p>

<p>There are <a href="#css-fail">other reasons why the JavaScript may fail to load or run</a>.</p>

<p>If your service is not designed with this in mind, users may be unable to use it.</p>

<p>You can increase the chances that your JavaScript will work correctly in all browsers by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using <a rel="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection">feature detection</a> for browser APIs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>including <a rel="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfills</a> for newer browser features</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>transpiling your JavaScript to a common syntax that your target browsers can understand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>using automated tests or linters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>doing regular manual testing, including testing with older or lower-powered devices</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Transpilation and polyfills can significantly increase the size of your JavaScript. You should consider the trade offs involved and revisit these decisions regularly as browser usage changes.</p>

<p>Where possible the JavaScript should enhance HTML and CSS that provides the same core functionality. For example, an autocomplete could enhance a  element, or something similar. This still lets the user do what they need to do, even if the JavaScript fails.</p>

<h3 id="alternatives-to-javascript">Alternatives to JavaScript</h3>

<p>If you believe your service can only be built using JavaScript, you should think about using simpler solutions that are built using HTML and CSS and will meet user needs.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to use use JavaScript to provide interactive graphs, other options are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>display the data in a table</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allow the data to be exported so that it can analysed in another application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pre-render the graphs as images</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the core functionality of your service cannot be provided without JavaScript, you’ll need to consider how users can access your service through other channels. This might be telephone calls or in-person visits to offices.</p>

<h3 id="using-client-side-javascript-frameworks">Using client-side JavaScript frameworks</h3>

<p>If your service is mostly built using components from the <a rel="external" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> and doesn’t have a complex user interface, you do not need to use a client-side JavaScript framework.</p>

<p>The components in the <a rel="external" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> include <a rel="external" href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/import-javascript">how to import JavaScript</a> to your service without the need for a framework.</p>

<p>If you do choose to use client-side <a rel="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks">JavaScript frameworks</a>, be aware that although they can be helpful when building a service with a complex user interface, they can introduce problems.</p>

<p>Using a client-side JavaScript framework can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>increase the overall size of your code base and push processing to the client-side, causing performance issues for users with a slower network connection or lower powered device</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create a reliance on third-party code that your developers do not have control over, requiring you to make major changes to your service in order to stay up to date with changes in the framework</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make it difficult to find people with the skills required to maintain the code, if the framework’s loses popularity over time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you use a JavaScript framework you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be able to justify with evidence, how using JavaScript would benefit users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be aware of any negative impacts and be able to mitigate them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider whether the benefits of using it outweigh the potential problems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only use the framework for parts of the user interface that cannot be built using HTML and CSS alone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>design each part of the user interface as a separate component</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Having separate components means that if the JavaScript fails to load, it will only be that single component that fails. The rest of the page will load as normal.</p>

<p>If you use JavaScript, it should only be used to enhance the HTML and CSS so users can still use the service if the JavaScript fails.</p>

<h3 id="css-fail">Reasons why CSS or JavaScript may fail to load or run</h3>

<p>CSS and JavaScript can fail to load or run because of, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>temporary network errors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third-party browser extensions like ad blockers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third-party supplier downtime, such as when using a content delivery network
DNS lookup failures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bugs introduced by browser updates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bugs introduced in third party JavaScript intentionally running on the same page
corporate firewalls blocking, removing or changing content (large institutions like banks or government departments may use these)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mobile network providers changing content to speed up load times and reduce bandwidth usage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal firewalls or antivirus software changing or blocking content</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the use of unsecure connections, where internet providers insert their own code into the page that accidentally conflicts with your own</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some users may deliberately turn off features in their browsers. You should respect their decision and make sure those users can still use your service.</p>

<h2 id="single-page-applications">Single page applications</h2>

<p>Do not build your service as a single-page application (SPA). This is where the loading of pages within your service is handled by JavaScript, rather than the browser.</p>

<p>Single page applications rarely bring benefits and can make the service inaccessible because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>users of assistive technology would be unaware of changes in context, for example when moving to a new page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it would fail to handle focus when moving between pages</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the user would be unable to navigate using the back or forward buttons in their browser</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>users would be unable to recover from an error, for example if there is an interruption to their network connection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing-your-service">Testing your service</h2>

<p>If any components in your service rely heavily on JavaScript or JavaScript frameworks you will need to make sure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>work on a wide range of browsers and devices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies">assistive technologies</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
