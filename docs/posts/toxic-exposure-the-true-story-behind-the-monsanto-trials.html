    <h1>Toxic Exposure: The True Story Behind the Monsanto Trials</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                  <p>I couldn&#39;t put this book down. It&#39;s a behind-the-scenes look into the link between Monsanto&#39;s Roundup and lymphoma and the lawsuits that followed. As a physician and expert witness, Dr. Nabhan is the right person to share this balanced narrative with the perfect mix of medicine, science, and humanity. The lessons from this case will reverberate across the globe for years to come, and the lessons from this book will stick with me forever.</p>

                  <p>When you&#39;re asked to help patients in their fight for justice, you have one choice: stand up, review the science and evidence, and do something. I have enormous respect and admiration for Dr. Chadi Nabhan for joining the team that defended and advocated for patients in the courtroom against Monsanto. We need more like him!</p>

          <div>
                  <p>Dr. Nabhan tells the dramatic story of how a household weed killer had tragic human consequences—with the authority of a cancer expert, and the compassion of someone who cares deeply about his patients. A compelling read.</p>

          <div>
                  <p>Dr. Nabhan perceptively chronicles his journey from oncology professor to court battle veteran in three historic Roundup trials against pesticide manufacturer and litigation bully Monsanto. Using internal Monsanto documents, testimony, and studies, he effectively and affably reveals the real science behind Roundup&#39;s role in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and how Monsanto spent 40 years manipulating public opinion, regulators, and scientists to cover it up.</p>
