    <p>I came upon one of your friends today and noticed that he was taking a moment; a moment to appreciate you, to take you in, maybe to remember you. I asked. He pointed at a sign. We talked.</p>
<p>At first, I was angry, and then I came to an understanding, and now I am processing. We are both sad. We are all sad.</p>
<p>You might know this already, or feel it in your being, but you have only a few days left, my friend. I pray they are the days that nurture you - be it rain, sun, the sound of crickets, the Great Horned Owls that find you in the dark, the little bushtits blowing through you like a breath. May all that love you come to visit – take you in – celebrate your being.</p>
<p>I can tell you that I am going to miss you – your little green leaves that emerge every spring that are a call for all to blossom – your ability to blanket our paths calling us to be children of the earth and crunch in your leaves – your cradle of boughs that provide for our birds, the crows - oh the crows will miss you so.  </p>
<p>I am going to miss your branching beauty, your glorious hues, and your streams of growth that flow into an ocean of sky. </p>
<p>Thank you for being here and gracing me with your call to ground for so many years.</p>
