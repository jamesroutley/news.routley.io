		<p>TiVo, the digital video recording pioneer, has moved on from its legacy DVR technology, focusing instead on its branded operating system software promoting third-party content searches, recommendation, including free ad-supported streaming options and more for smart televisions.</p>
<p>“As of Oct. 1, 2025, TiVo has stopped selling Edge DVR hardware products,” the company said in an AI-based message. The recording said that the company and its associates no longer manufacture DVR hardware, “and our remaining inventory is now depleted.”</p>
<p>TiVo said it remains “committed to providing support for our DVR customers and will continue to provide support for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>TiVo in 1999 created the first set-top device enabling users to record and skip ads within television programming. Over the past 25 years, streaming video technology has evolved to the point that major platforms, such as Netflix, Prime Video, Peacock, Hulu, HBO Max and Paramount+, enable users to watch content on their own schedule without the need for separate technology.</p>
<p>In early 2024, TiVo discontinued the antenna version of the TiVo Edge from its website. The cable version of the Edge as well as the TiVo Mini LUX and TiVo Stream 4K continue to be available.</p>
<p>TiVo also markets separate technology to automakers enabling them to generate royalty revenue from third-party entertainment streamed in automobiles manufactured by Ford and Volkswagen, among others.</p>
<p>On the company website, TiVo claims that video consumption by TiVo device users equals more than 5 billion hours per year across more than 3.6 billion devices and vehicles.</p>
