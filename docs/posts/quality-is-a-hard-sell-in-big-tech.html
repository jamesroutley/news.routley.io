    <h1>Quality is a hard sell in big tech</h1>

<p>I have noticed a trend in a handful of products I&#39;ve worked on at big tech companies. I have friends at other big tech companies that have noticed a similar trend: The products are kind of crummy.</p>
<p>Here are some experiences that I have often encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>the UI is flakey and/or unintuitive</li>
<li>there is a lot of cruft in the codebase that has never been cleaned up</li>
<li>bugs that have &#34;acceptable&#34; workarounds that never get fixed</li>
<li>packages/dependencies are badly out of date</li>
<li>the developer experience is crummy (bad build times, easily breakable processes)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I have found for these issues is that we simply aren&#39;t investing enough time to increase product quality: we have poorly or nonexistent quality metrics, invest minimally in testing infrastructure (and actually writing tests), and don&#39;t invest in improving the inner loop. But why is this?</p>
<p>My experience has been that quality is simply a hard sell in bigh tech.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s first talk about something that&#39;s an <em>easy</em> sell right now: AI everything. Why is this an easy sell? Well, Microsoft could announce they put ChatGPT in a toaster and their stock price would jump $5/share. The sad truth is that big tech is hyper-focused on doing the things that make their stock prices go up in the short-term.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to make this connection with quality initiatives. If your software is slightly less shitty, the stock price won&#39;t jump next week. So instead of being able to sell the obvious benefit of shiny new features, you need to have an Engineering Manager willing to risk having lower <a href="https://www.pcloadletter.dev/blog/impact-based-performance-evaluation">impact</a> for the sake of having a better product. Even if there is broad consensus in your team, group, org that these quality improvements are necessary, there&#39;s a point up the corporate hierarchy where it simply doesn&#39;t matter to them. Certainly not as much as shipping some feature to great fanfare.</p>

<p>Cory Doctorow has <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/22/who-wins-the-argument/#corporations-are-people-my-friend">said some interesting things</a> about <em>enshittification</em> in big tech:</p>
<p><em>&#34;enshittification is a three-stage process: first, surpluses are allocated to users until they are locked in. Then they are withdrawn and given to business-customers until they are locked in. Then all the value is harvested for the company&#39;s shareholders, leaving just enough residual value in the service to keep both end-users and business-customers glued to the platform.&#34;</em></p>
<p>At a macro level, it&#39;s possible this is the strategy: hook users initially, make them dependent on your product, and then cram in superficial features that make the stock go up but don&#39;t offer real value, and keep the customers simply because they really have no choice but to use your product (an enterprise Office 365 customer probably isn&#39;t switching anytime soon).</p>
<p>This does seem to have been a good strategy in the <em>short-term</em>: look at Microsoft&#39;s stock ever since they started cranking out AI everything. But how can the quality corner-cutting work long-term?</p>
<h2 id="i-hope-the-hubris-will-backfire" tabindex="-1">I hope the hubris will backfire <a href="#i-hope-the-hubris-will-backfire">#</a></h2>
<p>Something will have to give. Big tech products can&#39;t just keep getting shittierâ€”can they? I&#39;d like to think some smaller competitors will come eat their lunch, but I&#39;m not sure. Hopefully we&#39;re not all too entrenched in the big tech ecosystem for this to happen.</p>
