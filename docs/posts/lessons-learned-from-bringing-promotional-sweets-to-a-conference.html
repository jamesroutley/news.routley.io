    <h1>Lessons learned from bringing promotional sweets to a conference</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody"><p>I&#39;ve recently <a href="https://openideas.ltd.uk/">set up my own consultancy company</a> and decided to sponsor my local <a href="https://www.ukgovcamp.com/">UKGovCamp conference</a>. That entitled me to a logo on the site, a shout-out during the conference, and place to put any promotional stickers. Everyone <em>loves</em> stickers!</p><p>But I decided to bring along something different - promotional sweeties!</p><p>I found <a href="https://personaliseyoursweets.co.uk/">a small business to print my logo with edible ink onto sweets</a> and ordered some fizzy flying saucers, mint Mentos, and fruit Mentos. They all had my company logo and name on them.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tub-of-saucers.jpg" alt="A big plastic tub filled with luridly coloured sweets." width="512" height="683"/></p><p>Here was my working theory. If I were a bigger sponsor, I&#39;d have a table and people would have been able to come up to me and chat in exchange for swag. But I didn&#39;t have a dedicated space.  That&#39;s OK, I could make my own space!</p><p>If you walk up to people while carrying a big bag of candy and say &#34;Would you like <del>a Jelly Baby</del> an after-dinner mint?&#34; people react with joy! Most people love being offered a sweet. It&#39;s a great way to meet people and start conversations.</p><p>It was great! It felt like I talked to all 500 attendees, I gave away most of the sweets, and I told people a little about the work I do. People had smiles on their faces and were happy to chat.</p><p>But… Here&#39;s what <em>didn&#39;t</em> work.</p><p>The key flaw in my cunning plan is that once you give someone a sweet with a logo on it, they eat the sweet. Now they don&#39;t have your logo to remember you by! A sticker is like a business card - a physical reminder. A sweet is gone in an instant.</p><p>The sweets are quite small and, as a consequence, the logo and text are also small. A few people didn&#39;t notice the printing or thought that the mints were designed to look like blue eyeballs.</p><p><a href="https://urbanists.social/@martinhowitt/111788464310634759"><img decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mento.jpg" alt="A small white sweet with a logo printed on it." width="512" height="288"/></a></p><p>My site has reasonable SEO if you search for &#34;Open Ideas Ltd&#34; - but there was no URl printed on the sweets because they were too small. And they would be eaten straight away.</p><p>Compact disks of sugar aren&#39;t the most health-conscious snack. I made sure that <a href="https://www.mentos.co.uk/products/mentos-fruit-bag">the treats were all vegan and gluten-free</a>.  While the big tub of flying saucers had the ingredients and allergens printed on them, the Mentos didn&#39;t. Some people were (understandably) reluctant to take unidentified sweets from a stranger.</p><p>So, lessons learned? Bring bigger sweets, with more eye-catching designs, including a clear call to action, and which are sugar-free and inedible.</p><p>Stickers. I&#39;ve reinvented stickers…</p><p>And yet… I&#39;d probably do it again! I&#39;m not a mega-corp trying to convince people to purchase my services. I&#39;m just this guy, you know? It can be a bit intimidating to go up to strangers and say &#34;TALK TO ME&#34;. But saying &#34;Hello! Would you care for a sweet?&#34; is a socially acceptable ice-breaker.</p><p>I enjoyed the experience and, while I don&#39;t think it will lead to a 10x ROI with enhanced EBITDA and hitting my OKRs, it was a <em>lot</em> of fun.</p><p>My question to you is this - what&#39;s the favourite swag you&#39;ve ever given out?</p></div></div>
