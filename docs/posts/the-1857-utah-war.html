very significant event that occurred in the years leading up to the US Civil
War was the so-called &#34;Utah War&#34;, which took place from the latter
half of 1857 into the first half of 1858.</span></p>



<p><span>Frequently referred to as
&#34;Buchanan&#39;s Blunder&#34; (after then-US President James Buchanan), it was
one of the most notorious examples in US history of a president ginning up a
&#34;rally &#39;round the flag&#34; war to distract the populace from domestic
strife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The so-called &#34;Mormons&#34;
(members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) had been driven
from Missouri to Illinois, and following the assassination of their founding
prophet Joseph Smith, were compelled to leave the United States altogether to
escape persecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The vanguard, led by Brigham
Young, arrived in the valley of the Great Salt Lake in July 1847. The area was
still part of Mexico at the time. Young was passionately encouraged by many who
had already been there to continue to California, but he refused, saying he
wanted to settle the Saints in &#34;a place no one else wants.&#34;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Brigham Young is recorded to have
told his people, in 1847, that if the &#34;Gentiles&#34; would leave the
Saints alone for ten years, they would become strong enough to defy any attempt
to drive them out again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Ten years was <i>exactly</i> how
long they got.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>During their decade of peace,
Brigham Young sent out colonizing parties to every habitable locale within
about a 300 mile radius of the Salt Lake Valley – including my town of Cedar
City, on the southern rim of the Great Basin, 240 miles to the south, settled
in 1851.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>By 1857, the population of the
territory had grown to about 35,000. Thousands had emigrated from Scandinavia
and the British Isles – including my ancestors, who were impoverished English
factory workers from the ghettos of Manchester, as immortalized by Friedrich
Engels in his pre-communism classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Condition-Working-Class-England-Classics/dp/0140444866" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Condition of the Working Class in England.</a><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The casus belli of the &#34;Utah
War&#34; was erected on a foundation of tall tales spun by corrupt federal territorial officials who, amid lurid personal scandal, slithered back to Washington to
breathlessly report that the &#34;Mormons&#34; were in a state of
&#34;rebellion&#34; against the US government.</span></p>



<p><span>The federal appointees were
simply upset that, given the dynamics of the organization they were up against – allegedly licentious polygamy-practicing religious fanatics led by a
theocratic dictator (or so it was framed) – they simply wielded no real power
in the Utah Territory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>And, of course, they were, as a
class, considerably less than “morally upright”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>My sense of the matter is that
few in Washington were overly persuaded by the story of a <i>bona fide</i> insurrection
in Utah, but President Buchanan, drowning in unprecedented internal strife,
seized the propitious opportunity presented by the fabricated &#34;dossier&#39;&#39;,
and ordered elite regiments of the US Army – 2500 troops in total – to march to
Utah to &#34;put down the Mormon rebellion.&#34;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The troops set out for Utah from
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on July 18, 1857. The famous territorial lawman Porter
Rockwell, fulfilling a federal mail contract, just happened to be there; he
learned of their plans, and raced back to Utah to inform Brigham Young.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>Orrin Porter Rockwell was, in
many ways, the Forrest Gump of the Old American West. He repeatedly shows up at
significant junctures in Old West history, often with an important role to
play. He was also a universally feared Deputy Marshal of the Utah Territory,
who is reputed to have slain upwards of 80 outlaws over the course of his
multi-year tenure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Later in life, after a night of
whiskey drinking in Salt Lake City, and while walking back to his hotel with
friends, he was accosted by some hostile family members of an outlaw he had
shaded, and was accused of being a cold-blooded murderer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Rockwell famously replied, “I
never killed any man that didn’t need killing.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The phrase later inspired a line in
the classic John Wayne film, <i>True Grit</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Rockwell arrived in Salt Lake
City on July 24, 1857 – ten years to the day since the Mormons entered the valley.
But the city was almost devoid of inhabitants, most of whom had travelled
to the top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Cottonwood_Canyon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Cottonwood Canyon</a> to celebrate their decennial anniversary in
the valley.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Rockwell raced up the canyon and informed
Brigham Young of the news. Young immediately called the large gathering to
order, related the facts of the matter, assessed the sentiments of the Saints,
and resolved that they would not be driven again from the towns and cities they
had built.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Preparations to resist the army
commenced immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>They quickly assembled a small mounted force, whose strategy was simple: with
strict orders to avoid bloodshed, they were to operate as raiding guerrillas;
to burn all the grass ahead of and behind the Army&#39;s supply trains; to
confiscate their cattle, mules, and horses whenever possible, and to burn the
supply wagons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>In the succinct order of Brigham
Young, “Defeat the US Army, but do not shed blood.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Within several days, scouting parties
were dispatched to locate and discreetly follow the US Army, and send back
regular reports to the valley.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The troops ultimately marshalled
to “Defeat the US Army” never consisted of more than about 150 cavalrymen. They
called themselves the “Nauvoo Legion”, and to a man they were expert horsemen and
outdoorsmen with unrivaled knowledge of the mountainous terrain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>This handful of young Mormon
cavalry was led in the field by the famously iconoclastic duo of Lot Smith and
Porter Rockwell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>Operating often at night, they raided
the supply train camps, drove off the wagon mules, captured most of the cattle (which they
herded back to the Salt Lake Valley), burned most of the wagons, and <b><i>never
killed a single US soldier nor suffered a casualty themselves.<o:p></o:p></i></b></span></p>



<p><span>My favorite account from the
campaign was recorded by Captain Lot Smith, who, after having captured and
burned several wagon trains already, came upon another:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<blockquote><p><i><span><b>“On the morning following, we met
another train … we disarmed the teamsters, and I rode out and met the captain
about a half-mile away. I told him that I came on business. He inquired the
nature of it. I demanded his pistols. </b></span></i></p><p><i><span><b>“He replied, ‘By God, sir, no man
ever took them yet, and if you think you can, without killing me, try it.’</b></span></i></p><p><i><span><b>“We were all the time riding
towards the train, with our noses about as close together as two Scotch
terriers would have held theirs – his eyes flashing fire. I couldn’t see mine.</b></span></i></p><p><i><span><b>“I told him that I admired a
brave man, but that I didn’t like blood. ‘You insist on my killing you, which
will only take a minute, but I don’t want to do it.’</b></span></i></p><p><i><span><b>“We had by this time reached the
train. I told them to hurry up and get their things out, and take two wagons,
for we wanted to go on. Simpson (of the infantry) begged me not to burn the
train while he was in sight; said that it would ruin his reputation as a wagon
master.</b></span></i></p><p><i><span><b>“I told him not to be so
squeamish, that the trains burn very nicely, I had seen them before, and that we
hadn’t time to be ceremonious. We then supplied ourselves with provisions, set
the wagons afire, and rode on.”</b></span></i></p></blockquote>























<p><span>By the time the Army arrived on
the outskirts of Fort Bridger, Wyoming, winter had arrived in force and stopped
them in their tracks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>As the <i>coup de grace</i>, the
Mormons (who purchased the fort in 1855) burned it to the ground right before
the Army arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The army barely survived the
winter, and had to endure what they viewed as the ultimate insult of Brigham
Young&#39;s offer of provisions (which the Army refused).<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>They resumed their advance the
following spring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Just east of the Wasatch Mountains,
the Army was compelled to descend Echo Canyon, a miles-long narrow passage bordered
by steep red sandstone walls. There was no other way. Interstate 84 and the
Union Pacific Railroad were likewise compelled to the take the same route as
the only viable passage through the Wasatch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>Apprised by spies of where the
Army would camp each night, a couple squads of the Nauvoo Legion built long strings
of campfires on the buttes behind and in advance of the Army’s designated campsite,
and then continually rotated troops from one to the next to feed the fires, making
noisy demonstrations at each stop along the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>The US troops below became
convinced they were up against probably <i>thousands</i> of fanatical “Mormons” who
would slaughter them in an instant at the order of Brigham Young.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>It was first-class military
deception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Meanwhile, Young sent
representatives to the advancing force, and shrewdly negotiated an agreement
whereby the army was permitted to enter the valley, but could not encamp
themselves any nearer than 40 miles from Salt Lake City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Eventually the Army passed
through a temporarily evacuated Salt Lake City, and travelled 50 miles to the
southwest where they built Camp Floyd, and remained until 1861.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Ironically, with the outbreak of
the US Civil War, a large proportion of the officers sent to &#34;put down the
Mormon rebellion&#34; joined the Confederacy. General Albert Sidney Johnston himself,
the commander of the Utah Expedition, led the Confederate troops at the important
Battle of Shiloh in 1862, in which he was killed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>More humiliating for the US Army
was the realization, over the course of their entire stay in Utah, that the “Mormons”
were making a handsome profit off their presence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Indeed, in aggregate the territory gained at least ten million dollars in hard currency – much of it in gold –
during the army&#39;s 1858-61 &#34;siege&#34; of the alleged &#34;dictator&#34;
Brigham Young and his rebellious flock. It was a HUGE windfall about which
officers often complained bitterly in their communications to colleagues
and family “back east”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>When the last troops left Camp
Floyd, they burned or otherwise destroyed virtually everything of value which
they could not carry with them – in order that the &#34;damned Mormons&#34;
could not profit a farthing more than they already had from &#34;Buchanan&#39;s
Blunder&#34;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>Utah remained assiduously neutral
during the US Civil War and continued to profit from traffic moving in and out
from all points of the compass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span>After the war, in 1869, the
transcontinental railroad was completed at Promontory Point, on the northern
shore of the Great Salt Lake. Rail spurs rapidly connected the entire region to
the main line. My great-grandfather and his father both helped construct the
grade from Promontory Point to Salt Lake City, which thereafter assumed the
moniker of &#34;The Crossroads of the West&#34;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
