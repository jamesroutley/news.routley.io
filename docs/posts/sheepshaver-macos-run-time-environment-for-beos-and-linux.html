    <h1>SheepShaver: macOS run-time environment for BeOS and Linux</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="info">
<h2>General information</h2>

 <h3>What is SheepShaver?</h3>
 <p>
 SheepShaver is a MacOS run-time environment for BeOS and Linux that allows
 you to run classic MacOS applications inside the BeOS/Linux multitasking
 environment. This means that both BeOS/Linux and MacOS applications can run
 at the same time (usually in a window on the BeOS/Linux desktop) and data can
 be exchanged between them. If you are using a PowerPC-based system,
 applications will run at native speed (i.e. with no emulation involved).
 There is also a built-in PowerPC emulator for non-PowerPC systems.
 </p>
 <p>
 SheepShaver is distributed under the terms of the
 <a href="http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/COPYING">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.
 However, you still need a copy of MacOS and a PowerMac ROM image to use
 SheepShaver. If you&#39;re planning to run SheepShaver on a PowerMac, you probably
 already have these two items.

 <h3>Getting the source code</h3>
 <p>
 The source code of SheepShaver (and <a href="http://basilisk.cebix.net">Basilisk II</a>)
 is being hosted in a <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> repository on GitHub:
 </p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cebix/macemu">Main page of the GitHub repository</a>
  </li><li><a href="https://github.com/cebix/macemu/zipball/master">Download the most current source code as a zip file</a> <i>(~2MB)</i>
 </li></ul>
 <p>
 To download the current version of the repository via Git:
 </p>
<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/cebix/macemu.git
$ cd macemu/SheepShaver
$ make links
</pre>
 <p>
 The last command creates links inside the &#34;SheepShaver&#34; source tree to files
 in the &#34;BasiliskII&#34; tree which are shared between both emulators.
 </p>
 <p>
 After downloading and setting up the repository you can, for example, try
 to compile the Unix version of SheepShaver:
 </p>
<pre>$ cd macemu/SheepShaver/src/Unix
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

 <h3>Didn&#39;t I already see this years ago?</h3>
 <p>
 Yes, SheepShaver originally appeared for BeOS in 1998 as a commercial
 application (first as shareware, then via the now long-defunct BeDepot). Due
 to the demise of Be, it has been re-released in 2002 as Open Source software
 under the GPL.
 </p>

 <h3>Can I run MacOS X applications under Windows with this?</h3>
 <p>
 No. Firstly, SheepShaver doesn&#39;t run under Windows. Secondly, MacOS X doesn&#39;t
 run under SheepShaver.
 </p>

 <h3>Will you make a Windows version?</h3>
 <p>
 I&#39;m not a Windows programmer.
