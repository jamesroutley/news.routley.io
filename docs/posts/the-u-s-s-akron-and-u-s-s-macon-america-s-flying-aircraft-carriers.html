Aircraft were launched and retrieved by means of a trapeze, and could enter and exit the hangar though a large T-shaped opening at the bottom of the hull.</p><p>The capacity to embark and deploy fixed-wing aircraft was the essential element of Akron and Macon’s ability to serve as naval scouts. Airplanes greatly increased the range and area over which the airship could search for the enemy, but also addressed the airship’s own inherent weakness; its vulnerability to attack. The giant airships made large, slow targets which were highly vulnerable to destruction by an enemy’s planes.</p><p>Although the Navy originally envisioned the airships as scouting vessels which carried airplanes for fighter defense, over time (and over the objection of officers like <a href="https://www.airships.net/charles-rosendahl">Charles Rosendahl</a>) the Navy eventually realized that the vulnerable airship itself was best employed in the background, out of sight of the enemy; the airship’s function would be to carry scouting planes within range of the enemy. As naval airship doctrine eventually developed, rather than the airplane extending the scouting range of the airship, it was the airship which extended the scouting range of the airplane.</p><div id="attachment_6583"><p><a href="https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/macon-launch-recover-web1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6583" loading="lazy" title="USS Macon Launching and Recovering Aircraft" src="https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/macon-launch-recover-web1-550x250.jpg" alt="USS Macon Launching and Recovering Aircraft" width="550" height="250" srcset="https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/macon-launch-recover-web1-550x250.jpg 550w, https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/macon-launch-recover-web1-200x91.jpg 200w, https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/macon-launch-recover-web1-385x175.jpg 385w, https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/macon-launch-recover-web1.jpg 1113w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6583">U.S.S.

Goodyear president Paul Litchfield had insisted that the Zeppelin Company’s chief stress engineer, Karl Arnstein, be included in that group, and in November, 1924 Arnstein arrived in Akron along with a team of 12 hand-picked Zeppelin engineers. It was under Arnstein’s leadership that Goodyear-Zeppelin developed the plans which became the U.S.S. Akron and U.S.S.

In earlier zeppelins, the staggering of engines at differing heights along the hull allowed each propeller to operate in clean air, undisturbed by the prop wash from the engine in front of it, whereas the propellers on Akron and Macon operated in the disturbed air created by the engines ahead of them.  Placing the engines in a straight line along each of the lower keels, however, allowed for a much simpler and lighter design, and was accepted as a better alternative than the additional weight and complexity of the framework that would have been required to stagger them.</p><div id="attachment_3271"><p><a href="https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/akron-engine-room-web.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3271" loading="lazy" title="akron-engine-room-web" src="https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/akron-engine-room-web-385x304.jpg" alt="One of the eight engine rooms aboard USS Akron" width="385" height="304" srcset="https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/akron-engine-room-web-385x304.jpg 385w, https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/akron-engine-room-web-150x118.jpg 150w, https://3iz4pu1r2cxqxc3i63gnhpmh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/akron-engine-room-web.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3271">One of the eight engine rooms aboard U.S.S.

Macon (ZRS-5) was a virtually identical copy of her sister ship, U.S.S.

Later that year Macon left the Naval Air Station at Lakehurst for her new home in California at the U.S. Naval Air Station, Sunnyvale, which had been renamed Moffett Field in honor of Admiral Moffett.</p><p><strong><span>USS Macon filmed during flight trials</span></strong></p><p> <iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpVYXpGZOgg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Macon participated in numerous exercises with the fleet over the Pacific and also the Caribbean. In one notable adventure, in July, 1934, Macon’s scout planes were able to locate the two Navy cruisers transporting President Roosevelt across the Pacific to Hawaii on vacation. Macon was generally successful in locating enemy warships during exercises but operations revealed that the airship had significant vulnerability to attack.</p><p>In, April, 1934, in rough air over Texas, Macon’s tail was damaged in the area where the fins attached to the framework. In the original design of both Akron and Macon, the leading edge of the fins would have been attached to one of the ship’s main rings, but the design was modified to provide better visibility of the fins from the control car. The incident over Texas revealed the weakness in this design; repairs were clearly necessary, and were performed on three of the fins, but the Navy delayed repairs to the upper fin.</p><h2><strong><a id="MaconCrash"></a>Crash of U.S.S. Macon</strong></h2><p>Macon crashed at sea off the coast of California during a storm on February 12, 1935, after her unrepaired upper fin suffered in-flight structural failure.</p><p>The failure of the upper fin damaged the three aft gas cells and caused the loss of a significant quantity of helium, representing about 20% of the airship’s lift.  But the Macon remained in the air for 34 minutes after the initial damage, and airship historian Richard K. Smith has convincingly argued that the failure of the upper fin was not necessarily a catastrophic event.</p><p>After the separation of the fin, the ship climbed rapidly to an altitude of almost 5,000 feet, well above its pressure height, causing the automatic gas valves to open and release large quantities of additional helium.  The ship then began its irreversible descent into the ocean.  Dr. Smith argued that the loss of helium from the original damage was compensated by the jettisoning of 32,700 pounds of fuel and ballast, and by the loss of the 2,700 pound fin itself.  It was the loss of the additional helium, which was automatically valved when the ship climbed above pressure height, that actually doomed the airship.  Smith criticized the decision to drop large amounts of fuel and ballast in the first two minutes after the initial casualty, before officers could fully evaluate the nature of the damage, and also the continued operation of the ship’s engines (perhaps without the knowledge or control of the officers in the control car), which may have caused the nose-high airship to climb rapidly as the result of dynamic lift.</p><p>Unlike U.S.S.
