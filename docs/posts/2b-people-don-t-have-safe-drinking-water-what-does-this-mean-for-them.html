    <h1>2B people don&#39;t have safe drinking water: what does this mean for them?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h2>For billions, it can mean hours spent collecting water. For almost a million, it means dying from disease.</h2></header><p><span>In the time it would take me to write the next sentence, I could get up, walk to the kitchen, and pour myself a glass of clean water. I’ve never had to worry about whether that water would make me sick.</span></p><p><span>Almost six billion other people in the world share this reality. They have safe drinking water in their homes, ready whenever needed.</span></p><p><span>That still leaves two billion people without. That’s the most important number in this article: </span><strong><span>two billion people who don’t have safe water to drink</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>But these large numbers can seem abstract. It’s not clear what this means in practice. If people don’t have safe water, what </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> they drinking? What does it mean for their daily lives?</span></p><p><span>Here, I want to answer these questions and bring a more human perspective that sometimes gets lost when we’re talking about millions or billions of people.</span></p><p><span>Before we get into some of the personal stories and accounts, it’s important to understand how levels of drinking water services are defined and how many people fall on each “rung” of the ladder. I’ve summarized this in the diagram below based on data from the WHO and UNICEF.</span><a href="#note-1"><sup><span>1</span></sup></a></p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/04a5226d-a9e8-43dc-f005-bdcafecf3b00/w=48 48w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/04a5226d-a9e8-43dc-f005-bdcafecf3b00/w=100 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/04a5226d-a9e8-43dc-f005-bdcafecf3b00/w=350 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/04a5226d-a9e8-43dc-f005-bdcafecf3b00/w=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/04a5226d-a9e8-43dc-f005-bdcafecf3b00/w=1350 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/04a5226d-a9e8-43dc-f005-bdcafecf3b00/w=2754 2754w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"/><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/04a5226d-a9e8-43dc-f005-bdcafecf3b00/w=2754" alt="A data visualization titled &#34;The safe drinking water ladder: Where do people in the world get their water from?&#34; displays various categories of drinking water access worldwide. The upper section highlights &#34;Safe drinking water,&#34; indicating that 5.82 billion people, or 73%, have access to sources that are free from contamination, on the premises, and always available.

The next level shows &#34;Basic source,&#34; with 1.46 billion people, representing 18% of the population, who have access to drinking water less than 30 minutes away. Following that, there is the &#34;Limited source,&#34; where 292 million people (3.7%) access water more than 30 minutes away.

The lower section details sources considered &#34;Unimproved,&#34; with 296 million people (3.7%) using water from unprotected wells or springs, which are at risk of contamination, and &#34;Surface water,&#34; where 156 million people (1.4%) rely on potentially polluted sources like rivers, lakes, or ponds.

In the footer, the data source is listed as WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) from 2024. It also notes that the information is provided by Our World in Data, which focuses on research and data aimed at tackling global issues.

Again, this is the reality for almost six billion people.</span></p><p><span>What are the other two billion drinking? If you’d asked me in the past, I might have guessed that most people without safe drinking water were collecting water from streams or lakes. The world was binary: you either had safe piped water or were collecting it from a river. But that’s not the reality: people collecting surface water are in the minority. Only around 156 million people get their water this way. That’s </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/access-drinking-water-stacked"><span>1.4% of the global population</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The vast majority of the two billion — around three-quarters of them — </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> have access to a piped water source or protected well that is </span><em><span>probably</span></em><span> safe to drink. But it’s either not located in their home, is not always available, or there’s no guarantee it’s completely contamination-free. That usually means they must travel to get there; whether that round-trip takes less or more than 30 minutes determines whether they fall into the “basic source” or “limited source” category. This is summarized in the diagram below.</span></p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/60e4e96d-6413-4182-e4da-2a555750f900/w=48 48w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/60e4e96d-6413-4182-e4da-2a555750f900/w=100 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/60e4e96d-6413-4182-e4da-2a555750f900/w=350 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/60e4e96d-6413-4182-e4da-2a555750f900/w=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/60e4e96d-6413-4182-e4da-2a555750f900/w=1350 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/60e4e96d-6413-4182-e4da-2a555750f900/w=2550 2550w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"/><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/60e4e96d-6413-4182-e4da-2a555750f900/w=2550" alt="An infographic titled &#34;Drinking water: the different categories that determine someone&#39;s level of access to safe water sources.&#34; The upper section outlines categories for individuals with access to improved water sources. It highlights three types: 

1. Safe Source - Water available at home, contamination-free.
2. Basic Source - Water accessed in less than 30 minutes round trip.
3. Limited Source - Water accessed in more than 30 minutes round trip.

The lower section discusses individuals without access to improved water sources, featuring:

1. Unimproved Source - Water from an unprotected well or spring.
2. Surface Water - Water from rivers, streams, ponds, or lakes.

To do this, I’ve relied heavily on the </span><a href="https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Dollar Street project</span></a><span>, built by Anna Rosling Rönnlund at Gapminder.</span><a href="#note-2"><sup><span>2</span></sup></a><span> It lets us see the realities of daily life for more than 250 families across 50 countries — from the very poorest to some of the richest.</span></p><p><span>Although families on different rungs of the “drinking water ladder” can have very different experiences, the costs of not having safe drinking water are the same. There are two main ones (which I’ll expand on later).</span></p><p><span>The first is the most obvious. Drinking contaminated water can </span><strong><span>spread disease, make us sick, and in many cases, can be fatal</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second thing we think about less is </span><strong><span>the time it takes to collect this water</span></strong><span>.

A family could have a moderate income, but if they’re in an extremely remote area without piped networks and accessible wells, it’s difficult to get clean water easily.

Before that, the focus was on the number of people who had access to an “improved water source.”</span></p><p><span>An improved water source can potentially deliver safe water: it’s a protected pipe, spring, borehole, or other system that </span><em><span>probably</span></em><span> delivers safe water.</span></p><p><span>The problem is that it doesn’t guarantee the water is safe at the point of consumption. Imagine you collect a bucket of water from a pipe an hour from home. It might be safe when you collect it, but once you’ve trekked an hour back and left it sitting unrefrigerated in the heat for the rest of the day, there’s no guarantee that it’s free of pathogens when you drink it the next morning.</span></p><p><span>That’s the key point here. 95% of the world uses an improved water supply. As the map below shows, the majority in every country does, even in the poorest countries.</span><a href="#note-6"><sup><span>6</span></sup></a></p><p><span>Many countries have rapidly increased this share in the last few decades. In the slope chart, you can see the change in the share of the population with improved water for a selection of countries that still had pretty poor coverage in 2000. In Ethiopia, for example, access has tripled from just 26% to 80%.</span></p><p><span>Countries </span><em><span>can</span></em><span> quickly increase access to a (probably) clean piped, spring, or borehole source. The biggest challenge is getting those pipes into each individual household </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> making sure that the source is completely contamination-free. This aspect is harder, and often means expanding a single community-shared pipe into a whole water network. This is even more difficult in rural settings where infrastructure is less concentrated.</span></p><p><span>But to get universal access to safe drinking water, this is what the world will need to do.</span></p><p><span>Researching this article has helped me understand these abstract definitions and numbers. I hope they’ve clarified some of this for you, too.</span></p><p><span>I want to close by highlighting, again, the costs of not having safe drinking water.</span></p><p><span>The one I had underappreciated was the amount of time that some families spend collecting water. This is often women or children. We saw that this could take 70 hours a week in the most extreme examples. For most of us, that seems unfathomable: imagine that collecting water was a full-time job for not only you but another member of your family.</span></p><p><span>The second is more obvious, but still a huge global problem. Unsafe water </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor"><span>leads to</span></a><span> more than 800,000 deaths every year.</span><a href="#note-7"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a><span> This is because it can lead to the spread of </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/diarrheal-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>diarrheal diseases</span></a><span>, such as cholera or dysentery, and other diseases, including polio and hepatitis. It can also lead to malnutrition, which is </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/half-child-deaths-linked-malnutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>attributed to</span></a><span> half of all childhood deaths.</span><a href="#note-8"><sup><span>8</span></sup></a></p><p><span>These deaths tend to be concentrated in lower-income countries where fewer people have safe water to drink. As you can see on the map, in some of the worst-off countries, more than 5% of all deaths are attributed to unsafe water.</span></p><div><div><figure><picture><source id="grapher-preview-source" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-deaths-unsafe-water.png?imWidth=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-deaths-unsafe-water.png?imWidth=1700 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"/><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-deaths-unsafe-water.png" width="850" height="600" loading="lazy" data-no-lightbox="true"/></picture></figure></div></div><p><span>Again, a number as large as 800,000 can seem abstract. But that’s 800,000 families that have to endure the loss of a loved one, often their own child. What’s perhaps even more painful is that they died from one of the few things that humans need to stay alive.</span></p><p><span>Very few people in the world know this better than </span><a href="https://www.wateraid.org/ca/stories/life-after-loss-in-tombohuaun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Haja, a young mother</span></a><span> from Sierra Leone. She lost three children in just three years; two of them were small babies when they died from diarrheal diseases as a result of unsafe water.</span></p><p><span>As she puts it, “I have given birth to six children, but I only have three alive.”</span></p><p><span>That’s the reality of not having safe water to drink. Every day, you have no choice but to give your children, siblings, parents, or grandparents the very thing that could kill them.</span></p><div><h4>Acknowledgments</h4><p><span>I relied heavily on </span><a href="https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Dollar Street</span></a><span> — a project published by Gapminder and Anna Rosling Rönnlund — for the stories and visuals used in this article.
