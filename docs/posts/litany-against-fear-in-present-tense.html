    <h1>&#34;Litany Against Fear&#34; in Present Tense</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I love the Litany, but think it could benefit from more present tense. A litany
is an entreating. That’s why they’re recited over and over. It tells one how to treat something as they are <em>currently</em>
experiencing it.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I must not fear</p>

<p>Fear is the mind killer</p>

<p>Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.</p>

<p>I face the fear.</p>

<p>Pass over me and through me.</p>

<p>As it goes past, I turn the inner eye to see its path.</p>

<p>There is nothing. Only I remain.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mind can go either direction under stress—toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.</p>

<p>Remember your training.</p>
