    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I‚Äôve been experimenting with an algorithm I developed independently, and I thought it might be beneficial to share it. I‚Äôve named this algorithm ‚Äúbee-id‚Äù. It‚Äôs a single-byte unique identifier, compact enough to fit into just a byte.</p><p>I devised this algorithm out of a need for my game project. I required a method for generating unique identifiers, but these identifiers had to be as space-efficient as possible. At the same time, there was a strict no-collision policy - each ID had to be absolutely unique. And when the IDs were no longer needed, I wanted a way to recycle them for reuse.</p><p>The mechanics of the bee-id algorithm are straightforward.</p><h4 id="lease-an-id">Lease an ID</h4><p>The lease of a new ID is very straight forward. We keep an array of unique numeric IDs, a pointer to the current position in the array, and a lookup table which stores the array position for any given ID.</p><p>Every time we fetch an ID from the array, we move the pointer back until there are no items left and the pointer is <code>-1</code>. When that happens, there are no more available IDs and we must wait for some to be released.</p><figure><img src="https://bea.goth.cafe/images/blog-articles/beeid/id_lease_algo_1.png"/></figure><h3 id="release-an-id">Release an ID</h3><p>The release of an ID is a bit more complex since IDs can be released in any order. However, with a clever shuffling process, we can account for this.</p><figure><img src="https://bea.goth.cafe/images/blog-articles/beeid/id_release_algo_1.png"/></figure><p>And that approach will allow us to support 255 unique IDs. I think that‚Äôs pretty cool, so I named it bee-id. Thanks for reading! üêù</p><h3 id="implementation-in-golang">Implementation in golang</h3></div></div>
