<p>The GTK4 migration is one of the major refactoring projects on Inkscape’s roadmap. Besides migrating to a newer and more actively developed GUI framework version, this will help to significantly improve the performance of the user interface and the canvas (in particular OpenGL).</p>

<p>However, the migration is a complex endeavour and will change hundreds of files in our codebase. For this reason, it is imperative to perform the migration as quickly as possible, because all other work that touches the user interface during the migration time will face conflicts.</p>

<p>For this reason, the development team has decided to accelerate the migration in a two-fold way: a GTK expert, i.e. a senior C++ developer with GTK experience, will be hired and bring expert knowledge about GTK to the table. At the same time, an Inkscape expert will be hired for the same duration, bringing expert knowledge about Inkscape’s internal workings to the table. Those two will form a powerful team to drive the GTK4 migration. Additionally, multiple senior Inkscape developers are available to consult the migration process as a whole.</p>

<h2>Job posting: Senior C++ developer</h2>

<p>The Inkscape project is looking for a senior C++ developer with experience in gtkmm.</p>

<p>What we expect from candidates:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Significant experience in gtk / gtkmm, ideally some experience in GTK4.</li>
	<li>Ability to work in an asynchronous setting / working across time zones, generally available during US or EU time zones.</li>
	<li>Ideally, experience with FOSS development.</li>
</ul>

<p>The candidate will perform essential steps in the GTK4 migration (see <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/migrating-3to4.html">https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/migrating-3to4.html</a>). Knowledge of GTK4/gtkmm4 is advantageous.</p>

<p>Duration:</p>

<p>Application documents:</p>

<ul>
	<li>CV</li>
	<li>Portfolio</li>
	<li>Answers to the following questions (one paragraph each):
