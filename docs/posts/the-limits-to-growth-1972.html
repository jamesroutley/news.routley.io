The team behind it, led by Dennis Meadows, found that continuing with a “business as usual” growth model would likely lead to environmental and economic collapse within a century. At the time, their discoveries sparked huge controversy among scientists, scholars, and the general public. In the decades since, those discoveries have been supported by patterns of growth, environmental health, and resource use.</p>
<p>Today, forty years after its release, <em>The Limits to Growth</em> remains an important resource for anyone hoping to understand more about the complex system that is our planet. We are honored and excited to make it freely available online. Each page of the publication has been carefully scanned and optimized for digital viewing, and all the original figures are included.
