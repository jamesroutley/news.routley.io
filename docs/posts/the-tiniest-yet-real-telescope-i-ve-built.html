    <h1>The tiniest yet real telescope I&#39;ve built</h1>

<p>A “relaxation” project, mostly drawn on planes to and from Norway this month, where I had to travel to setup a digital art installation in Kristiansand with friends from the digital art collective Lab212. It has been drawn with one major constraint: it must fit in the inner pocket of my jacket (well, one specific jacket), except for the rods.</p>
<p>This is a 3D-printed dobsonian telescope built around a 76mm/300mm parabolic mirror kit. While there are plenty of mini-scope models on the internet, I wanted something that looked like a dobson that went a bit too hard through the clothes dryer, but without compromise on what matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balance</li>
<li>Smooth movements</li>
<li>Rigidity</li>
<li>Collimatable</li>
<li>Focusable eyepiece holder</li>
<li>A minimum of style (entirely subjective)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<ul>
<li>PETG-CF filament</li>
<li>4mm carbon rods</li>
<li>M3 screws and M3x4.5x4.5 heat-set inserts</li>
<li>A spring</li>
<li>Nylon screws to collimate both the primary and secondary mirrors</li>
<li>4 magnets for the secondary</li>
<li>A bit of paraffin to lubricate the focuser</li>
<li>A lycra light shroud that also helps with delaying dew forming on the mirrors</li>
</ul>
<p>The focuser follows Analog Sky’s recipe: the tube that receives the eyepiece is also the movement itself, with a rounded thread that prints extremely smoothly with very little play. No additional hardware needed - the eyepiece is self-held by the flexion of plastic fins.</p>
<p>All the holes for the rods are straight, which forces them to arch, which “locks” the structure in place.</p>
<p>The alt/az movements use “teflon pads” (actually gray HDPE or UHMW for furniture feet) with rubber backing, scalped and glued.</p>

<p>If you build it, the real trick for ease of mounting is to chamfer the carbon rods with a 1mm chamfer at both ends and seal it with CA glue. See the chamfer pic in the gallery.</p>

<p>Sadly, the results aren’t great. We were used to very good l/6 or better recent buys from Aliexpress, but this one is very overcorrected. It was very smooth, with a rather good edge at the foucault, but is overcorrected by 70%. With the eyepiece I selected, putting it at 30x power, this does not show too much, and it retains its “real telescope” status. But this mirror is so small that I will not refigure it – the realuminizing costs would outweigh the entire project.</p>
<p><strong>Edit as of dec. 11th</strong> : of course I did not resist re-figuring it. It now hovers around 0.9 strehl. The star test with the selected eyepiece shows nice symmetric defocused stars and I can now cound individual spider web strands and distinguish the dew droplets it carries, on a nearby electrical pole, whereas I did not even see the spider web with the mirror as it was from the factory. I still need to do a proper “showable” Bath report with enough interferograms, my last test was 4 interferograms and carries a ton of noise. So it is great but I now have to get it coated, and working a mirror this small did raise a few challenges in handling it.</p>
