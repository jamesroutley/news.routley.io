    <h1>Working with CSV files on shell/terminal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>The Command Line is a powerful tool for processing data. With the right combination of commands, you can quickly and easily manipulate data files to extract the information you need. In this blog post, we will explore some of the ways you can use the command line to process data.</p> <p>One of the key benefits of using the command line to process data is its flexibility. The command line provides a wide variety of tools and utilities that can be used to perform a wide range of data processing tasks. For example, you can use the <code>awk</code> command to extract specific fields from a delimited data file, or you can use the <code>sort</code> command to sort a file based on the values in a particular column.</p> <p>Another benefit of the command line is its scriptability. Because the command line is a text-based interface, you can easily create scripts that combine multiple commands to perform complex operations on data files. This can be particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks, such as cleaning up data files or performing data transformations.</p> <p>The command line also offers a high level of control over the data processing process. Because you have direct access to the data files and the tools that are used to process them, you can easily fine-tune the behavior of the commands and customize the output to suit your specific needs.</p> <p>Overall, the command line is a powerful and flexible tool for processing data. With the right combination of commands and scripts, you can easily manipulate data files to extract the information you need. Whether you are a data scientist, a system administrator, or a developer, the command line offers a wealth of opportunities for working with data.</p> <hr/> <p>Here are some oneliners which can help you get started with processing data simply by using commandline</p> <ol> <li>To print the first column of a CSV file: <div><div><pre><code><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span>, <span>&#39;{print $1}&#39;</span> file.csv
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li>To print the first and third columns of a CSV file: <div><div><pre><code><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span>, <span>&#39;{print $1 &#34;,&#34; $3}&#39;</span> file.csv
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li>To print only the lines of a CSV file that contain a specific string:  </li> <li>To sort a CSV file based on the values in the second column:  </li> <li>To remove the first row of a CSV file (the header row):  </li> <li>To remove duplicates from a CSV file based on the values in the first column: <div><div><pre><code><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span>, <span>&#39;!seen[$1]++&#39;</span> file.csv
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li>To calculate the sum of the values in the third column of a CSV file: <div><div><pre><code><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span>, <span>&#39;{sum+=$3} END {print sum}&#39;</span> file.csv
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li>To convert a CSV file to a JSON array: <div><div><pre><code>jq <span>-R</span> <span>-r</span> <span>&#39;split(&#34;,&#34;) | {name:.[0],age:.[1]}&#39;</span> file.csv
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li>To convert a CSV file to a SQL INSERT statement: <div><div><pre><code><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span>, <span>&#39;{printf &#34;INSERT INTO table VALUES (\&#34;%s\&#34;, \&#34;%s\&#34;, \&#34;%s\&#34;);\n&#34;, $1, $2, $3}&#39;</span> file.csv
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> </ol> <p>Lastly, these are just a few examples of the many things you can do with these oneliners to process CSV data. With the right combination of commands, you can quickly and easily manipulate CSV files to suit your needs.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed reading this post and got a chance to learn something new.
