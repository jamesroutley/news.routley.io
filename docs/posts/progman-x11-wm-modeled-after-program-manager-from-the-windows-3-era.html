    <h2>Fewer inspirations, taken more seriously</h2>
    <p>A little talked about facet of Steve Jobs I&#39;ve picked up reading his biography: despite (or maybe because of) relatively little &#34;real-life&#34; experience, he deeply internalized and utilized lessons from almost everything he did outside of work.</p>

<p>Obvious example: he really only studied Zen intensely for a few years, but the internalized idea of focus shaped so much of apple.</p>

<p>One trip to Florence he noticed the stone sidewalks and years later insisted on using a similar material for the floors of the first apple stores. The calligraphy class he dropped in on later informed apple&#39;s fonts.</p>

<p>Think about how rare it is for you to truly internalize a lesson like that from anything you do.</p>

<p>Modern culture values inundating yourself with as many experiences as possible. But as a result, none of them are very impactful. In a sense Steve embodied the Charlie Munger aphorism: &#34;Take a simple idea, and take it seriously.&#34; I think this explains some of the reverence for re-reading books. Constant inflow of ideas feels good but sometimes its better to just truly internalize a few.</p>

<p>What&#39;s surprising and maybe a testament to how well that works is that many of these ideas that he stuck with seem unbelievable random. It doesn&#39;t seem he was inherently good fated stumbling across gems of inspiration. But rather he noticed somewhat random things, chose to make them part of his identity, and fully utilized them.</p>
