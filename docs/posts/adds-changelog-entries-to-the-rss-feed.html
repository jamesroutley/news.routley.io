    <h1>Adds changelog entries to the RSS feed</h1>

    <p>Over the last couple of months I’ve been slowly but steadily increasing the number of wiki pages on my website. I’ve quietly logged these changes on a rather inconspicuous “changelog” section of my site’s index page, but have been waffling about whether or not to include these changes in my RSS feed.</p>

<p>As of today I think I’ve finally settled on a way to include these updates in my RSS feed while also keeping them separate from the full-on blog posts on my website. If you’re seeing this, it worked!</p>

<p>Don’t worry, these page updates are all manually written and I promise to only mention things that are noteworthy. That is, I’m not going to blast your RSS feed away with noise as I make gramatical tweaks to pages.</p>

<p>I will, on the other hand, keep you posted as I update and create new pages like some of the more recent projects and things I’ve been working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202311060918%20Citibike%20system%20data%20reference.html">Citibike system data reference</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202310091958%20Bookmarks.html">Bookmarks</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202010200000%20Red%20Lentil%20Curry.html">Red Lentil Curry</a></li>
</ul>

<p>See ya soon!</p>
