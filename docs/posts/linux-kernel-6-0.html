    <h1>Linux Kernel 6.0</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Linus has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/910086/">released the 6.0 kernel</a> as
expected.
</p><blockquote>
	So, as is hopefully clear to everybody, the major version number
	change is more about me running out of fingers and toes than it is
	about any big fundamental changes.
<p>
	But of course there&#39;s a lot of various changes in 6.0 - we&#39;ve got
	over 15k non-merge commits in there in total, after all, and as
	such 6.0 is one of the bigger releases at least in numbers of
	commits in a while.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Headline features in 6.0 include
a number of io_uring improvements including support for buffered writes to
XFS filesystems and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/879724/">zero-copy network
transmission</a>,
an <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/903855/">io_uring-based block driver</a> mechanism,
the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/857862/">runtime verification subsystem</a>,
and much more; see
the LWN merge-window summaries (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/903487/">part 1</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/904032/">part 2</a>) for more information.<br clear="all"/></p><hr/><p>
