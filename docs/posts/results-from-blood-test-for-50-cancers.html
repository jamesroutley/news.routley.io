    <h1>Results from blood test for 50 cancers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="byline-block"><div data-testid="byline-new"><p><span data-testid="byline-new-contributors"><p><span>Fergus Walsh</span><span data-testid="undefined-role-location">Medical editor</span></p></span></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.</p><p>Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don&#39;t have any form of screening programme.</p><p>More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.</p><p>The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  </p><p>Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, said the data showed that the test could &#34;fundamentally change&#34; their approach to cancer screening. </p><p>He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer &#34;earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest&#34;.</p><p>The test<b id=""> </b>correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  </p><p>When combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  </p><p>Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.</p><p>These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.</p><p>But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.</p><p>Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: &#34;Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.&#34;</p><p>The topline results are to be released at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.esmo.org/">European Society for Medical Oncology</a> congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.</p><p>The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results &#34;very compelling&#34;.  </p><p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4&#39;s Today programme, he said: &#34;The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.&#34;</p><p>Many cancers are found when they are &#34;already very advanced&#34; he added, explaining that the aim is to &#34;shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative&#34;.</p><p>But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to &#34;avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm&#34;. </p><p>&#34;The UK<b id=""> </b>National Screening Committee will &#34;play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,&#34; he added.</p></div></div>
