Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy.&#34;</p><p><b>Representative Hakeem Jefffies, the highest-ranking Democrat in the House:</b> &#34;Today’s White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin.&#34;</p><p><b>Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the most senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee,</b> to a reporter: &#34;It&#39;s distressing to see the President... is walking away from our commitment in Ukraine, and doesn&#39;t seem to understand what a murderous dictator Vladimir Putin is.&#34; </p><p><b>Representative Gregory Meeks, the most senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee:</b> &#34;Trump’s actions today undermined U.S. leadership, emboldened our adversaries, humiliated both himself and his Republican Party, and insulted the generations of Americans who fought and died to build America’s standing in the world. It is not President Zelensky who disrespected the United States in the Oval Office. It was Donald Trump.” </p><p><b>Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran</b>: &#34;Attacking our democratic partner in service of an autocratic dictator. 

Trump is a national disgrace.&#34;</p><p><b>Representative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House</b> who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: &#34;Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vance’s embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin. Today was a distressing moment for those of us who value democracy and America’s role as a force for good.&#34;</p><p><b>Senator Chris Murphy, a more liberal Democrat</b> on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has emerged as one of Trump&#39;s fiercest critics, on X: &#34;What just happened in the Oval Office was a planned ambush, designed to help a brutal Russian dictator and hurt America&#39;s security. 

Trump has become Putin&#39;s lapdog, and America&#39;s global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy. What an embarrassment.&#34;</p></article></div></div>
