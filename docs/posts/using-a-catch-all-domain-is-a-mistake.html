        <p>A few years ago, I set up a free Google Workspace account on my domain and configured a catch-all email. Anything in the username field of the domain routed to my user account, for example, uber@notcheckmark.com ended up at me@notcheckmark.com.</p><p>I wanted to see who shared my email and give myself a way to block those bad actors. If Uber started selling my email, I could just trash everything to uber@notcheckmark.com. A lot of people do this with the &#34;+&#34; character, appending something to the end of the username part of their email (e.g. john+uber@gmail.com), but this is easily identified and removed.</p><p>I started using it everywhere for every business I dealt with: hilton@, marriot@, hyatt@, delta@, comcast@, citi@, banana@, jcrew@, etc.</p><p>It was all a huge mistake.</p><p>What happened is a decade of awkward interactions.</p><blockquote>[At a Hilton check-in]</blockquote><p>At one time, I may have tried to explain it but it&#39;s never less embarrassing.</p><blockquote>[At J.Crew, trying to do a return]</blockquote><p>For other companies, like Gap, my email on file is banana@ because I signed up in person at Banana Republic and used a shortened version to make things smoother. Gap and Banana Republic are the same company and share rewards and customer information systems. Do I remember that when I visit Gap? Largely no. If I do remember they&#39;re the same company, do I remember that I&#39;m using banana@ and not bananarepublic@ or br@? Definitely not.</p><p>I also have a bunch that I&#39;ve misspelled. My GrubHub account is gruhub@. I use a password manager for passwords but I also need to use it to remember the associated emails.</p><blockquote>[Trying to log into a website I know I have an account for]</blockquote><p>Every so often I need to email a company from one of these emails which requires me to configure my email client to match what they expect. If I don&#39;t, I risk the email getting routed wrong or having to prove it&#39;s actually mine.</p><p>Has it been worthwhile? No, not really. The only benefit is that I&#39;m able to tell when companies are breached before wider disclosures because I start getting spam emails sent to thatcompany@.</p><p>The truth is no one really sells your email – at least no legitimate companies. The one outlier is political campaigns: they&#39;ll share your email till the end of time. No matter what I do I can&#39;t get bernie@ purged from any lists. Every level of government has that email and they share it as widely as they can. I&#39;m pretty sure I only gave him $20 a decade ago.</p><p>It&#39;s been a decade of trouble and totally not worth it. Especially since all these companies ask for and verify your cell phone number – which is way more static than any email address. It&#39;s basically your digital SSN.</p>
