    <h1>Daily cannabis use overtakes drinking in US first</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>The number of Americans who smoke cannabis on a daily or near-daily basis now exceeds those who drink alcohol as often, a study has found.<!-- --></p><p>The research, published in the journal Addiction, is based on data collected by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health over four decades.<!-- --></p><p>In 2022, the survey recorded an estimated 17.7 million daily cannabis users, higher for the first time than the estimate of 14.7 million daily drinkers.<!-- --></p><p>Alcohol still remains the more widely used substance of the two.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the study found that, between 1992 and 2022, there was a 15-fold increase in the per capita rate of those who reported daily or near-daily use of cannabis.<!-- --></p><p>Less than one million people said they used cannabis nearly every day in 1992, the lowest reported usage since the study began in 1979.<!-- --></p><p>Dr Brooke Worster, the chief medical officer at EO Care, a medicinal cannabis firm, said that while there was increased use for a variety of reasons, &#34;taking away the taboo&#34; had led to more people openly reporting they used the drug.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;The rates have not changed as dramatically as the survey indicates,&#34; she told the BBC. &#34;People don&#39;t feel as scared to admit they&#39;re using it.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>She added that the industry for legal cannabis products had also exploded in the past two decades, shaping a marketplace that includes many older adults too.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s not just a 20-year-old pothead in a dorm room any more,&#34; said Dr Worster.<!-- --></p><p>Recreational use of cannabis is allowed in 24 states and the District of Columbia, while 38 states have legalised its medicinal use.<!-- --></p><p>The government has so far resisted calls to legalise or decriminalise the drug at the federal level.<!-- --></p><p>However, in the most significant drug reform in more than half a century, the justice department moved earlier this month to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I controlled substance on a par with heroin, to a Schedule III substance. <!-- --></p><p>President Joe Biden said: &#34;Far too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana.&#34;<!-- --></p><p>Common misconceptions of cannabis as a &#34;gateway&#34; to other drugs have not been borne out by medical research over several decades, Dr Worster noted, and the majority of users do not progress to harder drugs.<!-- --></p><p>But she said that younger adults and those who use high-potency products are at risk of contracting a cannabis-use disorder.<!-- --></p><p>Cannabis-use disorder does not lead to organ damage or death unlike alcohol or opioid-use disorders, but it can cause that health and social problems that greatly impact a person&#39;s quality of life or even their safety.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;It signifies the need for guidance and oversight for high-frequency users,&#34; Dr Worster said.<!-- --></p></div></div>
