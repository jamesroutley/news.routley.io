    <h1>Tell HN: LinkedIn banned me because of my avatar, in the middle of my fundraise</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been on LinkedIn for a while with zero issues with my normal cartoon avatar (which I use absolutely everywhere). Then yesterday, in the middle of my new startup&#39;s fundraise, they hit me with an ID verification and banned my account + deleted my startup&#39;s page.</p><p>My profile is missing. I have unanswered messages with people whose emails I don&#39;t have. Potential investors etc. Friends reaching out asking me why my profile is missing.</p><p>They didn&#39;t tell me why. Still this morning I didn&#39;t know. Now they just responded with an email telling me my &#34;appeal has been denied&#34;, and telling me that they removed my avatar for not complying with the TOS.</p><p>Zero warning, just straight to ban. This is the avatar: https://leclan.ch (it&#39;s used with the author&#39;s permission)</p></div></div></div>
