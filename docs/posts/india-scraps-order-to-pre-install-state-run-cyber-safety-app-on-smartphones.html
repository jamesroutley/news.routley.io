    <h1>India scraps order to pre-install state-run cyber safety app on smartphones</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>India has scrapped an order making it mandatory for smartphone makers to  preload a state-run cyber safety app on new phones after a public furore. </p><p>The order gave smartphone makers 90 days to pre-load new phones with its new Sanchar Saathi app which could not be &#34;disabled or restricted&#34;, <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedxyvx74p4o">sparking privacy and surveillance concerns</a>. </p><p>The government argued the move was necessary to verify the authenticity of handsets, but cybersecurity experts said it impinged on citizens&#39; right to privacy.</p><p>Withdrawing the order on Wednesday, the government cited the app&#39;s &#34;increasing acceptance&#34;. It came after Apple and Samsung had reportedly resisted the directive to pre-install it on their devices.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So far 14 million users have downloaded the app, reporting 2,000 frauds daily, and on Tuesday alone 600,000 new users registered - a tenfold spike, according to India&#39;s telecom ministry.</p><p>But the order<b id=""> </b>- passed last week but made public on Monday -<b id=""> </b>to make the registration mandatory had led to a major backlash from several cybersecurity experts. </p><p>Smartphone giants like Apple and Samsung also resisted the directive to pre-install the app on their phones. </p><p>Sources told the BBC the companies were concerned the directive was issued without prior consultation and challenged user privacy norms. </p><p>While the order has now been withdrawn, India&#39;s Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia dismissed concerns that the app could be used to increase surveillance.</p><p>&#34;Snooping is neither possible nor will it happen with the Sanchar Saathi safety app,&#34; Scindia said. </p><p>The government&#39;s decision to reverse the order was welcomed by digital advocacy groups. </p><p>&#34;This is a welcome development, but we are still awaiting the full text of the legal order that should accompany this announcement, including any revised directions under the Cyber Security Rules, 2024,&#34; the Internet Freedom Foundation said on X. </p><p>&#34;For now, we should treat this as cautious optimism, not closure, until the formal legal direction is published and independently confirmed.&#34; </p><p><i id="follow-bbc-news-india-on">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/"><i id="instagram">Instagram</i></a><i id=",">, </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured"><i id="youtube,">YouTube,</i></a><i id=""> </i><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBCIndia"><i id="twitter">Twitter</i></a><i id="and"> and </i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/"><i id="facebook">Facebook</i></a><i id=".">.</i></p></div></div>
