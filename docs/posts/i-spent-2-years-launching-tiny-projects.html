	<p><i>May 18th 2022</i></p>

	<p>Two years ago, frustrated with a long list of unfulfilled project ideas in my phone notes, I decided to start trying one idea each week in its tiniest form.</p>

	<p>I never kept to a weekly schedule, but I&#39;ve kept plodding along since then and launched 8 things.</p>

	<p>Each morning I sit down with a coffee and bash out some project code. It&#39;s a hobby I love, and one that&#39;s starting to generate some decent passive income now.</p>

	<p>In this post I want to update you on everything I&#39;ve launched, and share what I&#39;ve learnt about building lots of these tiny internet projects.</p>

	<p>Lets go back to the start.</p>

	<h3>💡 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/tiny_website" target="_blank">Tiny Website</a></h3>
	<p>The first project I made is this blog you&#39;re reading right now.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the blog was to simply document all the other projects I&#39;d make.</p>

	<p>I launched it the day after I turned 25, and the very first post I wrote, <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/tiny_websites_are_great">&#34;Tiny Websites are Great&#34;</a>, went semi-viral, which was <i>very</i> lucky and spurred me to keep going.</p>

	<p>Not much has changed here since then. I&#39;ve written 17 blog posts, and, of course, there&#39;s now <i>dark mode.</i></p>

	<p>Objectively, looking at page views, this is the most successful thing I&#39;ve ever created.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>May 2020</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>840,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>🌐 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/i_bought_netflix_dot_soy" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Domain names</a></h3>
	<p>One week after launching this blog, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to buy domain names from several FAANG companies, e.g. <a href="https://google.xn--9dbq2a/" target="_blank">google.קום</a></p>

	<p>This wasn&#39;t really a project, but I&#39;d always been interested in domains, and the blog post I wrote <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/i_bought_netflix_dot_soy" target="_blank">&#34;I bought netflix.soy&#34;</a> again went semi-viral.</p>

	<p>I still own <a href="https://netflix.soy" target="_blank">netflix.soy</a>. With Netflix stock tanking, maybe it&#39;ll be worth more one day.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>May 2020</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Facebook cease and desists: <b>1</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>⚔️ <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/battle_royale" target="_blank">8-bit Battle Royale</a></h3>
	<p>The next project I made was a tiny 8-bit battle royale game for Android.</p>

	<p>This was so fun to build, but ended up being my least successful project.</p>

	<p>I launched it to crickets, which was gutting after the success of the last blog posts.</p>

	<p>Sadly I lost the code for the game when I switched laptops. It&#39;s still live, but <i>very</i> buggy. This didn&#39;t stop someone <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1413059800" target="_blank">streaming it on Twitch</a> last month though.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>June 2020</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Downloads: <b>183</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>🛍️ <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/one_item_store" target="_blank">One Item Store</a></h3>
	<p>Next up I built a micro online store builder to sell a single product on repeat; just imagine a tiny Shopify.</p>

	<p>I cobbled this project together in 2 weeks, and launched it on Product Hunt.</p>

	<p>Amazingly, people started selling real things on there, netting me a mighty £1.63 in 1% transaction fees.</p>

	<p>Although this wasn&#39;t even enough for a Tesco meal deal, it was my first taste of internet money, and boy did it taste good.</p>

	<p>Amazingly, a few months after launching One Item Store, I was approached by someone looking to buy it.</p>

	<p>I ended up <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/selling_a_tiny_project" target="_blank">selling for $5,300,</a> which blew my tiny mind.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>June 2020</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>28,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£1.63</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>📗 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/snormal" target="_blank">Snormal</a></h3>
	<p>After conquering the e-commerce world, building a social network was the obvious next step.</p>

	<p>In a few weeks I launched &#34;Snormal&#34;: a social network for people to post everyday normal things, like &#34;I just ate a baguette&#34;.</p>

	<p>In hindsight, this does not make an exciting social network that people want to visit, and the website is kind of dead.</p>

	<p>I&#39;ve abandoned this project, but it still has a few daily users.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>August 2020</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>9,800</b></i></li>
<!-- 		<li><i>Users: <b>769</b></i></li> -->
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>💸 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/earlyname" target="_blank">Earlyname</a></h3>
	<p>I sign up to a lot of new products to snag a &#34;rare&#34; handle, e.g. <span>@ben</span>. My next project turned this into a business.</p>

	<p>Each month I&#39;d send out a newsletter with 4 new social networks, and let you know if your username was available on them.</p>

	<p>For an optional $10/month, I&#39;d actually register the usernames for you.</p>

	<p>After a 1 month build, I launched &#34;Earlyname&#34; on Product Hunt, and surprisingly got a few paying customers.</p>

	<p>For 6 months I sent out newsletters, growing Earlyname to $350/month in revenue, but ultimately decided I didn&#39;t enjoy running it.</p>

	<p>Having already sold one project, I confidently listed Earlyname on MicroAcquire and <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/selling_tiny_internet_projects_for_fun_and_profit" target="_blank">sold it for $10,500.</a></p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>October 2020</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>10,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>$4,200/year</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>💌 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/mailoji" target="_blank">Mailoji</a></h3>
	<p>One day, I found you could use emoji domains in email addresses, e.g. <span>hi@👋.kz</span></p>

	<p>Realising there were many .kz emoji domains available, I decided it would be a great idea to buy 300 Kazakhstan emoji domains and launch an emoji email address service.</p>

	<p>One month after launching, I had 150 customers, but I&#39;d actually made a loss from the domain name costs.</p>

	<p>Like all these projects, I wrote up a blog post about it and put it on Hacker News.</p>

	<p>The post did nothing for 30 minutes, then absolutely skyrocketed.</p>

	<p>I sold $9,000 in subscriptions over a weekend; the most I&#39;ve ever made in such a short period of time.</p>

	<p>Mailoji is still going strong, and now has 700 emoji domains. I collect them like Pokémon. Recently I caught <span>❤️.gg</span></p>

	<p>You can now also have full emoji email addresses like <span>🦄🚀@🍉.fm</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>March 2021</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>129,000</b></i></li>
<!-- 		<li><i>Revenue: <b>$8,250/year</b></i></li> -->
		<li><i>Total Revenue: <b>$18,500</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>📖 <a href="https://daily.tinyprojects.dev/paper_website" target="_blank">Paper Website</a></h3>
	<p>I really enjoy writing using pen &amp; paper, and wanted to start a daily blog.</p>

	<p>Over a few weeks, I built a prototype app that let you snap a picture of a handwritten page and turn it into a website.</p>

	<p>After enjoying writing a few &#34;paper blog posts&#34;, I decided to turn this prototype into a full-blown service called Paper Website.</p>

	<p>I bought 100 notebooks to give out to initial customers, and braced for launch.</p>

	<p>Fortunately it went well. Over 200 people have built a paper website, and I only have a few notebooks left in my kitchen.</p>

	<p>My <a href="https://daily.tinyprojects.dev" target="_blank">daily blog</a> runs on Paper Website, and I&#39;ve handwritten well over 100 paper blog posts without getting a paper cut.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>Launched: <b>November 2021</b></i></li>

		<li><i>Revenue: <b>$9,370/year</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>👍 Pros of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>Rapidly launching lots of tiny projects is so much fun. This is the main reason I do it.</p>

	<p>However, with each launch, I&#39;m slowly learning what makes a project &#34;successful&#34;. After 8 launches, I&#39;m starting to see some patterns.</p>

	<p>I&#39;ve also discovered what micro-businesses I like to run: I don&#39;t enjoy newsletters, but love quirky technical projects that generate passive income. I would never have known this launching just one thing.</p>

	<p>The best thing about tiny projects is they&#39;re so small, the stakes are incredibly low. There&#39;s zero pressure if something fails, you just move on guilt-free and try again.</p>

	<p>Another random benefit is my developer skills have 10X&#39;ed over the 2 years of building these projects. I was decent before, but I&#39;m on a different level now.</p>

	<h3>👎 Cons of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>A big debate is whether you should launch lots of things, or focus on just one.</p>

	<p>I personally enjoy the &#34;micro-bet&#34; approach, but I often wonder if I gave all my attention to one project I could see better financial success.</p>

	<p>At the moment I have 3 active projects that run on auto-pilot. Time management and context switching has been okay, but with 5+ active projects it might get hard.</p>

	<p>One other weird downside is that, as I&#39;ve grown an audience building these projects, I sometimes catch myself thinking &#34;should I build something just for the upvotes&#34;.</p>

	<p>It&#39;s tempting, because I know I could, and it would probably work. But, I think this is a sure-fire way to burn out fast.</p>

	<h3>🔮 Conclusions &amp; The Future</h3>

	<p>When I started this mission, I had a big list of project ideas that I&#39;d built up in my phone. Maybe you have one of those lists too.</p>

	<p>Two years later, I&#39;ve realised a lot of these initial ideas were pretty terrible.</p>

	<p>It&#39;s a paradox, but I&#39;ve found that my best ideas now come from building other ideas.</p>

	<p>I would never have thought of an emoji email address service going about my day-to-day, if I hadn&#39;t decided to stupidly experiment with domains and buy <a href="https://netflix.soy" target="_blank">netflix.soy.</a></p>

	<p>If you&#39;re stuck for ideas, I recommend just building something; anything; even if it&#39;s terrible, and I guarantee a better idea will pop into your brain shortly after.</p>

	<p>Each project I build now uses a spark of an idea from the previous. It&#39;s like a monkey swinging vine-to-vine, except the vines are projects, and I&#39;m just a dumb monkey.</p>

	<p>I want to keep building tiny projects for decades, and I&#39;m excited to see what ideas come next.</p>

	<p>Now, onto the next project!</p>
