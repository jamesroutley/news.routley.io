    <h1>Thankful Again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I read <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/amandalitman/p/a-gratitude-list">Amanda Litman&#39;s Thankful List</a> and figured I&#39;d write a similar post. Last year I made <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/post/749">a post</a> like this. Might as well continue.</p>
<p>This year I am<!-- --> <a href="https://www.ryanliptak.com/tag/thankful">#thankful</a> for...</p>
<ul>
<li>The health of my family and friends. It&#39;s not always great, but we keep trying.</li>
<li>The Ocean and all of its creatures.</li>
<li>Wikipedia. Shared knowledge is invaluable.</li>
<li>Emergency and disaster first responders. The only constant is things will fail, and people will need saving. Thanks for your hard work.</li>
<li>The folks who grow our food. We can&#39;t stay healthy without it.</li>
<li>My job. It&#39;s a complicated pile of stress and chaos, but it&#39;s still one of the best jobs I&#39;ve had.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database">tzdb</a> and <a href="https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/paul-eggert/">Paul Eggert</a>.</li>
<li>All of the small communities I am apart of on the internet. RC, Merveilles, Gunks, Time Owls, Ops Party, The Waystone, Nerd Chat, etc. Y&#39;all make the chaos bearable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading. Lots of love.</p>
