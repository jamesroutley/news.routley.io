    <h1>Rob Pikeâ€™s Rules of Programming (1989)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h3>Rob Pike&#39;s 5 Rules of Programming</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Rule 1.</b> You can&#39;t tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don&#39;t try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you&#39;ve proven that&#39;s where the bottleneck is.
</li><li> <b>Rule 2.</b> Measure. Don&#39;t tune for speed until you&#39;ve measured, and even then don&#39;t unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.
</li><li> <b>Rule 3.</b> Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don&#39;t get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)
</li><li> <b>Rule 4.</b> Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they&#39;re much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.
</li><li> <b>Rule 5.</b> Data dominates. If you&#39;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
</li></ul>
<p>

Pike&#39;s rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare&#39;s 
famous maxim &#34;Premature optimization is the root of all evil.&#34; Ken 
Thompson rephrased Pike&#39;s rules 3 and 4 as &#34;When in doubt, use 
brute force.&#34;. Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design 
philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often shortened to &#34;write stupid code that uses smart objects&#34;.
