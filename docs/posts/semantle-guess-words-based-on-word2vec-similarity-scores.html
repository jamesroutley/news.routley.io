    <h1>Semantle: guess words based on Word2vec similarity scores</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="rules-content">
          <h3 id="rules-heading">Guess the secret word</h3>
          <p>
            Each guess must be a word. Semantle will tell you how semantically
            similar it thinks your word is to the secret word.  Unlike
            that other word game, it&#39;s not about the spelling; it&#39;s
            about the meaning. The similarity value comes from
            Word2vec.  The highest possible similarity is 100
            (indicating that the words are identical and you have
            won). The lowest in theory is -100, but in practice it&#39;s
            around -34.  By &#34;semantically similar&#34;, I mean, roughly
            &#34;used in the context of similar words, in a database of
            news articles.&#34;
          </p>
          <p>
            Secret words may be any part of speech, but will always be
            single words.  It&#39;s tempting to think only of nouns, since that
            is how normal semantic word-guessing games work.  Don&#39;t get
            caught in the trap!  Since our Word2vec data set contains some
            proper nouns, guesses are case-sensitive.  But I removed all but
            lower-case words from the secret word set, and if your word
            matches the secret word but for case, you win anyway.  So if you
            want to know if the word is more like nice
            or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice">Nice</a>, you
            can ask about both.
          </p>
          <p>
            The &#34;Getting close&#34; indicator tells you how close you are --if
            your word is one of the 1,000 nearest normal words to the target
            word, the rank will be given (1000 is the target word itself).
            If your word is not one of the nearest 1000, you&#39;re &#34;cold&#34;. (By
            &#34;normal&#34; words&#34;, I mean non-capitalized words that appears in a
            very large English word list; there are lots of capitalized,
            misspelled, or obscure words that might be close but that won&#39;t
            get a ranking.  Those get marked with &#34;????&#34;).
          </p>
          <p>
            You will need more than six guesses.  You will probably need
            dozens of guesses. <b>There&#39;s a new word every day</b>, where
