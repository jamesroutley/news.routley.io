    <h1>How we had our Nectar Points stolen, and this is how yours will be too</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up on the 9th June 2023 to find Vicki quite upset.. She’d been looking at our Nectar account in the Nectar app and found that our 13,500 points (£67.50) had been spent that morning in Sainsburys in Hendon. Obviously, it wasn’t us, we’d literally just woken up (in Essex), but it was in the app, that we’d lost all those points.</p><div><figure><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDQiIGhlaWdodD0iNjU4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzA0IDY1OCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="304" height="658" data-src="https://www.kiphakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2e4be4c1-a495-4b74-a5e6-183a3a3eb678-304x658.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.kiphakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2e4be4c1-a495-4b74-a5e6-183a3a3eb678-304x658.jpg 304w, https://www.kiphakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2e4be4c1-a495-4b74-a5e6-183a3a3eb678-310x670.jpg 310w, https://www.kiphakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2e4be4c1-a495-4b74-a5e6-183a3a3eb678.jpg 421w" data-sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px"/><figcaption>The Nectar App, the morning we’d had our Nectar Points Stolen</figcaption></figure></div><p>She called Nectar and they seemed pretty unsurprised, they told her that they would ‘investigate’ and then send us out a new card, and hopefully refund our stolen points. In hindsight, it was actually mad how non-plussed they were about it, like it was something that happened every day..</p><p>It turns out, it’s actually VERY easy to get into ANYONE’s Nectar account – because the way their website works is so flawed. I spent the morning of the 9th June learning about the ‘security’ Nectar have in place, and well, there wasn’t much of it.</p><p>A Nectar Card Number is made up of 19 digits – the first 8 are the same for everyone – 9826 3000 – the remaining 11, are a string of numbers. Your Nectar Barcode is that 19 digits, in a standard form – there’s nothing special about it – it’s just those numbers.</p><p>So by essentially ‘trying’ any random string of 11 digits, you can find out, valid Nectar card numbers. If they ARE valid, you can essentially take them over, and make an online account for them. Or, even ‘better’ (for the fraudster, at least), if they find that an account has already been set up, you’ve found someone who clearly cares about their points enough to register, and could potentially have points on their account.</p><p>I sat and tried this a LOT on that morning, I used random number generators to make a string of 11 digits for me, and found several valid Nectar accounts that hadn’t been registered online, and a couple where the people HAD registered them. The only way that I was momentarily stopped was by an ‘Are you a Robot?’ Captcha coming up every once in a while.. which, once passed, I could carry on trying more and more numbers.</p><p>Once you’ve found a valid card number, there is nothing stopping a scammer going to a barcode generating website and creating a valid barcode, That would be accepted at any Sainsburys ‘Scan as you Shop’ terminal, or Self Scan checkout. I definitely didn’t do that, because, obviously, this is ACTUAL FRAUD – but I managed to create a working barcode for my own card in seconds. I detailed everything I found on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e243b_tVUOA" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e243b_tVUOA" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube video</a> on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kiphakes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube Channel</a>..</p><figure><p>

But it meant that with our new card we were seen as ‘new’ customers, so all the carefully algorithmically picked shopping items that we buy regularly and got extra Nectar Points on, or Nectar Prices were forgotten. It’s taken MONTHS for us to get the new card to learn what we buy, and give us relevant offers based on it.</p><p>As a result of the video I made, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001vs91" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001vs91" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC Radio 4</a> got in touch and have run a story about me, and others who have had points stolen. Also the comments section of my video lit up with people who had their points stolen too. Many of them had HUNDREDS of pounds worth of points taken – someone actually had £1000 taken. They actually only had £250 worth of points in their account – however, because the Nectar points balance doesn’t refresh immediately, the fraudsters hit their account 4 times in quick succession. Leaving them with a debit of £750 in their Nectar account balance.</p><p>You might think it’s irresponsible of me to share how easy it is to get into the Nectar system.. It might well be. However, I wanted to show people just how little Nectar value the security of their own systems, and the data, and ‘money’ of their customers. That is HUGELY irresponsible, and potentially something that could land them in a lot of trouble with the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</a>. Obviously my method relies on work, and a bit of luck.. but people a LOT cleverer than me, and could, and I believe HAVE scaled this up on an industrial level. What I’ve done could be done thousands of times over, you can automate this process for sure.. Whether they use my method, or another method, it should be so easy to peep into someone’s account like this.</p><p>When asked by BBC Radio 4 about mine, and others having their points stolen they said..</p><p>“If a customer suspects they’ve been a victim of fraud we recommend they contact the Nectar Helpline team, who will thoroughly investigate.</p><p>Fraudsters are becoming increasingly sophisticated and using a range of tactics. We can’t go into detail on the types of fraud we’re seeing specifically for obvious reasons.”</p><p>My method wasn’t even sophisticated.. it was just finding random numbers, and giving it a go..</p></div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%2090%2090%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-src="https://www.kiphakes.com/wp-content/litespeed/avatar/8dd0af1608efe25fac2c0b9c0d23a139.jpg?ver=1706202069" srcset="" data-srcset="https://www.kiphakes.com/wp-content/litespeed/avatar/e836de9373dc1c4c63bb62701126d2a5.jpg?ver=1706202068 2x" height="90" width="90" decoding="async"/></p></div><div><h5>
