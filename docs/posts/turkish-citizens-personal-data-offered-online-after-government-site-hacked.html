<p>A website called sorgupaneli.org is offering to provide Turkish citizens’ private data that was stolen from the e-Devlet government services website, even claiming to be able to offer President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s personal information.</p>
<p>The hacked information that is being offered for free by the website in return for a membership signup includes ID numbers, phone numbers and information about people’s family members.</p>
<p>More sensitive information, including full addresses, real estate deeds and education details, is being offered with a paid premium membership.</p>
<p>When BIRN accessed the website, it said that the personal data on offer includes information about high-ranking state and government officials including Erdogan and Turkey’s main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu.</p>
<p>Experts said that the data theft is the biggest yet in Turkey and constitutes a major digital security problem.</p>
<p>“First and foremost, access to this website should be blocked. Following this, a full-scale investigation should be launched,” Sule Ozsoy Boyunsuz, a professor of constitutional law, told HALK TV.</p>
<p>The Turkish authorities have so far remained silent on the issue and the website remains accessible although it often crashes due to the high demand putting pressure on its servers.</p>
<p>e-Devlet, which means e-government, is the main public administration portal in Turkey, and includes personal information including details about education, health, banking credentials and tax status.</p>
<p>For several years, the e-Devlet website has been criticised for not being secure enough, but the authorities have dismissed the claims.</p>
