    <h1>Psychedelic frees up depressed brain, study shows</h1>

These patients were more likely to experience an improvement in mood months later.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Similar changes were not seen in the brains of people treated with a standard antidepressant.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This supports our initial predictions, and confirms psilocybin could be a real alternative approach to depression treatments,&#34; Prof Nutt said.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Brain-activity"><span role="text">Brain activity</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Psychedelics are a type of hallucinogenic substance which affects all the senses, altering a person&#39;s thinking, sense of time and emotions.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While regular antidepressants are taken every day, psilocybin may only need to be taken once or twice to produce the same effect - but further research on more patients for longer is needed to confirm that.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01744-z">The results, published in Nature Medicine,</a> are taken from two studies. In the first, everyone received psilocybin; and in the second - a randomised controlled trial - some were given the drug while others were given a different antidepressant. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>All participants also received talking therapies with registered mental health professionals. Brain scans were taken before, and then one day or three weeks after taking the therapy.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Robin Carhart-Harris, senior study author, said: &#34;We don&#39;t yet know how long the changes in brain activity seen with psilocybin therapy last, and we need to do more research to understand this. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We do know that some people relapse, and it may be that after a while their brains revert to the rigid patterns of activity we see in depression.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Earlier findings from the studies showed a reduction in symptoms of depression with the psilocybin therapy - but the researchers were not sure how and why it worked.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Now they want to test their theory of changes in brain connectivity on other mental health illnesses, such as anorexia.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
