    <h1>Agents and Hierarchies</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><time>April 8, 2022</time></p><div>
<p>Designing any society, be it human or computational, involves decisions like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which agents choose which others to do what jobs?</li>
<li>Who will decide which jobs are done at all?</li>
<li>Who decides what efforts to expend?</li>
<li>How will conflicts be settled?</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, roles even in a hierarchy are always relative. To <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-world-of-blocks/"><em>Builder</em></a>, <em>Add</em> is a subordinate, but to <em>Find</em>, <em>Add</em> is a boss. As for yourself, which sorts of thoughts concern you most – the orders you are supposed to take or those you’re supposed to give?</p>
