<p><b><u>The Secret Life of XY Monitors</u></b>
</p><p>By Jed Margolin</p></center>

<p>      During my time at Atari/Atari Games I
worked on several XY games. This article represents what I know about XY
Monitors. XY was Atari&#39;s name for what the Computer Graphics industry calls
&#39;&#34;Random Scan&#34; and the Video Game Community calls &#34;Vector Games.&#34; The major
parts of the XY Monitor are the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), the Deflection
Amplifiers, and the High Voltage Supply.

<p><b><u>CRT Electron Optics</u></b></p></center>

<p>The CRT is an evacuated container with an Electron Gun that shoots a
focused electron beam at a phosphor-coated screen which absorbs the energy
of the electrons and re-emits it as visible light. The High Voltage Supply
produces the voltage needed to accelerate the electron beam toward the
screen. The Deflection Amplifiers move the electron beam in the desired
pattern.
</p><p>We will start with the CRT shown in Figure 1.
</p><p>When metal is heated to incandescence in a vacuum the electrons near
the surface are given enough energy to fly off into the surrounding space.
</p><p>The Electron Gun starts with the Heater (or Filament) which uses an
electric current in order to heat it up to incandescence. However, instead
of using the Heater  to directly produce electrons, it heats up a
separate element, the Cathode, to produce the electrons. One reason for
doing it this way is that it allows the Heater supply to be electrically
isolated from the Cathode.  This keeps the Cathode voltage out of
the Heater supply, allowing it to be used for other things as well. It&#39;s
also a safety issue, since the Cathode voltage might be substantial. I
suspect that another reason for using an indirectly heated cathode is that
it allows the Heater to be optimized for  long life and the Cathode
optimized for emitting electrons.
</p><center>

<p>The Control Grid (called G1) is operated with a negative bias with respect
to the Cathode (typically around 50V.) and acts to repel the electrons
coming from the Cathode.
</p><p>The reason for doing this is that the Screen Grid (G2) is operated at
a voltage that is higher than the Cathode (typically several hundred volts).
The physics works out that a small change in the Control Grid voltage has
a large effect on the electron beam current.
</p><p>The electron beam is further accelerated by Focus Grid (G3) which is
operated at an even higher voltage (typically several thousand volts).
As you may have guessed, the Focus Grid also focuses the beam.
</p><p>The final acceleration comes from an even higher voltage on the Anode
(typically several times the voltage on the Focus Grid).
</p><p>The resulting beam strikes the phosphor-covered screen which absorbs
the energy of the electrons and re-emits it as visible light
</p><p>The equations that describe the motion of electrons in a potential field
take the same form as those used to describe the behavior of optical lenses.
The shape of the electron beam on the screen is an image of the electron
beam at what is called the crossover point, which is the place in the electron
gun where the grids cause the electrons  to change velocity. 
The ratio of the voltage at the Focus Grid (G3) relative to the voltage
at the Anode controls the crossover point and therefore the point at which
the image is focused, much the same way as the curvature of an optical
lens determines its focal point.
</p><p>This is why it is called electron optics.
</p><p> A further note about the grid structures. While standard vacuum
tubes (both receiving and transmitting types) use grids in the form of
a mesh, the grids in a CRT are cylinders.  In addition, the Control
Grid (G1) also contains a disk with a hole in the middle called the Aperture
Disk. ( See Figure 2). This helps produce a narrow electron beam
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig2.gif" height="222" width="355"/></p></center>

<p>Now that we have a nice focused electron beam hitting the phosphor we
should probably move it around before we burn the screen.

<p><b><u>Electrostatic Deflection</u></b></p></center>

<p>Two pairs of parallel plates are mounted in the CRT. A voltage applied
across the Vertical Plates will deflect the electron beam vertically as
shown in Figure 3. A voltage applied across the Horizontal Plates will
deflect the electron beam horizontally.  (One of the Horizontal Plates
in Figure 3 is hidden by its mate.)
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig3.gif" height="367" width="720"/></p></center>

<p>The deflection of the beam in an electrostatically deflected CRT is
given (from Whitaker) by:
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">                
Vd * dl</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">              
2 * dp * Vb</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><blockquote>where     Vd = the voltage between the
deflection plates
</blockquote>
Since the construction of the plates (dl and dp) is determined by the CRT
manufacturer we will simplify things by letting   K1 = 
dl/(2*dp)   so that:
<p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    tan(da) = K1 * Vd / Vb</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>Therefore, the tangent of the deflection angle is proportional to the
voltage between the plates and inversely proportional to the beam voltage
(Anode voltage).
</p><p>From Figure 3:
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    tan(da) = db/L</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>L is another value determined by the CRT manufacturer, so that the deflection
of the beam is given by:
</p><p><tt><SPAN size="+1"><b>    db = K2 * Vd / Vb </b> </SPAN></tt>    
where K2 = L * dl/(2*dp)
</p><p>The good news is that the screen deflection of the beam is proportional
to the voltage between the plates.
</p><p>The bad news is that it is inversely proportional to the Anode voltage.
This means that if we double the Anode voltage we have to double the voltage
between the plates for the same beam deflection. If the voltage between
the deflection plates is already 200V, then we would need to increase it
to 400V for the same deflection. Although that would not be too much of
a problem with today&#39;s components, the deflection amplifiers would now
also require twice the slew rate if we are to move the beam at the same
speed.
</p><p>Why not just use a low Anode voltage?
</p><p>First, Anode voltages have to be high just to get acceptable screen
brightness.
</p><p>And second, the Anode voltage has an effect on the beam focusing. 
As the Anode voltage is increased, the electron beam can be focused to
a smaller spot size.
</p><p>For these reasons, electrostatic CRTs are used mostly in oscilloscopes
where speed is important and screens are small.
</p><hr/>
<center>
<p><b><u> Magnetic Deflection</u></b></p></center>

<p>   An electron beam is deflected when it moves through 
a magnetic field. In a CRT with magnetic deflection, instead of two pairs
of deflection plates inside the CRT, there are two pairs of deflection
coils mounted around the neck. The two pairs of coils are mounted- at right
angles to provide X and Y deflection. As a side note, an electron beam
is deflected at right angles to the applied magnetic field, so that the
coils that are mounted on either side of the neck (horizontally) deflect
the beam vertically; the coils that are mounted vertically deflect the
beam horizontally.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig4.gif" height="367" width="720"/></p></center>

<p>The deflection of the beam is given (from Whitaker) by the formula:
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    sin(da) = (2.97*10**5) * L *
Bm / (V**0.5)</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>Let&#39;s simplify it by letting K3 = (2.97*10**5) * L,  so that
</p><p><tt><SPAN size="+1">    <b>sin(da) = K3 * Bm / (V**0.5)</b></SPAN></tt>
</p><p>    where:
</p><p>Further, in a properly designed coil, the magnetic field (Bm) is proportional
to the electric current in the yoke coils so we can say:
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    sin(da) = K4 * I / (V**0.5)</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>Again, there is good news and bad news.
</p><p>The good news is that the deflection is proportional to the inverse
square root of the Anode voltage, as opposed to the straight inverse in
the electrostatic CRT. This means that if we double the Anode voltage we
only have to increase the yoke current by a factor of 1.414 . (The electron
optics relating Anode voltage to spot size are the same as for the electrostatic
CRT. A higher Anode voltage produces a smaller spot size.)
</p><p>The bad news is that the deflection on the screen (db) is going to be
the tangent of the arcsin of the yoke current. You can see this is Figure
4 where
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    tan(da) = db/L</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>so that
</p><p><tt><SPAN size="+1">   <b> db = L * tan(da)</b></SPAN></tt>
</p><p>For angles of less than 30 degrees, sin(angle) is approximately equal
to the angle in radians. This is shown in Figure 5.
</p><p>Likewise, for angles of less than 30 degrees, tan(angle) is approximately
equal to the angle in radians. This is shown in Figure 6.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig5.jpg" height="267" width="640"/></p></center>
If we keep our deflection angle less than 30 degrees we&#39;ll be ok. That
would mean using a 60 degree CRT (plus and minus 30 degrees).
<p>Unfortunately, that was not a standard type for the sizes we wanted
to use (13&#34;, 19&#34;, and later, 25&#34;). The way CRTs were made (and probably
still are) is that once a year Corning guessed how many CRTs the TV industry
would need for the next year. They would then build that many CRT envelopes
in a single run, and that would be it for the year. The CRT envelopes were
then sold to the CRT manufacturers. Corning must have been good at estimating
the need because I don&#39;t remember there ever being a CRT shortage.
</p><p>Standard CRTs come in 90 degree, 100 degree, and 110 degree deflection
angles. This is because the larger the deflection angle, the shorter the
CRT envelope. These deflection angles came about because people don&#39;t want
the backs of their TVs to stick out a lot.
</p><p>Therefore, for a 90 degree (or more) CRT we have to deal with the deflection
nonlinearity.
</p><p>The deflection nonlinearity is actually worse than you might think and
is entirely the fault of geometry. The reason is that there is only one
electron beam, and it can only be deflected at one angle at a time.
</p><p>Figure 7a represents the geometry of a beam aimed at the center of the
screen. The face of the screen is shown in Figure 7b.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig7.gif" height="333" width="697"/></p></center>

<p>If we deflect the beam along only the X axis (Figure 8a) the deflection
angle to produce a screen deflection of dx will be <b>atan(dx/L)</b>.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig8.gif" height="335" width="716"/></p></center>

<p>However, as shown in Figure 9, if we want to produce a deflection of
both X and Y axes (dx and dy respectively) , the deflection angle will
be <b>atan(dr/L)</b>. Since dr is larger than either dx or dy, the deflection
angle will also be larger.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig9.gif" height="335" width="716"/></p></center>

<p>This is a problem, especially at the corners of the screen where the
deflection angles are the largest. Remember Figure 6. The larger the deflection
angle, the farther we are operating in the nonlinear part of the tangent
function.
</p><p>You may have heard of pincushion distortion. Now you know what causes
it.
</p><p>Figure 10 shows the uncorrected distortion for a 60 degree CRT.
</p><p>Figure 11 shows how much worse it is for a 90 degree CRT.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig10.jpg" height="254" width="640"/></p></center>

<p>There is an additional factor that causes geometric distortion.
</p><p>So far, our analyses have assumed a perfectly flat screen. While CRTs
with perfectly flat screens are available today, they weren&#39;t available
in the 1980s. This was before even almost-flat screens. On this one we
will leave out the math and just show Figure 12.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig12.gif" height="308" width="467"/></p></center>

<p>The reason for the curved screen is that curved screens are better able
to withstand the large forces produced by the vacuum inside the envelope.
After all, this is a vacuum tube.
</p><p>Now that we have shown the causes of pincushion distortion, what are
we going to do about it?
</p><p>According to Grob (page 220):
</p><blockquote>&#34;For monochrome picture tubes, the pincushion distortion is
corrected by permanent magnets mounted on the housing of the deflection
yoke. These pincushion magnets cannot be used with color picture tubes,
however, because they would affect the three beams by different amounts,
resulting in more problems with color purity and convergence. Therefore,
dynamic pincushion correction is used with color picture tubes.&#34;</blockquote>
Indeed, the Electrohome GO5 Monochrome X-Y Monitor (&#34;Quadrascan&#34;) used
in Lunar Lander, BattleZone, and Red Baron used magnets on the yoke housing
to provide pincushion distortion.
<p>According to Whitaker (page 234):
</p><blockquote>&#34;Pincushion  correction is used in all wide-angle deflection
systems. This correction may be achieved by one of the following&#34;</blockquote>

<blockquote>A special yoke design that has controlled field distortion.
<p>Predistorting the deflection current and applying it to a separate pincushion
transformer that connects the correction current to the vertical yoke.&#34;</p></blockquote>
Whitaker&#39;s reference to a pincushion transformer shows an obvious bias
toward raster scan displays. An XY display would use a circuit to predistort
the deflection currents.
<p>Also bear in mind that the Grob reference is from 1975. Perhaps the
method of using special yoke design to produce a controlled distortion
to provide pincushion came later.
</p><p>Normally, pincushion correction is performed in the monitor. However,
Atari&#39;s first color XY games (Tempest, Space Duel, Gravitar, and Black
Widow) did pincushion correction on the game board.
</p><p>Here&#39;s how it was done.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig13.gif" height="474" width="503"/></p></center>

<p>Now you know what the MC1495 analog multipliers were for.
</p><p>The following is a more complete schematic of the circuit.
</p><p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Tmpst1.gif" height="440" width="656"/>
</p><p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Tmpst2.gif" height="439" width="655"/>
</p><p>In Atari&#39;s last color XY games (Star Wars and Major Havoc) pincushion
correction was done in the monitor using a specially designed yoke.

<p><b><u>XY Deflection Amplifiers</u></b></p></center>

<p>We have gotten to the point where the currents in the X and Y deflection
coils will move the electron beam around the screen in a linear fashion.
</p><p>Now we have to produce the current.
</p><p>Since the output of the Vector Generator will be a voltage the Deflection
Amplifier will convert a voltage to a current (which will be substantial). 
To do this will require a foray into Control Theory.
</p><p>A standard feedback control network has the following form:
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig14.gif" height="191" width="377"/></p></center>

<p>The Gyrator takes the difference between the positive and negative inputs
and produces output Y.
</p><p>The Gain Block amplifies its input Y by a factor of A to produce output
Vout.
</p><p>Output Vout is fed back to the negative input of the Gyrator using Transfer
Function H.
</p><p>Now some simple math.
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    Y = Vin - Vout * H</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    Vout = A * Y</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>Therefore:
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    Vout = A * Y</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    Vout + A*Vout*H = A*Vin</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    Vout *(1+A*H) = A*Vin</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">           
A*Vin</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">              
Vin</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>If A is sufficiently large,<b> 1/A = 0</b>, so that
</p><p><tt><SPAN size="+1"><b>    Vout = Vin/H                

</b><i>Equation 2</i></SPAN></tt>
</p><p>The next thing is to notice that the Gyrator and Gain Block in Figure
14 looks a lot like an Op-Amp. The  main difference is that Output
Y is not generally accessible. (That&#39;s ok, Output Y has served its purpose.)
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig15.gif" height="161" width="528"/></p></center>

<p>Let&#39;s try a Transfer Function H in the form of a simple resistor divider
where
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    H = R1/(R1+R2)</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig16.gif" height="272" width="642"/></p></center>

<p>From Equation 2:
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    Vout = Vin * 1/H</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">        
= Vin *    1</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">        
= Vin * (R1+R2)</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">        
= Vin * (1 +  R2/R1)</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>which turns out to be the gain for a op-amp non-inverting amplifier.
</p><p>The next thing to recognize is that the voltage across R1 is Vin.
</p><p>After all,  <b>Vout = Vin/H</b>  and <b>VR1 = Vout * H</b>,
so that <b>VR1 = Vin/H * H = Vin</b>  .
</p><p>Therefore, the current through R1 is just <b>Vin/R</b>  .
</p><p>Assuming that the input currents to the op-am are negligible (which
is usually a good bet) the current through R2 is the same as the current
through R1. There&#39;s no other place for it to go.
</p><p>This means we can use Vin to control the current through R2. Of course,
that assumes the op-amp can supply the necessary current and voltage.
</p><p>The deflection amplifiers used in the XY monitors used in Star Wars
supply about 2 Amps for full deflection. (The deflection amplifiers are
not TL082s.)
</p><p>What if R2 is not a resistor at all, but, for example, an inductor such
as shown in Figure 18?
</p><p>(The deflection windings have an internal resistance which is not shown.
The Vertical windings have an internal resistance of 1.1 Ohms while the
Horizontal windings have a resistance of 1.9 Ohms, which is probably because
the windings are concentric and the Horizontal windings are on the outside.
Both Horizontal and Vertical deflection windings have an inductance of
about 1 mH.)
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig18.gif" height="272" width="343"/></p></center>

<p>The current through L is still the same as the current through R1. The
only difference is that the current through L is frequency dependent. In
the time domain an inductance resists having its current changed. The op-amp
provides persuasion by giving it a good swift voltage kick.
</p><p>Figure 19 shows the voltage across the sense resistor (top trace) and
voltage to the deflection yoke coil (bottom trace). We are on the X axis
with a monitor test screen (not shown) that draws a box all the way around
the screen. (It&#39;s from the BIP test.)
</p><p>1. The vector starts out being drawn to the right. The op-amp kicks
it to get it going. Once it gets going it needs very little additional
voltage to develop the current ramp in the yoke.
</p><p>2. When the vector stays in one place (because the Y axis is being ramped)
the X axis op-amp requires much less voltage to maintain the yoke current.
</p><p>3. When the vector is being drawn to the left, the op-amp gives it a
negative kick to get it going. Once it starts going it needs very little
additional voltage to develop the current ramp in the yoke.

</p><p>Output of Deflection Amplifier
</p></center>

<p>And, finally, a word about the current sense resistor. It is important
that this resistor be non-inductive. Otherwise, the deflection sensitivity
will change with frequency. For a bunch of vectors of random length the
result will be unpredictable, although short vectors will probably be shorter
than they should be and long vectors will be too long.   This
kind of problem we don&#39;t need.
</p><p>Since the current sense resistor needs to dissipate more power than
a carbon resistor can handle we are left with a wirewound resistor. A standard
wirewound resistor is just an appropriate length of resistance wire wound
around a core. See Figure 20a. This fits the definition of an inductor.
</p><p>In a non-inductive wirewound resistor, there are two windings wound
on the core in opposite directions and connected in parallel. The magnetic
fields produced by the coils cancel and thus the inductances cancel. See
Figure 20b.  (Of course, even a straight wire has some inductance.) 
A non-inductive resistor has about 1% of the inductance of a standard wound
resistor of the same size.
</p><p>And, further, because the windings are connected in parallel, it&#39;s ok
for each segment to be connected in parallel so it is not necessary to
use insulated wire.
</p><center>
<p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Fig20.gif" height="149" width="596"/></p></center>

<p>The Amplifone Deflection Amplifiers also contain a circuit that looks
at activity on the X and Y inputs. If  it doesn&#39;t find what it feels
is an appropriate amount of activity it turns off the Beam to prevent it
from burning up the screen phosphor. This is the infamous Spot Killer.
</p><p>Even with the Spot Killer, screen phosphor burn was a common occurrence
during software development. One time I saw a runaway Vector Generator
burn off the phosphor in the middle of the screen, then burn completely
through the shadow mask, and start to burn through the glass.
</p><p><a href="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/monitor.pdf">Here are the full schematics for the Amplifone
XY Monitors, followed by the schematics for the Wells-Gardner XY Monitor</a>.

<p><b><u>High Voltage Power Supplies</u></b></p></center>

<p>By now everyone has heard the story of the Universally-Hated Atari Executive
who went down to Brownsville to visit Amplifone, ignored requests not to
smoke inside the building, and triggered the fire sprinklers, ruining every
Amplifone HV transformer ever made. While there was never any shortage
of Universally-Hated Atari Executives, and while an incident of this type
could have happened, I have my doubts about it. For one, I didn&#39;t hear
about it until I saw it on the Web about two years ago, long after I left
Atari Games.
</p><p>The story I heard, while I was still at Atari, was that the method used
to make the HV transformers turned out to be sensitive to humidity, and
the first HV transformers to burn up were the ones made during hurricane
season.
</p><p>Very likely, the real story is simply that the potting material used
in the transformers was not up to the task.
</p><p>Regardless of the cause, by the time the problem appeared the Operators
had already made a good return on their investment. That was good news
for the Operators but bad news for those of us trying to keep their 17
year-old Star Wars games alive.
</p><p>I&#39;ve had two Amplifone HV transformers burn up in my TomCat game. I
finally replaced the HV assembly with one from a Wells-Gardner monitor.
The only difference is that the Wells-Gardner supply does not provide 6.3VAC
for the CRT heater. (I put in a 6.3VAC filament transformer.)
</p><p>The HV supply in my Star Wars game still works fine, although the game
does not have all that much flight time logged.
</p><p>For the record, I was the Project Engineer on Star Wars, but I didn&#39;t
design the monitor. (I certainly didn&#39;t design the High Voltage Transformer.)
</p><p>Let&#39;s start at the beginning.
</p><p>When televisions were first made in the late 1940s the high voltage
power supplies used transformers that operated from the line at 60 Hz.
I know, because I had one. (My father knew the owner of the TV repair shop
in town and I would periodically get junk TVs to take apart. People left
them because they decided they weren&#39;t worth fixing/adjusting. Some were
left because they were just old.)
</p><p>Screens were small (a 10 inch screen was common) so the high voltage
was probably only 10 KV. The problem was that filtering the 60 Hz output
required a large high voltage (10 KV) capacitor. One of the reasons that
60Hz was chosen as the vertical sync rate was so that 60 Hz hum would not
be as noticeable. Eventually, someone got the idea to use the horizontal
frequency (15,750 Hz) to produce the high voltage using a flyback transformer.
Operating at the higher frequency meant you could use a lower value capacitor.
</p><p><img src="https://www.jmargolin.com/xy/Dcap.jpg" height="144" width="160"/></p>
The standard high voltage capacitor was 500 pF.  It was called a <i>doorknob
capacitor</i> because that&#39;s what it looks like. This is what a modern
doorknob capacitor looks like.    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<p>Connections are made with screw terminals on the top and bottom. The
old TV doorknob capacitors were usually beige/orange and had ridges around
the cylinder.
</p><p>Nowadays they coat both the inside and outside of the CRT envelope with
a conductive material, forming a capacitor. The inside coating connects
to the HV connector and the outside coating is grounded. The capacitance
ends up being about 2000 pF. (Don&#39;t &#34;clean&#34; it off.)
</p><p>The way a flyback transformer works is that you charge it with current
(relatively slowly) and then release it all at once. That&#39;s because, in
an inductor, the voltage developed across it is proportional to the rate
of change of the current:
</p><p><b><tt><SPAN size="+1">    V = L * di/dt</SPAN></tt></b>
</p><p>The flyback transformer is charged during the active horizontal time
(50 us) and discharged as a Big Zap during Horizontal Sync (about 8 us). 
(When you add front and back porch blanking you end up with 63.5 us, which
is the horizontal period.)
</p><p>A further feature is that the charging of the inductor also provides
the current ramp for the horizontal deflection coils.
</p><p>The voltage still needs to be stepped up, so there is a secondary winding.
The output of the secondary winding is then rectified by a diode that is
usually encapsulated inside the flyback transformer and filtered by the
capacitor that is built into the CRT.
</p><p>The Big Zap occurs during Horizontal Blanking. Any sagging of the HV
also occurs at the horizontal rate and is not as noticeable as if it occurred
randomly during active video.
</p><p>The problem with XY is that there is no Horizontal Sync, so the Big
Zap occurs randomly in the vectors. Actually, the Big Zap occurs at regular
intervals, it&#39;s from the vectors&#39; point of view that it occurs randomly.
</p><p>The conventional wisdom is that the HV Supply for an XY Monitor must
generate a sine wave to avoid this problem The manual for the Electrohome
B/W XY Monitor explicitly mentions that it uses a sine wave circuit.
</p><p>I heard of a Collector who tried a television HV Supply in his Star
Wars. According to someone who saw it, it exhibited noticeable (and ugly)
Vector Beating. It appeared that the only way to fix a burned-up Amplifone
HV transformer was to buy an expensive replacement from Wintron.
</p><p>Now I&#39;m not so sure.
</p><p>In the process of putting this article together I put an oscilloscope
on the Wells-Gardner HV Supply in my TomCat. Since I don&#39;t have a special
(and expensive) high voltage probe, I looked at the collector of Q906,
the transistor that drives the HV transformer. (The schematics for the
Wells-Gardner HV Supply are in the previous section.)
</p><p>What I got is shown in Figure 21. It doesn&#39;t look like a sine wave to
me.

<b><u>Figure 21</u></b> - Wells-Gardner Color XY High Voltage Supply Waveform
at Q906 Collector
<p>Voltage = -24VDC to +250VDC
</p><p>The fact that there is 250V anywhere on a primary winding in a circuit
powered by 48V (-24V and +24V) is a dead giveaway that it is operating
in flyback mode.
</p><p>Besides, even with a sine wave, when you rectify it and use a capacitive-input
filter, you get a Big Zap.
</p><p>I performed a further experiment using a Philips Mono VGA Monitor (model
7BM749CH01). This is a B/W monitor that combines the RGB signals and runs
at VGA Sync frequencies.
</p><p>I connected the HV output (probably 15 KV) to the anode of the CRT in
my TomCat. The monitor started life as a stock Amplifone monitor so the
CRT is probably a 19VJTP22.  I left everything else (Heater, G2, and
Focus) connected to the Well-Gardner supply.
</p><p>There was just enough range in the Focus control to adjust to the lower
anode voltage.
</p><p>Unfortunately, the results were not definitive.
</p><p>1. The screen was noticeably dimmer, as you would expect with a lower
anode voltage. (Increasing the G2 voltage made it impossible to focus the
beam.)
</p><p>2. There was some Vector Beating in the game, but if I hadn&#39;t been looking
for it, I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it (at least not right away). It didn&#39;t
interfere with the game.
</p><p>3. Vector Beating was more evident in the test patterns, especially
the Cross Hatch pattern. The Philips supply was operating at around 16
KHz. Increasing the frequency had some effect on the beat pattern, suggesting
there was an interaction between the HV from the Philips supply and the
G2 (and focus) from the Wells supply. I suspect that operating all the
CRT voltages from the same supply would reduce vector beating and that
operating at a higher frequency (like 32 KHz) would give better results.
(When I increased the frequency of the Philips supply the HV decreased,
making it impossible to focus the beam.)
</p><p>This suggests that the HV supply from an old computer color monitor
(with a schematic) might be used to power color XY monitors. The requirements
are:
</p><blockquote>1. Either the High Voltage supply must be isolated from the
power line or an isolation transformer must be used.
<p>2. Either the circuitry that shuts down the monitor in the absence of
sync must be disabled or a simple sync generator must be constructed (two
555s producing 32 KHz and 60Hz respectively).
</p><p>3. Any electrical pincushion correction must also be disabled. Since
the Horizontal Deflection coils are intimately involved in the high voltage
circuit, any modulation of the Horizontal coils will probably also modulate
the High Voltage.  <b>(I wonder if the problem when the Collector
used a television High Voltage supply in his Star Wars was due to the presence
of a pincushion correction circuit. Someone with a high voltage probe and
a spectrum analyzer is invited to investigate this aspect further.)</b></p></blockquote>
If necessary, the outputs (anode, focus, and G2) could be filtered by adding
capacitors or by changing to an inductive-input filter.  (The filtered
voltage would be less, but might be enough.)
