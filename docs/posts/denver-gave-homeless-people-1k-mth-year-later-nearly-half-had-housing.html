    <h1>Denver gave homeless people $1k/mth. Year later, nearly half had housing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jarun Laws lived in his car in a restaurant parking lot near downtown Denver. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-guaranteed-basic-income-gbi-ubi-housing-security-homeless-rent-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">He worked there as a cook</a><strong> </strong>until 2020, and had only $400 a month left after paying bills and child support. That was barely enough to cover his car payments and child support — and not even close to what he would need for rent.</p><p>The 51-year-old<strong> </strong>occasionally spent part of his paycheck on weekend stays at a cheap hotel, where he could spend time with his children. He struggled to afford food, clothes, and medicine — and he had been experiencing homelessness for nearly a decade.</p><div><p>That changed when Laws enrolled in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ubi-cash-payments-reduced-homelessness-increased-employment-denver-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">The Denver Basic Income Project</a>. The pilot program allowed Laws to secure a temporary apartment with furniture, spend more time with his children, and find a better-paying job.</p><p>&#34;I had questioned myself: if I was going to be a good father to my children because I was suffering,&#34; Laws previously told Business Insider. &#34;When I got accepted, it changed my life.&#34;</p><p>Denver&#39;s basic income pilot — which first started payments in fall 2022 — focused on over 800 Coloradans experiencing homelessness, including people living in cars, temporary shelters, the outdoors, or other non-fixed living situations. Participants like Laws were given direct cash payments, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/which-states-cities-have-guaranteed-basic-income-programs-low-income-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">no strings attached</a>, and could spend the money on whatever they needed.</p><p>Denver released the project&#39;s one-year report on<strong> </strong>June 18, showing that 45% of participants secured their own house or apartment after receiving basic income for 10 months. They also experienced fewer emergency room visits, nights spent in a hospital or a temporary shelter, and jail stays. The report estimates that this reduction in public service use saved the city $589,214.</p><p>Denver&#39;s program initially lasted one year and was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-basic-income-project-ubi-extended-homelessness-poverty-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">extended in January for another six months</a>. Participants were sorted into random groups: one received $1,000 a month for a year; another got $6,500 upfront, followed by $500 a month; and a third got $50 a month as a control group.</p><p>The city of Denver, the Colorado Trust, and an anonymous foundation funded the project and has already provided more than $9.4 million to participants.</p><p>Basic income programs like Denver&#39;s have become <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/basic-income-gbi-ubi-low-income-americans-afford-housing-food-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">a popular strategy to reduce poverty</a> in US cities. Compared to traditional social services like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buying-groceries-snap-food-stamps-cant-afford-essentials-credit-card-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">SNAP</a> or Medicaid, basic income allows participants to spend the money where they need it most.</p><p>&#34;What is fundamentally different about our approach is the way that we start from a place of trust,&#34; Mark Donovan, the project founder and executive director, said at a Tuesday press conference.</p><h2 id="1b74210a-b49a-428b-aa18-dbe9189f9abd" data-toc-id="1b74210a-b49a-428b-aa18-dbe9189f9abd"><strong>Denver&#39;s basic income project helped participants secure housing and jobs</strong></h2><p>Denver&#39;s report found that basic income primarily helped participants pay for immediate expenses — like transportation, hygiene, clothes, and groceries. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chicago-basic-income-helped-mother-rent-an-apartment-ubi-gbi2024-5?mrfhud=true" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Affording recurring bills like rent</a>, healthcare, or debt payments was also a top priority for most families. Participants in each payment group reported increased financial stability and reduced reliance on emergency financial assistance programs.</p><p>Basic income puts low-income families on &#34;an equal playing field,&#34; Nick Pacheco, participant engagement coordinator, said at a press conference. He said the cash payments also help participants get the training and resources they need to establish careers.</p><p>Individuals who received the lump sum or $1,000 a month payments were more likely to find a stable, full-time job than before they received basic income.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s freedom,&#34; Pacheco said. &#34;It&#39;s freedom from poverty and not being able to reach your goals.&#34;</p><p>Participating households also experienced improved mental health and could spend more time with family and friends. Parents were able to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/san-antonio-ubi-guaranteed-basic-income-housing-finances-austin-rent-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">better support their children and grandchildren</a>.</p><p>These results echo those from the six-month report, which found fewer participants were sleeping on the street, experiencing food insecurity, and feeling unsafe.</p><p>Still, participants&#39; financial outcomes varied based on their payment group. Participants who received the lump sum $6,500 payment in addition to $500 a month could better build savings and make major life changes like signing a new lease or buying a car.</p><p>Many families told researchers that they&#39;re <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-emergency-cash-rent-homes-government-housing-aid-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">anxious about paying bills</a> after the basic income payments end. Some worry they could lose their housing again.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-guaranteed-basic-income-gbi-ubi-housing-security-homeless-rent-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Laws</a>, for example, had to go back to living in his car after his payments stopped.</p><h2 id="7877e820-05ba-4c6f-8ba2-27c9786dd3e7" data-toc-id="7877e820-05ba-4c6f-8ba2-27c9786dd3e7"><strong>Being able to pay bills alleviated participants&#39; financial stress</strong></h2><p>Denver participants have told BI that basic income was the financial safety net they needed.</p><p>Moriah Rodriguez, 38, was working as a youth developer for Denver Public Schools when she got hit by a car and suffered a traumatic brain injury. She lived in public housing with her kids, all of whom have intellectual disabilities, though they were displaced shortly after.</p><p>She received monthly Social Security payments, just enough to care for her kids. While staying with a friend, she learned about the pilot program.</p><p>Rodriguez used the payments to fix her truck, transport her kids to school and work, buy new clothing, and secure a lifelong public housing voucher. She also used some of the money to pay $400 for rent, $500 on gas, $100 on hygiene, and $100 on her credit card bill. In addition to returning to school to get her GED, she brought her credit score into the 700s.</p><p>&#34;The program gave me more time to focus on their education and their mental health,&#34; Rodriguez said, referring to her children, and added that the program&#39;s extension was another lifeline. &#34;I had the space to get them tested and get them diagnosed and connected with the support they need.&#34;</p><p>Similarly, Dia Broncucia, 53, and Justin Searls, 45, could also afford essentials like an apartment, a new car, and mental health resources through basic income. They had previously lived in a temporary shelter but could secure a studio apartment for $1,300 a month, along with clothing, hygiene products, and furniture.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-ubi-denver-participants-turn-their-lives-around-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Broncucia and Searls said last October</a> that though they had some uncertainties about their future, they felt much stronger and less stressed because of basic income.</p><p>&#34;Starting with nothing and then being able to receive a lump sum of money and then get our payments once a month is why we were able to get on track and stay on track,&#34; Broncucia previously told BI.</p><h2 id="fcf290b8-de5d-44fd-9e88-4430ad78df2a" data-toc-id="fcf290b8-de5d-44fd-9e88-4430ad78df2a">Basic income pilots can provide poverty solutions</h2><p>As the basic income pilot<strong> </strong>continues to be successful in cities like Denver, local leaders and economic security experts are looking to translate pilots into policy. States like California and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/immigrants-new-mexico-basic-income-for-housing-healthcare-ubi-gbi2024-5#:~:text=New%20Mexico&#39;s%20basic%20income%20pilot,and%20education%20outcomes%20for%20participants." data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">New Mexico </a>are already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/basic-income-gbi-ubi-low-income-americans-afford-housing-food-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">proposing basic income programs</a> in the state legislature.</p><p>&#34;The lessons from those pilots are infusing the whole ecosystem of support,&#34; Teri Olle, director for Economic Security California, a branch of the nonprofit Economic Security Project, previously told BI. &#34;People are really seeing the power of those pilots, and the power of giving people money and trusting them.&#34;</p><p>Denver leaders also hope to extend the city&#39;s basic income for a third year. The project is currently raising the millions of dollars necessary to continue efforts in Colorado.</p><p>Donovan said he&#39;s paying close attention to results from basic income programs across the country. It&#39;s a &#34;really exciting time in the movement,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;If we&#39;re able to move people into housing and out of homelessness at a lower cost and generate better long-term outcomes, why wouldn&#39;t we try to expand and build upon that?&#34; Donovan said.</p><p><em>Have you benefited from a guaranteed basic income program?
