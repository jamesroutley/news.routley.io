    <h1>Terrible things I&#39;d do with your money</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In some of Daniel Kahnemann&#39;s books and any other business
advice-type articles, you always seem to read the same argument: The
thing important people all over the world would like to see is increased
risk-taking in the workplace.</p>
<p>And having spent roughly seven years in the startup space, I&#39;m
starting to agree immensely with this sentiment. It&#39;s the unique Gen
Z-er feeling of boredom, flicking through startup ideas like your Tiktok
feed only to realize that 99% of it - you&#39;ve already seen it and that
you&#39;re exhausted.</p>
<p>The craving for <em>true</em> originality, just a little hit of
dopamine for experiencing <em>the new</em>, it has become scarily real
for me not only on social media but also in the startup space.</p>
<p>So let me tell you in my real voice right now, &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=citation&amp;book=Acts&amp;chapno=9&amp;startverse=18&amp;endverse=20">It
fell like scales from my eyes</a>&#34; when I read Nick Tredennick&#39;s &#34;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amp/an-engineers-view-of-venture-capitalists-2650252508">Engineer&#39;s
View of Venture Capitalists</a>&#34; article; from 2001 and saw him claim
that &#34;VCs are sheep. They don&#39;t take risks.&#34;</p>
<p>Outrageous! The audacity he has to make such claims! After all, in
terms of the type of investments, aren&#39;t VCs quasi <em>the</em>
risk-takers that keep our economy going?</p>
<h2 id="vcs-are-sheep.">&#34;VCs are sheep.&#34;</h2>
<p>But Nick&#39;s right. Particularly when focusing our attention on what
really gets funded and who are the new hot companies. Already the
mainstream terminology makes me wanna throw up: &#34;Unicorn!&#34; ðŸ¤®</p>
<p>Because, yes, after having hot meals delivered to your house and that
absolutely <em>not</em> going great for years: Why not try now also to
deliver cold food (aka. groceries) too but under a different brand name
and a slightly adjusted business process.</p>
<p>And since this article is about keeping you engaged through
quantitative originality, just tangentially, maybe conspiracies are
popular these days because they&#39;re less boring than reality!</p>
<p>But yes, this is what it has come to: In Europe, the hot &#34;tech&#34;
Unicorns are: &#34;Gorillaz,&#34; &#34;Flink,&#34; and &#34;Getir&#34; - all grocery delivery
startups with exactly the same market positioning and value proposition.
They deliver food on bikes.</p>
<p>But not only does this situation confirm that VCs are indeed sheep,
that they all <em>baa</em> the minute one <em>baas</em> - it also shows
the level of risk aversion they exhibit.</p>
<p>Sure, here and there may be investors that fund radically new ideas,
but isn&#39;t it interesting that the evolutionary output VCs are curating
usually just bubbles up boring stuff?</p>
<h2 id="vcs-dont-take-enough-risks.-and-neither-do-startup-founders.">VCs
don&#39;t take (enough) risks. And neither do startup founders.</h2>
<p>It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true. In a way, the annoying South African
dude on Twitter and the notorious lying woman posing as female Steve
Jobs did/do one thing well: They&#39;ve both gone all-in; mega bold and
despite the odds stacked against them.</p>
<p>As an engineer that has been <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">kept in check
by founders and managers</a> for years - since they always want you to
factor in the business side while developing tech, I admire the boldness
of <em>true</em> risk-takers â€” the insanity of wanting to settle on Mars
or to blood-test everyone with a tiny pinch.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I get told by my collaborators to deleverage risk;
when they want me to ship something visible instead of going for my
wildest technical dreams - when I want to <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/06/18/when-scope-blows-up/">blow up the scope</a>, but they
won&#39;t allow me, <em>I dream of the terrible things I&#39;d do with their
money</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-utopia-of-creative-freedom">The Utopia of Creative
Freedom</h2>
<p>I dream of the freedom to work on what I think is right - for how
long I think is good.</p>
<p>I dream of not owing responsibility to my employers or financiers.
The utopia of creative freedom, where no budget limitations, no sense of
scarcity, or fear of failure exists.</p>
<p>I dream of a place where financiers understand my desire to take
risks, a place where not only engineers have empathy towards the
business but vice versa.</p>
<p>It&#39;s there where I&#39;d waste <em>your</em> hard-earned dollars on days
of &#34;unnecessary&#34; and tangential work.</p>
<p>It&#39;s where I&#39;d rent servers to compute seemingly useless shit - where
I&#39;d blow tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just to gather more,
to you, <em>irrelevant information</em>.</p>
<p>If I had all the creative freedom in the world, I&#39;d do &#34;terrible&#34;
things with the money you invested.</p>
