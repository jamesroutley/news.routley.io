    <h1>Why &#34;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&#34; matters (2011)</h1>

<cite>Brian Harvey</cite>

<p>In 2011, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of MIT, the <i>Boston Globe</i>
made a list of the most important innovations developed there.  They asked me
to explain the importance of <i>SICP,</i> and this is what I sent them:

</p><p>SICP was revolutionary in many different ways.  Most importantly, it
dramatically raised the bar for the intellectual content of introductory
computer science.  Before SICP, the first CS course was almost always
entirely filled with learning the details of some programming language.
SICP is about standing back from the details to learn big-picture ways
to think about the programming process.  It focused attention on the
central idea of <i>abstraction</i> -- finding general patterns from specific
problems and building software tools that embody each pattern.  It made
heavy use of the idea of <i>functions as data</i>, an idea that&#39;s hard to learn
initially, but immensely powerful once learned.  (This is the same idea,
in a different form, that makes freshman calculus so notoriously hard even
for students who&#39;ve done well in earlier math classes.)  It fit into the
first CS course three different <i>programming paradigms</i> (functional,
object oriented, and declarative), when most other courses didn&#39;t even
really discuss even one paradigm.

</p><p>Another revolution was the choice of Scheme as the programming language.
To this day, most introductions to computer science use whatever is the
&#34;hot&#34; language of the moment: from Pascal to C to C++ to Java to Python.
Scheme has never been widely used in industry, but it&#39;s the perfect
language for an introduction to CS.  For one thing, it has a very simple,
uniform notation for everything.  Other languages have one notation for
variable assignment, another notation for conditional execution, two or
three more for looping, and yet another for function calls.  Courses that
teach those languages spend at least half their time just on learning the
notation.  In my SICP-based course at Berkeley, we spend the first hour
on notation and that&#39;s all we need; for the rest of the semester we&#39;re
learning ideas, not syntax.  Also, despite (or because of) its simplicity,
Scheme is a very versatile language, making it possible for us to examine
those three programming paradigms and, in particular, letting us see how
object oriented programming is implemented, so OOP languages don&#39;t seem
like magic to our students.  Scheme is a dialect of Lisp, so it&#39;s great
at handling functions as data, but it&#39;s a stripped-down version compared
to the ones more commonly used for professional programming, with a
minimum of bells and whistles.  It was very brave of Abelson and Sussman
to teach their introductory course in the best possible language <i>for
teaching</i>, paying no attention to complaints that all the jobs were in
some other language.  Once you learned the big ideas, they thought, and
this is my experience also, learning another programming language isn&#39;t
a big deal; it&#39;s a chore for a weekend.  I tell my students, &#34;the language
in which you&#39;ll spend most of your working life hasn&#39;t been invented yet,
so we can&#39;t teach it to you.  Instead we have to give you the skills you
need to learn new languages as they appear.&#34;

</p><p>Finally, SICP was firmly optimistic about what a college freshman can be
expected to accomplish.  SICP students write interpreters for programming
languages, ordinarily considered more appropriate for juniors or seniors.
The text itself isn&#39;t easy reading; it has none of the sidebars and colored
boxes and interesting pictures that typify the modern textbook aimed at
students with low attention spans.  There are no redundant exercises; each
exercise teaches an important new idea.  It uses big words.  But it repays a
close reading; every sentence matters.

</p><p>Statistically, SICP-based courses have been a small minority.  But the book
has had an influence beyond that minority.  It inspired a number of later
textbooks whose authors consciously tried to live up to SICP&#39;s standard.  The
use of Scheme as a language for learners has been extended by others over a
range from middle school to graduate school.  Even the more mainstream courses
have become sensitive to the idea of programming paradigms, although most of
them concentrate on object oriented programming.  The idea that computer
science should be about ideas, not entirely about programming practice, has
since widened to include non-technical ideas about the context and social
implications of computing.

</p><p>SICP itself has had a longevity that&#39;s very unusual for introductory CS
textbooks.  Usually, a book lasts only as long as the language fad to which it
is attached.  SICP has been going strong for over 25 years and shows no sign
of going out of print.  Computing has changed enormously over that time, from
giant mainframe computers to personal computers to the Internet on cell
phones.  And yet the big ideas behind these changes remain the same, and they
are well captured by SICP.

</p><p>I&#39;ve been teaching a SICP-based course since 1987.  The course has changed
incrementally over that time; we&#39;ve added sections on parallelism, concurrency
control, user interface design, and the client/server paradigm.  But it&#39;s
still essentially the same course.  Every five years or so, someone on the
faculty suggests that our first course should use language X instead; each
time, I say &#34;when someone writes the best computer science book in the world
using language X, that&#39;ll be fine&#34; and so far the faculty have always voted to
stay with the SICP course.  We&#39;ll find out pretty soon whether the course can
survive my own retirement.

</p><ul><li>(Footnote: Nope.  Berkeley&#39;s new first course for majors uses Python,
with lecture notes that try to keep the ideas (and some of the text) of SICP.)
</li></ul>

<p>The discussion has been sharper recently because MIT underwent a major
redesign of their lower division EECS curriculum.  People outside MIT tend to
summarize that redesign as &#34;MIT decided to switch to Python,&#34; but that&#39;s not a
perceptive description.  What MIT decided was to move from a curriculum
organized around topics (programming paradigms, then circuits, then signal
processing, then architecture) to a curriculum organized around applications
(let&#39;s build and program a robot; let&#39;s build and program a cell phone).
<i>Everything</i> about their courses had to be reorganized; the choice of
programming language was the least of those decisions.  Their new approach is
harder to teach; for one thing, each course requires a partnership of
Electrical Engineering faculty and Computer Science faculty.  Perhaps in time
the applications-first approach will spark a revolution as profound as the one
that followed SICP, but it hasn&#39;t happened yet.

</p><p>In my experience, relatively few students appreciate how much they&#39;re
learning in my course while they&#39;re in it.  But in surveys of all our
CS students, it turns out to be among the most popular courses in
retrospect, and I regularly get visits and emails from long-gone students
to tell me about how they&#39;re using in their work ideas that they thought
were impractical ivory-tower notions as students.  The invention of the
MapReduce software for data parallelism at Google, based on functional
programming ideas, has helped eliminate that ivory-tower reputation.
