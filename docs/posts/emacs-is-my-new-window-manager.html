Most companies that employ me, hand me a “work laptop” as I enter the
building. Of course, I do not install personal software and keep a
clear division between my “work like” and my “real life.”
</p>

<p>
However, I also don’t like to carry two computers just to jot down
personal notes. My remedy is to install a virtualization system and
create a “personal” virtual machine. (Building cloud software as my
day job means I usually have a few VMs running all the time.)
</p>

<p>
Since I want this VM to have minimal impact on my work, I base it on a
“Server” version of Ubuntu. however, I like some graphical features,
so my most minimal <i>after market</i> installation approach is:<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<div>
<pre>sudo apt-get install -y xinit
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since most of what I do is <code>org-mode</code> work, the next step is:
</p>

<div>
<pre>sudo apt-get install -y emacs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I have played with a lot of window managers, and while some claim to
be unobtrusive and minimal<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>, I really just want Emacs in full-screen
mode (utilizing all screen estate possible).<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, I create an <code>.xinitrc</code> file that contains only:
</p>

<pre id="org338a66d">exec emacs
</pre>

<p>
That’s right, folks, <b>Emacs is my window manager</b>. I add the
following to my Emacs <code>init.el</code> script:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>set-frame-parameter nil &#39;fullscreen &#39;fullboth<span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And now I can split the screen into windows, launch programs– even
edit files– all without fondling the mouse, and since Emacs is in its
graphical mode, I can use my favorite fonts, decorate the fringe, etc.
</p>

<p>
If I need a program that doesn’t run well <i>within</i> Emacs, I can
call <code>xterm</code> (or any other application) with <code>M-! xterm</code>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf5a58ba">
<h2 id="orgf5a58ba">Web Browsing</h2>
<div id="text-orgf5a58ba">
<p>
Unlike the previous century, this century has been defined by web
applications. Most of my web efforts are looking up code
documentation and other technical resources, and this is good using
a text-oriented browser like <a href="http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/">w3m</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eww/index.html#Top">eww</a> embedded within Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Whenever a page doesn’t render well (can you say JavaScript), I can
hit the <code>&amp;</code> key to bring up a web browser.<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>. You can kick off a
graphical browser to a specific URL by binding a function that calls
this:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>start-process <span>&#34;&#34;</span> nil <span>&#34;xdg-open&#34;</span> <span>&#34;http://mail.google.com&#34;</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Keep in mind, running X window applications without a <i>real</i> window
manager will overlay Emacs, which is only an option if the
window is temporary.  When closed, you are back to Emacs:

<p>
<b>Update:</b> Since I wrote this section, a number of people have
mentioned some light-weight window managers. If you need to use a
browser, but still want Emacs to utilize every possible pixel,
the best seems to be Ratpoison<sup><a id="fnr.5" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> (with DWM a close second).

I realize that <a href="https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/eshell-fun.html">running shells inside Emacs</a> isn’t for everyone, but
currently using Emacs as my entire Linux desktop works pretty well.
Especially since I can split the frame into a series of windows
running:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InternetRelayChat">IRC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TwitteringMode">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/04/">RSS Feed Reader</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vermiculus/sx.el/">Stack Exchange</a></li>
<li><a href="http://emacs-jabber.sourceforge.net/">Google Talk/Jabber</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I use a function to start my favorite time-sinks…er,
applications, at one time:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>setup-windows</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>&#34;Organize a series of windows for ultimate distraction.&#34;</span>
  <span>(</span><span>interactive</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>delete-other-windows<span>)</span>

  <span>;; </span><span>Start with the Stack Overflow interface</span>
  <span>(</span>sx-tab-frontpage t nil<span>)</span>

  <span>;; </span><span>Put IRC on the other side</span>
  <span>(</span>split-window-horizontally<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>other-window 1<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>circe-connect-all<span>)</span>

  <span>;; </span><span>My RSS Feed goes on top:</span>
  <span>(</span>split-window-vertically<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>elfeed<span>)</span>

  <span>;; </span><span>And start up the Twitter interface above that:</span>
  <span>(</span>other-window 2<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>split-window-vertically<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>twit<span>)</span>

  <span>(</span>window-configuration-to-register ?w<span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The last line insert this “current” configuration in a register, so
after stomping and stirring my windows, I return to this
organization with <code>C-x r j w</code>.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps another screenshot of these results are in order:
