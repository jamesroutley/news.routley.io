<p>I listened to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U18MJLVrxUU" target="_blank">John Giorno</a> last night reading “thanx for nothing.” I also watched <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tO_r7U_MLo" target="_blank">this recording of thanx for nothing</a>. As I write this maybe I should have written a prompt that looked at both these poems or inspiration but I did not. What this did do was inspire me to output a spoken word piece – which is text to speech and sounds like crap – but hey LLMS did it.</p>



<h2 id="h-here-is-the-process">here is the process</h2>



<h3 id="h-prompt">prompt</h3>



<blockquote>
<p>write a text to speech poem in python based on nlk concordances as the prompts written today</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I wrote a bunch of prompts about music to end violence.</p>



<h3 id="h-llm">LLM</h3>



<p>Creating a text-to-speech poem in Python based on NLTK concordances can be an interesting creative exercise. Below is an example of a Python code that generates a poem using NLTK concordance lines and then converts it to speech using the <code>gTTS</code> (Google Text-to-Speech) library. To run this code, you’ll need to install NLTK and gTTS if you haven’t already:</p>



<pre><code>pip install nltk
pip install gTTS
</code></pre>



<p>Now, you can create a Python script (e.g., <code>poem_generator.py</code>) with the following code:</p>



<pre><code>import nltk
from nltk.corpus import reuters
from nltk.text import Text
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from gtts import gTTS
import os

# Download the Reuters corpus if not already downloaded
nltk.download(&#34;reuters&#34;)

# Load the Reuters corpus
reuters_corpus = Text(reuters.words())

# Define a target word for concordances
target_word = &#34;freedom&#34;

# Generate concordances for the target word
concordances = reuters_corpus.concordance_list(target_word, width=100, lines=10)

# Extract sentences containing the target word
sentences = set()
for conc in concordances:
    sentences.update(sent_tokenize(conc.line))

# Create a poem from the extracted sentences
poem = &#34;\n&#34;.join(sentences)

# Save the poem to a text file
with open(&#34;poem.txt&#34;, &#34;w&#34;) as poem_file:
    poem_file.write(poem)

# Convert the poem to speech
poem_text = &#34;&#34;
with open(&#34;poem.txt&#34;, &#34;r&#34;) as poem_file:
    poem_text = poem_file.read()

tts = gTTS(poem_text, lang=&#34;en&#34;)
tts.save(&#34;poem.mp3&#34;)

# Play the generated poem
os.system(&#34;mpg123 poem.mp3&#34;)
</code></pre>



<p>In this code:</p>



<ul>
<li>We use NLTK to load the Reuters corpus and generate concordances for a target word, which is set to “freedom” in this example.</li>



<li>We extract sentences containing the target word and create a poem from these sentences.</li>



<li>The poem is saved to a text file and then converted to speech using the <code>gTTS</code> library.</li>



<li>Finally, the generated poem is played as an MP3 audio file.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can replace the target word and adapt the code to generate poems based on different prompts or words of your choice.</p>



<p>Then I thought oh I am going to ask the llm to convert the text to speech (not so great) – there is an opportunity for improvement he</p>



<h2 id="h-reflections">Reflections</h2>



<p>This did not work out of the box – because the reuters feed is no longer available. When I told the LLM this, it was replaced with shakespeare’s hamlet, and the target word was replaced with to.</p>



<p>I included this output as poem.py, poem.txt, and poem.mp3.</p>



<p>All the generated art so for feels really random, and in the animation the random library is used, rather that something that will generate a pattern like sine, or cosine. I would like to explore this in the future. But when I heard this output at first, I was not sure whether or not this was actually different from the actual Shakespeare text. This is a fail. so I figured lets give it some poetic structure – a villanelle.</p>



<h2 id="h-prompt-2">prompt 2</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>make the poem a villanelle</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The output to this was to autogenerate words and turn it into a villanelle. It had nothing to do with the previous output. I gave it a thumbs down and was offered a solution that took the previous solution with hamlet and put it into vilanelle form.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-output">the output</h3>



<p>A villanelle is a 19-line poem with a specific structure and rhyme scheme (AABAABAA, AABAABAA, AABAA), and it often explores a theme or repeats a refrain throughout the poem. Here’s a Python script that generates a villanelle-style poem based on NLTK concordances from a chosen text source:</p>



<pre><code>import nltk
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
from nltk.text import Text
from gtts import gTTS
import os

# Download the Gutenberg corpus if not already downloaded
nltk.download(&#34;gutenberg&#34;)

# Load the Gutenberg corpus (in this case, we&#39;re using &#34;Hamlet&#34; by William Shakespeare)
hamlet_corpus = Text(gutenberg.words(&#34;shakespeare-hamlet.txt&#34;))

# Define a target word for concordances
target_word = &#34;to&#34;

# Generate concordances for the target word
concordances = hamlet_corpus.concordance_list(target_word, width=100, lines=10)

# Extract sentences containing the target word
sentences = set()
for conc in concordances:
    sentences.add(conc.line)

# Create a villanelle-style poem
poem_lines = list(sentences)
villanelle_poem = []

# Reorder the poem lines to match the villanelle structure (AABAABAA, AABAABAA, AABAA)
for i in range(7):
    villanelle_poem.append(poem_lines[i % 2])

villanelle_poem.append(poem_lines[6])  # The final AABAA stanza

# Save the poem to a text file
with open(&#34;villanelle_poem.txt&#34;, &#34;w&#34;) as poem_file:
    poem_file.write(&#34;\n&#34;.join(villanelle_poem))

# Convert the poem to speech
poem_text = &#34;&#34;
with open(&#34;villanelle_poem.txt&#34;, &#34;r&#34;) as poem_file:
    poem_text = poem_file.read()

tts = gTTS(poem_text, lang=&#34;en&#34;)
tts.save(&#34;villanelle_poem.mp3&#34;)

# Play the generated villanelle-style poem
os.system(&#34;mpg123 villanelle_poem.mp3&#34;)
</code></pre>



<p>In this code:</p>



<ul>
<li>We’ve adapted the generated sentences to follow a villanelle-style structure (AABAABAA, AABAABAA, AABAA).</li>



<li>The reordered lines are saved to a text file, and the poem is then converted to speech.</li>
</ul>



<p>This code will generate a villanelle-style poem using sentences from “Hamlet” that contain the target word “to.” You can adjust the target word or the text source to create different villanelles based on your preferences.</p>



<p>This was a bit better:</p>



<p>But the audio and the poem and code is available under villanelle_poem.txt.mp3 villanelle_poem.txt villanelle_poem.py</p>



<blockquote>
<p>tion come , He may approue our eyes , and speake to it Hor . Tush , tush , ‘ twill not appeare Bar .</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It also really makes no sense, not sure if it even makes audio sense also I thought villanelles ended with couplets.</p>
