  <p>July 20, 2024</p>
  <p>I&#39;ve run the full matrix of combinations of linux and macos between my work and personal setups. At this point I&#39;m pretty comfortable switching. Linux will always have my heart but periodically I get fed up and just want a laptop that goes to sleep when you close the lid. I&#39;ve recently seen some posts and since I did my most recent round of switching from an all-linux setup to linux-at-home + mac-at-work, I wanted to share a short list of key apps. These are mostly from my personal toolbelt with a few picked from some online discussions I saw recently.</p>
<ul>
<li>terminal
<ul>
<li>I run <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a> and really enjoy having the exact same terminal across OSes</li>
<li>The Terminal.app that ships with macos is also a fine choice.</li>
<li>Things are in very good state at the moment with numerous high-quality choices avalible including alacritty, wezterm, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zsh
<ul>
<li>Just note that for license reasons the default shell on macos is zsh, which is good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://brew.sh">homebrew</a> is the most common package manager, although I think there are alternatives for the brave
<ul>
<li>Also <a href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas">mas</a> is a CLI to help with the Mac App Store</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>clipboard manager
<ul>
<li>I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12">flycut</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>keyboard remapping
<ul>
<li>macos built-in keyboard settings can handle basic layout swapping as well as the common key remaps like caps lock is control</li>
<li>for advanced tricks, <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner Elements</a> is great</li>
<li><a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cliclick#default">cliclick</a> is a handy tool for scripting simulated keyboard events (similar to xdotool for linux)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mouse and touchpad tricks
<ul>
<li>I use <a href="https://folivora.ai/">BetterTouchTool</a> mostly to get &#34;natural scrolling&#34; on the touchpad while keeping a physical mouse wheel working correctly. It has some other good knobs and dials too, and I think even a clipboard manager, but I don&#39;t use most of its features anymore.</li>
<li><a href="https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/">Scroll Reverser</a> can fix this too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>screenshots
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flameshot.org/">flameshot</a> works on macos and linux and is great</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you use dmenu or rofi on linux, you might want <a href="https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/choose">choose</a> (&#34;choose-gui&#34; is the homebrew package name)</li>
<li>Many command line and terminal tools you may use on linux are cross-platform and available on macos as well
<ul>
<li>bat</li>
<li>direnv</li>
<li>eza</li>
<li>fd</li>
<li>fzf</li>
<li>gitui</li>
<li>htop</li>
<li>jless</li>
<li>jq</li>
<li>lazygit</li>
<li>lf</li>
<li>neovim</li>
<li>pandoc</li>
<li>prettier</li>
<li>ripgrep</li>
<li>sd</li>
<li>shellcheck</li>
<li>shfmt</li>
<li>starship</li>
<li>tokei</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I run <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">awesomewm</a> on linux, which is configured with lua code, I run <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a> on mac. It&#39;s the same philosophy and approach - use real code to get highly precise customization. The hammerspoon API is way way nicer than awesomewm though. When I joined Mailchimp in 2020 and had to use mac for work, I ended up doing a nearly feature-for-feature port of my awesomewm config to Hammerspoon and surprisingly my basic approach has been so stable that I have been maintaining both of them in parallel for about 4 years now. I know how I want my desktop environment to work and they both can acheive it.</p>
<p>If you just want basic window arrangements there are many good tools available including the ones below. I don&#39;t personally use these since Hammerspoon handles window management for me, but I know many folks like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rectangleapp.com/">rectangle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/">Alt-Tab</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">yabai</a> if you prefer tiling window managers a la i3
<ul>
<li>pairs well with <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">skhd</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> and <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> are popular. I have a home-grown thing based on scripts and choose-gui which works identically for me on linux and mac so I haven&#39;t looked at this category much.</p>

<p>Get <a href="https://meetingbar.app/">MeetingBar</a>. It&#39;s amazing. Perfect in every way and solves a longstanding problem for me. I barely need to look at my calendar anymore.</p>

<p>The differences between linux and mac for developers are as minimal now as they have ever been. We spend so much time in browsers and other cross-platform developer tools that it&#39;s pretty straightforward to have high similarity. It may take a fair amount of tweaking and futzing, but you should be able to get something that feels comfortable.</p>
