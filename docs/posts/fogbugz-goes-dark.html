<p>Today I got an email titled ‘Your Manuscript Account Balance’ which said:</p>



<pre>Your Manuscript account is now in arrears in the amount of $31.25.

Use this link to specify a credit card for your account and we will use it to settle your balance:

You can prepay for a year in advance using a check, corporate purchase order, or credit card:

Thank you,

<p>Fogbugz was an online bugtracker developed by the much respected Fog Creek Software. They sold it some years ago when their company headed off into the stratosphere (Stackoverflow, Trello etc). I think I might have had a <strong>free</strong> Fogbugz account 10+ years ago. I asked around on Twitter and quite a few people seem to have got the exact same email. It appears that:</p>



<ul>
<li>The venerable FogBugz application was recently sold on to <a href="https://ignitetech.com">https://ignitetech.com</a> and they appear to be trying to demand money from anyone who ever used FogBugz. Which is likely to be thousands of people.</li>



<li>IgniteTech describe themselves as “Where software goes to live”, but “Where software goes to die” might be a better description.</li>



<li>FogBugz was renamed to ‘Manuscript’ at some point.</li>
</ul>



<p>I tried replying to the email, telling them in no uncertain terms that they weren’t going to get a penny from me. This is the reply I got:</p>

<p>It is sad to see someone using dark business practices to try to wring a few pennies from the corpse of a once much-respected product. Does Joel Spolsky know? I don’t think he’d be impressed.</p>
