You see it on the web, in social networks, airline routes, power grids, trains, banks, Bitcoin mining, protein interactions, ecological food webs, neural networks, and oligarchies. Network theory tells us why:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Preferential attachment</strong><span>: more connections means more network effect means more connections, leading to the emergence of densely-connected hub nodes.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>N^2 scaling</strong><span>: if every fed has to talk to every other fed to exchange messages, the number of connections will scale exponentially with each additional node </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_graph" rel="">(n * (n -1))</a></em><span>. This leads to the emergence of large hubs that aggregate and relay world state.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness pressure</strong><span>: Small nodes get taken down by large spikes in traffic, while large nodes stick around. Small nodes have fewer resources, large nodes have lots. Unreliable nodes attract fewer connections, while reliable nodes attract connections just by virtue of staying alive.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong><span>: exponentially-distributed networks are ultra-small worlds. You can get from anywhere to anywhere in just a few hops through hubs.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Resilience</strong><span>: exponential networks survive random failures, because the chances are exponential that the node that fails will be from the long tail.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This is called </span><a href="https://networksciencebook.com/chapter/4#introduction4" rel="">the scale-free property</a><span>, and it </span><a href="https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/centralization-is-inevitable" rel="">emerges in all evolving networks</a><span>. Federated networks are no exception. Take email for example:</span></p><blockquote><p>Email is not distributed anymore. You just cannot create another first-class node of this network.</p><p>Email is now an oligopoly, a service gatekept by a few big companies which does not follow the principles of net neutrality.</p><p>I have been self-hosting my email since I got my first broadband connection at home in 1999. I absolutely loved having a personal web+email server at home, paid extra for a static IP and a real router so people could connect from the outside. I felt like a first-class citizen of the Internet and I learned so much.</p><p>Over time I realized that residential IP blocks were banned on most servers. I moved my email server to a VPS. No luck. I quickly understood that self-hosting email was a lost cause. Nevertheless, I have been fighting back out of pure spite, obstinacy, and activism. In other words, because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>But my emails are just not delivered anymore.

Defederation is hardly an effective blockade. The network has consolidated. Network science strikes again.</span></p><p>At scale, federated systems experience many of the same problems as centralized apps. That’s because feds are still feudal. They own your data, they own your account, they own your keys.</p><p>Large feds occupy a strategically central location in the network topology, and they have powerful influence over the rest of the network. They can leverage their network effect to pull up the drawbridge, by inventing new features that don’t federate, or cutting off contact with other feds.</p><p>So, federated networks become oligopolies. We can choose our server, as long as it’s blessed by the oligopoly. Still, an oligopoly is better than a dictatorship, email better than Facebook. But can we do even better?</p><p>Ok, forget servers. What if we could connect to each other directly?
