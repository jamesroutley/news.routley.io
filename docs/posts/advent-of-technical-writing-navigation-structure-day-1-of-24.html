			<p>This post was going to begin with &#34;Last year, I wrote 24 blog posts about bloggers whose content I followed.&#34; Until a voice in the back of my head said &#34;wait, maybe I did that the year before.&#34; It turns out that is the case: my <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2021/12/01/advent-of-bloggers-1/">Advent of Bloggers</a> series, where I wrote about blogs I liked, is two years old. I am in disbelief. Time does indeed fly.</p>
<p>I have been pondering about what to write today and I started to think about technical writing. As is the origin of many ideas, I combined my Advent of Bloggers series with technical writing (in general), to come up with a new series. Herein begins Advent of Technical Writing.</p>
<p>Over the next 24 days, I am going to share one lesson I have learned when writing technical documents. My experience pertains almost exclusively to software technical writing. I expect that much of what I write will be more applicable in that domain, but I hope my advice can generalise. This series will use a lot of &#34;I&#34;s, because I want to write with direct reference to my experience. You may have your own style that deviates from mine; therein lies the beauty of writing. But perhaps you will learn something from what I write!</p>
<p>This series is for everyone interested in technical writing, whether you are a beginner (like we all are at one point!), someone who writes a bit of documentation at work and wants to improve, an expert, or anything in between.</p>
<p>Without further preamble, let&#39;s start the first edition!</p>
<h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
<p>Over the last year, I have led the development or restructure of several documentation sites, both at work and for personal projects.</p>
<p>As I write documentation, I pay a lot of attention to the navigation structure. This comprises a number of elements, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you use a sidebar or a top navigation bar (or both) to allow people to find for what they are looking;</li>
<li>Deciding on the order in which documents appear in navigation;</li>
<li>Deciding on subheadings to organise content, and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to focus in on the second point above: ordering documents.</p>
<p>I commonly use a sidebar for technical documentation, in large part because the tools I use most for documentation sites (mkdocs and GitBook) both have well-designed sidebar features. When I write, or update, documentation, I always ask myself the question: in what order do I want someone to learn about the thing I am documenting?</p>
<p>I want someone to learn the &#34;what is&#34; as soon as possible, then provide a quickstart to get someone using the software. The quickstart should be use as little nomenclature as possible. When jargon is used that I cannot comfortable assume the audience will know, I aim to define said jargon. Quickstarts are effective because they are a single point to which someone can go to use your software; a reader doesn&#39;t need to jump around to try and find an entry point. In most of my writing, the outcome of a quickstart is running a project on one&#39;s own machine, but the aim will vary depending on the project you are documenting.</p>
<p>After the user has had a chance to experiment with the software through the quickstart, I want to graduate the reader into exploring more key value propositions that were not explained in the quickstart. Then, I go on to more advanced information, including reference material.</p>
<p>Let me talk through an example.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://inference.roboflow.com">Inference</a>, an open source inference server that lets you run computer vision models on your own hardware. I started off by thinking about everything that I wanted to include in the documentation. Then, I divided the information into a few key sections applicable for the project. Here are the general sections of content I wrote, in order of how they appear in the sidebar:</p>
<ol>
<li>A home page: The first place a person lands. I wanted this to be visual and provide a great summary to encourage someone to get started.</li>
<li>A list of &#34;Getting started&#34; guides which covers one of the main value propositions, and the topic that I decided was the most appropriate entry point: running a fine-tuned vision model on one&#39;s device.</li>
<li>A &#34;Run a Model&#34; section with guides on how to run a model. Each tutorial is titled &#34;On a...&#34;, such as &#34;On an Image (Using HTTP).&#34; With the sidebar heading as context, each link concisely states exactly what each guide does.</li>
<li>&#34;Use a Foundation Model&#34;, which documents the foundation model features in Inference. These features are important, but are more effective to read once you know about how to run a model.</li>
<li>&#34;Integrate with Inference&#34;, which includes more advanced documentation.</li>
<li>&#34;Reference&#34;, which includes miscellaneous reference information that someone may use with the library.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sidebar appears on the homepage, and all of the pages linked in the sections mentioned above. The sidebar changes if a user navigates to a different area of the site using the navigation bar at the top of the page. The link &#34;Home&#34; always appears in the top navigation bar, allowing a user to get back to the above documentation, which covers the most important parts of using Inference.</p>
<p>My goal for the documentation was to achieve the following in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell someone what the product is.</li>
<li>Tell someone how to use it as soon as I can.</li>
<li>Highlight key value propositions, in order of relevance to a beginner:</li>
<li>Running a model on images, videos, webcams, and streams.</li>
<li>Using foundation models.</li>
<li>Using the SDK integration.</li>
<li>Including important reference material that users will need.</li>
</ol>
<p>The structure above assumes you are documenting a single product. For a site that documents multiple products, you may choose to have different subheaders in a sidebar for different products, or different links in a navigation bar at the top of the page that takes people to different product home pages or guides.</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://supabase.com/docs">Supabase</a>&#39;s structure, where they have a parent sidebar and child sidebars for each product or topic area. For example, &#34;Database&#34;, their flagship product, is at the top of their &#34;Product&#34; sidebar section. This section is directly below their quickstart. If I click into &#34;Database&#34;, the sidebar is replaced with guides related to their database product. I can always navigate back by clicking the &#34;Back to Home&#34; link that appears.</p>
<p>Generally, be conscious that document order matters. Order guides in such a way where a new reader can easily find for what they are looking.</p>
<p>Join me tomorrow for another tip!</p>
