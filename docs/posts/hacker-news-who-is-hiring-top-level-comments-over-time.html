<p>tl;dr:  I believe HN Who is Hiring? posts are down; scroll to the bottom for the chart, code lives <a href="https://github.com/tjwds/hn-jobs-data">here</a>.</p>


<p>Hacker News.  The Orange Site.  Since April 2011, it’s had a thread every month, which dares potential employers to answer one question:  who is hiring?</p>


<p>I take a quick skim through this thread every month.  Not only does Fastmail (<a href="http://fastmail.com/about/jobs/">who are hiring, by the way</a>) post there, but you can glean a lot of interesting information from the posts that are being made here.  I subscribe to <a href="(https://hnrss.github.io">an RSS feed for this</a>, which makes flipping through the comments very easy.</p>


<h2>The hunch</h2>


<p>Reading this month’s thread, I got a hunch:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Economic pessimism is way, way up this month</li>
    <li>Therefore hiring might be down this month</li>
    <li>Which would be reflected by the number of organizations posting in this month’s HN Who’s Hiring thread being down<br/></li>
</ul>


<p>In describing this theory to my colleagues, I drew a chart on the whiteboard that looked something like a Loch Ness Monster:</p>


<div><figure><img width="1170" height="922" src="https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage.png 1170w, https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage-300x236.png 300w, https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage-1024x807.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px"/></figure></div>


<p>That is, we generally expect the number of posts to go up over time, because HN’s popularity has gone up; with notable exceptions for the first few months of the pandemic, and the slow-down we’re going through right now.</p>


<p>Is the metric “number of top-level comments in HN Who is Hiring threads” a good indicator of how companies are hiring in general?  I’ll let you decide.</p>


<h2>Methodology</h2>


<p>There is an official HN API: <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">https://github.com/HackerNews/API</a>.  So, really, all we have to do is fetch a lot of data, store it in a format we can retrieve, then mess around with it:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Go create a list of the “Who Is Hiring” posts.  I could have done this in a less manual fashion, but I just made a list from the account which posts the posts.</li>
    <li>Go get all of those posts; mark their publish time, and their direct descendant comments (in the API, “kids”).</li>
    <li>Go get all the comments, and their publish times.  This took a while.</li>
    <li>Make a chart.<br/></li>
</ul>


<p>When you look at it like that, this all becomes a simple matter of programming.  I did that programming!  You can find the programs <a href="https://github.com/tjwds/hn-jobs-data">here</a>.</p>


<h2>The result</h2>


<p>So, assuming that there wasn’t any weirdness with the API, we see the following shape.  The darker top line is number of non-deleted posts after three days; the bottom line is after one day.</p>


<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2328" height="1228" src="https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage-1.png 2328w, https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage-1-300x158.png 300w, https://blog.joewoods.dev/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DraggedImage-1-1024x540.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2328px) 100vw, 2328px"/></figure></div>


<p>So my hunch that posts are down <em>this month</em> doesn’t seem to be strictly true; unless someone points out a flaw with my methodology, it’s safe to assume that new job posts on HN have been down at least the past handful of months.</p>
