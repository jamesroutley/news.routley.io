    <h1>Saving Electricity (1998 – 2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <p><i>Last update: December 1, 2023</i> </p>
          <p><span><b>This was the very
                first site on the Internet about saving electricity, launching
                in 1999.</b></span>  I was telling you about LED lights,
            front-loading washers, and heat pump heating <em>years</em> before
            they started to become mainstream.  I don&#39;t have time to update
            the site much these days, but most of the old info is still true
            today.  In fact, the site is better than most articles about
            saving electricity in the popular press, which don&#39;t include useful
            numbers or which get their facts completely wrong.</p>
          <p><b>Start with learning <a href="https://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/cost.html">exactly what a kilowatt
                hour is</a> and <a href="https://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/cost.html">how much you pay for one</a>.</b> 
            You can then see how to calculate exactly how much electricity your
            household appliances use, so you know which items are guzzling the
            most juice (and which ones are the best targets for savings). 
            You&#39;ll also learn exactly <a href="https://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/measure.html">how to read your
              electric meter</a>, if you like. (Find <i>that</i> on any other
            website.)  Finally, I&#39;ve answered countless questions from
            readers about saving electricity. If you have a question, it&#39;s
            probably answered here already. </p>
          <p><b>Saving electricity doesn&#39;t just save money, it also saves
              energy, which means less pollution.</b>  This might be
            surprising, because you don&#39;t see or smell any pollution when you
            turn on the lights, unlike when you fire up your car.  But the
            pollution is thereit just happens at the power plant instead of
            on-site.  Most electricity is generated by burning coal and
            other fossil fuels.  Every time you turn on the lights, you
            create a little pollution. (See the sidebar.) In fact, <b>the
              average home pollutes more than the average car!</b> (See my <a href="https://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/carboncalculator.html">Carbon
              Footprint Calculator</a> for the numbers.)  So saving
            electricity doesn&#39;t just put money in your pocket, it helps keep the
            air and water clean, too.</p>
          <p><b>Saving electricity is the low-hanging fruit.  </b>The
            legendary James Hansen, one of the first scientists to warn about
            global warming way back in the 80s, said that<b> </b><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/23/AR2008062301920.html?hpid=opinionsbox1" target="_blank"><b>the
                real key to preventing climate change is reducing home energy
                use</b></a><b>.</b>  That&#39;s because, as he says, we can&#39;t
            stop the oil from being burned for transport, since if we don&#39;t use
            it, another country will. But we can certainly stop burning our own
            country&#39;s coal.  And the quickest way to reduce coal emissions
            is to reduce our electricity consumption. <SPAN size="-2">(</SPAN><a href="https://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/climatechange.html"><SPAN size="-2">more

          <p><b>And if you <i>really</i> want to lessen your </b><a href="https://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/carboncalculator.html"><b>carbon
                footprint</b></a><b>,</b> you&#39;ll also want to look into <a href="https://michaelbluejay.com/veg/environment.html" target="">eating

              </b>Attack the biggest energy-users first</SPAN></h2>
          <p><b>Before we get to the tips on specific appliances, remember one
              simple thing:</b> You&#39;ll save more electricity by dealing with the
            biggest electricity-guzzlers rather than worrying about items that

          <p>Obsessing about whether it&#39;s better to boil a cup of water on an
            electric burner or in a microwave, or whether you wear out your
            lights quicker by turning them off rather than keeping them on, is a
            waste of time and <b>misses the point</b>.  Such trivia won&#39;t
            make a big difference in your electric bill.  It&#39;s the bigger
            things that matter.  With that in mind, you&#39;ll first want to

            <p> I&#39;m just dropping a quick note to thank your for your amazing
              electricity subsite. It&#39;s outstanding. I&#39;ve been working to
              improve my finances for a while, and every little bit helps. I
              just posted about your Saving Electricity site on my site (Get
              Rich Slowly). I hope to steer others to the information you&#39;ve
              provided.<SPAN size="-2" color="#660000"><i> -- J.D. Roth, </i></SPAN><a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/"><SPAN size="-2"><i>Get

            <p>I studied your site after deciding that I was determined to put
              an end to paying for (and wasting) lots of electricity.  I
              bought a kilowatt meter to measure my usage.  In the first
              month I dropped my from 578 kWh avg. to 197 kWh.  This past
              month after replacing my 1980&#39;s fridge with a new one I was able
              to get down to 150 kilowatt-hours, and that includes my home
              office.  My electric company lets you look at and compare the
              past 14 months worth of usage and bills online.  I saved $50
              this past month compared to last year and plan on saving more than
              $1000 for the year over 2004.  Our rates are about 14 cents
              for delivery and usage not including the $7.36 customer charge, so
              this has made a big impact.  So I just wanted express a quick
              &#39;thank you&#39; for your site.  I appreciate the depth of
              information and the ability to reference many other sites. <SPAN size="-2" color="#660000"><i>best
                  regards, Aaron Patt</i></SPAN> Thank you for making &#39;Saving
              Electricity.&#39;  I googled for a site about using the
              window units in my apartment more efficiently (I&#39;m used to
              central air) and after reading your site I&#39;ve gone from
              running two window units and a fan on high and still
              being uncomfortably warm to sitting directly in front of
              a single fan, on low, and I&#39;m a little chilly. I think I&#39;m
              also going to purchase clothes drying rack. I have a wacky idea
              about trying to use my fan and hanging my clothes up to dry in
              conjunction.... <SPAN size="-2" color="#660000"><i>—</i></SPAN><a href="http://www.veronicapare.com/"><SPAN size="-2"><i>Veronica
