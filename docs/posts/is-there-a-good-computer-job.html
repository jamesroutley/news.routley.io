			    <blockquote><p>But I don’t know that any computing makes the world better, or even neutral. These days the planet is in a dire state. Working with people still doing the “write software” Silicon Valley dance while trying to survive in triple-digit heat waves is a level of cognitive dissonance I can handle no further.</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought computers could make the world a better place. When I saw <a href="https://thewebivore.com/ada-lovelace-day-justine-cassell-and-why-i-fell-in-love-with-computer-science/">a computer scientist present her work at a conference in 2009</a>, I had my “I don’t know what I’m going to do, but I’m definitely going to work around <em>that</em>” moment with computing. I wasn’t sure <em>what</em> I would do but I knew I wanted to be around <em>that </em>kind of work.</p>
<p>Reading Wesley Aptekar-Cassels’s post <a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/tech-industry/">Tech, Industry</a> gave me some language to think about what’s happened in how I feel now, reflecting on my decade+ working in computing. They reference “tech optimism” – I felt that in 2009. In the last decade, the backlash against tech, or “techlash,” is more accurate.</p>
<p>As I said in my quote above, I have a very difficult time thinking about how computers make things better. This led me to reflect on other times I believed in something and was let down.</p>
<h3>I’ve had my heart broken before</h3>
<p>It may be true that I’ve burnt out on the tech industry. However, I’ve passed through other industries while working with computers, and I recognize that I’ve been hurt before.</p>
<p>My first jobs out of college were politics or politics-adjacent – I worked for a think tank and at an agency for political campaigns.</p>
<p>There I learned very quickly that politics is a nasty game of power. It will burn up idealists gleefully, and reward sociopaths and narcissists openly.</p>
<p>I dreamed of working in journalism and found a job working in computing with a non-profit doing local investigative journalism.</p>
<p>At a journalism conference I was horrified to listen to people on stage outlining how they would click a button to apply various statistical methods to data and “pick the one that made a nice chart.” Generally irksome from a statistical perspective, confidence-breaking in relation to my appraisal of these folks’ work.</p>
<p>(And it didn’t help that my brief stint in journalism ended when I found out we were running out of money and had no sustainable plan for continuity … I couldn’t stand staying.)</p>
<h3>Startups &amp; Enterprise</h3>
<p>I went on to corporate software engineering. There I could learn what kinds of things corporations paid for in relation to software, so I would have insight into how to make those things. (Learn enterprise software problems by working on enterprise software)</p>
<p>And then working in writing software for software people worked for a while. I could motivate myself to care about the problems as they were intellectually challenging.</p>
<p>Someone’s day might be better because of software I’d written. I know what it’s like to write code and maintain services, so I can relate to that!</p>
<p>Another reason I went further into the tech industry was frankly around pay. It paid the most, and working in the tech industry has constantly felt like a bubble.</p>
<p>Ergo, make as much money as possible in as little time as possible, to be able to stop when I needed to. Turns out that “I need to stop” was 2021.</p>
<p>Chasing compensation and climbing the ladder created so much pressure. It felt like I always had to advance, otherwise I was either leaving money on the table for myself, or failing my gender as a woman working in the industry.</p>
<p>Last year, when I was working a job I shouldn’t have taken (I should have been resting) and <a href="https://thewebivore.com/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/">my headaches and pain worsened</a>, the mantra that came to mind over and over was “What is the money for?”</p>
<p>And I quit.</p>
<h3>Should I stay or should I go now</h3>
<p>Circling back to <em>Tech, Industry?,</em> the closing statements are a call to action to <em>stay</em> in the tech industry.</p>
<p>And yet, non-participation is its own viable action. As one of my mentors said, “Perhaps the only way they can learn the lesson you have to share is by your absence.”</p>
<p>I wonder about how many things need to simply … not exist. And not contributing your labor towards something that doesn’t need to exist is one form of exercising power.</p>
<p>The VC-funded game, the start-up merry-go-round. I, and many, keep expecting its untimely demise, but it carries on anyway. Riding the merry-go-round can be fun, but boy is it difficult to un-see the mess it is in order to continue playing.</p>
<p>I’ve chatted with more than one person working in tech who talks about their current job being their “last tech job” – trying to find a way out. How painful that that’s the framing. How accurate is it that the freedom of “enough” money is a reason to try and stay.</p>
<p>The way tech is difficult to hire in but highly compensated, you would think we were dealing with radioactive materials. Something to think on…</p>
<h3>Is there a good computer job?</h3>
<p>But … is there a good computer job?</p>
<p>… Probably.</p>
<p>Reading through my own reflections, I sound like someone who’s burnt out.</p>
<p>Non-participation in a system is <i>absolutely</i> a viable path of action … but there’s a lot of software in the world. If I say “It’s all horrible, can we please just all work on handicrafts instead!?” … that’s coming from a place of hurt.</p>
<p>And maybe that’s why taking a break, or doing something very different, is exactly what I need  to be (and am!) doing. It’s going well, but I’m also thinking about “what else?” or “what’s next [eventually]”, because I’m always rushing to the next thing, even when I explicitly told myself <i>not</i> to…</p>
<p>I’ve started pondering if I <i>did</i> want to do some tech-related or tech-adjacent work, what would that look like, and I don’t know yet. Community-oriented work? Reboot my own consulting company? Start a software company? I’m helping out with a project very soon that is related to computers, creativity, and community. What about more of that?</p>
