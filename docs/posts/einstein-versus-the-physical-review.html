The <i>Physical Review</i> received Einstein’s submission on 1 June 1936, according to the journal’s logbook.

In particular, he wrote, “I could not accept for publication in THE PHYSICAL REVIEW a paper which the author was unwilling I should show to our </p><named-content content-type="sem:AIPTh1.2" rid="kwd1.2">Editorial</named-content><p> Board before publication.”</p></div><div><p>The paper was, however, subsequently accepted for publication by the <i>Journal of the Franklin Institute</i> in Philadelphia,<span><a data-rid="c6" data-reflink="_i10" href="#"> <sup>6</sup> </a><span><span></span><span>6.

(Rosen did not leave for the Soviet Union until near the end of July, according to a letter written on his behalf by Einstein to Vyacheslav Molotov on 4 July.) Robertson apparently did not return to Princeton until mid-August.

Indeed, Robertson, in his very next report to Tate, commented that the author “is a man of good scientific standing, and it would seem to me that if he insists, he has more right to be heard than any single referee has to throttle!” That dispute turned more on matters of interpretation, though, and when it came to a paper that might actually be wrong, even an Einstein had to be queried, however gently.</p></div><div><p>Doubtless the rigorous criticism may have come as something of a shock to Einstein, who was accustomed to gentler treatment early in his </p><named-content content-type="sem:AIPTh1.2" rid="kwd1.19">career.</named-content><p> However, Einstein could be very frank and direct in his criticism of others’ work. From 1914 on, as a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, he was regularly called on to review articles submitted to the academy’s proceedings. The German word for worthless frequently occurs in those brief reviews. As a member of the academy, Einstein had his papers published without question or revision. Anything less must have seemed to him a tremendous slight.</p></div><div><p>In his letter to Einstein, Tate had carefully avoided stating that anonymous review by the </p><named-content content-type="sem:AIPTh1.2" rid="kwd1.2">editorial</named-content><p> board or others was a necessary step in the acceptance of a paper by the journal. In fact, the <i>Physical Review</i> logbook suggests that neither of the two previous papers by Einstein and Rosen, including the one with Podolsky, had been sent to a referee: In both cases the field for the referee’s name was left blank, and the EPR paper was sent for publication the day after its receipt at the journal. Therefore it is likely that the </p><named-content content-type="sem:AIPTh1.2" rid="kwd1.1">gravitational wave</named-content><p> paper was Einstein’s first encounter with the anonymous peer-review system practiced in American journals at the time.</p></div><p>That Tate chose to have the 1936 paper refereed is interesting. After all, Einstein’s two previous submissions were certainly controversial. EPR is arguably the most controversial paper Einstein ever published, and the Einstein–Rosen bridge paper was part of an ongoing controversy with Ludwig Silberstein.<span><a data-rid="c10" data-reflink="_i10" href="#"> <sup>10</sup> </a><span><span></span><span>10.

Tate published both of those papers without outside advice.</p><div><p>A paper purporting to prove that </p><named-content content-type="sem:AIPTh1.2" rid="kwd1.1">gravitational waves</named-content><p> did not exist, though, apparently sounded alarms with him.

Tate published the better-known papers expeditiously and, by consulting Robertson for the third, saved Einstein from what would have been a very public embarrassment.
