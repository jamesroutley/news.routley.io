At a hastily called news conference at the Toronto hotel where he was staying, the professor demurred when asked about the newfound fame that comes with being a Nobel laureate.</p><p>“I don’t know that I want to attract more attention to my work,” a bemused Marcus <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-10-15-mn-394-story.html"><u>told reporters</u></a>. “I just want more time to get it done.”</p><p>He got his wish. His colleagues couldn’t have foreseen the sheer longevity of his tenure when he arrived at Caltech during the Carter administration, “but the Nobel Prize quality, yes,” said <a href="https://www.cce.caltech.edu/people/john-d-baldeschwieler?back_url=%2Fpeople" target="_blank"><u>John D. Baldeschwieler</u></a>, a retired professor emeritus of chemistry who was chair of the department at the time of Marcus’ hiring. </p><p>Marcus was born in 1923 in Montreal, the much-loved only child of Esther and Myer Marcus. His mother in particular instilled a love of learning, in part motivated by the fact that her own family lacked the money to continue her education beyond grade school.</p><p>“She told me that when I was a baby and she used to wheel me in a carriage around McGill, she told me that I would go there,” he said in an <a href="https://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/139/1/Marcus_OHO.pdf" target="_blank"><u>oral history</u></a> collected by Caltech in 1993. (She was right: he earned both his bachelor’s degree and doctorate at the prestigious Montreal university.)</p><p>He was drawn to puzzles as a child, and has often described his approach to science as a decades-long continuation of the childlike pleasure of teasing a solution from once-scattered parts.</p><p>“The main thing is finding something that you enjoy doing, that preferably doesn’t harm others, and that tests whatever aptitude one has, that tests one’s ingenuity,” he said. “It’s almost like a kind of a game.
