<p>Instructor: Jeremy Siek</p>

<p>Welcome to the half-day tutorial for Essentials of Compilation (EoC)!</p>

<p>This tutorial introduces the participants to the joys of teaching and
learning about compilers using the incremental approach. The tutorial
provides a sneak-preview of a compiler course based on the new
textbooks from MIT Press:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047760/essentials-of-compilation/">Essentials of Compilation: An Incremental Approach in Racket</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048248/essentials-of-compilation/">Essentials of Compilation: An Incremental Approach in Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>PDFs for the books are available for free from my web page:</p>

<h2 id="about-essentials-of-compilation">About Essentials of Compilation</h2>

<p>The EoC course takes students on a journey through constructing their
own compiler for a small but powerful language. The standard approach
to describing and teaching compilers is to proceed one pass at a time,
from the front to the back of the compiler. Unfortunately, that
approach obfuscates how language features motivate design choices in a
compiler. In the EoC course we instead take an incremental approach in
which we build a complete compiler every two weeks, starting with a
small input language that includes only arithmetic and variables. We
add new language features in subsequent iterations, extending the
compiler as necessary. Student get immediate positive feedback as they
see their compiler passing test cases and then learn important lessons
regarding software engineering as they grow and refactor their
compiler throughout the semester.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

<p>The first half of the tutorial will provide an overview of the EoC
course and textbook with plenty of time for questions and answers.</p>

<p>The second half of the tutorial will be a hands-on activity in which
the tutorial participants implement one of the compiler passes
described in the Chapter 2 of the book: the “Remove Complex Operands”
pass. The activity can be completed in either</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python (version 3.10 or higher) or</li>
  <li>Racket (version 8.0 or higher)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please make sure to have one of them installed on your laptop.</p>

<h2 id="python-specifics">Python Specifics</h2>

<p>The file <code>compiler.py</code> is the skeleton code for your compiler.
The goal will be to fill in the method <code>remove_complex_operands</code>
inside the <code>Compiler</code> class.</p>

<p>You can test your implementation of <code>remove_complex_operands</code> by
running the test script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python3.11 ./run-tests.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Go ahead and run the script right away. It should tell you that 0 out
of 3 tests passed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>tests: 0/3 for compiler var on language var
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It ran your incomplete compiler on the three test programs in the
<code>tests/var/</code> directory. You are encouraged to add more test programs.</p>

<p>The script also reports that 0 of 0 passes succeeded.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>passes: 0/0 for compiler var on language var
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The script runs an intepreter on the intermediate programs produced by
each pass of your compiler to check whether they have the same result
as the source program. Once you have implemented the
<code>remove_complex_operands</code> method, the script will say that <code>1/1</code> passes
were successful.</p>

<h2 id="racket-specifics">Racket Specifics</h2>

<p>The file <code>compiler.rkt</code> is the skeleton code for your compiler.
The goal will be to fill in the function <code>remove-complex-opera*</code>.</p>

<p>You can test your implementation of the <code>remove-complex-opera*</code>
function by running the test script:</p>



<p>Go ahead and run the script right away. It should tell you that 9
tests passed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>9 success(es) 0 failure(s) 0 error(s) 9 test(s) run
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are three test programs for the <code>var</code> language in the <code>tests</code>
subdirectory, and the script includes three things by default in the
“success” count for each test program, including type checking and
running the interpreter on the source program.</p>

<p>The script runs an intepreter on the intermediate programs produced by
each pass of your compiler to check whether they have the same result
as the source program.</p>

<p>Once you have implemented the <code>remove-complex-opera*</code> function,
uncomment the line for <code>remove complex opera*</code> in the
<code>compiler-passes</code> list at the end of <code>compiler.rkt</code>. Run the script
again and it should report <code>18</code> successes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>18 success(es) 0 failure(s) 0 error(s) 18 test(s) run
</code></pre></div></div>
