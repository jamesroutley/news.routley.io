                    <p>Writing effectively is a superpower, there is no denying it. As a software engineer, you write <em><strong><strong>a lot</strong></strong></em>. Most of the writing you do is for computers. Businesses, however, consist of people.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just spoke to the CEO of a $350 million company, who said: &#34;I won&#39;t promote somebody to a strategic leadership position unless they&#39;re a good writer.&#34;</p>‚Äî David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1583234471561637889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2022</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Many of us work remotely which puts higher demands on the quality of our writing. If a few years ago we were able to scoot a couple of meters in our office chair and talk to a co-worker about something, we now usually <em>write</em> to them. Sometimes we won&#39;t hear back until several hours later, maybe even days. When the round-trip time is measured in hours, you&#39;ll want to consider what and how you write to avoid the gut-punching &#34;What do you mean?&#34; a day later.</p><h2 id="communicating-effectively-as-an-engineer-means-empathically-increasing-the-resolution-of-your-writing">Communicating effectively as an engineer means empathically increasing the resolution of your writing.</h2><h3 id="short-form-writing">Short-form writing</h3><p>The first major category of writing ubiquitous in every developer‚Äôs life is chat ‚Äî Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc. Whatever the platform may be, the messages are exchanged ‚Äî written and read ‚Äî quickly.</p><p>Writing messages on Slack isn‚Äôt what engineers get paid for, though. Writing code to solve problems is. Instant messaging tools are seen more as a necessary evil to get work done in a team than anything else. Because of this dynamic, there is a tendency to elide details or cut messages short, sometimes at the expense of legibility.</p><p>Let‚Äôs look at a couple of tactical examples üëáüèª</p><figure><img src="https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/2022/10/dm-example.png" alt="A comparison of two Slack messages.

One on the left shows a confusing message. The other on the right depicts a well thought-through message." loading="lazy" width="1602" height="316" srcset="https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/team-chat-example.png 600w, https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/team-chat-example.png 1000w, https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/team-chat-example.png 1600w, https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/2022/10/team-chat-example.png 1602w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption>Chatting in a public or team channel with many people.</figcaption></figure><p>In both cases, the example on the left is what I call ‚Äúlow-resolution writing‚Äù. There is very little context, too much reliance on pronouns and unclear references. The writing is not emphatic ‚Äîthe reader has to spend extra energy to work out what is being said:</p><ul><li>what is ‚Äúit‚Äù?</li><li>who is ‚Äúher‚Äù?</li><li>‚Äúnot working properly‚Äù how?</li><li>what exactly does ‚Äúbad time‚Äù mean?</li></ul><p>The examples on the right, on the other hand, try to make the reader do less work, even though it is more effort for the writer. The writer clearly has thought about how the message will be read.</p><p>Especially in the ‚Äúteam channel‚Äù example on the left, it is unclear what the writer is even trying to convey. It is a statement, do I have to acknowledge it? It is ambiguous, should I follow up with questions? Is the writer looking for help or simply quipping that there is a problem?</p><p>On the right, however, the writer has gone through the trouble of telling the reader:</p><ul><li>what symptom they‚Äôre seeing (assuming they pasted the exception afterwards);</li><li>what they have tried in order to resolve the problem; and</li><li>that they need help.</li></ul><p>Someone familiar with the problem will be able to help immediately instead of having to start solving the mystery of what the message author meant.</p><h2 id="longer-form-writing">Longer-form writing</h2><p>The second category of writing many engineers carry out daily is producing notes of all sorts ‚Äî comments on pull requests, feedback on design documents, proposals and RFCs, code comments, and so on. Usually, this type of writing is to be read ‚Äúoffline‚Äù, at a slower pace. The rules of high resolution and empathy apply here, too. </p><p>Longer-form writing gives you an opportunity to dive deeper into <em>why</em> you are saying what you are saying. It is a chance to educate, to teach, to help understand and to level up.</p><figure><img src="https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/2022/10/pr-example.png" alt="A comparison of two pull request review comments. One on the left is very terse. The one on the right elaborates on the issue at thand." loading="lazy" width="1602" height="747" srcset="https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/pr-example.png 600w, https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/pr-example.png 1000w, https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/pr-example.png 1600w, https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/2022/10/pr-example.png 1602w"/></figure><p>In the above example on the left, the comment I wrote does its job ‚Äî it states that the introduced endpoint isn‚Äôt RESTful and that there is a bug in the implementation. There is nothing inherently wrong with this review comment, although it‚Äôs a little cold.</p><p>On the right is the comment I actually wrote. Because I knew the context and the recipient, I took some time to explain how the buggy implementation could crash and elaborated on how to fix it ‚Äúproperly‚Äù by making it more RESTful. It may seem like an overkill. And sure, if you‚Äôre providing feedback like this to an industry veteran, you are going to get some weird looks. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to understand the context and write for the reader, empathically.</p><p>Now, I‚Äôm not saying you should be producing essays every time you sit down to do a PR review or provide feedback on a design document. Often it is totally fine to leave a few short, clear notes. But keep an eye out for situations where the reader might disproportionally benefit from you spending 10 minutes vs 2 minutes writing a response.</p><h2 id="long-form-writing">Long-form writing</h2><p>This category of writing is very difficult to give tactical advice for. The length of documents produced can vary from a single page to several thousand words of prose and it&#39;s usually where structure and flow really start to matter.</p><p>Many organisations cannot afford (or simply do not see the point of) hiring a technical writer, so the task of producing clear, helpful, accurate prose falls on <strong>you</strong>, the developer. This, in turn, requires you to be your own editor.</p><p>Although this is true for shorter-form writing as well, I would recommend thinking about long-form writing, especially, as a lever. The clearer and easier-to-understand you make your writing, the longer the lever gets.</p><figure><img src="https://www.karlsutt.com/content/images/2022/10/increased-resolution-1.png" alt="Two photos side-by-side.

It has a bunch of users. The service is powered by an API which you decide to open up to your users so they‚Äôll be able to build their own integrations and interact with your service programmatically.</p><p>The quality of the API documentation will carry an astronomical amount of leverage. This leverage will work in both directions.</p><p>Genuinely helpful documentation is the difference between being swamped by support requests from frustrated API users and significantly increasing the usage of your service. Happy users beget more happy users.</p><p>API docs is just one example, the same goes for other texts like specifications, design documents, and feature and project pitches.</p><h2 id="why-writing-matters">Why writing matters</h2><p>We all write things. Most of the time what we write isn‚Äôt very impactful ‚Äî a reply to a random email, quick banter with friends on Discord, a birthday card to a distant relative.</p><p>It starts to matter, and matter a lot, in a professional setting. When what you write is read by your co-workers, your manager or your manager&#39;s manager, it helps <strong><strong><strong><strong>everyone</strong></strong></strong></strong> if your writing is clear, concise and empathic.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The more our company grows, the more I believe in quality writing.</p>‚Äî David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1584933536439881728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote>
