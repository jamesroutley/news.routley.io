    <h1>Ask HN: Location based pay is killing my motivation, how do others handle it?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Recently I got to know the pay scales that my peers and even junior developers are getting in the US/EU. It is substantially more even though we do the same work. Though I&#39;ve known about this policy, getting to know the numbers is extremely jarring. It&#39;s causing a lot of resentment and detachment to work from my side.<p>I&#39;ve raised this issue with my manager and they&#39;ve told me that I can transfer if i want those pay scales but that&#39;s not a possibility for me. If the company is willing to pay me that amount in a different location, why can&#39;t it pay me the same here?</p><p>The reasons they&#39;ve given me are weak and I want to debunk them.</p><p>1) cost of living - a lot of my colleagues are in locations where they can buy independent houses which are cheaper than an appartment in the city I live. Real estate in my country runs on black money, and I&#39;ll probably never be able to own a house. Some of the EU countries provide free health care and education, I&#39;m just a major health issue away from poverty. Most of them come from nuclear family cultures, where as I take care of my retired parents and younger siblings, and if i get married that&#39;s a whole new family.</p><p>2) talent - if they are more talented than me then why am I in a more senior role than them. And my talent won&#39;t change if I change location so why should my salary</p><p>3) something about not trapping in a high salary job - I dont even know what to say about this. I would love to be in that trap instead of the one I&#39;m in right now where I&#39;m being forced to migrate, where I would loose my family, friends and all the support structures I&#39;ve built around me, to receive the same benefits as my peers.</p><p>This seems senseless to me. What would the company gain if I work from a different location that they would pay me more? It feels like a poverty tax and I&#39;ve never felt more like a cog in a machine.</p><p>What do others think about this and how do you deal with this?</p></div></div>
