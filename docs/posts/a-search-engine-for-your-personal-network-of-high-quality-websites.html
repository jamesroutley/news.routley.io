    <h1>A search engine for your personal network of high-quality websites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Why? How?</h2><p><img src="https://grep.help/img/cover.png" alt="Grep"/></p><h3>Why?</h3><p>Search engines have been drowning in SEO and mostly unauthoritative content. With the rise of ChatGPT, AI-generated content is flooding the search engines, making it even harder to find authoritative and reliable results.</p><p>This is the problem that Grep aims to solve.</p><h3>How?</h3><p>Grep is a new kind of search engine where users follow a minimum of 7 websites they like. From there, we build a 4-degree connection by taking the websites they follow and the websites those websites link to, and so on. If the minimum website requirement of 70,000 websites is not met, we will expand the network up to 7 degrees of connection.</p><h3>P.S.</h3><p>Grep is still in early development, and we are working hard to make it better. Our vision is to build a new kind of social search engine to show authoritative and reliable results that you trust. We will more social features in the future.</p><p>If you have any feedback, please message us on<!-- --> <a href="https://twitter.com/grepsearch">Twitter</a> or say hi on our <a href="https://discord.gg/7jxw8BedVR">Discord</a>.</p></div></div>
