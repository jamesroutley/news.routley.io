    <p>Chloe Yehwon Lee, 17, of Murphy, explored a way to lower the toxic effects of acetaminophen (Tylenol) on the liver for her Regeneron Science Talent Search chemistry project. The painkiller is used by over 60 million Americans each week, but it is also the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and the second most common cause of liver transplant worldwide. Chloe studied chemical changes to the acetaminophen molecule’s benzene ring to see if they could reduce liver toxicity.</p>

    <p>Chloe studied chemical changes to the acetaminophen molecule’s benzene ring to see if they could reduce liver toxicity. She developed computer models of the modified molecules to test their ability to relieve pain and toxic effects. She found and synthesized a modified acetaminophen molecule that may be less toxic and may even kill pain better than the original. Her new molecule could be a first step in creating safer and more effective forms of acetaminophen.</p>

            </h2>
        
        <p>Chloe is an award-winning violinist who performs with multiple orchestras. She has taught violin to younger students and plays with her school’s Ensembles for Elderly, which performs at assisted living and memory care centers.</p>
<p>FUN FACTS: An eraser as a prized possession? Absolutely! Chloe’s jumbo “For Really Big Mistakes” eraser is the perfect reminder that, together, we learn, fail and improve, one step at a time!</p>
