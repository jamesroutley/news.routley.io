                        <p>Recently, I needed to debug a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/233821">particularly nasty interaction</a> between two programs, one of which was a go tool. To get further in understanding the issue, I had to compile a little test program with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo"><code>cgo</code></a>, the dreaded (by go programmers) compilation mode that allows go programs to call C code. Unfortunately, it’s a bit difficult to find out what to concretely do in order to build a program with <code>cgo</code>.</p>
<p>As with all semi-taboo knowledge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, there seems to be a strong reluctance in the respective community to providing straightforward guidance on how do what you want (in this case, build a program with <code>cgo</code> which is discouraged and intensely disliked but is an integral part of building several popular &amp; working go programs). Well, we’ll show them!</p>
<p>There are two main things you need to do: First, explicitly opt out of disabling the usage of the <code>cgo</code> compiler by setting <code>CGO_ENABLED=1</code> on the compiler’s process environment. (This defaults to on, but your environment might have it turned off! Best to explicitly enable it.)</p>
<p>Second, you <em>also</em> have to provide the compiler a reason <em>in code</em> to compile your code with cgo: You have to make an FFI call into C. The easiest way that <a href="https://ottawa.place/@andrew">Andrew</a> pointed me at is to use call a no-op C function from a go <code>init()</code> function.</p>
<p>This looks like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>package</span> main
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>/*
</span></span></span><span><span><span>int dummy(void) { return 42; }
</span></span></span><span><span><span>*/</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>import</span> <span>&#34;C&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> <span>init</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>    C.<span>dummy</span>()
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In order to make a program that can optionally be compiled with cgo and the native go complier, I structured the cgo-enabling parts such that the init function above lives in a file <code>enablecgo.go</code>, and starts with a line that says <code>// +build enablecgo</code>. You can find the whole source code <a href="https://github.com/antifuchs/nixpkgs-bug-repro-flyctl/tree/main/testapp">in my bug report repro repo</a>.</p>
<p>To build the app from that repo, you use the following commandlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>without</em> cgo (native go compiler): <code>go build ./</code></li>
<li><em>with</em> cgo: <code>env CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags enablecgo</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you landed on this page, I hope it can help you get further in your debugging journey, and hope that the pain stops soon.</p>
