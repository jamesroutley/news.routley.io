    <h1>Treat your to-read pile like a river, not a bucket</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-mesh-id="comp-la9rckt41inlineContent" data-testid="inline-content"><div data-mesh-id="comp-la9rckt41inlineContent-gridContainer" data-testid="mesh-container-content"><div id="comp-krm60pbo2" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span><span>I&#39;m going to take</span></span> a wild guess here and say that you, like me, have a large pile (or digital equivalent) of books or articles you&#39;ve been meaning to get around to reading, plus maybe a long queue of podcast episodes to which you&#39;d love to listen, if only you had the time. It&#39;s the archetypal &#34;first-world problem&#34;, I know. But one worth reflecting on – because it&#39;s a microcosm of a broader mistake that makes it more stressful than in needs to be to build a fulfilling and productive life: the problem of Too Many Needles.</p>



<p>It&#39;s amusing to reflect that at an earlier stage in the history of the web, information overload was widely held to be a temporary issue. Yes, true, for the time being we were getting deluged by a zillion irrelevant blog posts, emails and news updates. But that wouldn&#39;t last, because soon we&#39;d have better technology for finding what we wanted, while disregarding the rest. The real trouble, according to the leading techno-optimist Clay Shirky, wasn&#39;t information overload, but <span><span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/shirky-problem-is-filter-failure-not-info-overload/" target="_blank">&#34;filter failure&#34;</a></span></span>. We needed – and we&#39;d eventually get – more sophisticated ways to filter the wheat from the online chaff. And then we&#39;d no longer feel overwhelmed. </p>



<p>Yeah… no. I assume you&#39;d agree that the problem of your to-read pile is very much not one of filter failure. It&#39;s not that you&#39;re deluged with things you don&#39;t care about, and need help figuring out what&#39;s truly of interest. It&#39;s that you&#39;re overwhelmed by things you do want to read. All the books on your bedside table, all those bookmarks in your browser, or articles <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI/c?w=gXmN01MP-roA9DVSSLwwrp0-dobRyQmYwGP4mYTk9dQ.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFwYXBlci5jb20vIiwiciI6ImEwOGRhOGFkLTlkMTktNGUyYS02OTdhLTE4ODMwZWNhM2JkOCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9" target="_blank">saved to Instapaper </a>– all of them seem like they might be right up your street, or crucial to your professional success, or might contain some nugget of wisdom you&#39;d benefit from absorbing. The problem, as the critic Nicholas Carr <span><span><a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=1464" target="_blank">explained</a></span></span>, isn&#39;t filter failure. It&#39;s filter success. In a world of effectively infinite information, the better you get at sifting the wheat from the chaff, the more you end up crushed beneath a never-ending avalanche of wheat.</p>



<p>And so, for example, the reading recommendations I encounter via Twitter are much more tailored to my concerns than those I might encounter via a newspaper, because I choose who I follow on Twitter; it&#39;s like having a thousand assistants scouring the infoverse for whatever might pique my interest. My challenge, information-wise, isn&#39;t about finding a needle in a haystack. It&#39;s that I&#39;m confronted on a daily basis, in Carr&#39;s words, by &#34;haystack-sized piles of needles.&#34; </p>



<p>The wider point here is that lots of the other ways in which we feel overwhelmed are problems of &#34;too many needles&#34; as well. They involve the attempt to divide our finite time and attention among too many things that all have a legitimate claim on them. Some of these are &#34;good problems to have&#34;: for example, if you&#39;re blessed with work you love, or a creative passion you&#39;re good at, you may often feel torn between multiple projects you&#39;re excited to launch. Others are the familiar problems of Life Under Late Capitalism™, like the feeling that there&#39;s simply not enough time in the day to be a good parent while staying afloat financially. What they all have in common is that the things you&#39;re choosing between all genuinely matter, and would benefit from more time than you can give them.</p>



<p><span><span>Too many rocks</span></span></p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, most advice on productivity and time management takes the needle-in-a-haystack approach instead. It&#39;s about becoming more efficient and organised, or better at prioritising, with the implied promise that you might thereby eliminate or disregard enough of life&#39;s unimportant nonsense to make time for the meaningful stuff. To stretch a metaphor: it&#39;s about reducing the size of the haystack, to make it easier to focus on the needle.</p>



<p>There&#39;s definitely a role for such techniques; but in the end, the only way to deal with a too-many-needles problem is to confront the fact that it&#39;s insoluble – that you definitely won&#39;t be fitting everything in. (Of course some such problems, where just scraping a living feels impossible, demand political solutions too – a topic for another time.) It&#39;s not a question of rearranging your to-do list so as to <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI/c?w=g9EKf5Lv4dlKvqPm06dCQrm_h5m7KtU3D_wcpDzjNds.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHBsZXNlZWRzLm9yZy9iaWctcm9ja3NfY292ZXkuaHRtIiwiciI6ImEwOGRhOGFkLTlkMTktNGUyYS02OTdhLTE4ODMwZWNhM2JkOCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9" target="_blank">make space for all your &#34;big rocks&#34;</a>, but of accepting that there are simply too many rocks to fit in the jar. You have to take a stab at deciding what matters most, among your various creative passions/life goals/responsibilities – and then do that, while acknowledging that you&#39;ll inevitably be neglecting many other things that matter too.</p>



<p>To return to information overload: this means treating your &#34;to read&#34; pile like a river (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it). After all, you presumably don&#39;t feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren&#39;t <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI/c?w=qiSKQRmJJq0-qcwQTuOai0NtmSDVPnNWqEd4D_sHVwI.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmwudWsvYWJvdXQtdXMvb3VyLXN0b3J5L2ZhY3RzLWFuZC1maWd1cmVzLW9mLXRoZS1icml0aXNoLWxpYnJhcnkjIiwiciI6ImEwOGRhOGFkLTlkMTktNGUyYS02OTdhLTE4ODMwZWNhM2JkOCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9" target="_blank">an overwhelming number of them</a>, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.</p>



<p>Coming at life this way definitely entails tough choices. But it&#39;s liberating, too, as you slowly begin to grasp that you never had any other option. There&#39;s no point beating yourself up for failing to clear a backlog (of unread books, undone tasks, unrealized dreams) that it was always inherently unfeasible to clear in the first place. I like to think of it as the productivity technique to beat all productivity techniques: finally internalizing the implications of the fact that what&#39;s genuinely impossible – the clue is in the name! – cannot actually be done.</p>
