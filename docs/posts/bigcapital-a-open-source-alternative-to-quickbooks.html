    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, September 25, 2023</em></p><p>On the command line, you can use <code>tsort</code> to sort a graph into a list (a topological ordering.) Say you have this chart showing what you need to get dressed:</p><p><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/tsort-clothes.png" alt="A graph of dependency relationships among pieces of clothing. It shows you need an undershirt to put on a shirt, shirt to put on a tie, underwear to put on pants, pants to put on a belt, and socks to put on shoes."/></p><p>You can write all those arrows down in a file as dependencies (in order of &#34;X blocks Y,&#34; for example &#34;Shirt blocks Tie,&#34; &#34;Socks block Shoes.&#34;)</p><pre><code><span>Shirt Tie
</span><span>Undershirt Shirt
</span><span>Shirt Belt
</span><span>Pants Belt
</span><span>Underwear Pants
</span><span>Socks Shoes
</span><span>Pants Shoes
</span></code></pre><p>If you pass that to <code>tsort</code> you get this, one order in which you could put on clothes to get dressed:</p><pre><code><span>Socks
</span><span>Undershirt
</span><span>Underwear
</span><span>Shirt
</span><span>Pants
</span><span>Tie
</span><span>Shoes
</span><span>Belt
</span></code></pre><p>It kinda suggests lanes of parallelism, too. For example, you could hypothetically put socks, undershirt, and underwear at the same time. Granted, you&#39;d have to have some machine like in Wallace and Gromit in <em>The Wrong Trousers</em>, but that turned out so well for them! ðŸ˜†</p><p>On a more serious note, I&#39;ve used this to order tasks in projects in <a href="https://linear.app">Linear</a>. Combined with blocker relationships, it makes it clear to everyone which tasks should go first.</p></article></div>
