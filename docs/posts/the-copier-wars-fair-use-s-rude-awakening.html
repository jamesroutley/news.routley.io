You don’t have the right to charge for it.’”</span></p><p>Of course, churches weren’t the only institutions struggling with the complexities the copier created for its vendors. Also in this category were universities, which, as anyone who has paid hundreds of dollars for a textbook can tell you, suffer from a captive-audience problem that professors and students alike spent years trying to work around.</p><p>Whether the play is buying used books, purchasing books online at cheaper prices than in-person bookstores can offer, or “renting” books, there is a desire not to pay publishers tons of money for books that add significant costs to higher education. And copyright regulations, such as fair use and the first sale doctrine, were the cudgels that students, whether they realized it or not, were leveraging.</p><p>Also an important tool for cost-conscious students? Copy machines. Copiers made it possible to work around this system in a fair-use way. Here’s how: One student buys the book, then copies a single chapter—the only one on the syllabus. Someone makes a copy of the copy, and suddenly, the whole class has a copy. Heck, maybe the professor is the one that makes the copy. It doesn’t look as good as the original, but as long as they get the necessary information, does it really matter?</p><p>The answer to whether copying a textbook is fair use is somewhat complicated, but the short answer is essentially this: Yes, but only an excerpt. If you commandeered a copier for three hours to copy the whole thing, that wouldn’t be allowed.</p><p>The risk of such willing infringement, though, created a lasting problem. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, these suddenly ubiquitous machines became a liability for universities and the businesses that served them.</p><p>And the publishing industry, suddenly concerned that this was going to affect their bottom line, looked to legal action to resolve some of these issues.</p><p>One of the first conflicts of its kind emerged at New York University in the early ’80s, when numerous publishers—backed by the Association of American Publishers—sued the university, along with a handful of professors, for using copies as teaching materials. Eventually, the threat of legal action led to an agreement—the publishers would drop the suit if the school agreed to prudent copying limitations.</p><p><span>“We’re not out to hang faculty members from a lamppost and cut out all photocopying,” said Jon A. Baumgarten, a lawyer for the association, </span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/nyregion/publishers-and-nyu-settle-suit-on-colleges-photocopying-rights.html%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1712941478661480%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3ABTFUQvFPRTpZ7uNqQiCd&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1712941478678548&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gMAlI-8aiMCBJnZA5CIQX" rel="">in comments to </a><em><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/nyregion/publishers-and-nyu-settle-suit-on-colleges-photocopying-rights.html%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1712941478661737%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2MAzSA7_e7msKBgRX_agGJ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1712941478679187&amp;usg=AOvVaw1pH8IQdxu7uy6iuDWRitB3" rel="">The New York Times</a></em><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/nyregion/publishers-and-nyu-settle-suit-on-colleges-photocopying-rights.html%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1712941478661966%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3Pr6uMS-dDGkDmTPbWcT5X&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1712941478679671&amp;usg=AOvVaw19K9DZ-ZV0Ml3-KZtt3AqX" rel=""> in a 1983 article</a><span>. “The assumption is not that photocopying should be stopped, but that the rights of copyright owners should be respected.”</span></p><p>But the concern wasn’t just professors—also a major worry were nearby “copy shops,” which allowed students to copy to their heart’s content. One could imagine the model: A student buys a used book, goes to a copy shop, spends a few hours copying, then returns and sells the book back, saving lots of money in the process. Eventually, the bookstores realized they could cut out the middle man and do the copying themselves, which they then turned into a service called “course packs.” Professors eventually got in on the scheme, and boom, nobody has to buy the book this semester.</p><p>This model put a target on the back of these copy centers, and publishers—whether focused on books or periodicals—were ready to sue to protect their copyrights.</p><p>The most dramatic such case came about in the mid-1990s, when Michigan Document Services, a copy shop serving the University of Michigan, was sued by Princeton University Press and other publishers for offering a service that copied different books and other reading materials into inexpensive “course packs.” Unlike the NYU case, this one actually went to trial.</p><p><span>Eventually reaching the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, </span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/99/1381/639844/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1712941478662595%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3oo0koAmMQeqmDC8QBozbf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1712941478680280&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vSZDrZP2AL8NSBBKmOYC2" rel="">the court sided with the publishers</a><span>, finding the use case was not fair use, because Michigan Document Services was willfully copying materials for profit-making purposes—rather than what the Archdiocese of Chicago was doing, which was making copies for its own parishioners to sing.</span></p><p>But even that decision wasn’t cut and dry, with the ruling only coming after the full Sixth Circuit ruled on the case—an appellate panel originally favored the copy center, 2-1, meaning that things could have played out much differently.</p><p><span>The case, among others, helped give momentum to legal arguments against copy shops.
