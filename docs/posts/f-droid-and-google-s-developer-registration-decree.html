    <p>For the past <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/04/twif.html">15 years</a>, F-Droid
has provided a safe and secure haven for Android users around the world to
find and install free and open source apps. When contrasted with the
commercial app stores — of which the Google Play store is the most prominent
— the differences are stark: they are hotbeds of spyware and scams,
blatantly promoting apps that prey on their users through attempts to
monetize their attention and mine their intimate information through any
means necessary, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years">trickery and dark
patterns</a>.</p>

<p>F-Droid is different. It distributes apps that have been validated to work
<em>for</em> the user’s interests, rather than for the interests of the app’s
distributors. The way F-Droid works is simple: when a developer creates an
app and hosts the source code publicly somewhere, the F-Droid team reviews
it, inspecting it to ensure that it is completely open source and contains
no undocumented <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/"><em>anti-features</em></a>
such as advertisements or trackers. Once it passes inspection, the F-Droid
build service compiles and packages the app to make it ready for
distribution. The package is then signed either with F-Droid’s cryptographic
key, or, if the build is
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Reproducible_Builds/">reproducible</a>, enables
distribution using the original developer’s private key. In this way, users
can trust that any app distributed through F-Droid is the one that was built
from the specified source code and has not been tampered with.</p>

<p>Do you want a weather app that doesn’t <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/884233/your-weather-app-is-spying-on-you-heres-what-to-do/#why-are-weather-apps-such-a-privacy-nightmare">transmit your every
movement</a>
to a shadowy data broker? Or a scheduling assistant that doesn’t <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/online-behavioral-ads-fuel-surveillance-industry-heres-how">siphon
your intimate
details</a>
into an advertisement network? F-Droid has your back. Just as sunlight is
the best disinfectant against corruption, open source is the best defense
against software acting against the interests of the user.</p>

<h3 id="googles-move-to-break-free-app-distribution">Google’s move to break free app distribution</h3>

<p>The future of this elegant and proven system was put in jeopardy last month,
when Google unilaterally
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">decreed</a>
that Android developers everywhere in the world are going to be required to
register centrally with Google. In addition to demanding payment of a
registration fee and agreement to their (non-negotiable and ever-changing)
terms and conditions, Google will also require the <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#verify-your-identity">uploading of personally
identifying
documents</a>,
including government ID, by the authors of the software, as well as
<a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#register-your-apps">enumerating</a>
all the unique “application identifiers” for every app that is to be
distributed by the registered developer.</p>

<p>The F-Droid project cannot require that developers register their apps
through Google, but at the same time, we cannot “take over” the application
identifiers for the open-source apps we distribute, as that would
effectively seize exclusive distribution rights to those applications.</p>

<p>If it were to be put into effect, the developer registration decree will end
the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app distribution sources as
we know them today, and the world will be deprived of the safety and
security of the catalog of thousands of apps that can be trusted and
verified by any and all. F-Droid’s myriad users will be left adrift, with no
means to install — or even update their existing installed —
applications. (How many F-Droid users are there, exactly? We don’t know,
because we don’t track users or have any registration: <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html">“No user accounts,
by design”</a>)</p>

<h3 id="the-security-canard">The Security Canard</h3>

<p>While directly installing — or “sideloading” — software can be construed as
carrying some inherent risk, it is false to claim that centralized app
stores are the only safe option for software distribution. Google Play
itself has
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/09/224-malicious-apps-removed-from-the-google-play-store-after-ad-fraud-campaign-discovered">repeatedly</a>
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/apps_android_malware/">hosted</a>
malware, proving that corporate gatekeeping doesn’t guarantee user
protection. By contrast, F-Droid offers a trustworthy and transparent
alternative approach to security: every app is free and open source, the
code can be audited by anyone, the build process and logs are public, and
reproducible builds ensure that what is published matches the source code
exactly. This transparency and accountability provides a <em>stronger</em> basis
for trust than closed platforms, while still giving users freedom to
choose. Restricting direct app installation not only undermines that choice,
it also erodes the diversity and resilience of the open-source ecosystem by
consolidating control in the hands of a few corporate players.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Google’s framing that they need to mandate developer
registration in order to defend against malware is disingenuous because they
<em>already</em> have a remediation mechanism for malware they identify on a
device: the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853">Play Protect
service</a> that is
enabled on all Android Certified devices already scans and disables apps
that have been identified as malware, regardless of their provenience. Any
perceived risks associated with direct app installation can be mitigated
through user education, open-source transparency, and existing security
measures without imposing exclusionary registration requirements.</p>

<p>We do not believe that developer registration is motivated by security. We
believe it is about consolidating power and tightening control over a
formerly open ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="the-right-to-run">The Right to Run</h3>

<p>If you own a computer, you should have the right to run whatever programs
you want on it. This is just as true with the apps on your Android/iPhone
mobile device as it is with the applications on your Linux/Mac/Windows
desktop or server. Forcing software creators into a centralized registration
scheme in order to publish and distribute their works is as egregious as
forcing writers and artists to register with a central authority in order to
be able to distribute their creative works. It is an offense to the core
principles of free speech and thought that are central to the workings of
democratic societies around the world.</p>

<p>By tying application identifiers to personal ID checks and fees, Google is
building a choke point that restricts competition and limits user
freedom. It must find a solution which preserves user rights, freedom of
choice, and a healthy, competitive ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-propose">What do we propose?</h3>

<p>Regulatory and competition authorities should look carefully at Google’s
proposed activities, and ensure that policies designed to improve security
are not abused to consolidate monopoly control. We urge regulators to
safeguard the ability of alternative app stores and open-source projects to
operate freely, and to protect developers who cannot or will not comply with
exclusionary registration schemes and demands for personal information.</p>

<p>If you are a developer or user who values digital freedom, you can
help. Write to your <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home">Member of
Parliament</a>,
<a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative">Congressperson</a>
or other representative, sign petitions in defense of sideloading and
software freedom, and
<a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/contact-dma-team_en">contact</a> the
European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) team to express why
preserving open distribution matters. By making your voice heard, you help
defend not only F-Droid, but the principle that software should remain a
commons, accessible and free from unnecessary corporate gatekeeping.</p>
