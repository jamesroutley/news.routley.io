<p>The ever-escalating game of cat-and-mouse between YouTube, ad blockers, and users has reached a point where it can no longer be ignored, with YouTube making it impossible for some users with adblockers installed to watch videos, and adblock developers and their users constantly updating their tactics to continue blocking ads on YouTube. </p><p>Over the last few months, people using ad blockers have been getting these popups from YouTube: </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/11/8bsp6n4k11xb1.webp" alt="&#34;Ad blockers violate YouTube&#39;s Terms of Service. It looks like you may be using an ad blocker.&#34; " loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1322" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/8bsp6n4k11xb1.webp 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/8bsp6n4k11xb1.webp 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/11/8bsp6n4k11xb1.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Screenshots: uBlock Origin via Reddit</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube has been rolling these out to different users at different times, so there hasn’t been a single day of ad-block apocalypse, instead, it’s been a constantly-evolving problem that is affecting millions of people at different times. This, as app developer Zhenyi Tan <a href="https://andadinosaur.com/youtube-s-anti-adblock-and-ublock-origin?ref=404media.co">wrote in an excellent blog this week</a>, has had the effect of confusing people, who have flooded Reddit, social media, and ad block review sites with differing information, because certain versions of certain ad blockers continue to work for some people, but not others. </p><p>AdGuard cofounder Andrey Meshkov told 404 Media that what YouTube is doing is “technically, nothing too special compared to what we&#39;ve seen in the past from others. The difference is the scale. YouTube is huge and video ads are especially annoying, this is what makes this case interesting.”  </p><p>“Generally speaking, they&#39;re employing a standard adblock wall tactic: try to detect an ad blocker and if it is detected, show a popup that prompts users to disable their ad blocker,” he added. “There are several versions of these pop-ups, their testing is clearly still in-progress. However, the share of affected users is growing so we can safely assume that eventually they&#39;re going to launch it for all YouTube users.”</p>

<p>YouTube’s ever-changing ad block detector scripts, which have become so sensitive as to detect certain pieces of privacy-protecting software that are not actually adblockers, are facing a privacy complaint with Ireland’s Data Protection Committee (DPC), <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/26/privacy_advocate_challenges_youtube/?ref=404media.co">The Register reported last week</a>. </p><p><strong>“</strong>The use of ad blockers violate YouTube’s Terms of Service. We’ve launched a global effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14129599?ref=404media.co">allow ads on YouTube</a> or try YouTube Premium for an ad free experience,” a YouTube spokesperson told 404 Media. “Ads support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube. We will of course cooperate fully with any questions or queries from the DPC.”</p><p>YouTube added that it has started putting these popups to inform viewers about its terms of service, and said it would only disable playback if users ignore repeated requests to allow ads on YouTube.</p><p>Meanwhile, every major adblocker and its user base has started to talk almost exclusively about YouTube’s escalations, and have been working on mitigations to stay one step ahead. The ad block saga has also become the main topic of conversation on the YouTube subreddit and a popular topic on YouTube itself. The uBlock Origin team has been updating a “filter” that evades detection from YouTube and posting mega threads about the situation on its subreddit every couple days, the latest of which notes that “YouTube changes their detection scripts twice a day, which means that even if you got a filter update earlier today, another one might be required soon. There’s no way around this if you want to remain logged in.”</p><p>Users of uBlock Origin created a website that <a href="https://drhyperion451.github.io/does-uBO-bypass-yt/?ref=404media.co">tracks the state of the adblock war</a>, called “Is uBlock updated to the last Anti-Adblocker YouTube script? YES or NO”</p><div><p>🫥</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about Google&#39;s relationship with ad blockers? I would love to hear from you.

Otherwise, send me an email at jason@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>uBlock Origin has been tweaking itself multiple times a day, and the software’s GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases?ref=404media.co">shows multiple new versions over the last few days</a>. The developers of the software also wrote lengthy instructions on how to make sure the software continues to work on YouTube, are troubleshooting for individual users in Reddit comments, and are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/17j6ygs/youtube_antiadblock_and_ads_october_29_2023_mega/?ref=404media.co">providing detailed information</a> about the steps YouTube has been taking to try to stop their software from working.</p><p>At the moment, uBlock Origin seems to be putting up the strongest fight against Google’s ad blocker detectors, which is particularly notable considering that the software is currently being updated on GitHub by exactly two people (though more people are handling customer service), and Google is one of the largest companies in the world. Even more impressive, uBlock Origin has no funding of any sort and as a rule does not even accept donations from its users. Members of the uBlock Origin team told me that they do not want to speak to the press about “such a sensitive topic,” and that all communication about the issue will be done publicly on its GitHub or on Reddit.</p><p>AdGuard is another major adblocker that <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/releases?ref=404media.co">updated its software</a> to evade YouTube’s detectors, and said in a blog post that YouTube is waging a “war against ad blockers.”</p><p>“YouTube’s plan to purge ad blocking users from its platform will not go down well with either users or ad blockers, who will undoubtedly push back,” AdGuard wrote <a href="https://adguard.com/en/blog/ad-blockers-youtube-ban.html?ref=404media.co">in a blog post</a>. “As YouTube widens up its crackdown, ad blocker developers won’t sit idly by, but will try to come up with solutions that would allow them to evade YouTube’s detection — a process that might take some time.”</p><blockquote>Google has its hands on quite literally every aspect of this entire saga as a vertically integrated adtech giant. Most adblockers are browser extensions that are most widely used on Chrome, which is a Google product and the most popular browser in the world. They are being used to block ads sold by Google, the largest ad company in the world. And they are specifically being used to block ads on YouTube, a Google-owned website that is also one of the largest websites on Earth. </blockquote><p>Meshkov said that AdGuard’s paid, network-level filtering product has not been affected, but its free browser extension has been. “Browser extensions are also capable of mitigating the issue, but YouTube constantly changes their detection algorithm and there still will be a period of time when the users will see that adblock wall pop-up as filters maintainers need time to figure out the new algorithm.”</p><p>Ghostery has <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/blog/whats-happening-with-youtube-ads?ref=404media.co">also written blog posts about the problem</a>, and how they are addressing it (by working to update their software, basically). Stephen Ray, a mod on the Brave browser forums (but not a Brave employee), told users <a href="https://community.brave.com/t/psa-youtube-adblock-detection/510337?ref=404media.co">in a Brave community note</a>: “Every web browser and adblock is encountering this message. Nobody will be immune. That said, Brave is keeping up and slightly ahead. Switching to Firefox, Vivaldi, or whatever else won’t save you. Neither will using uBlock Origin, AdBlock, Undetectable Adblocker, or any of the bunch of things out there.”</p><p>This brings me, I think, to the elephant in the room, which is the fact that Google has its hands on quite literally every aspect of this entire saga as a vertically integrated adtech giant. Most adblockers are browser extensions that are most widely used on Chrome, which is a Google product and the most popular browser in the world. They are being used to block ads sold by Google, the largest ad company in the world. And they are specifically being used to block ads on YouTube, a Google-owned website that is also one of the largest websites on Earth. </p><p>Adblock software can be distributed outside of the Chrome Web Store, but the fact remains that Google can and does ban specific extensions and classes of extensions from the Chrome Web Store (cryptomining extensions are banned, for example). There was some protracted worry about something called Manifest V3, which is a framework for how extensions function on Chrome. </p><p>Major adblocking companies and software developers <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/blog/manifest-v3-the-ghostery-perspective?ref=404media.co">said that Manifest V3</a> would make it harder for their extensions to function and would restrict their capabilities, and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening?ref=404media.co">Electronic Frontier Foundation called it</a> “another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.” Full rollout of Manifest V3 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw1eIaRuy7w&amp;ref=404media.co">has been delayed indefinitely</a>, Google said earlier this month.</p><p>This extreme power over the adtech and online advertising ecosystem is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies?ref=404media.co">one of the subjects of an FTC antitrust</a> suit against Google. </p><p>Google’s influence over the adblocking industry (not just the advertising industry) is <a href="https://www.magiclasso.co/insights/google-undermines-adblock/?ref=404media.co">controversial</a> among ad block developers. </p><p>Google <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-saved-an-estimated-887-million-by-paying-adblock-plus-to-show-its-ads-2013-8?ref=404media.co">famously paid AdBlock Plus</a> to serve ads to its users, and AdBlock Plus has experimented with “<a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/google-ends-partnership-adblock-plus-partner-acceptable-ads-marketplace-173485/?ref=404media.co">acceptable ads</a>” to deliver to its users. AdBlock Plus’s parent company, Eyeo, just <a href="https://adfilteringdevsummit.com/public/-NXuG6IckpLeVt7jyeIm?ref=404media.co">threw the Ad Filtering Dev Summit</a>, a conference about ad blocking. Google was one of the sponsors. </p><p>Adblock Plus, meanwhile, wrote <a href="https://blog.adblockplus.org/blog/whats-happening-with-youtube-ads?ref=404media.co">a blog about the problem</a> and the first words on its <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb/related?ref=404media.co">Chrome Store description</a> is “Block YouTube ads.” </p><p>“YouTube’s walls are particularly distressing to many of our users,” Adblock Plus wrote. “While we don’t have a solution to implement at the moment, our teams are working hard to figure out what we can do in light of these changes. We certainly haven’t given up the fight against anti-ad blocking!” </p><blockquote>&#34;Who will win? I don&#39;t know. YouTube certainly has the capability and resources for that, but on the other hand we&#39;ve seen the example of Facebook trying to circumvent ad blocking and they gave up in the end despite also having unlimited resources.”</blockquote><p>An Eyeo spokesperson told 404 Media, however, that for them, it’s less of a fight and more of a negotiation: “Eyeo has currently been witnessing what appears to be a series of tests with different cohorts rather than YouTube making a sweeping change. As always, we are interested in finding a middle ground that&#39;s user-centric, where people regain control over their experience, but also allows content creators and publishers to get rewarded for their content. We are talking to all the different parties involved and hope to have updates to share with users soon.” </p><p>So, how does this end up? It depends on how much Google actually cares about this issue. Early indications are that it cares a lot. </p><p>“Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet here,” AdGuard’s Meshkov said. “It all depends on the resources that YouTube is ready to invest. Both YouTube and filters maintainers will try to keep up with each other&#39;s pace. We should also not forget that there will be collateral damage (different other extensions like privacy badger, browsers like Brave, etc.) so for the YouTube side minimizing this collateral damage will be rather expensive. Who will win? I don&#39;t know. YouTube certainly has the capability and resources for that, but on the other hand we&#39;ve seen the example of Facebook trying to circumvent ad blocking and they gave up in the end despite also having unlimited resources.”</p>
