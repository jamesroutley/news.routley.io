    <h1>Remote Code Execution in Marvel Rivals Game</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>Security vulnerabilities in online games aren&#39;t just theoretical - they happen more often than you&#39;d think. Recently, I discovered a <strong>Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit</strong> in Marvel Rivals that could allow an attacker on the same network to run arbitrary code on another player&#39;s device.</p><h2 id="the-elephant">The Elephant</h2><p>The issue is the game uses remote code execution for their hotfix patching system - but <strong>the game doesn&#39;t verify that it&#39;s connected to the real game server</strong>, and the cherry on top is that <strong>the game runs with admin privileges for the sake of anti-cheat.</strong></p><p>This type of exploit, known as Remote Code Execution (RCE), is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities a game can have. It means an attacker could potentially run harmful commands on your PC without your knowledge - just by being connected to the same Wi-Fi.</p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><p>Watch my breakdown of the exploit and why game security matters</p><iframe width="50%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/sSXoH1xYIcE"></iframe><h2 id="ps5-implications">PS5 Implications</h2><p>This also opens the door up to an entrypoint on PS5. You can see the POC here - <a href="https://youtu.be/IDxUaIvVxmY">https://youtu.be/IDxUaIvVxmY</a></p><h2 id="other-rant">Other Rant</h2><p>Game developers continue to amaze me at their lack of security awareness.</p><p>In the past year, I&#39;ve found at least 5 critical bugs in VERY POPULAR games that can have a negative impact on the entire player base. 3 of them still exist, because either the game dev isn&#39;t reachable, or the game dev just straight up doesn&#39;t care. Cool, right?</p><p>It&#39;s very hard for security researchers to report bugs to most game dev companies. On top of that, most do not have bug bounty programs. It is a huge shame, and it encourages people looking into video game security to not report vulnerabilities and only create hacks and bots, because that&#39;s where the money is. Thank you to those game devs that do have successful bug bounty programs!</p><h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2><p>AeonLucid, LukeFZ, nitro, and sanktanglia all helped with the network crypto and helped out.</p></div></div>
