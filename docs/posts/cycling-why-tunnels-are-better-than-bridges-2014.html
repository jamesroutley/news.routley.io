    <h1>Cycling: Why Tunnels are Better than Bridges (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><ul>
<li>Tunnels offer faster journeys than bridges due to less climbing. Steeper gradients can be used than with a bridge because cyclists going into a tunnel first ride downhill and pick up speed which can be used to climb back out of the tunnel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tunnels have a smaller height difference than bridges. Only need clearance for the height of a cyclist, not for trucks or trains plus electric lines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tunnels take up less space than a bridge because inclines are shorter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tunnels are easier to fit into an existing landscape.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tunnels offer protection from wind and rain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A possible disadvantage is low social safety. It is important that cyclists can see out of a tunnel before they enter it. There should be no turns within the tunnel, no-where for a potential mugger to hide. Obviously tunnels should also be well lit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Picture: All crossings in Assen [The Netherlands] can be used without slowing down. This is one of the many cycle and pedestrian crossings of a major road. Four metre wide cycle-path, separate pedestrian path, gentle inclines, well lit and we can see right through for good social safety. Built in the 1970s, well maintained: last resurfaced 2012.</p>
