    <h1>Iceland declares ocean-current instability a national security risk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Iceland has classified the potential collapse of a major Atlantic current system as a national security threat, citing new scientific warnings that such a change could radically alter the country’s climate and economy. Officials say the risk represents an “existential” challenge that demands a coordinated, top-level response.</p>

			

<p>Iceland has taken the rare step of treating a climate-linked ocean threat as a matter of national survival, launching a coordinated government response to one of the most feared potential tipping points in the climate system.</p>







<h2>Security shift in Reykjavík</h2>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/15/climate/iceland-warming-current-amoc-collapse-threat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a></em>, Iceland’s National Security Council formally labelled the possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) a national security risk in September — the first time the country has applied such a designation to a climate impact.</p>







<p>Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Iceland’s minister for environment, energy and climate, said the risks extend far beyond weather. </p>




<p>“Our climate, economy and security are deeply tied to the stability of the ocean currents around us,” he told <em>CNN</em>.</p>



<p>He later described the threat as “an existential threat,” warning that a breakdown could disrupt transport, damage infrastructure and hit the country’s fishing industry.</p>



<h2>Why the AMOC matters</h2>



<p>The AMOC — often compared to a giant conveyor belt — carries warm water northward before it cools and sinks, helping regulate weather across the Atlantic basin. </p>



<p><em>CNN </em>reported that scientists increasingly worry that warming temperatures and disrupted salinity levels are slowing the system.</p>



<p>Some studies suggest a tipping point could be reached this century, though the exact timeline remains uncertain.</p>




<p>Stefan Rahmstorf, an oceanographer at Potsdam University, told <em>CNN </em>that a collapse “cannot be considered a low likelihood risk anymore.” </p>



<p>The consequences, he said, would be dramatic: surging sea levels along US and European coasts, major monsoon disruptions across Africa and Asia, and a deep freeze across parts of Europe.</p>



<p>For Iceland, he said, the country “would be close to the center of a serious regional cooling,” with sea ice potentially surrounding the island.</p>



<h2>Preparing for the worst</h2>



<p>The security designation means Iceland will now pursue a high-level, cross-government effort to analyse the threat and consider how to manage or reduce the consequences. Jóhannsson said the decision </p>



<p>“reflects the seriousness of the issue and ensures that the matter gets the attention it deserves.”</p>




<p>Rahmstorf praised Iceland’s stance, telling <em>CNN </em>that other nations should treat the risk with similar urgency.</p>



<p>Jóhannsson said the country is confronting a stark possibility: “What we do know is that the current climate might change so drastically that it could become impossible for us to adapt… this is not just a scientific concern — it’s a matter of national survival and security.” </p>
