    <h1>We&#39;re migrating many of our servers from Linux to FreeBSD</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>I&#39;ve been a Linux (or GNU/Linux, for the purists) user since 1996. I&#39;ve been a FreeBSD user since 2002. I have always successfully used both operating systems, each for specific purposes. I have found, on average, BSD systems to be more stable than their Linux equivalents. By stability, I don&#39;t mean uptime (too much uptime means too few kernel security updates, which is wrong). I mean that things work as they should, that they don&#39;t &#34;break&#34; from one update to the next, and that you don&#39;t have to revise everything because of a missing or modified basic command.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been for development and innovation as long as it doesn&#39;t (necessarily, automatically and unreasonably) break everything that is already in place. And the road that the various Linux distributions are taking seems to be that of modifying things that work just for the sake of it or to follow the diktats of the Kernel and those who manage it - but not only.</p><p>Some time ago we started a complex, continuous and not always linear operation, that is to migrate, where possible, most of the servers (ours and of our customers) from Linux to FreeBSD.</p><p><em>Why FreeBSD?</em></p><p>There are many alternative operating systems to Linux and the *BSD family is varied and complete. <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, in my opinion, today is the &#34;all rounder&#34; system par excellence, i.e. well refined and suitable both for use on large servers and small embedded systems. The other BSDs have strengths that, in some fields, make them particularly suitable but FreeBSD, in my humble opinion, is suitable (almost) for every purpose.</p><p>So back to the main topic of this article, why am I migrating many of the servers we manage to FreeBSD? The reasons are many, I will list some of them with corresponding explanations.</p><h2 id="the-system-is-consistentkernel-and-userland-are-created-and-managed-by-the-same-team">The system is consistent - kernel and userland are created and managed by the same team</h2><p>In other words, in FreeBSD there is no need to &#34; revolutionise&#34; everything every few years and changes are made primarily in the form of additions that can enrich (and not break) each update. If a modification was to change the way it interacts with network devices, ifconfig would be modified to take advantage of that and remain compatible with the &#34;old&#34; syntax. In the long-term, this kind of approach is definitely appreciated by system administrators who find themselves with a linear, consistent, and always well-documented update path.</p><h2 id="freebsd-development-is-still-driven-by-technical-interests-not-strictly-commercial-ones">FreeBSD development is (still) driven by technical interests, not strictly commercial ones.</h2><p>Even FreeBSD has big companies behind it, collaborating in a more or less direct way. The license is more permissive, so not everyone who uses it commercially contributes to it, but knowing that FreeBSD is <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2019/fosdem/looney-netflix_and_freebsd/">at the base of Netflix CDNs</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22028689">Whatsapp servers</a> (waiting for Meta to replace them, for internal coherence reasons, with Linux servers), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4_system_software">Sony Playstations</a> and, in part, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/BSD/BSD.html">macOS, iOS, iPadOS, etc.</a> surely gives confidence on its level. These realities, however, do not have enough clout to drive the development of the core team.</p><h2 id="linux-has-docker-podman-lxc-lxd-etc-but-freebsd-has-jails">Linux has Docker, Podman, lxc, lxd, etc. but... FreeBSD has jails!</h2><h2 id="linux-has-ext4-xfs-btrfs-and-zfs-but-with-some-manual-intervention-freebsd-has-ufs2-and-zfs">Linux has ext4, xfs, btrfs... (and zfs, but with some manual intervention). FreeBSD has UFS2 and ZFS</h2><h2 id="the-freebsd-boot-procedure-is-cleaner-and-simpler">The FreeBSD boot procedure is cleaner and simpler.</h2><h2 id="freebsds-network-stack-is-still-superior-to-linuxsand-often-so-is-its-performance">FreeBSD&#39;s network stack is (still) superior to Linux&#39;s - and, often, so is its performance.</h2><h2 id="straightforward-system-performance-analysis">Straightforward system performance analysis</h2><h2 id="bhyve-is-more-incomplete-but-more-efficient-than-kvm">Bhyve is more incomplete (but more efficient) than KVM</h2><p>Will I abandon Linux for FreeBSD? Obviously not, just as I haven&#39;t for the last 20 years. Both have their uses, their space, their strengths. But if up to now I have had 80% Linux and 20% FreeBSD, the perspective is to invert the percentages of use and, where possible, directly implement solutions based on FreeBSD.</p><p><em>NOTE: this article has been translated from its <a href="https://www.dragas.net/posts/perche-migrare-i-server-da-linux-a-freebsd/">Italian original version</a>.
