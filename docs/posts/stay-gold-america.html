My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn&#39;t forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. </p><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These <a href="https://uvaro.com/blog/college-costs-vs-inflation-1982-present?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">huge cost increases</a> for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.</p><figure><a href="https://uvaro.com/blog/college-costs-vs-inflation-1982-present?ref=blog.codinghorror.com"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="675" height="700" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/image-6.png 675w"/></a></figure><p>Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183923/http://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">in 2008</a> when we built <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a>, a Q&amp;A website for programmers creating a shared <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Creative Commons</a> knowledge base for the world.

I earned millions of dollars. I thought that was the final part of the American Dream. But it wasn&#39;t.</p><p>I recently attended a theater performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">The Outsiders</a> at my son&#39;s public high school. All I really knew was the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46JMzVzSB4&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">&#34;stay gold&#34; line</a> from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. </blockquote><p>I <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/" rel="noreferrer">believe deeply</a> in sharing The American Dream. It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjzZh6-h9fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jimi Hendrix - The Star Spangled Banner [ National Anthem ] ( Live at Woodstock 1969 )"></iframe></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">enough of us voted</a> for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don&#39;t understand.</p><figure><a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfe_wqbzOe_elPxK-9TqRLDAxtI2Qrd8GHAtxqtJ8DvQ87d69tFasQnClpWuRYvDP-Iofd-PDkfpQU5RayMlyDo2rlVZWzfacm-kr1aM8fZprnh_1XXkpbr63MbGUpiNNaibPmxVQ?key=gIYEBDEiC9EgZC24CSOXGvAl" alt="" loading="lazy" width="661" height="573"/></a></figure><p>34% of adults in America <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-2024-our-very-complicated-democracy/election-2024-why-americans-dont-vote-episode-6.html?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">did not exercise their right to vote</a>.

The 7.6% that are ineligible to vote are mostly adults living in America who have not managed to attain citizenship, or people <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">convicted of a felony</a>. Whatever the reasons, 42% of adults living in America had no say in the 2024 election. The vote <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">failed to represent everyone</a>.</p><p>I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively <em>keeping America fair for everyone</em>. Our status as the <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">world&#39;s leading democracy</a> is in question.

<p>Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:</p><ul><li>We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.</li><li>We could fund nonprofits that have a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/our-methodology/ratings/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">proven track record</a> of protecting democratic institutions.</li><li>We could found a new organization loosely based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">RAND Corporation</a>, but modernized like <a href="https://www.leverforchange.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Lever for Change</a>. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for <em>everyone,</em> working within the current system or outside it.</li><li>All states are shades of purple, not fully red or blue. We have <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50343-national-policy-proposals-with-bipartisan-support?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">more in common on specific policies</a> than we realize. It would be very difficult to draw borders if we split. I know what divorce feels like, and we don&#39;t want this. Let&#39;s come together <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com">through our shared American Dream</a>. </li><li>We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs.

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote>The Fermi Paradox is a contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, such as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation?ref=codinghorror.obox.agency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Drake equation</a>, and lack of any evidence for such civilizations.</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<blockquote>To me, this is a compelling argument, in the same way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel?ref=blog.codinghorror.com#Absence_of_time_travelers_from_the_future" rel="noreferrer">the lack of evidence of any time travellers</a> is:</blockquote><blockquote>Many have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers.</blockquote><p>It seems, to me at least, clear evidence that time travel is not possible, given the enormous amount of time behind us. Something, somewhere, would certainly have invented it by now... right?</p><p>So if not, what happened? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Great Filter</a> maybe?</p><blockquote>The Great Filter theory says that at some point from pre-life to Type III intelligence, there’s a wall that all or nearly all attempts at life hit.

And <em>faster</em>. And so does intelligent life. </p><blockquote>Why build planet-size anything when the real action is in the small things? Small spaces, small units of time, <strong>everything gets smaller</strong>.</blockquote><p>Large is inefficient and unnecessary. Look at the history of computers: from giant to tiny and tinier. From slow to fast and faster. Personally, I have a feeling really advanced life eventually does away with all physical stuff that slows you down as soon as they can, and enters <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-infinite-space-between-words/" rel="noreferrer">the infinite spaces between</a>:</p><blockquote>This is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don’t see clues to widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that we’re alone. But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence. <strong>It could be that it’s the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable.</strong> This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be – and this is, of course, speculation – that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build nanobots instead.</blockquote><p>Seth delivers an excellent TED talk on this topic as well:</p><figure></figure><p>If we can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">barely see far in the universe as is</a>, there&#39;s no way we could possibly see into the infinite space and time between.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJTU48_yghs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Her Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson Movie HD"></iframe></figure><p>That is of course just my opinion, but <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/her?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">we&#39;ll see</a>.. eventually.</p>

        <p>If you haven&#39;t been able to keep up with my blistering pace of one blog post per year, I don&#39;t blame you. There&#39;s a lot going on right now. It&#39;s a busy time. But let&#39;s pause and take a moment to celebrate that Elon Musk destroyed Twitter. I <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/god-did-us-a-favor-by-destroying-twitter/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">can&#39;t possibly say it better than Paul Ford</a> so I&#39;ll just refer you there:</p><blockquote>Every five or six minutes, someone in the social sciences publishes a PDF with a title like “Humans 95 Percent Happier in Small Towns, Waving at Neighbors and Eating Sandwiches.” When we gather in groups of more than, say, eight, it’s a disaster. Yet there is something fundamental in our nature that desperately wants to get everyone together in one big room, to “solve it.” Our smarter, richer betters (in Babel times, the king’s name was Nimrod) often preach the idea of a town square, a marketplace of ideas, a centralized hub of discourse and entertainment—and we listen. But when I go back and read Genesis, I hear God saying: “My children, I designed your brains to scale to 150 stable relationships. Anything beyond that is overclocking. You should all try Mastodon.”</blockquote><p>It&#39;s been clear for quite some time that the early social media strategery of &#34;jam a million people in a colosseum and let them fight it out with free speech&#34; isn&#39;t panning out, but never has it been more clear than now, under the Elon Musk regime, that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-isnt-funny-bad-jokes-twitter-1234712950/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">being beholden to the whims of a billionaire going through a midlife crisis</a> isn&#39;t exactly healthy for society. Or you. Or me. Or anyone, really.</p><p>I tried to be fair; I gave the post-Elon Twitter era a week, thinking &#34;how bad could it possibly be?&#34; and good lord, <em>it was so much worse than I could have possibly ever imagined</em>. It&#39;s like Elon read the Dilbert pointy-haired-manager book on management and bonked his head on every rung of the ladder going down, generating an ever-growing <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-terrible-things-hes-said-and-done?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">laundry list of terrible things no manager should ever do</a>. And he <em>kept going!</em></p><p>It&#39;s undeniably sad. I really liked Twitter, warts and all, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/twitter-service-vs-platform/" rel="noreferrer">from 2007 onward</a>. In fact, it was the only &#34;social network&#34; I liked at all. Even when it became clear in the Trump era that Twitter was unhealthy for human minds, I soldiered on, gleaning what I could. I&#39;m not alone in that; Clay Shirky&#39;s moribund signoff at the end of 2022 reflected how I felt:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1348" height="1495" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/image.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/image.png 1348w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Indeed, Twitter was murdered at the whims of a billionaire high on Ketamine while it was (mostly) healthy, <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/elon-musk-x-twitter-purchase-daughter-jenna-musk-woke-virus?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">because of the &#34;trans woke virus&#34;</a>.  </p><p>I urge you, all of you, <strong>to disavow Twitter and never look at it again</strong>. No one who cares about their mental health should be on Twitter at this point, or linking to Twitter and feeding it the attention it thrives on. We should entomb Twitter deep in concrete with this public warning on its capstone:</p><figure><img src="https://media.infosec.exchange/infosec.exchange/media_attachments/files/110/240/386/903/991/473/original/d3ff3462bf229383.png" alt="This place is not a place of honor...no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here ...nothing valued is here." loading="lazy"/></figure><p>In the end, I begrudgingly realized, as did Paul Ford, that Elon unwittingly did us a favor by killing Twitter. He demonstrated <strong>the very real dangers of any platform run by a king, a dictator, a tyrant, a despot, an autocrat</strong>. You can have all your content rug-pulled out from under you at any time, or watch in horror as your favorite bar... slowly transforms into a nazi bar. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1363" height="1920" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/image-1.png 1363w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>I&#39;ve been saying for a long time that decentralization is the way to go. We can and should have sane centralized services, of course, but <strong>it&#39;s imperative that we <em>also</em> build decentralized services which empower users and give them control</strong>, rather than treating them <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/are-you-a-digital-sharecropper/" rel="noreferrer">like digital sharecroppers</a>. That&#39;s what our <a href="https://discourse.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Discourse project</a> is all about. I propose collective ownership of the content and the communities we build online. Yeah, it&#39;s more work, it&#39;s not &#34;free&#34; (sorry not sorry), but I have some uncomfortable news for you: those so-called &#34;free&#34; services <em>aren&#39;t really free</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2014/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b01a3fcc55683970b-800wi.png" alt="Geek-and-poke-pigs-free" loading="lazy"/></figure><p>Which, again, is not to say that &#34;free&#34; services don&#39;t have a place in the world, they do, but please don&#39;t harbor any illusions about what you are sacrificing in the name of &#34;free&#34;. Grow up.</p><p>I take a rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Tron-like</a> view of the world when it comes to this stuff; in the software industry, our goal should be to <em>empower</em> users (with strong moderation tools), not exploit them. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="504" height="640"/></figure><p>So I encourage you to explore alternatives to Twitter, ideally open source, federated alternatives. Is it messy? <em>Hell yes it&#39;s messy</em>. But so is democracy; it&#39;s worth the work, because it&#39;s the only survivable long term path forward. Anything worth doing is never <em>easy</em>.</p><p>I&#39;m currently on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Mastodon</a>, an open source, federated Twitter alternative at <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@codinghorror?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">https://infosec.exchange/@codinghorror</a> – I urge you to join me on the Mastodon server of your choice, or quite literally <em>any other platform</em> besides Twitter. Really, whatever works for you. Pick what you like. Help make it better for everyone.</p><p>To inspire that leap of faith, I am currently auctioning off, with all funds to benefit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trevor_Project?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">the Trevor Project</a> which offers assistance to LGBTQ youth, these 10 museum quality brass plaques of what I consider to be the best tweet of all time, hands down:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/IMG_3328.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1134" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/IMG_3328.jpg 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/IMG_3328.jpg 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/IMG_3328.jpg 1600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/IMG_3328.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>(Blissfully, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Horse_ebooks?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">@horse_ebooks is also on Mastodon</a>.
