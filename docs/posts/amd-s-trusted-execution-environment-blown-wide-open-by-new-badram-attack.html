    <h1>AMD&#39;s trusted execution environment blown wide open by new BadRAM attack</h1>

<p>If a VM has been backdoored, the cryptographic <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/attestation-confidential-computing">attestation</a> will fail and immediately alert the VM admin of the compromise. Or at least that’s how SEV-SNP is designed to work. BadRAM is an attack that a server admin can carry out in minutes, using either about $10 of hardware, or in some cases, software only, to cause DDR4 or DDR5 memory modules to misreport during bootup the amount of memory capacity they have. From then on, SEV-SNP will be permanently made to suppress the cryptographic hash attesting its integrity even when the VM has been badly compromised.</p>
<p>“BadRAM completely undermines trust in AMD&#39;s latest Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV-SNP) technology, which is widely deployed by major cloud providers, including Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure,” members of the research team wrote in an email. “BadRAM for the first time studies the security risks of bad RAM—rogue memory modules that deliberately provide false information to the processor during startup. We show how BadRAM attackers can fake critical remote attestation reports and insert undetectable backdoors into _any_ SEV-protected VM.”</p>
<h2>Compromising the AMD SEV ecosystem</h2>
<p>On a <a href="https://badram.eu/">website</a> providing more information about the attack, the researchers wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Modern computers increasingly use encryption to protect sensitive data in DRAM, especially in shared cloud environments with pervasive data breaches and insider threats. AMD&#39;s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a cutting-edge technology that protects privacy and trust in cloud computing by encrypting a virtual machine&#39;s (VM&#39;s) memory and isolating it from advanced attackers, even those compromising critical infrastructure like the virtual machine manager or firmware.</p>
<p>We found that tampering with the embedded SPD chip on commercial DRAM modules allows attackers to bypass SEV protections—including AMD’s latest SEV-SNP version. For less than $10 in off-the-shelf equipment, we can trick the processor into allowing access to encrypted memory. We build on this BadRAM attack primitive to completely compromise the AMD SEV ecosystem, faking remote attestation reports and inserting backdoors into any SEV-protected VM.</p>
<p>In response to a vulnerability report filed by the researchers, AMD has already shipped patches to affected customers, a company spokesperson said. The researchers say there are no performance penalties, other than the possibility of additional time required during boot up. The BadRAM vulnerability is tracked in the industry as CVE-2024-21944 and AMD-SB-3015 by the chipmaker.</p></blockquote>

<h2>A stroll down memory lane</h2>
<p>Modern dynamic random access memory for servers typically comes in the form of DIMMs, short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMM">Dual In-Line Memory Modules</a>. The basic building block of these rectangular sticks are capacitors, which, when charged, represent a binary 1 and, when discharged, represent a 0. The capacitors are organized into cells, which are organized into arrays of rows and columns, which are further arranged into ranks and banks. The more capacitors that are stuffed into a DIMM, the more capacity it has to store data. Servers usually have multiple DIMMs that are organized into channels that can be processed in parallel.</p>
