    <h1>The Website Obesity Crisis</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is the text version of a talk I gave on October 29, 2015, at the <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/wd15/">Web Directions</a> conference in Sydney.  [<a href="http://www.webdirections.org/blog/the-website-obesity-crisis/">53 minute video</a>].

    <p>Let me start by saying that beautiful websites come in all sizes and page weights.  I love big websites packed with images. I love high-resolution video. I love sprawling Javascript experiments or well-designed web apps. 
    
    </p><p>This talk isn&#39;t about any of those. It&#39;s about mostly-text sites that, for unfathomable reasons, are growing bigger  with every passing year.
    
    </p><p>While I&#39;ll be using examples to keep the talk from getting too abstract, I’m not here to shame anyone, except some companies (Medium) that should know better and are intentionally breaking the web.

    <p>What do I mean by a website obesity crisis?  
    
    </p><p>Here’s an article on GigaOm from 2012 titled &#34;<a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/05/23/the-growing-epidemic-of-page-bloat/">The Growing Epidemic of Page Bloat</a>&#34;.  It warns that the average web page is over a megabyte in size.  
    </p><p>The article itself is 1.8 megabytes long.

    <p>Here&#39;s an almost identical article from the same website two years later, called “<a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/12/29/the-overweight-web-average-web-page-size-is-up-15-in-2014/">The Overweight Web</a>&#34;.  This article warns that average page size is approaching 2 megabytes.  
    
    </p><p>That article is 3 megabytes long.
    
    </p><p>If present trends continue, there is the real chance that articles warning about page bloat could exceed 5 megabytes in size by 2020.
    
  </p><p> The problem with picking any particular size as a threshold is that it encourages us to define deviancy down. Today’s egregiously bloated site becomes tomorrow’s typical page, and next year’s elegantly slim design. 
  
  </p><p>I would like to anchor the discussion in something more timeless.

    <p>To repeat a suggestion I <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/653714626857730048">made on Twitter</a>, I contend that <b>text-based websites should not exceed in size the major works of Russian literature</b>.

</p><p>This is a generous yardstick. I could have picked French literature, full of slim little books, but I intentionally went with Russian novels and their reputation for ponderousness.

</p><p>In Goncharov&#39;s <a href="http://www.powells.com/book/oblomov-9780300162288">Oblomov</a>, for example, the title character spends the first hundred pages just getting out of bed.

<p>To channel a famous motivational speaker, I could go out there tonight, with the materials you’ve got, and rewrite the sites I showed you at the start of this talk to make them load in under a second.  In two hours.  

</p><p>Can you?  Can you?

</p><p>Of course you can! It’s not hard!  We knew how to make small websites in 2002. It’s not like the secret has been lost to history, like Greek fire or Damascus steel.

</p><p>But we face pressure to make these sites bloated.

</p><p>I bet if you went to a client and presented a 200 kilobyte site template, you’d be fired. Even if it looked great and somehow included all the tracking and ads and social media crap they insisted on putting in. It’s just so far out of the realm of the imaginable at this point.

<p>If you&#39;ve ever struggled to lose weight, you know there are tricks people use to fool themselves into thinking they&#39;re thinner. You suck in your gut, wear a tight shirt, stand on a certain part of the scale. 

</p><p>The same situation obtains with performance testing. People have invented creative metrics to persuade themselves that their molasses-like websites load fast.

</p><p>Google has a popular one called <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index">SpeedIndex</a>. (You know it&#39;s from Google because they casually throw an integral sign into the definition.) 

</p><p>SpeedIndex is based on the idea that what  counts is how fast the visible part of the website renders.  It doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s happening elsewhere on the page. It doesn&#39;t matter if the network is saturated and your phone is hot to the touch.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the battery is visibly draining. Everything is OK as long as the part of the site in the viewport appears to pop into view right away.

</p><p>Of course, it doesn’t matter how fast the site appears to load if the first thing the completed page does is serve an interstitial ad.  Or, if like many mobile users, you  start scrolling immediately and catch the &#39;unoptimized&#39; part of the page with its pants down.

</p><p>There is only one honest measure of web performance: <b>the time from when you click a link to when you&#39;ve finished skipping the last ad</b>.

</p><p>Everything else is bullshit.

</p><p>Most of the talk about web performance is similarly technical, involving compression, asynchronous loading, sequencing assets, batching HTTP requests,  pipelining, and minification.

<p>Here is what I recommend for a balanced website in 2015:

</p><ul>
<li><p>A solid base of text worth reading, formatted with a healthy dose of markup. </p></li>
<li><p>Some images, in moderation, to illustrate and punch up the visual design.</p></li>
<li><p>A dollop of CSS.</p></li>

 </p><p>More cookies are the last thing your overweight website needs.
 
 </p><p>These scripts get served from God knows where and are the perfect vector for malware.
 
 </p><p>Advertisers will tell you it has to be this way, but in dealing with advertisers you must remember they are professional liars.  
 
 </p><p>I don’t mean this to offend.  I mean it as a job description.  An advertiser&#39;s  job is to convince you to do stuff you would not otherwise do. Their task in talking to web designers is to persuade them that the only way to show ads is by including mountains of third-party cruft and tracking.

<p>There was always a catch.  The gas burners on the stoves were kind of small. The handles would occasionally fall off the frying pans, at unexpected times.

</p><p>Some things were guaranteed to never fail—the freezers, say, would always stay below freezing.  But maybe you wouldn&#39;t be able to unlock the doors for several hours at a time.

    <p>Let me give you a concrete example.  I recently heard from a competitor, let’s call them ACME Bookmarking Co., who are looking to leave the bookmarking game and sell their website. 
    
    </p><p>While ACME has much more traffic than I do, I learned they only have half the daily active users. This was reassuring, because the hard part of scaling a bookmarking site is dealing with people saving stuff.   
    
    </p><p>We both had the same number of employees.  They have an intern working on the project part time, while I dither around and travel the world giving talks. Say half a full-time employee for each of us.
    
    </p><p>We have similar revenue per active user.  I gross $12,000 a month, they gross $5,000.
    
    </p><p>But where the projects differ radically is cost. ACME hosts their service on AWS, and at one point they were paying $23,000 (!!) in monthly  fees.   Through titanic effort, they have been able to reduce that to $9,000 a month. 
    
    </p><p>I pay just over a thousand dollars a month for hosting, using my own equipment.  That figure includes the amortized cost of my hardware, and sodas from the vending machine at the colo.
    
    </p><p>So while I consider bookmarking a profitable business, to them it&#39;s a $4,000/month money pit.  I&#39;m living large off the same income stream that is driving them to sell  their user data to marketers and get the hell out of the game.

  </p><p>The point is that assumptions about complexity will anchor your expectations, and limit what you&#39;re willing to try.   If you think a &#39;real&#39; website has to live in the cloud and run across a dozen machines, a whole range of otherwise viable projects will seem unprofitable.  
  
  </p><p>Similarly, if you think you need a many-layered CMS and extensive custom javascript for an online publishing venture, the range of things you will try becomes very constricted. 
  
  </p><p>Rather than trying to make your overbuilt projects look simple, ask yourself if they can&#39;t just <i>be</i> simple.

<p>I don&#39;t want to harsh on the cloud.  Some of my best friends are in the cloud.

</p><p>Rather, I want to remind everyone there’s plenty of room at the bottom. Developers today work on top of too many layers to notice how powerful the technology has become. It’s a reverse princess-and-the-pea problem.  

</p><p>The same thing happens in the browser. The core technology is so fast and good that we’ve been able to pile crap on top of it and still have it work tolerably well.  

</p><p>One way to make your website shine is by having the courage to let the browser do what it&#39;s optimized to do.   Don&#39;t assume that all your frameworks and tooling are saving you time or money.

</p><p>Unfortunately, complexity has become a bit of a bragging point. People boast to one another about what&#39;s in their &#39;stack&#39;, and share tips about how to manage it.

</p><p>&#34;Stack&#34; is the backend equivalent to the word &#34;polyfill&#34;. Both of them are signs that you are radically overcomplicating your design.

<p>The other vision is of the web as Call of Duty—an exquisitely produced, kind-of-but-not-really-participatory guided experience with breathtaking effects and lots of opportunities to make in-game purchases.  

</p><p>Creating this kind of Web requires a large team of specialists. No one person can understand the whole pipeline, nor is anyone expected to.  Even if someone could master all the technologies in play, the production costs would be prohibitive.

</p><p>The user experience in this kind of Web is that of being carried along, with the illusion of agency, within fairly strict limits.   There&#39;s an obvious path you&#39;re supposed to follow, and disincentives to keep you straying from it.  As a bonus, the game encodes a whole problematic political agenda. The only way to reject it is not to play.  

</p><p>Despite the lavish production values, there&#39;s a strange sameness to everything. You&#39;re always in the same brown war zone.

</p><p>With great effort and skill, you might be able make minor modifications to this game world. But most people will end up playing exactly the way the publishers intend.  It&#39;s passive entertainment with occasional button-mashing.

</p><p>Let’s commit to the idea that as computers get faster, and as networks get faster, the web should also get faster.

</p><p>Let’s not allow the panicked dinosaurs of online publishing to trample us as they stampede away from the meteor. Instead, let&#39;s hide in our holes and watch nature take its beautiful course.

</p><p>Most importantly, let’s break the back of the online surveillance establishment that threatens not just our livelihood, but our liberty.  Not only here in Australia, but in America, Europe, the UK—in every free country where the idea of permanent, total surveillance sounded like bad science fiction even ten years ago.
