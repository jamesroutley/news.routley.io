      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I feel like we are living in uniquely pessimistic times, at least when compared to the last ~70 years. The world order is being challenged, and not for the better. Massive geopolitcal problems are ahead with no good prospects - continuing Russian aggression in Europe, looming aggression in Taiwan, gloomy prospects over Iran nuclear situation. The US may well see a new civil war in the next few decades. Demographics, particularly in Europe, are not looking good. There are climate change risks to look forward to. Deglobalisation will lead to less global economic efficiency/prosperity. Tech advancement appears to have stagnated, and in any case the dream of technological innovation making tomorrow better has been replaced with the reality of tech making a lot of our lives worse, disconnecting people, pitting people against each other, hijacking our attention.  Culturally, we seem to be getting worse at getting along with each other. Generally, we seem to have given up on making things better overall, and instead just focus on trying to prevent bad/worse outcomes. I can&#39;t remember when I last saw someone outline a positive vision of the world we are building with a rough idea of how to get there - mostly, anything referring to the future is some cyberpunk dystopia.<p>Given all the above, what makes you optimistic about the future? Why do you believe that the world of tomorrow will be better than the world of today? What do you look forward to in the world of the future?</p></td></tr>
