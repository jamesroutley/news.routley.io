                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>A flow system requires focus on reliable handoffs and system throughput, not on utilization. It requires creative people who vigilantly address problems and improve the workflow. It requires a leadership team that understands &#34;Results are Not the Point&#34; - the real point is to create a system and grow people who are capable of delivering excellent results over the long term.</p>
