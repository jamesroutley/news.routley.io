<ul>
<li>been thinking more than doing this week which i think (there it goes again, the infernal thinking!) usually i&#39;d take to be a bad thing, but i know it was a very busy week household management wise (cleaning and admin, etc). trying to give myself a little grace. üôèüèø</li>
<li>continuing <a href="https://www.alphabetsuperset.com/">alphabet superset</a> after a long hiatus. the creator of the challenge is still working on his so I&#39;m allowing myself to not be a perfectionist about it. draft of the next one, on <a href="https://notes.olu.online/jargon">jargon</a> is up but not complete, hopefully obviously. coming up with for life-centric, justice/flourishing-centered topics for k is weirdly hard but I&#39;ll think of something.</li>
<li>i was catching up on lu&#39;s blog in the middle of writing this ‚Äî¬†no YOU have executive dysfunction issues ‚Äî¬†and she recently posted about <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/open/garden/">how you shouldn&#39;t ask for feedback on things you haven&#39;t released a draft of</a>, so i&#39;ll pretend that&#39;s the reason i am posting more to the notes blog. you can&#39;t stop me!</li>
<li>came across a series on a blog about bloggers due to <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-anne-sturdivant">anne sturdivant</a> recommending me as a blog to read! i&#39;m touched especially as i have done nothing but weeknotes and <a href="https://olu.online/24-hopes-for-2024/">hopes</a> so far this year but it&#39;s funny timing; i had been thinking about picking up on alphabet superset for a while but this was the push i needed! <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/">anne</a> is also doing <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a>, another challenge i&#39;m going to try!</li>
<li>a friend was asking about project management stuff I do and I think it&#39;s part of why I struggle with big projects like long form video. aka &#34;what project management?&#34; is my answer lol. I know I&#39;d love a system that accounted for dependencies and let me block tasks until another task was done. I feel like <a href="https://olu.online/weeknotes-11-week-31-2024/amazingmarvin.com">amazing marvin</a> probably has it in its box of tricks but finding it a lot for my current minimalist approach; might have to write something myself üò©</li>
<li>as i&#39;ve sort of said on my <a href="https://olu.online/now">now</a> page, i have discovered i have a burning fear of being on camera on some level. i thought i was putting off making short videos cos I was worried about being boring or being wrong but it&#39;s garden variety stage fright (booo. boooo!). i think (more booing erupts) that practice, taking it slow, and recording things but not immediately/ever posting them might help? but we shall see! worried it will go the way of chess and i&#39;ll just be forever put off it, but i know it&#39;s not good for anxiety to let it fester. dragging my fear out into the light, like god intended!</li>
<li>I remember why I was on Lu&#39;s site now; I am loath to create a new idea about how habit apps should work, and thus a new habit app, when a billion of the bloody things exist. They are mostly interchangeable and will not have been built by me though, so maybe it&#39;s not so much <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-ideas/">a new idea</a> but a new implementation that will teach me a bunch of things? Whatever, we&#39;ll see.</li>
