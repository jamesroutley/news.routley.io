                    <hr/>
                    <p>Forget that! Who would ever want to put in all of that effort for a website? Just open up your web browser and type &#34;bootstrap template&#34; into your favorite search engine, like Yahoo! or Bing, and you&#39;re on your way! There are hundreds of templates to choose from, but go ahead and pick this same exact template from the first result on google, edit a few lines, and you&#39;re on your way! No one will notice!</p>

                        <p>Look at this cool set of four icons describing different things about us! We use four, because it&#39;s the default.</p>

                        <p>We even changed some of the icons! We take the extra effort to make our designs truly original.</p>

                    <p>Here&#39;s my phone number and email address, because hey that&#39;s part of the template and why would you not include that on your webpage? You&#39;d be a fool not to! I can&#39;t wait for all the job offers to come pouring in from all the companies wanting my insane website design skills.</p>
