    <h1>Tell HN: Spectrum is blocking TCP/UDP 5060 at my home</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>For several years, I&#39;ve run 3 VOIP phones from my house.  About a week ago they stopped working.  SIP REGISTER started failing.</p><p>Turns out Spectrum now blocks TCP/UDP port 5060.  My workaround is to use a VPN.  After that, everything is fine.</p><p>This reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/t8nulq/spectrum_is_rate_limiting_voipsip_traffic_port/ suggests Spectrum was rate limiting 5060 on 300mbps plans, but not on the 100mbps plans.</p><p>I have the 100mbps plan, and it is definitely affected now.</p><p>So if you are in SoCal, using Spectrum, and your VOIP phones suddenly stopped working in the last week or so, maybe this will help you.</p></div></div></div>
