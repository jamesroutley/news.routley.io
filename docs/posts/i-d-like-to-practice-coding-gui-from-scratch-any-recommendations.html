    <h1>Ask HN: I&#39;d like to practice coding GUI from scratch. Any recommendations?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hi folks!<p>As the title says, I want to practice coding a GUI framework, probably in C++.</p><p>I read about a retained and an immediate modes, have a rough understanding how event loop works, and overall my goal is to practice architecture and optimization (especially cache-friendliness), and less so graphics and typography rendering, though I understand it&#39;s unavoidable to implement a rendering pipeline (I plan to start off with AGG or Skia graphics libraries).</p><p>The dummy app itself will be less about forms but more about data representation, e.g. an audio editor or a node-based system, where data should be updated and visualized in real time, and everything should feel responsive.</p><p>Could you please give some research directions? Maybe case studies, best practices, some interesting software, maybe to read more in detail about related architectures, etc.? Or maybe personal stories? I&#39;m struggling to find related info which would not be focused on some framework, etc.</p></td></div></div>
