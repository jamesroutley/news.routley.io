    <h1>Ask HN: Why is Pave legal?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>If you haven&#39;t heard of it, Pave is a YC-backed startup that helps startups with compensation. I can&#39;t actually access the system so I&#39;m speaking from hearsay and what&#39;s information on public parts of their website. The way I understand it works is that you connect Pave to your HR and Payroll systems, they take the data about who you employ and how much you pay them, combine it with all their other companies, and give companies a collective breakdown of compensation ranges.</p><p>My question is, isn&#39;t this specifically anti-competitive wage fixing? This seems exactly like RealPage but for employee compensation. As far as I know, colluding on wages like this is illegal. Is there something about the company that I&#39;m missing?</p></div></td></div></div>
