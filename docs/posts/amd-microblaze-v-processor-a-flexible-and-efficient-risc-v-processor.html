                            <p>I&#39;m surprised at how similar so many creation stories are. I wonder how much of that is a result of folk stories subtly changing to fit with the pressures of Christian missionaries â€” probably some, but I suspect there is also a inherent sameness in many creation stories.</p>
<p>I quite liked the story of Grandfather Sun spending less and less time in the sky because people weren&#39;t friendly or grateful with him, that will definitely stick in my memory.</p>
<p>I am grateful for this book, but I do wish it included more stories and talked a little more about the history of the stories. I can understand why it doesn&#39;t, though.</p>
