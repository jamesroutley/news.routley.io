<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>This talk announces the first public release of sixos, a two year project to create a nixpkgs-based operating system using skarnet&#39;s s6 supervisor instead of systemd.</p>

<p>The monolithic design of `systemd` is inconsistent with the UNIX userspace philosophy.  Its our-way-or-fork-off policy attracts influence-seekers, and thereby encourages *platform decay* within the free software ecosystem.  Systemd&#39;s failure to provide Linux-grade ABI stability („we don&#39;t break userspace“) creates a large and tempting attack surface for *enshittification*.</p>

<p>This talk announces the first public release of [sixos](https://codeberg.org/amjoseph/sixos), a two year project to create a nixpkgs-based operating system using [skarnet](https://skarnet.org/software/)&#39;s [`s6`](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/) instead of `systemd`.</p>

<p>Sixos replaces NixOS modules with the simpler [`infuse`](https://codeberg.org/amjoseph/infuse.nix) combinator.  This allows sixos to treat services the same way nixpkgs handles packages:
</p>

<p>Whenever possible, sixos retains good ideas pioneered by NixOS, like atomically-activated immutable configurations and the layout of `/run`.</p>

<p>Sixos is not a fork of NixOS.  It shares no code with `nixpkgs/nixos`, nor is any part of it derived from NixOS.  Sixos and NixOS both depend on `nixpkgs/pkgs`.</p>

<p>On [ownerboot](https://codeberg.org/amjoseph/ownerboot) hardware all [mutable firmware](https://codeberg.org/amjoseph/ownerboot/src/branch/master/doc/owner-controlled.md#clarifications) -- all the way back to the reset vector -- is versioned, managed, and built as part of the sixos configuration.  This *eliminates the artificial distinction between firmware software and non-firmware software*.  On NixOS, either the initrd „secrets“ or the software that decrypts them ([ESP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition), [initrd ssh keys](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/6b88838224de5b86f449e9d01755eae4efe4a1e4/nixos/modules/system/boot/initrd-ssh.nix#L73-L76)) is stored unencrypted on writable media.  Ownerbooted sixos closes this loophole without any „trusted computing“ voodoo, eliminating all unencrypted storage except for an eeprom whose hardware write-protect pin is connected to ground.</p>

<p>The speaker runs ownerbooted sixos on his workstations, servers, twelve routers, stockpile of disposable laptops, and on his company&#39;s 24-server/768-core buildfarm.  So far all of his attempts to run sixos on his snowboard have failed.</p>
