					ACM Takes Major Step in Its Transition To Become a Fully Open Access Publisher</h2>
			<p><b>New York, NY, April 7, 2022</b>—ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, today announced that its first 50 years of publications, from 1951 through the end of 2000, are now open and freely available to view and download via the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM Digital Library</a>. ACM’s first 50 years backfile contains more than 117,500 articles on a wide range of computing topics. In addition to articles published between 1951 and 2000, ACM has also opened related and supplemental materials including data sets, software, slides, audio recordings, and videos.</p>

<p>Making the first 50 years of its publications and related content freely available expresses ACM’s commitment to open access publication and represents another milestone in the organization’s transition to full open access within the next five years.</p>
