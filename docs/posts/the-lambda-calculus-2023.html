    <h1>The Lambda Calculus (2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus is, at heart, a simple notation for functions
and application. The main ideas are <em>applying</em> a function to an
argument and forming functions by <em>abstraction</em>. The syntax of
basic \(\lambda\)-calculus is quite sparse, making it an elegant,
focused notation for representing functions. Functions and arguments
are on a par with one another. The result is a non-extensional theory
of functions as rules of computation, contrasting with an extensional
theory of functions as sets of ordered pairs. Despite its sparse
syntax, the expressiveness and flexibility of the \(\lambda\)-calculus
make it a cornucopia of logic and mathematics. This entry develops
some of the central highlights of the field and prepares the reader
for further study of the subject and its applications in philosophy,
linguistics, computer science, and logic.</p><div id="main-text">

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus is an elegant notation for working with
<em>applications</em> of <em>functions</em> to <em>arguments</em>. To
take a mathematical example, suppose we are given a simple polynomial
such as \(x^2 -2\cdot x+5\). What is the value of this expression when
\(x = 2\)? We compute this by ‘plugging in’ 2 for \(x\) in
the expression: we get \(2^2 -2\cdot 2+5\), which we can further
reduce to get the answer 5. To use the \(\lambda\)-calculus to
represent the situation, we start with the \(\lambda\)-term</p><p>

\[
\lambda x[x^2 -2\cdot x+5].
\]

</p><p>
The \(\lambda\) operators allows us to <em>abstract</em> over \(x\).
One can intuitively read ‘\(\lambda x[x^2 -2\cdot x+5]\)’
as an expression that is waiting for a value \(a\) for the variable
\(x\). When given such a value \(a\) (such as the number 2), the value
of the expression is \(a^2 -2\cdot a+5\). The
‘\(\lambda\)’ on its own has no significance; it merely
<em>binds</em> the variable \(x\), guarding it, as it were, from
outside interference. The terminology in \(\lambda\)-calculus is that
we want to <em>apply</em> this expression to an <em>argument</em>, and
get a value. We write ‘\(Ma\)’ to denote the application
of the function \(M\) to the argument \(a\). Continuing with the
example, we get:</p><p> 
\[\begin{align}
(\lambda x[x^2 -2\cdot x+5])2 \rhd 2^2&amp; -2\cdot 2+5
   &amp;\langle \text{Substitute 2 for } x\rangle \\
&amp;= 4-4+5
   &amp;\langle\text{Arithmetic}\rangle \\
&amp;= 5 
   &amp;\langle\text{Arithmetic}\rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>
The first step of this calculation, plugging in ‘2’ for
occurrences of \(x\) in the expression ‘<span>\(x^2 -
2\cdot x + 5\)</span>’, is the passage from an
<strong><em>abstraction term</em></strong> to another term by the
operation of substitution. The remaining equalities are justified by
computing with natural numbers.</p>

<p>
This example suggests the central principle of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus, called
<strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction</em></strong>, which is also sometimes
called <strong><em>\(\beta\)-conversion</em></strong>:</p><p> 
\[
\tag{\(\beta\)}
(\lambda x[M])N \rhd M[x := N]
\]

</p><p>
The understanding is that we can <em>reduce</em> or <em>contract</em>
\((\rhd)\) an application \((\lambda xM)N\) of an abstraction term
(the left-hand side, \(\lambda xM)\) to something (the right-hand
side, \(N)\) by simply plugging in \(N\) for the occurrences of \(x\)
inside \(M\) (that’s what the notation ‘\(M[x :=
N]\)’ expresses). <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction</em></strong>,
or <strong><em>\(\beta\)-conversion</em></strong>, is the heart of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus. When one actually applies \(\beta\)-reduction to
reduce a term, there is an important proviso that has to be observed.
But this will be described in Section 2.1, when we discuss bound and
free variables.</p>

<h3><a name="MulArgOpe">1.1 Multi-argument operations</a></h3>

<p>
What about functions of multiple arguments? Can the
\(\lambda\)-calculus represent operations such as computing the length
of the hypotenuse of a right triangle:</p>

<p>
Hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length \(x\) and \(y
\Rightarrow \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).</p>

<p>
The length-of-hypotenuse operation maps two positive real numbers
\(x\) and \(y\) to another positive real number. One can represent
such multiple-arity operations using the apparatus of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus by viewing the operation as taking one input at a
time. Thus, the operation can be seen as taking one input, \(x\), a
positive real number, and producing as its value not a
<em>number</em>, but an <em>operation</em>: namely, the operation that
takes a positive real number \(y\) as input and produces as output the
positive real number \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). One could summarize the
discussion by saying that the operation, <span><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>,
that computes
the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths
\(a\) and \(b\) of its legs, is:</p>

<p>
<span><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span> \(:=
\lambda a[\lambda b[\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}]]\)</p>

<p>
By the principle of \(\beta\)-reduction, we have, for example, that
<span><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span> 3, the
application of <span><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
to 3, is
\(\lambda b[\sqrt{3^2 + b^2}]\), which is a function of that is
‘waiting’ for another argument. The \(\lambda\)-term <span><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
3 can be viewed
as a function that computes the length of the hypotenuse of a right
triangle one of whose legs has length 3. We find, finally, that (<span><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
3)4—the
application of <span><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
to 3 and then to
4—is 5, as expected.</p>

<p>
Another way to understand the reduction of many-place functions to
one-place functions is to imagine a machine \(M\) that initially
starts out by loading the first \(a\) of multiple arguments \(a,
b,\ldots\) into memory. If one then suspends the machine after it has
loaded the first argument into memory, one can view the result as
another machine M\(_a\) that is awaiting one fewer input; the first
argument is now fixed.</p>

<h3><a name="Non-Extensionality">1.2 Non-Extensionality</a></h3>

<p>
An important philosophical issue concerning the \(\lambda\)-calculus
is the question of its underlying concept of functions. In set theory,
a function is standardly understood as a set of argument-value pairs.
More specifically, a function is understood as a set \(f\) of ordered
pairs satisfying the property that \((x,y) \in f\) and \((x,z) \in f\)
implies \(y = z\). If \(f\) is a function and \((x,y) \in f\), this
means that the function f assigns the value \(y\) to the argument
\(x\). This is the concept of
<strong><em>functions-as-sets</em></strong>. Consequently, the notion
of equality of functions-as-sets is equality <em>qua</em> sets, which,
under the standard principle of extensionality, entails that two
functions are equal precisely when they contain the same ordered
pairs. In other words, two functions are identical if and only if they
assign the same values to the same arguments. In this sense,
functions-as-sets are <em>extensional</em> objects.</p>

<p>
In contrast, the notion of a function at work in \(\lambda\)-calculus
is one where functions are understood as <em>rules</em>: a function is
given by a rule for how to determine its values from its arguments.
More specifically, we can view a \(\lambda\)-term \(\lambda x[M]\) as
a description of an operation that, given \(x\), produces \(M\); the
body \(M\) of the abstraction term is, essentially, a <em>rule</em>
for what to do with \(x\). This is the conception of
<strong><em>functions-as-rules</em></strong>. Intuitively, given rules
\(M\) and \(N\), we cannot in general decide whether \(\lambda x[M]\)
is equal to \(\lambda x[N]\). The two terms might ‘behave’
the same (have the same value given the same arguments), but it may
not be clear what resources are needed for showing the equality of the
terms. In this sense, functions-as-rules are <em>non-extensional</em>
objects.</p>

<p>
To distinguish the extensional concept of functions-as-sets from the
non-extensional concept of functions-as-rules, the latter is often
referred to as an <em>‘intensional’</em> function concept,
in part because of the ostensibly intensional concept of a rule
involved. This terminology is particularly predominant in the
community of mathematical logicians and philosophers of mathematics
working on the foundations of mathematics. But from the perspective of
the philosophy of language, the terminology can be somewhat
misleading, since in this context, the extensional-intensional
distinction has a slightly different meaning.</p>

<p>
In the standard possible-worlds framework of philosophical semantics,
we would distinguish between an extensional and an intensional
function concept as follows. Let us say that two functions are
<em>extensionally equivalent at a world</em> if and only if they
assign the same values to the same arguments at that world. And let us
say that two functions are <em>intensionally equivalent</em> if and
only if they assign the same values to the same arguments at
<em>every</em> possible-world. To illustrate, consider the functions
<span><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span> and
<span><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span>,
where <span><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span>
assigns
the highest mountain on earth as the value to every argument and <span><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span>
assigns the highest mountain in the Himalayas as the value to every
argument. The two functions are extensionally equivalent (at the
actual world), but not intensionally so. At the actual world, the two
functions assign the same value to every argument, namely Mt. Everest.
Now consider a world where Mt. Everest is not the highest mountain on
earth, but say, Mt. Rushmore is. Suppose further that this is so, just
because Mt. Rushmore is 30.000 feet/9.100 m higher than it is at the
actual world, while Mt. Everest, with its roughly 29.000 feet/8.800 m,
is still the highest mountain in the Himalayas. At that world, <span><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span>
now
assigns Mt. Rushmore as the value to every argument, while <span><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span>
still assigns Mt. Everest to every object. In other words, <span><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span>
and <span><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span>
are extensionally equivalent (at the actual world) but not
intensionally equivalent.</p>

<p>
A function concept may now be called <em>extensional</em> if and only
if it requires functions that are extensionally equivalent at the
actual world to be identical. And a function concept may be classified
as <em>intensional</em> if and only if it requires intensionally
equivalent functions to be identical. Note that these classifications
are conceptually different from the distinctions commonly used in the
foundations of mathematics. On the terminology used in the foundations
of mathematics, functions-as-sets are classified as extensional since
they use the axiom of extensionality as their criterion of identity,
and functions-as-rules are classified as intensional because they rely
on the ostensibly intensional concept of a rule. In the present
possible-worlds terminology, function concepts are classified as
extensional or intensional based of their behavior at
possible-worlds.</p>

<p>
An issue from which conceptual confusion might arise is that the two
terminologies potentially pass different verdicts on the function
concept at work in the \(\lambda\)-calculus. To see this, consider the
following two functions:</p><p> 
\[\begin{align}
\addone &amp;:= \lambda x[x+1] \\
\addtwosubtractone &amp;:= \lambda x[[x+2]-1] 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>
These two functions are clearly extensionally equivalent: they assign
the same value to the same input at the actual world. Moreover, given
standard assumptions in possible worlds semantics, the two functions
are also <em>intensionally</em> equivalent. If we assume that
mathematical facts, like facts about addition and subtraction, are
necessary in the sense that they are the same at every possible world,
then we get that the two functions give the same value to the
arguments at <em>every</em> possible world. So, an intensional
function concept would require the two functions to be identical. In
the \(\lambda\)-calculus, however, it’s not clear at all that we
should identify the two functions. Formally speaking, without the help
of some other principle, we cannot show that the two \(\lambda\)-terms
denote the same function. Moreover, informally speaking, on the
conception of <em>functions-as-rules</em>, it’s not even clear
that we <em>should</em> identify them: the two terms involve genuinely
different rules, and so we might be tempted to say that they denote
different functions.</p>

<p>
A function concept that allows for intensionally equivalent functions
to be distinct is called <strong><em>hyperintensional</em></strong>.
The point is that in possible-worlds terminology, the function concept
at work in the \(\lambda\)-calculus may be regarded not as intentional
but <em>hyper</em>intensional—in contrast to what the
terminology common in the foundations of mathematics says. Note that
it’s unclear how an intensional semantic framework, like the
possible-worlds framework, could even in principle account for a
non-intensional function concept. On the semantics of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus, see section
 <a href="#SemLCal">7</a>.
 The point here was simply to clarify any conceptual confusions that
might arise from different terminologies at play in philosophical
discourse.</p>

<p>
The hyperintensionality of the \(\lambda\)-calculus is particularly
important when it comes to its applications as a theory of not only
functions, but more generally <em>\(n\)-ary relations</em>. On this,
see section
 <a href="#Relations">9.3</a>.
 It is effectively the hyperintensionality of the \(\lambda\)-calculus
that makes it an attractive tool in this context. It should be noted,
however, that the \(\lambda\)-calculus can be made extensional (as
well as intensional) by postulating additional laws concerning the
equality of \(\lambda\)-terms. On this, see section
 <a href="#LThe">5</a>.</p>
 
<h2><a name="Syn">2. Syntax</a></h2>

<p>
The official syntax of the \(\lambda\)-calculus is quite simple; it is
contained in the next definition.</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> For the alphabet of the language of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus we take the left and right parentheses, left and
right square brackets, the symbol ‘\(\lambda\)’, and an
infinite set of variables. The class of
<strong><em>\(\lambda\)-terms</em></strong> is defined inductively as
follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>Every variable is a \(\lambda\)-term.</li>

<li>If \(M\) and \(N\) are \(\lambda\)-terms, then so is
\((MN)\).</li>

<li>If \(M\) is a \(\lambda\)-term and \(x\) is a variable, then
\((\lambda x[M])\) is a \(\lambda\)-term.</li>
</ol>

<p>
By ‘term’ we always mean ‘\(\lambda\)-term’.
Terms formed according to rule (2) are called <strong><em>application
terms</em></strong>. Terms formed according to rule (3) are called
<strong><em>abstraction terms</em></strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>
As is common when dealing with formal languages that have grouping
symbols (the left and right parenthesis, in our case), some
parentheses will be omitted when it is safe to do so (that is, when
they can be reintroduced in only one sensible way). Juxtaposing more
than two \(\lambda\)-terms is, strictly speaking, illegal. To avoid
the tedium of always writing all needed parentheses, we adopt the
following convention:</p>

<p>
<strong>Convention</strong> (association to the left): When more than
two terms \(M_1 M_2 M_3 \ldots M_n\) are juxtaposed we can recover the
missing parentheses by <strong><em>associating to the
left</em></strong>: reading from left to right, group \(M_1\) and
\(M_2\) together, yielding \((M_1 M_2)M_3 \ldots M_n\); then group
\((M_1 M_2)\) with \(M_3\): \(((M_1 M_2)M_3)\ldots M_n\), and so
forth.</p>

<p>
The convention thus gives a unique reading to any sequence of
\(\lambda\)-terms whose length is greater than 2.</p>

<h3><a name="VarBouFre">2.1 Variables, bound and free</a></h3>

<p>
The function of \(\lambda\) in an abstraction term \((\lambda x[M]\))
is that it <strong><em>binds</em></strong> the variable appearing
immediately after it in the term \(M\). Thus \(\lambda\) is analogous
to the universal and existential quantifiers \(\forall\) and
\(\exists\) of first-order logic. One can define, analogously, the
notions of free and bound variable in the expected way, as
follows.</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> The syntactic functions \(\mathbf{FV}\)
and \(\mathbf{BV}\) (for ‘free variable’ and ‘bound
variable’, respectively) are defined on the set of
\(\lambda\)-terms by structural induction thus:</p>

<p>
For every variable \(x\), term \(M\), and term \(N\):</p>

<p>

\[\begin{array}{lll}
  &amp;\text{Free}
  &amp;\text{Bound} \\
(1)
  &amp;\mathbf{FV}(x) = \{ x \} \quad 
  &amp;\mathbf{BV}(x) =  \varnothing \\
(2)
  &amp;\mathbf{FV}(MN) = \mathbf{FV}(M) \cup \mathbf{FV}(N)
  &amp;\mathbf{BV}(MN) = \mathbf{BV}(M) \cup \mathbf{BV}(N) \\
(3)
  &amp;\mathbf{FV}(\lambda x[M]) = \mathbf{FV}(M) - \{ x \}
  &amp;\mathbf{BV}(\lambda x[M]) = \mathbf{BV}(M) \cup \{ x \}
\end{array}\]

</p>

<p>
If \(\mathbf{FV}(M) = \varnothing\) then \(M\) is called a
<strong><em>combinator</em></strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>
Clause (3) in the two definitions supports the intention that
\(\lambda\) binds variables (ensures that they are not free). Note the
difference between \(\mathbf{BV}\) and \(\mathbf{FV}\) for
variables.</p>

<p>
As is typical in other subjects where the concepts appear, such as
first-order logic, one needs to be careful about the issue; a casual
attitude about substitution can lead to syntactic
 difficulties.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 We can defend a casual attitude by adopting the convention that we
are interested not in terms themselves, but in a certain equivalence
class of terms. We now define substitution, and then lay down a
convention that allows us to avoid such difficulties.</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (substitution) We write ‘\(M[x :=
N]\)’ to denote the substitution of \(N\) for the free
occurrences of \(x\) in \(M\). A precise
 definition<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 by recursion on the set of \(\lambda\)-terms is as follows: for all
terms \(A\), \(B\), and \(M\), and for all variables \(x\) and \(y\),
we define</p>

<ol>

<li>\(x[x := M] \equiv M\) </li>

<li>\(y[x := M] \equiv y\) (\(y\) distinct from \(x)\)</li>

<li>\((AB)[x := M] \equiv A[x := M]B[x := M]\)</li>

<li>\((\lambda x[A])[x := M] \equiv \lambda x[A]\)</li>

<li>\((\lambda y[A])[x := M] \equiv \lambda y[A[x := M]]\) (\(y\)
distinct from \(x)\)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Clause (1) of the definition simply says that if we are to substitute
\(M\) for \(x\) and we are dealing simply with \(x\), then the result
is just \(M\). Clause (2) says that nothing happens when we are
dealing (only) with a variable different from \(x\) but we are to
substitute something for \(x\). Clause (3) tells us that substitution
unconditionally distributes over applications. Clauses (4) and (5)
concern abstraction terms and parallel clauses (1) and (2) (or rather,
clauses (2) and (1), in opposite order): If the bound variable \(z\)
of the abstraction term \(\lambda z[A]\) is identical to the variable
\(x\) for which we are to do a substitution, then we do not perform
any substitution (that is, substitution “stops”). This
coheres with the intention that \(M[x := N]\) is supposed to denote
the substitution of \(N\) for the <em>free</em> occurrences of \(x\)
in \(M\). If \(M\) is an abstraction term \(\lambda x[A]\) whose bound
variable is \(x\), then \(x\) does not occurr freely in \(M\), so
there is nothing to do. This explains clause 4. Clause (5), finally,
says that if the bound variable of an abstraction term differs from
\(x\), then at least \(x\) has the “chance ” to occur
freely in the abstraction term, and substitution continues into the
body of the abstraction term.</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (change of bound variables,
\(\alpha\)-convertibility). The term \(N\) is obtained from the term
\(M\) by a <strong><em>change of bound variables</em></strong> if,
roughly, any abstraction term \(\lambda x[A]\) inside \(M\) has been
replaced by \(\lambda y[A[x := y]]\).</p>

<p>
Let us say that terms \(M\) and \(N\) are
<strong><em>\(\alpha\)-convertible</em></strong> if there is a
sequence of changes of bound variables starting from \(M\) and ending
at \(N\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Axiom</strong>. <strong><em>\(\beta\)-conversion</em></strong>
(stated with a no-capture proviso):</p>

<p>
\( (\lambda x[M])N \rhd M[x := N]\),
</p>
</div>

<p>
Roughly, we need to adhere to the principle that free variables ought
to remain free; when an occurrence of a variable is threatened to
become bound by a substitution, simply perform enough
\(\alpha\)-conversions to sidestep the problem. If we keep this in
mind, we can work with \(\lambda\)-calculus without worrying about
these nettlesome syntactic difficulties. So, for example, we
can’t apply the function \(\lambda x[\lambda y[x(y-5)]]\) to the
argument \(2y\) because upon substitution of “\(2y\)” for
“\(x\)”, the “\(y\)” in “\(2y\)”
would be captured by the variable-binding operator “\(\lambda
y\)”. Such a substitution would yield a function different from
the one intended. However, we can first transform \(\lambda x[\lambda
y[x(y-5)]]\) to \(\lambda x[\lambda z[x(z-5)]]\) by
\(\alpha\)-conversion, and then apply this latter function to the
argument \(2y\). So whereas the following is <em>not</em> a valid use
of \(\beta\)-conversion: 
\[ (\lambda x[\lambda y[x(y-5)]])2y  \rhd \lambda y[2y(y-5)]\]
 we can validly use
\(\beta\)-conversion to conclude: 
\[ (\lambda x[\lambda z[x(z-5)]])2y \rhd \lambda z[2y(z-5)]\]
 This example helps one
to see why the proviso to \(\beta\)-conversion is so important. The
proviso is really no different from the one used in the statement of
an axiom of the predicate calculus, namely: \(\forall x\phi \to
\phi^{\tau}_x\), provided no variable that is free in the term
\(\tau\) before the substitution becomes bound after the
substitution.</p>

<p>
The syntax of \(\lambda\)-calculus is quite flexible. One can form all
sorts of terms, even self-applications such as \(xx\). Such terms
appear at first blush to be suspicious; one might suspect that using
such terms could lead to inconsistency, and in any case one might find
oneself reaching for a tool with which to forbid such terms. If one
were to view functions and sets of ordered pairs of a certain kind,
then the \(x\) in \(xx\) would be a function (set of ordered pairs)
that contains as an element a pair \((x,y)\) whose first element would
be \(x\) itself. But no set can contain itself in this way, lest the
axiom of foundation (or regularity) be violated. Thus, from a set
theoretical perspective such terms are clearly dubious. Below one can
find a brief sketch of one such tool, type theory. But in fact such
terms do not lead to inconsistency and serve a useful purpose in the
context of \(\lambda\)-calculus. Moreover, forbidding such terms, as
in type theory, does not come for free (e.g., some of the
expressiveness of untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus is lost).</p>

<h3><a name="Com">2.2 Combinators</a></h3>

<p>
As defined earlier, a <strong><em>combinator</em></strong> is a
\(\lambda\)-term with no free variables. One can intuitively
understand combinators as ‘completely specified’
operations, since they have no free variables. There are a handful of
combinators that have proven useful in the history of
\(\lambda\)-calculus; the next table highlights some of these special
combinators. Many more could be given (and obviously there are
infinitely many combinators), but the following have concise
definitions and have proved their utility. Below is a table of some
standard \(\lambda\)-terms and combinators.</p>

Usually, parentheses are used to separate the function from the

grouping symbols. Thus, it is safe to write the function and the

such as ‘\(PQR\)’? Recall our convention that we are to
understand such officially illegal expressions by working from left to
right, always putting parentheses around adjacent terms. Thus,
‘\(PQR\)’ is to be understood as \((PQ)R\).
‘\(PQRS\)’ is \(((PQ)R)S\). The expression
‘\((PQ)R\)’ is disambiguated; by our convention, it is
identical to \(PQR\). The expression ‘\(P(QR)\)’ is also
explicitly disambiguated; it is distinct from \(PQR\) because it is
the application of \(P\) to the argument \(QR\) (which is itself the
application of the function \(Q\) to the argument \(R)\).</p></td>

The official vocabulary of the \(\lambda\)-calculus consists of the
symbol ‘\(\lambda\)’, left ‘(’and right

chaos).</p>

<p>
<strong>Alternative notation</strong>. It is not necessary to include
two kinds of grouping symbols (parentheses and square brackets) in the
syntax. Parentheses or square brackets alone would obviously suffice.
The two kinds of brackets are employed in this entry for the sake of
readability. Given the two kinds of grouping symbols, we could
economize further and omit the parentheses from abstraction terms, so
that ‘\((\lambda x[M]\))’ would be written as
‘\(\lambda x[M]\)’.</p>

<p>
Some authors write ‘\(\lambda x.M\)’ or ‘\(\lambda
x\cdot M\)’, with a full stop or a centered dot separating the
bound variable from the body of the abstraction term. As with the
square brackets, these devices are intended to assist reading
\(\lambda\)-terms; they are usually not part of the official syntax.
(One sees this device used in earlier works of logic, such as
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, where the function of the symbol
<strong>.</strong> in expressions such as ‘\(\forall
x\)<strong>.</strong>\(\phi\)’ is to get us to read the whole of
the formula \(\phi\) as under the scope of the \(\forall x\).)</p>

<p>
Some authors write abstraction terms without any device separating the
bound variable from the body: such terms are crisply written as, e.g.,
‘\(\lambda xx\)’, ‘\(\lambda yx\)’. The
practice is not without its merits: it is about as concise as one can
ask for, and permits an even simpler official syntax of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus. But this practice is not flawless. In
‘\(\lambda xyz\)’, is the bound variable \(x\) or is it
\(xy\)? Usually the names of variables are single letters, and
theoretically this is clearly sufficient. But it seems unduly
restrictive to forbid the practice of giving longer names to
variables; indeed, such constructions arise naturally in computer
programming languages.</p>

in this entry. (Incidentally, this notation is used in (Turing,

Which notation to use for substitution seems to be a personal matter.
In this entry we use a linear notation, eschewing superscripts and

As with the square brackets employed to write abstraction terms, the

<h2><a name="BriHisLCal">3. Brief history of \(\lambda\)-calculus</a></h2>

<p>
\(\lambda\)-calculus arose from the study of functions as rules.
Already the essential ingredients of the subject can be found in
Frege’s pioneering work (Frege, 1893). Frege observed, as we did
above, that in the study of functions it is sufficient to focus on
unary functions (i.e., functions that take exactly one argument). (The
procedure of viewing a multiple-arity operation as a sequence of
abstractions that yield an equivalent unary operation is called
<strong><em>currying</em></strong> the operation. Perhaps it would be
more historically accurate to call the operation
<strong><em>fregeing</em></strong>, but there are often miscarriages
of justice in the appellation of mathematical ideas.) In the 1920s,
the mathematician Moses Schönfinkel took the subject further with
his study of so-called <em>combinators</em>. As was common in the
early days of the subject, Schönfinkel was interested in the
kinds of transformations that one sees in formal logic, and his
combinators were intended to be a contribution to the foundations of
formal logic. By analogy with the reduction that one sees in classical
propositional logic with the Sheffer stroke, Schöfinkel
established the astonishing result that the all functions (in the
sense of all transformations) could be given in terms of the
combinators \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\bS\); later we will see the
definition of these combinators.</p>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> For every term \(M\) made up of
\(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\bS\) and the variable \(x\), there exists a term
\(F\) (built only from \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\bS)\) such that we can
derive \(Fx = M\).</p>

<p>
(The proof that these two suffice to represent all functions is beyond
the scope of this entry. For further discussion, see the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-combinatory/">combinatory logic</a>.)
 One can prove the theorem constructively: there is an algorithm that,
given \(M\), produces the required \(F\). Church called this \(F\)
‘\(\lambda x[M]\)’ (Church,
 1932).<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 From this perspective, the \(\beta\)-rule can be justified: if
‘\(\lambda x[M]\)’ is to be a function \(F\) satisfying
\(Fx = M\), then \(\lambda x[M]\)x should transform to \(M\). This is
just a special case of the more general principle that for all \(N,
(\lambda x[M])N\) should transform to \(M[x := N]\).</p>

<p>
Although today we have more clearly delimited systems of abstraction
and rewriting, in its early days \(\lambda\)-calculus and combinatory
logic (à la Schönfinkel) were bound up with investigations
of foundations of mathematics. In the hands of Curry, Church, Kleene,
and Rosser (some of the pioneers in the subject) the focus was on
defining mathematical objects and carrying out logical reasoning
inside the these new systems. It turned out that these early attempts
at so-called illative \(\lambda\)-calculus and combinatory logic were
inconsistent. Curry isolated and polished the inconsistency; the
result is now known as Curry’s paradox. See the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/">Curry’s paradox</a>
 and appendix B of (Barendregt, 1985).</p>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus earns a special place in the history of logic
because it was the source of the first undecidable problem. The
problem is: given \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\) and \(N\), determine whether
<span>\(M = N\)</span>. (A theory of equational reasoning
about \(\lambda\)-terms has not yet been defined; the definition will
come later.) This problem was shown to be undecidable.</p>

<p>
Another early problem in the \(\lambda\)-calculus was whether it is
consistent at all. In this context, inconsistency means that all terms
are equal: one can reduce any \(\lambda\)-term \(M\) to any other
\(\lambda\)-term \(N\). That this is not the case is an early result
of \(\lambda\)-calculus. Initially one had results showing that
certain terms were not interconvertible (e.g., \(\mathbf{K}\) and
\(\bS)\); later, a much more powerful result, the so-called
Church-Rosser theorem, helped shed more light on \(\beta\)-conversion
and could be used to give quick proofs of the non-inter-convertibility
of whole classes of \(\lambda\)-terms. See below for more detailed
discussion of consistency.</p>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus was a somewhat obscure formalism until the
1960s, when, at last, a ‘mathematical’ semantics was
found. Its relation to programming languages was also clarified. Till
then the only models of \(\lambda\)-calculus were
‘syntactic’, that is, were generated in the style of
Henkin and consisted of equivalence classes of \(\lambda\)-terms (for
suitable notions of equivalence). Applications in the semantics of
natural language, thanks to developments by Montague and other
linguists, helped to ‘spread the word’ about the subject.
Since then the \(\lambda\)-calculus enjoys a respectable place in
mathematical logic, computer science, linguistics (see, e.g., Heim and
Kratzer 1998), and kindred fields.</p>

<h2><a name="Red">4. Reduction</a></h2>

<p>
Various notions of reduction for \(\lambda\)-terms are available, but
the principal one is \(\beta\)-reduction, which we have already seen
earlier. Earlier we used the notation ‘\(\rhd\)’; we can
be more precise. In this section we discuss \(\beta\)-reduction and
some extensions.</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (one-step \(\beta\)-reduction
\(\rhd_{\beta ,1})\) For \(\lambda\)-terms \(A\) and \(B\), we say
that \(A\) \(\beta\)-reduces in one step to \(B\), written \(A
\rhd_{\beta ,1} B\), just in case there exists an (occurrence of a)
subterm \(C\) of \(A\), a variable \(x\), and \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\)
and \(N\) such that \(C \equiv(\lambda x[M])N\) and \(B\) is \(A\)
except that the occurrence of \(C\) in \(A\) is replaced by \(M[x :=
N]\).</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of \(\beta\)-reduction:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
The variable \(x\) does not \(\beta\)-reduce to anything. (It does not
have the right shape: it is simply a variable, not an application term
whose left-hand side is an abstraction term.)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\((\lambda x[x])a \rhd_{\beta ,1} a\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(x\) and \(y\) are distinct variables, then \((\lambda x[y])a
\rhd_{\beta ,1} y\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term \((\lambda x[(\lambda y[xy])a])b]\)
\(\beta\)-reduces in one step to two different \(\lambda\)-terms:</p>

\[
(\lambda x[(\lambda y[xy])a])b \rhd_{\beta ,1} (\lambda y[by])a
\]

<p>
and</p> 
\[
(\lambda x[(\lambda y[xy])a])b \rhd_{\beta ,1} (\lambda x[xa])b
\]

<p>
Moreover, one can check that these two terms \(\beta\)-reduce in one
step to a common term: \(ba\). We thus have:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
  <td>\((\lambda y[by])a\)</td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>\(\nearrow\)</td>

  <td></td>
  <td>\((\lambda x[xa])b\)</td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td> </tr>
</tbody></table> </li>
</ol>

<p>
As with any binary relation, one can ask many questions about the
relation \(\rhd_{\beta ,1}\) holding between \(\lambda\)-terms, and
one can define various derived notions in terms of \(\rhd_{\beta
,1}\).</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction
sequence</em></strong> from a \(\lambda\)-term \(A\) to a
\(\lambda\)-term \(B\) is a finite sequence \(s_1 , \ldots s_n\) of
\(\lambda\)-terms starting with \(A\), ending with \(B\), and whose
adjacent terms \((s_k,s_{k+1})\) satisfy the property that \(s_k
\rhd_{\beta ,1} s_{k+1}\).</p>

<p>
More generally, any sequence \(s\)—finite or
infinite—starting with a \(\lambda\)-term \(A\) is said to be a
\(\beta\)-reduction sequence commencing with \(A\) provided that the
adjacent terms \((s_k,s_{k+1})\) of \(s\) satisfy the property that
\(s_k \rhd_{\beta ,1} s_{k+1}\).</p>
</div>

<ol title="\(\beta\)-reduction sequence examples">

<li>

<p>
Continuing with \(\beta\)-reduction Example 1, there are no
\(\beta\)-reduction sequences at all commencing with the variable
\(x\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Continuing with \(\beta\)-reduction Example 2, the two-term
sequence</p> 
\[
(\lambda x[x])a, a
\]

<p>
is a \(\beta\)-reduction sequence from \((\lambda x[x])a\) to \(a\).
If \(a\) is a variable, then this \(\beta\)-reduction sequence cannot
be prolonged, and there are no other \(\beta\)-reduction sequences
commencing with \((\lambda x[x])a\); thus, the set of
\(\beta\)-reduction sequences commencing with \((\lambda x[x])a\) is
finite and contains no infinite sequences.</p></li>

<li id="beta-reduction-sequence-example-3">The combinator
\(\boldsymbol{\Omega}\) has the curious property that \(\Omega
\rhd_{\beta ,1} \Omega\). Every term of every \(\beta\)-reduction
sequence commencing with \(\boldsymbol{\Omega}\) (finite or infinite)
is equal to \(\boldsymbol{\Omega}\).</li>

<li id="beta-reduction-sequence-example-4">

<p>
Consider the term \(\mathbf{K}a\boldsymbol{\Omega}\). There are
infinitely many reduction sequences commencing with this term:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\bK a\boldsymbol{\Omega} \rhd_{\beta ,1} a\)</li>

<li>\(\bK a\boldsymbol{\Omega} \rhd_{\beta ,1} \bK

a\boldsymbol{\Omega} \rhd_{\beta ,1} \bK a\boldsymbol{\Omega}
\ldots\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If \(a\) is a variable, one can see that all finite reduction
sequences commencing with \(\bK a\boldsymbol{\Omega}\) end at \(a\),
and there is exactly one infinite reduction sequence.</p> </li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A
<strong><em>\(\beta\)-redex</em></strong> of a \(\lambda\)-term \(M\)
is (an occurrence of) a subterm of \(M\) of the form \((\lambda
x[P])Q\). (‘redex’ comes from ‘reducible
expression.) A \(\beta\)-redex is simply a candidate for an
application of \(\beta\)-reduction. Doing so, one
<strong><em>contracts</em></strong> the \(\beta\)-redex. A term is
said to be in <strong><em>\(\beta\)-normal form</em></strong> if it
has no \(\beta\)-redexes.</p>

<p>
(Can a term have multiple \(\beta\)-normal forms? The answer is
literally ‘yes’, but substantially the answer is
‘no’: If a \(M\) and \(M&#39;\) are \(\beta\)-normal forms of
some term, then \(M\) is \(\alpha\)-convertible to \(M&#39;\) Thus,
\(\beta\)-normal forms are unique up to changes of bound
variables.)</p>

<p>
So far we have focused only on one step of \(\beta\)-reduction. One
can combine multiple \(\beta\)-reduction steps into one by taking the
transitive closure of the relation \(\rhd_{\beta ,1}\).</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> For \(\lambda\)-terms \(A\) and \(B\), one
says that \(A\) <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduces</em></strong> to \(B\),
written \(A \rhd_{\beta} B\), if either \(A \equiv B\) or there exists
a finite \(\beta\)-reduction sequence from \(A\) to \(B\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A term \(M\) <strong><em>has a
\(\beta\)-normal form</em></strong> if there exists a term \(N\) such
that \(N\) is in \(\beta\)-normal form an \(M \rhd_{\beta} N\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Reducibility as defined is a one-way relation: it is generally not
true that if \(A \rhd_{\beta} B\), then \(B \rhd_{\beta} A\). However,
depending on one’s purposes, one may wish to treat \(A\) and
\(B\) as equivalent if either \(A\) reduces to \(B\) or \(B\) reduces
to \(A\). Doing so amounts to considering the reflexive, symmetric,
and transitive closure of the relation \(\rhd_{\beta ,1,}\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> For \(\lambda\)-terms \(A\) and \(B\), we
say that \(A =_{\beta} B\) if either \(A \equiv B\) or there exists a
sequence \(s_1 , \ldots s_n\) starting with \(A\), ending with \(B\),
and whose adjacent terms \((s_k,s_{k+1})\) are such that either \(s_k
\rhd_{\beta ,1} s_{k+1}\) or \(s_{k+1} \rhd_{\beta ,1} s_k\).</p>

<h3><a name="OthNotRed">4.1 Other notions of reduction</a></h3>

<p>
We have thus far developed the theory of \(\beta\)-reduction. This is
by no means the only notion of reduction available in the
\(\lambda\)-calculus. In addition to \(\beta\)-reduction, a standard
relation between \(\lambda\)-terms is that of
<strong><em>\(\eta\)-reduction</em></strong>:</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (one-step \(\eta\)-reduction) For
\(\lambda\)-terms \(A\) and \(B\), we say that \(A\) \(\beta
\eta\)-reduces in one step to \(B\), written \(A \rhd_{\beta \eta ,1}
B\), just in case there exists an (occurrence of a) subterm \(C\) of
\(A\), a variable \(x\), and \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\) and \(N\) such
that either</p>

<p>
\(C \equiv(\lambda x[M])N\) and \(B\) is \(A\) except that the
occurrence of \(C\) in \(A\) is replaced by \(M[x := N]\)</p>

<p>
or</p>

<p>
\(C \equiv(\lambda x[Mx]\)) and \(B\) is \(A\) except that the
occurrence of \(C\) in \(A\) is replaced by \(M\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The first clause in the definition of \(\rhd_{\beta \eta ,1}\) ensures
that the relation extends the relation of one-step
\(\beta\)-reduction. As we did for the relation of one-step
\(\beta\)-reduction, we can replay the development for
\(\eta\)-reduction. Thus, one has the notion of an \(\eta\)-redex, and
from \(\rhd_{\eta ,1}\) one can define the relation \(\rhd_{\eta}\)
between \(\lambda\)-terms as the reflexive and transitive closure of
\(\rhd_{\eta ,1}\), which captures zero-or-more-steps of
\(\eta\)-reduction. Then one defines \(=_{\eta}\) as the symmetric and
transitive closure of \(\rhd_{\eta}\).</p>

<p>
If \(A \rhd_{\eta ,1} B\), then the length of \(B\) is strictly
smaller than that of \(A\). Thus, there can be no infinite
\(\eta\)-reductions. This is not the case of \(\beta\)-reduction, as
we saw above in
 <a href="#beta-reduction-sequence-example-3">\(\beta\)-reduction sequence examples 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#beta-reduction-sequence-example-4">4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
One can combine notions of reduction. One useful combination is to
blend \(\beta\)- and \(\eta\)-reduction.</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (one-step \(\beta \eta\)-reduction)
\(\lambda x[Mx] \rhd_{\beta \eta ,1} M\) and \((\lambda x[M]N))
\rhd_{\beta \eta ,1} M[x := N]\). A \(\lambda\)-term \(A\) \(\beta
\eta\)-reduces in one step to a \(\lambda\)-term \(B\) just in case
either \(A\) \(\beta\)-reduces to \(B\) in one step or \(A\)
\(\eta\)-reduces to \(B\) in one step.</p>

<p>
Again, one can replay the basic concepts of reduction, as we did for
\(\beta\)-reduction, for this new notion of reduction \(\beta
\eta\).</p>

<h3><a name="RedStr">4.2 Reduction strategies</a></h3>

<p>
Recall that a term is said to be in \(\beta\)-normal form if it has no
\(\beta\)-redexes, that is, subterms of the shape \((\lambda x[M]\))N.
A term has a \(\beta\)-normal form if it can be reduced to a term in
\(\beta\)-normal form. It should be intuitively clear that if a term
has a \(\beta\)-normal form, then we can find one by exhaustively
contracting all all \(\beta\)-redexes of the term, then exhaustively
contracting all \(\beta\)-redexes of all resulting terms, and so
forth. To say that a term has a \(\beta\)-normal form amounts to
saying that this blind search for one will eventually terminate.</p>

<p>
Blind search for \(\beta\)-normal forms is not satisfactory. In
addition to be aesthetically unpleasant, it can be quite inefficient:
there may not be any need to exhaustively contract all
\(\beta\)-redexes. What is wanted is a
<em>strategy</em>—preferably, a computable one—for finding
a \(\beta\)-normal form. The problem is to effectively decide, if
there are multiple \(\beta\)-redexes of a term, which ought to be
reduced.</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction
strategy</em></strong> is a function whose domain is the set of all
\(\lambda\)-terms and whose value on a term \(M\) not in
\(\beta\)-normal form is a redex subterm of \(M\), and whose value on
all terms M in \(\beta\)-normal form is simply \(M\).</p>

<p>
In other words, a \(\beta\)-reduction strategy selects, whenever a
term has multiple \(\beta\)-redexes, which one should be contracted.
(If a term is in \(\beta\)-normal form, then nothing is to be done,
which is why we require in the definition of \(\beta\)-reduction
strategy that it does not change any term in \(\beta\)-normal form.)
One can represent a strategy \(S\) as a relation \(\rhd_S\) on
\(\lambda\)-terms, with the understanding that \(M \rhd_S N\) provided
that \(N\) is obtained from \(M\) in one step by adhering to the
strategy S. When viewed as relations, strategies constitute a
subrelation of \(\rhd_{\beta ,1}\).</p>

<p>
A \(\beta\)-reduction strategy may or may not have the property that
adhering to the strategy will ensure that we (eventually) reach a
\(\beta\)-normal form, if one exists.</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A \(\beta\)-reduction strategy \(S\) is
<strong><em>normalizing</em></strong> if for all \(\lambda\)-terms
\(M\), if \(M\) has a \(\beta\)-normal form \(N\), then the sequence
\(M, S(M), S(S(M)),\ldots\) terminates at \(N\).</p>

<p>
Some \(\beta\)-reduction strategies are normalizing, but others are
not.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong><em>rightmost strategy</em></strong>, whereby we
always choose to reduce the rightmost \(\beta\)-redex (if there are
any \(\beta\)-redexes) is not normalizing. Consider, for example, the
term <strong>KI\(\Omega\)</strong>. This term has two
\(\beta\)-redexes: itself, and <strong>\(\Omega\)</strong> (which,
recall, is the term
\(\omega\omega\equiv(\lambda\)x[\(xx])(\lambda\)x[\(xx]\))). By
working with left-hand \(\beta\)-redexes, we can \(\beta\)-reduce
<strong>KI\(\Omega\)</strong> to \(\mathbf{I}\) in two steps. If we
insist on working with the rightmost \(\beta\)-redex
<strong>\(\Omega\)</strong> we reduce <strong>KI(\(\Omega\))</strong>
to \(\mathbf{KI}\)(<strong>\(\Omega \)</strong>), then
\(\mathbf{KI}\)(<strong>\(\Omega\)</strong>), ….</li>

<li>The <strong><em>leftmost strategy</em></strong>, whereby we always
choose to reduce the leftmost \(\beta\)-redex (if there are any
\(\beta\)-redexes) is normalizing. The proof of this fact is beyond
the scope of this entry; see (Barendregt, 1985, section 13.2) for
details.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once we have defined a reduction strategy, it is natural to ask
whether one can improve it. If a term has a \(\beta\)-normal form,
then a strategy will discover a normal form; but might there be a
shorter \(\beta\)-reduction sequence that reaches the same normal form
(or a term that is \(\alpha\)-convertible to that normal form)? This
is the question of <em>optimality</em>. Defining optimal strategies
and showing that they are optimal is generally considerably more
difficult than simply defining a strategy. For more discussion, see
(Barendregt, 1984 chapter 10).</p>

<p>
For the sake of concreteness, we have discussed only
\(\beta\)-reduction strategies. But in the definitions above the
notion of reduction \(\beta\) is but one possibility. For any notion
\(R\) of reduction we have the associated theory of \(R\)-reduction
strategies, and one can replay the problems of normalizability,
optimality, etc., for \(R\).</p>

<h2><a name="LThe">5. \(\lambda\)-theories</a></h2>

<p>
We discussed earlier how the \(\lambda\)-calculus is a non-extensional
theory of functions. If, in the non-extensional spirit, we understand
\(\lambda\)-terms as descriptions, how should we treat equality of
\(\lambda\)-terms? Various approaches are available. In this section,
let us treat the equality relation = as a primitive, undefined
relation holding between two \(\lambda\)-terms, and try to
<em>axiomatize</em> the properties that equality should have. The task
is to identity axioms and formulate suitable <strong><em>rules of
inference</em></strong> concerning the equality of
\(\lambda\)-terms.</p>

<p>
Some obvious properties of equality, having nothing to do with
\(\lambda\)-calculus, are as follows:</p><p> 
\[\tag{Reflexivity}
\frac{}{X=X}
\]
 
\[\tag{Symmetry}
\frac{X=Y}{Y=X}
\]

\[\tag{Transitivity}
\frac{X=Y \quad Y=Z}{X=Z}
\]

</p><p>
As is standard in proof theory, the way to read these rules of
inference is that above the horizontal rule \(\frac{}{\phantom{X=X}}\)
are the <strong><em>premises</em></strong> of the rule (which are
equations) and the equation below the horizontal rule is the
<strong><em>conclusion</em></strong> of the rule of inference. In the
case of the reflexivity rule, nothing is written above the horizontal
rule. We understand such a case as saying that, for all terms \(X\),
we may infer the equation \(X = X\) from no premises.</p>

<h3><a name="BasTheL">5.1 The basic theory \(\lambda\)</a></h3>

<p>
The three rules of inference listed in the previous section governing
equality have nothing to do with the \(\lambda\)-calculus. The
following lists rules of inference that relate the undefined notion of
equality and the two term-building operations of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus, application and abstraction.</p><p> 
\[
\frac{M=N}{AM=AN} \quad \frac{M=N}{MA=NA}
\]

\[
\tag{\(\boldsymbol{\xi}\)}
\frac{M=N}{\lambda x[M] = \lambda x[N]}
\]

</p><p>
Together, these rules of inference say that = is a
<strong><em>congruence relation</em></strong> on the set of
\(\lambda\)-terms: it ‘preserves’ both the application and
abstraction term-building operations</p>

<p>
The final rule of inference, \(\beta\)-conversion, is the most
important:</p><p> 
\[\tag{\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)}
\frac{}{(\lambda x[M])A = M[x := A]}
\]

</p><p>
As before with the reflexivity rule, the rule \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)
has no premises: for any variable \(x\) and any terms \(M\) and \(A\),
one can infer the equation \((\lambda x[M])A = M[x := A]\) at any
point in a formal derivation in the theory
\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\).</p>

<h3><a name="ExtBasTheL">5.2 Extending the basic theory \(\lambda\)</a></h3>

<p>
A number of extensions to \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) are available.
Consider, for example, the rule (\(\boldsymbol{\eta}\)), which
expresses the principle of \(\eta\)-reduction as a rule of
inference:</p><p> 
\[\tag{\(\boldsymbol{\eta}\)}
\frac{}{\lambda x[Mx] = M} \text{ provided } x \not\in \mathbf{FV}(M)
\]

</p><p>
Rule \(\boldsymbol{\eta}\) tells us that a certain kind of abstraction
is otiose: it is safe to identify \(M\) with the function that, given
an argument \(x\), applies \(M\) to \(x\). Through this rule we can
also see that all terms are effectively functions. One can intuitively
justify this rule using the principle of \(\beta\)-reduction.</p><p>

\[\tag{\(\mathbf{Ext}\)}
\frac{Mx=Nx}{M=N}\text{ provided } x \not\in \mathbf{FV}(M) \cup \mathbf{FV}(N)
\]

</p><p>
One can view rule \(\mathbf{Ext}\) as a kind of generalization
principle. If we have derived that \(Mx = Nx\), but \(x\) figures in
neither \(M\) nor \(N\), then we have effectively shown that \(M\) and
\(N\) are alike. Compare this principle to the principle of universal
generalization in first-order logic: if we have derived \(\phi(x)\)
from a set \(\Gamma\) of hypotheses in which \(x\) is not free, then
we can conclude that \(\Gamma\) derives \(\forall x\phi\).</p>

<p>
Another productive principle in the \(\lambda\)-calculus permits us to
identify terms that ‘act’ the same:</p><p> 
\[\tag{\(\boldsymbol{\omega}\)}
\frac{\text{For all terms }x, Mx=Nx}{M=N}
\]

</p><p>
The rule \(\boldsymbol{\omega}\) has infinitely many hypotheses: on
the assumption that \(Mx = Nx\), no matter what \(x\) may be, then we
can conclude that \(M = N\). The \(\boldsymbol{\omega}\) rule is an
analogue in the \(\lambda\)-calculus of the rule of inference under
the same name in formal number theory, according to which one can
conclude the universal formula \(\forall x\phi\) provided one has
proofs for \(\phi(x := \mathbf{0}), \phi(x := \mathbf{1}),\ldots\) .
Note that unlike the rule \(\mathbf{Ext}\), the condition that \(x\)
not occur freely in \(M\) or \(N\) does not arise.</p>

<h2><a name="ConLCal">6. Consistency of the \(\lambda\)-calculus</a></h2>

<p>
Is the \(\lambda\)-calculus consistent? The question might not be
well-posed. The \(\lambda\)-calculus is not a logic for reasoning
about propositions; there is no apparent notion of contradiction
\((\bot)\) or a method of forming absurd propositions (e.g., \(p
\wedge \neg p)\). Thus ‘inconsistency’ of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus cannot mean that \(\bot\), or some formula
tantamount to \(\bot\), is derivable. A suitable notion of
‘consistent’ is, however, available. Intuitively, a logic
is inconsistent if it permits us to derive too much. The theory
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> is a theory of equations. We can thus
take inconsistency of <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> to mean: <em>all
equations are derivable</em>. Such a property, if it were true of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>, would clearly show that
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> is of little use as a formal theory.</p>

<p>
Early formulations of the idea of \(\lambda\)-calculus by A. Church
were indeed inconsistent; see (Barendregt, 1985, appendix 2) or
(Rosser, 1985) for a discussion. To take a concrete problem: how do we
know that the equation \(\bK = \mathbf{I}\) is not a theorem of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>? The two terms are obviously intuitively
distinct. \(\bK\) is a function of two arguments, whereas
\(\mathbf{I}\) is a function of one argument. If we could show that
\(\bK = \mathbf{I}\), then we could show that \(\mathbf{KK} =
\mathbf{IK}\), whence \(\mathbf{KK} = \bK\) would be a theorem of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>, along with many other equations that
strike us as intuitively unacceptable. But when we’re
investigating a formal theory such as <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>,
intuitive unacceptability by no means implies underivability. What is
missing is a deeper understanding of \(\beta\)-reduction.</p>

<p>
An early result that gave such an understanding is known as the
Church-Rosser theorem:</p>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> (Church-Rosser) If \(P \rhd_{\beta} Q\) and
\(P \rhd_{\beta}\) R, then there exists a term \(S\) such that both
\(Q \rhd_{\beta} S\) and \(R \rhd_{\beta} S\).</p>

<p>
(The proof of this theorem is quite non-trivial and is well-beyond the
scope of this entry.) The result is a deep fact about
\(\beta\)-reduction. It says that no matter how we diverge from \(P\)
by \(\beta\)-reductions, we can always converge again to a common
term.</p>

<p>
The Church-Rosser theorem gives us, among other things, that the plain
\(\lambda\)-calculus—that is, the theory
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> of equations between
\(\lambda\)-terms—is consistent, in the sense that not all
equations are derivable.</p>

<p>
As an illustration, we can use the Church-Rosser theorem to solve the
earlier problem of showing that the two terms \(\bK\) and
\(\mathbf{I}\) are not identified by <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>. The
two terms are in \(\beta\)-normal form, so from them there are no
\(\beta\)-reduction sequences at all. If \(\bK = \mathbf{I}\) were a
theorem of <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>, then there would be a term
\(M\) from which there is a \(\beta\)-reduction path to both
\(\mathbf{I}\) and \(\bK\). The Church-Rosser theorem then implies the
two paths diverging from \(M\) can be merged. But this is impossible,
since \(\bK\) and \(\mathbf{I}\) are distinct \(\beta\)-normal
forms.</p>

<p>
The Church-Rosser theorem implies the existence of \(\beta\)-reduction
sequences commencing from \(\bK\) and from \(\mathbf{I}\) that end at
a common term. But there are no \(\beta\)-reduction sequences at all
commencing from \(\mathbf{I}\), because it is in \(\beta\)-normal
form, and likewise for \(\bK\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> is consistent,
in the sense that not every equation is a theorem.</p>

<p>
To prove the theorem, it is sufficient to produce one underivable
equation. We have already worked through an example: we used the
Church-Rosser theorem to show that the equation \(\bK = \mathbf{I}\)
is not a theorem of <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>. Of course,
there’s nothing special about these two terms. A significant
generalization of this result is available: <em>if \(M\) and \(N\) in
\(\beta\)-normal form but \(M\) is distinct from \(N\), then the
equation \(M = N\) is not a theorem of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong></em>. (This simple condition for
underivability does not generally hold if we add additional rules of
inference to <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>.) </p>

<p>
The theories <strong>\(\lambda \eta\)</strong> and <strong>\(\lambda
\omega\)</strong> are likewise consistent. One can prove these
consistency results along the lines of the consistency proof for
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> by extending the Church-Rosser theorem to
the wider senses of derivability of these theories.</p>

<h2><a name="SemLCal">7. Semantics of \(\lambda\)-calculus</a></h2>

<p>
As we’ve said at the outset, the \(\lambda\)-calculus is, at
heart, about functions and their applications. But it is surprisingly
difficult to cash this idea out in semantic terms. A natural approach
would be to try to associate with every \(\lambda\)-term \(M\) a
function \(f_M\) over some domain \(D\) and to interpret application
terms \((MN)\) using function application as \(f_M(f_N).\) But this
idea quickly runs into difficulties. To begin with, it’s easy to
see that, in this context, we can’t use the standard
set-theoretic concept of functions-as-sets (see section
 <a href="#Non-Extensionality">1.2</a>
 of this entry). According to this concept, remember, a function \(f\)
is a set of argument-value pairs, where every argument gets assigned a
unique value. The problem arises in the context of
<em>self-applications</em>. Remember from section
 <a href="#VarBouFre">2.1</a>
 that the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus allows \(\lambda\)-terms such
as \((xx)\), which intuitively apply \(x\) to itself. On the semantic
picture we’re exploring, we can obtain the associated function
\(f_{(xx)}\) for the term \((xx)\) by taking the function \(f_x\) for
\(x\) and applying it to itself:</p><p> 
\[
f_{(xx)}=f_x(f_x)
\]

</p><p>
But following functions-as-sets, this would mean that the <em>set</em>
\(f_x\) needs to contain an argument-value pair that has \(f_x\) as
its first component and \(f_{(xx)}\) as the second: </p><p> 
\[
f_{x}=\{\ldots, (f_{x},f_{(xx)})), \ldots\}
\]

</p><p>
But this would make \(f_x\) a non-well-founded object: defining
\(f_x\) would involve \(f_x\) itself. In fact, sets like this are
excluded in standard axiomatic set theory by the axiom of foundation
(also known as the axiom of regularity). —This is further
<em>semantic</em> evidence that the concept of a function underlying
the \(\lambda\)-calculus can’t be the extensional
functions-as-sets concept. </p>

<p>
But the problem runs even deeper than that. Even when we use a
non-extensional notion of a function, such as the functions-as-rules
conception (see again section
 <a href="#Non-Extensionality">1.2</a>),
 we run into difficulties. In the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus,
everything can both be function and an argument to functions.
Correspondingly, we should want our domain \(D\) to include, in some
sense, the function space \(D^D\), which contains all and only the
functions with both arguments and values from \(D\). To see this:</p>

<ul>

<li>Every element of \(D\) can be a function that applies to elements
of \(D\), and what’s returned can then be again be an argument
for elements of \(D\). So, every element of \(D\) intuitively
corresponds to a member of \(D^D\).</li>

<li>If, in turn, we take a member of \(D^D\), i.e., a function with
arguments and values from \(D\), this is precisely the kind of thing
we want to include in our domain \(D\). So, intuitively, we want every
member of \(D^D\) to correspond to a member of \(D\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, we want there to be a <em>one-to-one correspondence</em>
between our domain and its own function space, i.e., we want them to
satisfy the ‘equation’ \(X\cong X^X\). But this is
impossible since it contradicts Cantor’s theorem.</p>

<p>
Given these difficulties, the question arises whether it’s
possible to give a set-theoretic model for the \(\lambda\)-calculus in
the first place? It turns out that it is. D. Scott was the first to
describe such a model in an unpublished manuscript from 1969. This
model, \(D_\infty\), solves the aforementioned problems with
Cantor’s theorem by suitably restricting the function space
\(D^D\), by only letting <em>some</em> members of \(D^D\) correspond
to members of \(D\). Covering Scott’s construction goes beyond
the scope of this entry, since it involves advanced tools from algebra
and topology; see (Meyer 1982), (Barendregt, 1985, chapter 18.2), or
(Hindley and Seldin, 2008, chapter 16) for details. Instead,
we’ll discuss the more general question: <em>What </em>is<em> a
model for the \(\lambda\)-calculus?</em> That is, leaving aside for a
moment the question whether sets are functions, rules, or something
altogether different, we ask what kind of mathematical structure a
model for the \(\lambda\)-calculus is in the first place.</p>

<h3><a name="LamMod">7.1 \(\lambda\)-Models</a></h3>

<p>
It turns out that there are multiple, essentially equivalent, ways of
defining the notion of a model for the \(\lambda\)-calculus; see
(Barendregt, 1985, chapter 5) or (Hindley and Seldin, 2008, chapter
15). In the following, we’ll discuss what we consider the most
palatable notion for philosophers familiar with the standard semantics
for first-order logic (see, e.g., the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/">Classical Logic </a>),
 the so-called <strong><em>syntactical
\(\lambda\)-models</em></strong>. These models first appear in the
work of (Hindley and Longo, 1980), (Koymans, 1982), and (Meyer 1982).
They derive their name from the fact that their clauses closely
correspond to the syntactic rules of the calculus
\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\). This is somewhat unsatisfactory and
motivates ‘syntax-free’ definitions (see below). At the
same time, the syntactical \(\lambda\)-models provide a fairly
transparent and accessible route into the world of \(\lambda\)-models.
In addition, despite their conceptual shortcomings, syntactical models
have proven a technically useful tool in the semantical study of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus.</p>

<p>
In order to avoid the set-theoretic problems mentioned above, most
definitions of \(\lambda\)-models use so-called
<strong><em>applicative structures</em></strong>. The idea is to treat
the denotations of \(\lambda\)-terms not as set-theoretic functions,
but as unanalyzed, first-order ‘function-objects’,
instead. Correspondingly, then, we treat function application as an
unanalyzed binary operation on these function-objects:</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> An <em>applicative structure</em> is a
pair \((D,\cdot)\), where \(D\) is some set and \(\cdot\) a binary
operation on \(D\). To avoid trivial models, we usually assume that
\(D\) has at least two elements.</p>

<p>
Applicative structures are, in a sense, first-order models of function
spaces that satisfy the problematic equation \(X\cong X^X\).
\(\lambda\)-models, in turn, are defined over them.</p>

<p>
For the definition of our \(\lambda\)-models, we work with
<strong><em>valuations</em></strong>—a concept familiar from
first-order semantics. Valuations assign denotations to the variables
and are used primarily in the semantic clauses for the
\(\lambda\)-operator. Additionally, they can be used to express
general claims over the domain, in a way that is familiar from the
semantics for the first-order quantifiers \(\exists x\) and \(\forall
x\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A <em>valuation</em> in an applicative
structure \((D,\cdot)\) is a function \(\rho\) that assigns an element
\(\rho(x)\in D\) to every variable \(x\).</p>

<p>
As a useful piece of notation, for \(\rho\) a valuation in some
applicative structure \((D,\cdot)\), \(x\) a variable, and \(d\in D\)
an object, we define the valuation \(\rho[x\mapsto d]\) by saying
that: 
\[\rho[x\mapsto d](y)=\begin{cases} d &amp; \text{ if }y=x\\
  \rho(y) &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]
 That is, \(\rho[x\mapsto d]\) is the result of
changing the value of \(x\) to be \(d\), while leaving all other other
values under \(\rho\) unchanged.</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A <em>syntactical \(\lambda\)-model</em>
is a triple \(\mathfrak{M}=(D,\cdot,\llbracket \ \rrbracket)\), where
\((D,\cdot)\) is an applicative structure and \(\llbracket \
\rrbracket\) is a function that assigns to every \(\lambda\)-term M
and valuation \(\rho\) a denotation \(\llbracket M\rrbracket_\rho\in
D\) subject to the following constraints:</p>

<ol>

<li>\(\llbracket x\rrbracket_\rho=\rho(x)\)</li>

<li>\(\llbracket MN\rrbracket_\rho=\llbracket M\rrbracket_\rho\cdot
\llbracket N\rrbracket_\rho\)</li>

<li>\(\llbracket \lambda xM\rrbracket_\rho\cdot d=\llbracket
M\rrbracket_{\rho[x\mapsto d]}\), for all \(d\in D\)</li>

<li>\(\llbracket \lambda xM\rrbracket_\rho = \llbracket \lambda
xN\rrbracket_\rho\), whenever for all \(d\in D\), we have \(\llbracket
M\rrbracket_{\rho[x\mapsto d]}=\llbracket N\rrbracket_{\rho[x\mapsto
d]}\)</li>

<li>\(\llbracket M\rrbracket_\rho=\llbracket M\rrbracket_\sigma\),
whenever \(\rho(x)=\sigma(x)\) for all \(x\in \mathbf{FV}(M)\)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Intuitively, in a model \(\mathfrak{M}\), \(\llbracket
M\rrbracket_\rho\) is the function-object denoted by the
\(\lambda\)-term \(M\) under the valuation \(\rho\).</p>

<p>
It is now straight-forward to define what it means for a
\(\lambda\)-model \(\mathfrak{M}\) to satisfy an equation \(M=N\),
symbolically \(\mathfrak{M}\vDash M=N\):</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (satisfaction).</p><p> 
\[\mathfrak{M}\vDash M=N\text{ iff for all }\rho\text{, we have }
\llbracket M\rrbracket_\rho=\llbracket N\rrbracket_\rho\]

</p></div>

<p>
In words: an equation \(M=N\) holds in a model \(\mathfrak{M}\) just
in case the \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\) and \(N\) have the same denotation
under every valuation in the underlying applicative structure.</p>

<p>
Note that clauses 3. and 4. from the definition of a syntactical
\(\lambda\)-model directly mirror the \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\)-rules
\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\), respectively (see
section
 <a href="#BasTheL">5.1</a>
 above). This is the ‘syntactic’ nature of our models.
While this might be semantically unsatisfactory (see below), it makes
it relatively straight-forward to prove a soundness theorem for the
semantics provided by the syntactical \(\lambda\)-models; see
(Barendregt, 1985, Theorem 5.3.4) and (Hindley and Seldin, 2008.
Theorem 15.12):</p>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> For all terms \(M,N\), if \(M=N\) is
derivable in \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\), then for all syntactical
\(\lambda\)-models \(\mathfrak{M}\), we have that \(\mathfrak{M}\vDash
M=N\). </p>

<p>
This theorem provides a first ‘sanity-check’ for the
semantics. But note that, so far, we haven’t shown that there
<em>exist</em> any syntactical \(\lambda\)-models at all.</p>

<p>
This worry is addressed by constructing so-called ‘term
models’, which are not unlike the well-known Henkin
constructions from first-order semantics. In order to define these
models, we first need the notion of a
<em>\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\)-equivalence class</em> for a given
\(\lambda\)-term \(M\). This class contains precisely the terms that
\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) proves identical to \(M\): </p><p> 
\[
[M]_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}=\{N:\boldsymbol{\lambda}\text{ proves }M=N\}
\]

</p><p>
We then define the <strong><em>term model</em></strong> for
\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\), \(\mathfrak{T}\), by setting:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(D=\{[M]_\boldsymbol{\lambda}:M\text{ is a
}\lambda\text{-term}\}\)</li>

<li>\([M]_\boldsymbol{\lambda}\cdot
[N]_\boldsymbol{\lambda}=[MN]_\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) </li>

<li> \(\llbracket
M\rrbracket_\rho=[M[x_1:=N_1]\ldots[x_n:=N_n]]_\boldsymbol{\lambda}\),
where \(\mathbf{FV}(M)=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}\) and \(\rho(x_1)=N_1,
\ldots,\rho(x_n)=N_n\) </li>
</ul>

<p>
It is easily seen that this indeed defines a syntactical
\(\lambda\)-model. In fact, it is easily checked that in the term
model for \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\), we have that:</p><p> 
\[ \mathfrak{T}\vDash M=N\text{ iff
}\boldsymbol{\lambda}\text{ derives }M=N. \]

</p><p>
This paves a way for a very simple completeness proof for
\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) with respect to the class of syntactical
\(\lambda\)-models; see (Meyer, 1982, 98–99) for one of the few
explicit mentions of this kind of result in the literature:</p>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> For all terms \(M,N\), if for all syntactical
\(\lambda\)-models \(\mathfrak{M}\), we have that \(\mathfrak{M}\vDash
M=N\), then \(M=N\) is derivable in \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\). </p>

<p>
The proof is a simple proof by contraposition, which uses the term
model \(\mathfrak{T}\) as a countermodel to any non-derivable identity
in \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\).</p>

<p>
But there are reasons to be dissatisfied with the syntactical
\(\lambda\)-models as a semantics for the \(\lambda\)-calculus. For
one, by virtue of clauses 3. and 4. mirroring rules
\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\), the soundness result
is ‘baked into’ the semantics, as it were. This is
unsatisfactory from a semantic perspective since it means that via the
syntactical \(\lambda\)-models, we don’t really learn anything
directly about what conditions an applicative structure needs to
satisfy in order to adequately model the \(\lambda\)-calculus.</p>

<p>
A related worry is that the clauses 3. and 4. are not
<em>recursive</em> in nature. That is, they don’t allow us to
compute the denotation of a complex \(\lambda\)-term from the
denotations of its parts and information about the syntactic operation
used to combine them. In our syntax (see section
 <a href="#Syn">2</a>),
 there are two ways of constructing complex \(\lambda\)-terms:
application terms of the form \(MN\) and abstraction terms of the form
\((\lambda x[M])\). Clause 1. of our syntactical \(\lambda\)-models is
a recursive clause for the syntactical application operation, but we
don’t have a recursive clause for the syntactical operation of
\(\lambda\)-abstraction. Clauses 3. and 4. are rather conditions on
the denotation function \(\llbracket \ \rrbracket\) than recursive
clauses. This is unsatisfactory since it means that we’re not
really given a compositional semantics for the \(\lambda\)-operator by
the syntactical \(\lambda\)-models.</p>

<p>
These worries are taken care of in the development of
<strong><em>syntax-free \(\lambda\)-models</em></strong>. A
comprehensive discussion of syntax-free models goes beyond the scope
of this entry; but see (Barendregt, 1985, chapter 5.2) and (Hinley and
Seldin, 2008, chapter 15B) for the details. Suffice it to say that the
definition of syntax-free \(\lambda\)-models involves determining
precisely under which conditions an applicative structure is suitable
for interpreting the \(\lambda\)-calculus. The resulting
\(\lambda\)-models, then, indeed provide (something much closer to) a
recursive, compositional semantics, where the syntactical operation of
\(\lambda\)-abstraction is interepreted by a corresponding semantic
operation on applicative structures.</p>

<p>
It is worth noting, however, that syntactical \(\lambda\)-models and
the syntax-free \(\lambda\)-models are, in a certain sense,
equivalent: every syntactical \(\lambda\)-model defines a syntax-free
\(\lambda\)-model and vice versa; see (Barendregt, 1985, theorem
5.3.6) and (Hinley and Seldin, 2008, theorem 15.20) for the details.
From a technical perspective, this result allows us to freely move
between the different presentations of \(\lambda\)-models and to use,
in a given context, the notion of a model that is most expedient. At
the same time, there may be <em>philosophical</em> reasons to prefer
one presentation over the other, such as the semantic worries about
syntactical \(\lambda\)-models mentioned above.</p>

<p>
Before moving to model constructions, let us briefly mention that
there are various ways of approaching \(\lambda\)-models. One
particularly interesting approach we’ve neglected so far is from
the perspective of category theory and categorical logic. There are
well-known model descriptions using so-called ‘Cartesian closed
categories’; see (Koymans, 1982). Covering these model
descriptions goes beyond the scope of the present entry since it
requires a familiarity with a wide range of concepts from category
theory; see the entry
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/">Category Theory</a>
 for a sense of the machinery involved. For the details of these model
descriptions, instead, (Barendregt, 1985, sections 5.4–6). In
recent years, there has been a renewed interest in categorical
approaches to the \(\lambda\)-calculus, which have mainly focused on
typed versions of the \(\lambda\)-calculus (see sections
 <a href="#AddTyp">8.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#TypedLambda">9.1.2</a>
 below) but also include the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus discussed in
this article. See, for example, (Hyland, 2017) for a recent
discussion.</p>

<h3><a name="ModCon">7.2 Model Constructions</a></h3>

<p>
The term model we’ve seen in section
 <a href="#LamMod">7.1</a>
 is rather trivial: it directly reflects the syntactic structure of
the \(\lambda\)-terms by modeling precisely syntactic equality modulo
\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\)-provable equality. This makes the term model
mathematically and philosophically rather uninteresting. The
construction and study of more interesting concrete \(\lambda\)-models
is one of the principal aims of the model theory for the
\(\lambda\)-calculus.</p>

<p>
We’ve already mentioned what’s perhaps the most important,
but was definitely the first non-trivial model for the
\(\lambda\)-calculus: Scott’s \(D_\infty\). But there are also
other interesting model constructions, such as Plotkin and
Scott’s graph model \(P_\omega\), first described in (Plotkin
1972) and (Scott, 1974). These model constructions, however, usually
rely on fairly involved mathematical methods, both for their
definitions and for verifying that they are indeed \(\lambda\)-models.
Consequently, covering these constructions goes beyond the scope of
this entry; see (Hinley and Seldin, 2008, chapter 16F) for an overview
of various model constructions and (Barendregt, 1985, chapter 18) for
many of the formal details.</p>

<p>
One of the advantages of having different models is that one sees
different aspects of equality in the \(\lambda\)-calculus: each of the
different models takes a different view on what \(\lambda\)-terms get
identified. An interesting question in this context is: <em>What is
the \(\lambda\)-theory of a given class of models?</em> In this
context, we call a class \(\mathcal{C}\) of \(\lambda\)-models
<em>complete</em> just in case every (consistent) \(\lambda\)-theory
is satisfied by some model in \(\mathcal{C}\). See (Salibra, 2003) for
an overview of various completeness and <em>in</em>completeness
results for interesting classes of \(\lambda\)-models.</p>

<h3><a name="ComLog">8.1 Combinatory logic</a></h3>

<p>
A sister formalism of the \(\lambda\)-calculus, developed slightly
earlier, deals with variable-free combinations.
<strong><em>Combinatory logic</em></strong> is indeed even simpler
than the \(\lambda\)-calculus, since it lacks a notion of variable
binding.</p>

<p>
The language of combinatory logic is built up from
<strong><em>combinators</em></strong> and variables. There is some
flexibility in precisely which combinators are chosen as basic, but
some standard ones are \(\mathbf{I}, \bK , \bS, \mathbf{B}\) and
\(\mathbf{C}\). (The names are not arbitrary.)</p>

<p>
As with the \(\lambda\)-calculus, with combinatory logic one is
interested in <em>reducibility</em> and <em>provability</em>. The
principal reduction relations are:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>Combinator</td>
  <td>Reduction Axiom</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bI\)</td>
  <td>\(\bI x = x\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bK\)</td>
  <td>\(\bK xy = x\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bS\)</td>
  <td>\(\bS xyz = xz(yz)\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bB\)</td>
  <td>\(\bB xyz = x(yz)\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bC\)</td>
  <td>\(\bC xyz = xzy\)</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
There is a passage from \(\lambda\)-calculus to combinatory logic via
translation. It turns out that although combinatory logic lacks a
notion of abstraction, one can define such a notion and thereby
simulate the \(\lambda\)-calculus in combinatory logic. Here is one
translation; it is defined recursively.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>Rule</td>
  <td>Expression</td>
  <td>Translation</td>
  <td>Condition</td> </tr>

<p>
This translation works inside-out, rather than outside-in. To
illustrate:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
The translation of the term \(\lambda y[y]\), a representative of the
identity function, is mapped by this translation to the identity
combinator \(\bI\) (because of Rule 4), as expected.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term \(\lambda x[\lambda y[x]]\) that we have been
calling ‘\(\bK\)’is mapped by this translation to:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\lambda x[\lambda y[x]] 
  &amp;\equiv \lambda x[\bK x]  &amp;\langle \text{Rule 1}\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \bK   &amp;\langle \text{Rule 3} \rangle
\end{align}\]
 </li>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term \(\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]]\) that switches its
two arguments is mapped by this translation to:</p> 
\[\begin{align}
\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]] 
 &amp;\equiv \lambda x[\bC(\lambda y[y])^* x]  &amp;\langle\text{Rule 8}\rangle \\
 &amp;\equiv \lambda x[\bC\bI x]  &amp;\langle\lambda y[y] \equiv \bI,\text{ by Rule 4}\rangle \\
 &amp;\equiv \bB\bC\bI)(\lambda x[x])^*  &amp;\langle\text{Rule 7}\rangle \\
 &amp;\equiv \bB(\bC\bI)\bI  &amp;\langle(\lambda x[x])^* \equiv \bI,\text{ by Rule 4}\rangle
\end{align}\]

<p>
We can confirm that the \(\lambda\)-term \(\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]]\)
and the translated combinatory logic term \(\bB(\bC\bI)\bI\) have
analogous applicative behavior: for all \(\lambda\)-terms \(P\) and
\(Q\) we have</p> 
\[
(\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]])PQ \rhd (\lambda y[yP]) \rhd QP;
\]

<p>
likewise, for all combinatory logic terms \(P\) and \(Q\) we have</p>

\[
\bB(\bC\bI)\bI PQ \rhd (\bC\bI)(\bI P)Q \rhd \bI Q(\bI P) \rhd Q(\bI P) \rhd QP
\]
 </li>
</ol>

<p>
We can give but a glimpse of combinatory logic; for more on the
subject, consult the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-combinatory/">combinatory logic</a>.
 Many of the issues discussed here for \(\lambda\)-calculus have
analogues in combinatory logic, and vice versa.</p>

<h3><a name="AddTyp">8.2 Adding types</a></h3>

<p>
In many contexts of reasoning and computing it is natural to
distinguish between different kinds of objects. The way this
distinction is introduced is by requiring that certain formulas,
functions, or relations accept arguments or permit substitution only
of some kinds of objects rather than others. We might require, for
example, that addition + take numbers as arguments. The effect of this
restriction is to forbid, say, the addition of 5 and the identity
function \(\lambda
 x.x\).<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Regimenting objects into types is also the idea behind the passage
from (unsorted, or one-sorted) first-order logic to
<em>many-sorted</em> first-order logic. (See (Enderton, 2001) and
(Manzano, 2005) for more about many-sorted first-order logic.) As it
stands, the \(\lambda\)-calculus does not support this kind of
discrimination; any term can be applied to any other term.</p>

<p>
It is straightforward to extend the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus so
that it discriminates between different kinds of objects. This entry
limits itself to the <em>type-free</em> \(\lambda\)-calculus. See the
entries on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/">type theory</a>
 and
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/">Church’s type theory</a>
 for a detailed discussion of the extensions of \(\lambda\)-calculus
that we get when we add types, and see (Barendregt, Dekkers, Statman,
2013) for a book length treatment of the subject.</p>

<p>
From a model-theoretic perspective, it’s interesting to add that
(Scott, 1980) uses the semantic fact that categorical models for the
<em>un</em>typed \(\lambda\)-calculus (see section
 <a href="#LamMod">7.1</a>)
 derive from the categorical models of the typed \(\lambda\)-calculus
to argue for a conceptual priority of the typed over the untyped
calculus.</p>

<h2><a name="App">9. Applications</a></h2>

<h3><a name="LogLaL">9.1 Logic à la \(\lambda\)</a></h3>

<p>
Here are two senses in which \(\lambda\)-calculus is connected with
logic.</p>

<h4>9.1.1 Terms as logical constants</h4>

<p>
In the
 <a href="#combinator-table">table of combinators</a>
 above, we defined combinators \(\bT\) and \(\bF\) and said that they
serve as representations in the \(\lambda\)-calculus of the truth
values true and false, respectively. How do these terms function as
truth values?</p>

<p>
It turns out that when one is treating \(\lambda\)-calculus as a kind
of programming language, one can write conditional statements
“If \(P\) then \(A\) else \(B\)” simply as \(PAB\), where
of course \(P, A\), and \(B\) are understood as \(\lambda\)-terms. If
\(P \rhd \bT\), that is, P is ‘true’, then we have</p><p>

\[
\text{if-}P\text{-then-}A\text{-else-}B := PAB \rhd \bT AB \rhd A,
\]

</p><p>
(recall that, by definition, \(\bT \equiv \bK\)) and if \(P \rhd
\bF\), that is, \(P\) is ‘false’, then</p><p> 
\[
\text{if-}P\text{-then-}A\text{-else-}B := PAB \rhd \bF AB \rhd B,
\]

</p><p>
(recall that, by definition, \(\mathbf{F} \equiv \mathbf{KI})\) which
is just what we expect from a notion of if-then-else. If \(P\) reduces
neither to \(\mathbf{T}\) nor \(\mathbf{F}\), then we cannot in
general say what \(\text{if-}P\text{-then-}A\text{-else-}B\) is. </p>

<p>
The encoding we’ve just sketched of some of the familiar truth
values and logical connectives of classical truth-table logic does not
show that \(\lambda\)-calculus and classical logic are intimately
related. The encoding shows little more than embeddibility of the
rules of computation of classical truth-table logic in
\(\lambda\)-calculus. Logics other than classical truth-table logic
can likewise be represented in the \(\lambda\)-calculus, if one has
sufficient computable ingredients for the logic in question (e.g., if
the logical consequence relation is computable, or if a derivability
relation is computable, etc.). For more on computing with
\(\lambda\)-calculus, see section
 <a href="#Computing">9.2</a>
 below. A more intrinsic relationship between logic and
\(\lambda\)-calculus is discussed in the next section.</p>

<h4><a name="TypedLambda">9.1.2 Typed \(\lambda\)-calculus and the Curry-Howard-de Bruijn correspondence</a></h4>

<p>
The correspondence to be descried here between logic and the
\(\lambda\)-calculus is seen with the help of an apparatus known as
<em>types</em>. This section sketches the beginnings of the
development of the subject known as <strong><em>type
theory</em></strong>. We are interested in developing type theory only
so far as to make the so-called Curry-Howard-de Bruijn correspondence
visible. A more detailed treatment can be found in the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/">type theory</a>;
 see also (Hindley, 1997) and (Barendregt, Dekkers, Statman,
2013).</p>

<p>
Type theory enriches the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus by requiring
that terms be given <strong><em>types</em></strong>. In the untyped
\(\lambda\)-calculus, the application \(MN\) is a legal term
regardless of what \(M\) and \(N\) are. Such freedom permits one to
form such suspicious terms as \(xx\), and thence terms such as the
paradoxical combinator \(\mathbf{Y}\). One might wish to exclude terms
like \(xx\) on the grounds that \(x\) is serving both as a function
(on the left-hand side of the application) and as an argument (on the
right-hand side of the application). Type theory gives us the
resources for making this intuitive argument more precise.</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Assigning types to terms</strong> The language of type theory
begins with an (infinite) set of <strong><em>type
variables</em></strong> (which is assumed to be disjoint from the set
of variables of the \(\lambda\)-calculus and from the symbol
‘\(\lambda\)’ itself). The set of types is made up of type
variables and the operation \(\sigma \rightarrow \tau\). Variables in
type theory now come with a <strong><em>type annotation</em></strong>
(unlike the unadorned term variables of untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus).
Typed variables are rendered ‘\(x : \sigma\)’; the
intuitive reading is ‘the variable \(x\) has the type
\(\sigma\)’. The intuitive reading of the judgment ‘\(t :
\sigma \rightarrow \tau\)’ is that the term \(t\) is a function
that transforms arguments of type \(\sigma\) into arguments of type
\(\tau\). Given an assignment of types to term variables, one has the
typing rules:</p><p> 
\[
(M : \sigma \rightarrow \tau)(N : \sigma) : \tau
\]

</p><p>
and</p><p> 
\[
(\lambda x : \sigma[M : \tau]) : \sigma \rightarrow \tau
\]

</p><p>
The above two rules define the assignment of types to applications and
to abstraction terms. The set of terms of type theory is the set of
terms built up according to these formation rules.</p>
</div>

<p>
The above definition of the set of terms of type theory is sufficient
to rule out terms such as \(xx\). Of course, ‘\(xx\)’ is
not a typed term at all for the simple reason that no types have been
assigned to it. What is meant is that there is no type \(\sigma\) that
could be assigned to \(x\) such that ‘\(xx\)’ could be
annotated in a legal way to make a typed term. We cannot assign to
\(x\) a type variable, because then the type of the left-hand \(x\)
would fail to be a function type (i.e., a type of the shape
‘\(\sigma \rightarrow \tau\)’). Moreover, we cannot assign
to \(x\) a function type \(\sigma \rightarrow \tau\), because then
then \(\sigma\) would be equal to \(\sigma \rightarrow \tau\), which
is impossible.</p>

<p>
As a leading example, consider the types that are assigned to the
combinators \(\bI\), \(\bK\), and \(\bS\):</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>Combinator  </td>
 
 <td>Type<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bI\)</td>
  <td>\(a \rightarrow a\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bK\)</td>
  <td>\(a \rightarrow(b \rightarrow a)\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bS\)</td>
  <td>\( (a \rightarrow(b \rightarrow c)) \rightarrow ((a \rightarrow
b) \rightarrow(a \rightarrow c))\)</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
(See Hindley (1997) <em>Table of principal types</em> for a more
extensive listing.) If we read ‘\(\rightarrow\)’ as
implication and type variables as propositional variables, then we
recognize three familiar tautologies in the right-hand column of the
table. The language used is meager: there are only propositional
variables and implication; there are no other connectives.</p>

<p>
The table suggests an interesting correspondence between the typed
\(\lambda\)-calculus and formal logic. Could it really be that the
types assigned to formulas, when understood as logical formulas, are
valid? Yes, though ‘validity’ needs to understood not as
classical validity:</p>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> If \(\tau\) is the type of some
\(\lambda\)-term, then \(\tau\) is intuitionistically valid.</p>

<p>
The converse of this theorem holds as well:</p>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> If \(\phi\) is an intuitionistically valid
logical formula whose only connective is implication
\((\rightarrow)\), then \(\phi\) is the type of some
\(\lambda\)-term.</p>

<p>
The correspondence can be seen when one identifies intuitionistic
validity with derivability in a certain natural deduction formalism.
For a proof of these two theorems, see (Hindley, 1997, chapter 6).</p>

<p>
The correspondence expressed by the previous two theorems between
intuitionistic validity and typability is known as the
<em>Curry-Howard-de Bruijn</em> correspondence, after three logicians
who noticed it independently. The correspondence, as stated, is
between only propositional intuitionistic logic, restricted to the
fragment containing only the implication connective \(\rightarrow\).
One can extend the correspondence to other connectives and to
quantifiers, too, but the most crisp correspondence is at the level of
the implication-only fragment. For details, see (Howard, 1980).</p>

<h3><a name="Computing">9.2 Computing</a></h3>

<p>
One can represent natural numbers in a simple way, as follows:</p>

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (ordered tuples, natural numbers) The
ordered tuple \(\langle a_0,\ldots a_n\rangle\) of \(\lambda\)-terms
is defined as \(\lambda x[x a_0\ldots a_n]\). One then defines the
\(\lambda\)-term \(\ulcorner n\urcorner\) corresponding to the natural
number \(n\) as: \(\ulcorner 0\urcorner = \mathbf{I}\) and, for every
\(k\), \(\ulcorner k + 1\urcorner = \langle \mathbf{F}, \ulcorner
k\urcorner\rangle\).</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term corresponding to the number 1, on this
representation, is:</p> 
\[\begin{align}
\ulcorner 1 \urcorner &amp;\equiv \langle\bF,\ulcorner 0\urcorner\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \langle\bF,\bI\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \lambda x[x\mathbf{FI}]
\end{align}\]
 </li>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term corresponding to the number 2, on this
representation, is:</p> 
\[\begin{align}
\ulcorner 2 \urcorner &amp;\equiv \langle\bF,\ulcorner 1\urcorner\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \lambda x[x\mathbf{F}\lambda x[x\mathbf{FI}]]
\end{align}\]
 </li>

<li>

<p>
Similarly, \(\ulcorner 3\urcorner\) is \(\lambda x[x\mathbf{F}\lambda
x[x\mathbf{F}\lambda x[x\mathbf{FI}]]]\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Various representations of natural numbers are available; this
representation is but
 one.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Using the ingredients provided by the \(\lambda\)-calculus, one can
represent all recursive functions. This shows that the model is
exactly as expressive as other models of computing, such as Turing
machines and register machines. For a more detailed discussion of the
relation between these different models of computing, see the section
comparing the Turing and Church approaches in the entry on the
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/church-turing/index.html#CompTuriChurAppr">Church-Turing Thesis</a>.</p>
 
<div>

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> For every recursive function \(f\) of arity
\(n\), there exists a \(\lambda\)-term \(f^*\) such that</p>

<p>
for all natural numbers \(a_1,\ldots a_n\): \(f(a_1,\ldots a_n) = y\)
iff \(\boldsymbol{\lambda} \vdash f^*\langle
\bar{a}_1,\ldots,\bar{a}_n\rangle = \bar{y}\) </p>
</div>

<p>
For a proof, see
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/recursive-functions.html">the appendix</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Since the class of recursive functions is an adequate representation
of the class of all computable (number-theoretic) functions, thanks to
the work above we find that all computable (number-theoretic)
functions can be faithfully represented in the
\(\lambda\)-calculus.</p>

<h3><a name="Relations">9.3 Relations</a></h3>

<p>
The motivation for the \(\lambda\)-calculus given at the beginning of
the entry was based on reading \(\lambda\)-expressions as descriptions
of functions. Thus, we have understood ‘\(\lambda x[M]\)’
to be a (or the) function that, given \(x\), gives \(M\) (which
generally, though not necessarily, involves x). But it is not
necessary to read \(\lambda\)-terms as functions. One could understand
\(\lambda\)-terms as denoting relations, and read an abstraction term
‘\(\lambda x[M]\)’ as the unary relation (or property)
\(R\) that holds of an argument \(x\) just in case \(M\) does (see
Carnap 1947, p. 3). On the relational reading, we can understand an
application term \(MN\) as a form of predication. One can make sense
of these terms using the principle of \(\beta\)-conversion:</p><p>

\[
(\lambda x[M])a = M[x := A],
\]

</p><p>
which says that the abstraction relation \(\lambda x[M]\), predicated
of A, is the relation obtained by plugging in A for all free
occurrences of \(x\) inside \(M\).</p>

<p>
As a concrete example of this kind of approach to
\(\lambda\)-calculus, consider an extension of first-order logic where
one can form new atomic formulas using \(\lambda\)-terms, in the
following way:</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: For any formula \(\phi\) and any finite
sequence \(x_1 , \ldots ,x_n\) of variables, the expression
‘\(\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi]\)’ is a predicate symbol
of arity n. Extend the notion of free and bound variables (using the
functions \(\mathbf{FV}\) and \(\mathbf{BV})\) in such a way that</p><p>

\[
\mathbf{FV}(\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi]) = \mathbf{FV}(\phi) - \{ x_1 , \ldots x_n \}
\]

</p><p>
and</p><p> 
\[
\mathbf{BV}(\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi]) = \mathbf{BV}(\phi) \cup \{ x_1 , \ldots x_n \}
\]

</p><p>
<strong>Deduction</strong> Assume as axioms the universal closures of
all equivalences</p><p> 
\[
\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi](t_1 ,\ldots t_n) \leftrightarrow \phi[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots t_n]
\]

</p><p>
where \(\phi[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots t_n]\) denotes the
simultaneous substitution of the terms \(t_k\) for the variables
\(x_k\) \((1 \le k \le n)\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Semantics</strong> For a first-order structure \(A\) and an
assignment \(s\) of elements of \(A\) to variables, define</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A \vDash &amp;\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi](t_1 ,\ldots t_n) [s] \text{ iff } \\
         &amp;A \vDash \phi[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots t_n] [s]
\end{align}\]

</p></div>

<p>
According to this approach, one can use a \(\lambda\) to treat
essentially any formula, even complex ones, as if they were atomic. We
see the principle of \(\beta\)-reduction in the deductive and semantic
parts. That this approach adheres to the relational reading of
\(\lambda\) terms can be seen clearly in the semantics: according to
the standard Tarski-style semantics for first-order logic, the
interpretation of a formula (possibly with free variables) denotes a
set of tuples of elements of the structure, as we vary the variable
assignment that assigns elements of the structure to the
variables.</p>

<p>
One can ‘internalize’ this functional approach. This is
done in the case of various <em>property theories</em>, formal
theories for reasoning about properties as metaphysical objects
(Bealer 1982, Zalta 1983, Menzel 1986, 1993, and Turner 1987). This
kind of theory is employed in certain metaphysical investigations
where properties are metaphysical entities to be investigated. In
these theories, metaphysical relations are (or are among) the objects
of interest; just as we add term-building symbols + and \(\times\) in
formal theories of arithmetic to build numbers, \(\lambda\) is used in
property theory to build relations. This approach contrasts with the
approach above. There, \(\lambda\) was added to the grammar of
first-order logic by making it a recipe for building atomic formulas;
it was a new formula-building operator, like \(\vee\) or
\(\rightarrow\) or the other connectives. In the case of property
theories, the \(\lambda\) plays a role more like + and \(\times\) in
formal theories of arithmetic: it is used to construct relations
(which, in this setting, are to be understood as a kind of
metaphysical object). Unlike + and \(\times\), though, the \(\lambda\)
binds variables.</p>

<p>
To give an illustration of how \(\lambda\) is used in this setting,
let us inspect the grammar of a typical application (McMichael and
Zalta, 1980). One typically has a <em>predication operator</em> (or,
more precisely, a family of predication operators) \(p_k (k \ge 0)\).
In a language where we have terms \(\mary\) and \(\john\) and a binary
relation loves, we can formally express:</p>

<ul>

<li>John loves Mary: \(\loves(\john ,\mary)\)</li>

<li>The property that John loves Mary: \(\lambda[\loves(\john
,\mary)]\) (note that the \(\lambda\) is binding no variables; we
might call this ‘vacuous binding’. Such properties can be
understood as propositions.)</li>

<li>The property of an object \(x\) that John loves it: \(\lambda x
[\loves(\john,x)]\).</li>

<li>The property that Mary is loved by something: \(\lambda[\exists
x(\loves(x,\mary))]\) (another instance of vacuous binding, viz.,
proposition)</li>

<li>The predication of the property of \(x\) that John loves \(x\) to
Mary: \(p_1 (\lambda x[\loves(\john,x)],\mary)\).</li>

<li>The (0-ary) predication of the property that John loves Mary:
\(p_0 (\lambda x[\loves(\john,\mary)])\).</li>

<li>The property of objects \(x\) and \(y\) that \(x\) loves \(y\):
\(\lambda xy[\loves(x,y)]\).</li>

<li>The property of an objects \(x\) that \(x\) loves itself:
\(\lambda x[\loves(x,x)]\).</li>

<li>The predication of the property of objects \(x\) and \(y\) that
\(x\) loves \(y\) to John and Mary (in that order): \(p_2 (\lambda
xy[\loves(x,y)],\john,\mary)\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We reason with these \(\lambda\)-terms using a \(\beta\)-conversion
principle such as:</p><p> 
\[\begin{align}
p_n (\lambda x_1,&amp;\ldots x_n [A], t_1 , \ldots ,t_n) \leftrightarrow \\
                 &amp;A[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots, t_n]
\end{align}\]

</p><p>
Formally, the predication operator p\(_k\) is a \((k+1)\)-ary
predicate symbol. The first argument is intended to be a
\(\lambda\)-term of \(k\) arguments, and the rest of the arguments are
intended to be the arguments of the body of the \(\lambda\)-term. The
\(\beta\)-principle above says that the predication of an \(n\)-ary
\(\lambda\)-term \(L\) to \(n\) terms holds precisely when the body of
\(L\) holds of those terms.</p>

<p>
It turns out that in these theories, we may or may not be able to be
fully committed to the principle of \(\beta\)-conversion. Indeed, in
some property theories, the full principle of \(\beta\)-conversion
leads to paradox, because one can replay a Russell-style argument when
the full principle of \(\beta\)-conversion is in place. In such
settings, one restricts the formation of \(\lambda\)-formulas by
requiring that the body of a \(\lambda\)-term not contain further
\(\lambda\)-terms or quantifiers. For further discussion, see (Orilia,
2000).</p>

<p>
One of the reasons why property theories formulated in the
\(\lambda\)-calculus are of a particular philosophical importance is
the <em>hyperintensional</em> nature of the calculus (see section
 <a href="#Non-Extensionality">1.2</a>).
 A property concept may be called
‘<em>hyperintensional</em>’ if and only if it does not
identify necessarily coextensional properties, i.e., properties that
are instanciated by exactly the same objects at every possible world.
The properties and relations described by the theories of Bealer,
Zalta, Menzel, and Turner have exactly this characteristic. In other
words, the theories are hyperintensional property theories. Recent
years have seen a significant rise of interest in hyperintensional
concepts of properties in metaphysics (Nolan 2014), and
correspondingly property theories formulated in the
\(\lambda\)-calculus will likely experience a rise of interest as
well.</p>

<p>
In the context of the foundations of mathematics, Zalta and
Oppenheimer (2011) argue for the conceptual priority of the relational
interpretation of \(\lambda\)-terms over the functional one. </p>
