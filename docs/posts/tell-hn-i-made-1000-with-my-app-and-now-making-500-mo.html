    <h1>Tell HN: I made $1000 with my app and now making $500/mo</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Edit: Wow #1 on HN. Y&#39;all are making my day.<p>Hey HN,</p><p>I&#39;m mostly a lurker on HN who&#39;s always super inspired by other people&#39;s small project that end-up making money. (Huge fan of Ben Stoke&#39;s Tiny Project [0])</p><p>After being burnt-out in big tech, I decided to write my own weightlifting app and set myself a humble goal of reaching $1000 in total proceeds. See [1] for my initial launch post.</p><p>I&#39;ve now surpassed that goal and am now making about 500$/mo by selling premium features in the app. Android version is coming soon too. Doing the whole thing end-to-end (code, launch, marketing, support) was super gratifying and taught me a whole lot. I have to admit that I got almost teary eyed the first time someone bought one of my IAPs.</p><p>I&#39;m not making a killing out of the app, and that was never the goal. But the personal satisfaction I got out of it was worth everything. I can&#39;t pretend to have derived any life lesson that applies to everybody from this, but this whole mini-journey was worth it for me, and I hope it will be for you too, should you embark in a similar one.</p><p>[0] https://tinyprojects.dev/</p><p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27507452</p></div></div>
