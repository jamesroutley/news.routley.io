<p>I spent the last three months hiking through California, mostly on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>.</p>


      
    

<p>The trail was an experience like no other. I met all sorts of fascinating people, savored countless breathtaking views, and enjoyed the gracious hospitality of charming trail towns I passed along the way.</p>



      
    


<p>…to be honest, most of it can be picked up pretty fast after the first few days of hiking (there’s no teacher like experience).</p>
<p>So instead, to keep this brief, here are what I’d consider to be my three most important learnings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nalgenes are one of the worst types of water bottle you can bring on a long-distance hike, since they weigh almost <a href="https://nalgene.com/product/32oz-wide-mouth-sustain/">half a pound each</a>. Opt for Glaceau Smartwater bottles instead: cheap and light, yet still durable and reusable.</li>
<li>There are people who actually pick up hitchhikers. They are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.</li>
<li>If you walk 17 miles per day for 100 days, you’ll walk 1700 miles.</li>
</ol>
