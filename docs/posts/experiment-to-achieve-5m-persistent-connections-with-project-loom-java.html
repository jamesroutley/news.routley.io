  <p>I made a <a href="https://www.hytradboi.com/">HYTRADBOI teaser trailer</a>.</p>
<p>As I write we&#39;re at 293 attendees. All the infrastructure is <a href="https://twitter.com/sc13ts/status/1518300718192418816">wired up</a> and my todo list is mercifully clear for these last few days.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I sat down briefly with Marco Munizaga to look at using <a href="https://github.com/jamii/dida">dida</a> in <a href="https://github.com/datalogui/datalog">datalogui</a>. The main outcome is that it&#39;s really clear that I need to rethink how to js bindings work wrt reference types. Probably the new version will move the graph builder api entirely into js and just ship the whole thing across as a value type. I&#39;ll also stop using pointers directly in favor of handles, so that memory management mistakes on the js side (eg freeing the shard and then trying to read from it) lead to exceptions instead of UB. </p>
<hr/>
<p>I made a bunch of build-time improvements to the little clojurescript dialect that I demoed in the last log. No major changes in the demo, but a lot of the cruft has been removed, the error handling has been improved so the demo can&#39;t brick itself and I can actually ship a jar now instead of only being able to run it in figwheel. </p>
<hr/>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16684.pdf">DBSP</a> is a new formalization of incremental maintenance from the folks behind <a href="https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog">differential datalog</a>. I will have a lot more to say about this in the future, but the short version is that it drops some of the capabilities of differential dataflow (eg out-of-order inputs, temporal operators, efficient parallel execution over fine-grained timestamps) but in exchange has a much simpler formalization and implementation, and crucially can still incrementally maintain recursive functions.</p>
<p>I made some progress on a didactic implementation that I hope to turn into a little interactive essay, but I definitely won&#39;t be able to finish it until after HYTRADBOI.</p>

<p>The self-hosted zig compiler can now build itself. <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/89">#89</a> tracks the remaining tasks before it can ship. A huge amount of other improvements to the language are blocked on shipping the new compiler, so it&#39;s pretty exciting.</p>

Advocates the foss developers should not think only about the things that users are not legally prevented from doing, but about what things they are realistically empowered and supported in doing.</p>
