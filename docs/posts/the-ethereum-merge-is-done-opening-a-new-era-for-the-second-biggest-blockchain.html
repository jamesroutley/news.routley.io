    <h1>The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain</h1>

He owns ETH, BTC and MATIC.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>The massive overhaul of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> known as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-merge-explained-what-investors-should-know-about-the-shift-to-proof-of-stake/">the Merge</a> has finally happened, moving the digital machinery at the core of the second-largest cryptocurrency to a vastly more energy-efficient system after years of development and delay.</p></div><div><p>It was no small feat swapping out one way of running a blockchain, known as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/16/what-is-proof-of-work/">proof-of-work</a>, for another, called <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/30/what-is-proof-of-stake/">proof-of-stake</a>. “The metaphor that I use is this idea of switching out an engine from a running car,” said Justin Drake, a researcher at the non-profit Ethereum Foundation who spoke to CoinDesk before the Merge happened. “I like to think of it as kind of like the switch from gasoline to electric.”</p></div><div><div><p><i><b>CoinDesk Special Coverage:</b></i><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-merge/"><i><b> The Ethereum Merge</b></i></a></p></div></div><div><p>The payoff is potentially gigantic. Ethereum <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more">should now consume</a> 99.9% or so less energy. From an energy costs perspective, it&#39;s like Finland suddenly shut off its power grid, according to <a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption">one estimate</a>.</p></div><div><p>Ethereum’s developers say the upgrade will make the network – which houses a <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum">$60 billion</a> ecosystem of cryptocurrency exchanges, lending companies, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and other apps – more secure and scalable, too.</p></div><div><p>The idea was there from its start that Ethereum, whose ether (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum/">ETH</a>) token’s current market value near $200 billion makes it the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/">BTC</a>), would one day make this switch. But the transition was a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-the-merge-and-why-has-it-taken-so-long/">complicated technical effort</a> – an endeavor so risky that many doubted it would happen at all.</p></div><div><p>&#34;There’s a part of me which hasn’t completely realized that this is actually happening,” Drake said. “I’m somewhat in denial, you know, because I’ve trained myself to just expect it to happen in the future.”</p></div><div><p>When the Merge officially kicked in at 2:43 AM EST, over 41,000 people were tuned in on YouTube to an &#34;Ethereum Mainnet Merge Viewing Party.&#34; They watched with bated breath as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/14/monitoring-the-merge-what-a-successful-ethereum-upgrade-will-look-like/">key metrics</a> trickled in suggesting that validators – the operators of Ethereum’s new <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/30/what-is-proof-of-stake/">proof-of-stake network</a> – were behaving as expected and writing new transactions to the blockchain’s ledger. After around 15 long minutes, the Merge &#34;finalized,&#34; meaning it could officially be declared a success.</p></div><div><p>The update, which ends the network’s reliance on the energy-intensive process of cryptocurrency mining, has been closely watched by crypto investors, enthusiasts and skeptics for the impact it is expected to have on the wider blockchain industry.</p></div><div><p>Mark Cuban, investor and billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks pro basketball team, told CoinDesk he would be “watching [the Merge] with interest like everyone else,” pointing out that it might make ETH <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/">deflationary</a>.</p></div><div><p>In the minutes immediately following the Merge, ETH was trading at $1,594 down about 0.81% in the past 24 hours.</p></div><div><p>The update’s complexity was compounded by the fact that it may have been one of the largest open-source software endeavors in history, requiring coordination across dozens of teams and scores of individual researchers, developers and volunteers.</p></div><div><p>Tim Beiko, an Ethereum Foundation developer who played a key role in coordinating the update, said to CoinDesk, “I think the Merge can genuinely get those people who were interested in Ethereum, but skeptical of the environmental impacts, to come and experiment with it.”</p></div><div><p>In 2008, Bitcoin introduced the world to the idea of a decentralized ledger – a single, immutable record of transactions that computers around the world could view, alter and trust without the need for intermediaries.</p></div><div><p>Ethereum, introduced in 2015, expanded upon the core concepts of Bitcoin with smart contracts – or computer programs that effectively use the blockchain as a global supercomputer, recording data onto its network. That innovation was the essential ingredient behind <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-nfts-and-how-do-they-work/">NFTs</a> – the main catalysts of the most recent crypto boom.</p></div><div><p>The Merge retires Ethereum’s proof-of-work system, where <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-bitcoin-mining-works-2/">crypto miners</a> competed to write transactions to its ledger – and earn rewards for doing so – by solving cryptographic puzzles.</p></div><div><p>Most crypto mining today happens in “farms,” though they may be more aptly described as factories. Picture massive warehouses lined with rows of computers stacked on top of one another like shelves of books at a university library – each computer hot to the touch as it strains to pump out cryptocurrency.</p></div><div><p>This system, which was pioneered by Bitcoin, is what caused Ethereum to guzzle so much energy and is responsible for fueling the blockchain sector’s reputation as an environmental menace.</p></div><div><p>“My daughter and I spoke about NFTs a few months ago,” recalled Ben Edgington, a product leader at the Ethereum research and development firm ConsenSys. “At the dinner table I rather foolishly mentioned some NFT projects, and she was yelling at me, ‘How can you boil the oceans with this nonsense? This is terrible. I can&#39;t believe that you do this for a living.’”</p></div><div><p>Edgington, who began his career researching climate science before eventually landing in crypto, understood where his daughter was coming from. “Rightly or wrongly, she&#39;d absorbed a very toxic environmental narrative,” he said. “I mean, it&#39;s kind of hard to defend ‘stickers for grownups’ that emit, by some estimates, a megaton of [carbon dioxide] a week.”</p></div><div><p>Ethereum’s new system, proof-of-stake, does away with mining entirely.</p></div><div><p>Miners are replaced by validators – people who “stake” at least 32 ETH by sending them to an address on the Ethereum network where they cannot be bought or sold.</p></div><div><p>These staked ETH tokens act like lottery tickets: The more ETH a validator stakes, the more likely one of its tickets will be drawn, granting it the ability to write a “block” of transactions to Ethereum&#39;s digital ledger.</p></div><div><p>Ethereum introduced a proof-of-stake network in 2020 called the Beacon Chain, but until the Merge it was just a staging area for validators to get set up for the switch. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake involved merging the Beacon Chain with Ethereum’s main network.</p></div><div><p>According to Beiko, the energy consumption of proof-of-stake is “not even a rounding error in terms of environmental impact.”</p></div><div><p>“Proof-of-stake is like running an app on your MacBook,” he said. “It&#39;s like running Slack. It&#39;s like running Google Chrome or running Netflix. Obviously, your MacBook plugs into the wall and uses electricity to run. But no one thinks about the environmental impact of running Slack, right?”</p></div><div><p>Edgington pointed to the environmental impact of the Merge upgrade as the benefit he is personally the most excited about. “I feel very proud, you know, that I&#39;ll be able to look back and say I&#39;ve had a role to play in removing a megaton of carbon from the atmosphere every week. That&#39;s something that meaningfully affects my family and others,” he said.</p></div><div><p>Rather than a single piece of open-source software, the Ethereum network is better understood as a nation-state – a kind of living organism that comes together when a bunch of computers talk to one another in the same language, all following an identical set of rules.</p></div><div><p>Ethereum’s new system introduces a new set of incentives for the people operating these computers to follow the rules as written, thereby securing the ledger from any unwanted tampering.</p></div><div><p>“Proof-of-work is a mechanism by which you take physical resources and you convert them into security for the network. If you want your network to be more secure, you need more of those physical resources,” Beiko explained. “On proof-of-stake, what we do is we use financial resources to convert to security.”</p></div><div><p>Although Ethereum had thousands of individual miners operating and securing its proof-of-work network, computers from just three <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-mining-pools/">mining pools</a> dominated a majority of the network’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/">hashrate</a>, a measure of the collective computing power of all miners.</p></div><div><p>If a few of Ethereum’s big mining firms colluded to amass a majority of the network’s hashrate, they would have been able to execute a so-called <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-51-attack/">51% attack</a>, making it difficult or impossible for anyone else to update the ledger.</p></div><div><p>In proof-of-stake, the amount of ETH one stakes – not the amount of energy one expends – dictates control over the network. Proof-of-stake boosters say this makes attacks more expensive and self-defeating: attackers can have their staked ETH slashed, or reduced, as punishment for trying to harm the network.</p></div><div><p>Not everyone buys into the proof-of-stake hype. There are no signs that Bitcoin, for instance, will ever abandon proof-of-work – which <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/14/bitcoin-after-the-ethereum-merge-experts-weigh-in/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_campaign=headlines">proponents insist</a> remains the more battle-tested and secure system.</p></div><div><p>And although control of the Ethereum network will no longer be concentrated in the hands of a few publicly traded mining syndicates, critics insist that old power players will just be <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/20/is-ethereum-staking-pool-lidos-growth-an-omen-of-centralization/">replaced by new ones</a>. Lido, a kind of community-run validator collective, <a href="https://beaconcha.in/charts">controls over 30%</a> of the stake on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain. Coinbase, Kraken and Binance – three of the largest crypto exchanges – own another 30% of the network’s stake.</p></div><div><p>Skepticism around proof-of-stake fueled Chandler Guo, a prominent crypto miner, to announce in the lead-up to the Merge that he would <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/15/miner-chandler-guo-repeats-support-for-ethereum-fork-post-merge/">launch a fork</a> of Ethereum’s old proof-of-work chain – a clone of Ethereum’s blockchain that hums along using the old miner-based mechanism.</p></div><div><p>Ethereum’s core developers have generally derided proof-of-work forks as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/24/ethereum-proof-of-work-forks-gift-or-grift/">sideshows and scams</a>, but Guo’s “ETHPOW” effort and others like it have gained <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/ethereum-proof-of-work-fork-timing-posted/">modest traction</a> in certain corners of the crypto community.</p></div><div><p>In crypto markets, the Merge had become an object of speculation since at least mid-July, with traders initially viewing the event as a catalyst for a steep rally in the price of ETH. The market for ETH options started pricing in post-Merge gains, a welcome respite following the crash in digital-asset markets earlier in the year.</p></div><div><p>The prospect of a fork of the Ethereum blockchain by irate crypto miners spurred a wave of new activity, this time as traders tried to lock in value from the theoretical airdrop of a new “ETHPOW” token.</p></div><div><p>In general, it is impossible to predict with certainty how the markets will react to a successful Merge. The upgrade has been on Ethereum’s roadmap since its inception, so there’s the possibility that it has already, by-and-large, been priced in by the market.</p></div><div><p>“I think if you asked me maybe about three weeks ago, I would say that not only is it priced in, it’s overly priced in,” said Kevin Zhou of Galois Capital. “Now the market is roughly 70/30 in favor of this being a positive event for ETH.”</p></div><div><p>&#34;This is the first step towards Ethereum being a very mature system, but there are still steps to go,&#34; said Vitalik Buterin, who co-created Ethereum and spoke about the Merge as it occurred during a public live stream.</p></div><div><p>Ethereum&#39;s relatively <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/13/reminder-the-merge-wont-solve-ethereums-scaling-woes-by-itself/">high fees and slow speeds</a> were not addressed by the update, and they remain as much a barrier to growing its user base as environmental concerns ever were.</p></div><div><p>Buterin has outlined a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/01/ethereum-after-the-merge-what-comes-next/">set of next steps</a> for the network that includes “sharding” – a method that should help address the network’s sluggish transaction times and high fees by spreading transactions across “shards,” like adding lanes to a highway.</p></div><div><p>That upgrade was initially slated to accompany the transition to proof-of-stake, but it was deprioritized given the success third-party solutions – called <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-rollups-zk-rollups-and-optimistic-rollups-explained/">rollups</a> – have had in solving some of the same issues.</p></div><div><p>Rollups foreshadow the likely future for Ethereum development, where community solutions – rather than updates to Ethereum’s core code – play the primary role in expanding the chain’s capabilities.</p></div><div><p>While Ethereum&#39;s environmental woes may now be behind it, the network still has many hurdles to overcome if it wants to reach more users. For now, though, after years of work and megatons of carbon emissions in the rear-view mirror, it’s hard to imagine Ethereum’s developers won’t be taking a few days to celebrate.</p></div><div><p><i>UPDATE (Sept. 14, 07:23 UTC): Adds information throughout.</i></p></div></div><div data-module-name="article-body/newsletter-cta" data-module-version="1"><hr/><p><h6>Sign up for Valid Points, our weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets.</h6></p><p><span>By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk product updates, events and marketing and you agree to our <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/terms/">terms of services</a> and<!-- --> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</span></p></div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/skessler/"><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/coindesk/32060bda-fbfa-439f-ae3f-215d0b79a89e.png" alt="CoinDesk - Unknown" loading="lazy"/></p></a></div></div><div><p>Sam is a reporter at CoinDesk focused on decentralized technology, DeFi and DAOs.
