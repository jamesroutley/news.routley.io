                <section>
                    <p>Last week, I wrote about how Joshua Aaron&#39;s ICEBlock app, which allows people to anonymously report ICE sightings within a 5-mile radius, is – unfortunately, and despite apparent good intentions – <a href="https://micahflee.com/unfortunately-the-iceblock-app-is-activism-theater/" rel="noreferrer">activism theater</a>. This was based on Joshua&#39;s talk at HOPE where he made it clear that he isn&#39;t taking the advice of local community groups, that ICE sightings aren&#39;t verified in any way, and that he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing when it comes to security and privacy.</p><p>In that post, in the section about his &#34;HIGHLY secure&#34; server that he kept mentioning, I wrote:</p><blockquote>Without providing more details, I also discovered that his server is running outdated software with known vulnerabilities.</blockquote><p>I was intentionally vague because I knew that his server was vulnerable at the time of writing, and I didn&#39;t want anyone to exploit one of these vulnerabilities before he had a chance to fix it.</p><p>ICEBlock has been downloaded over one million times from the App Store. I don&#39;t know whether Joshua&#39;s server stores data related to these users or the reports they submit, but it might, and he certainly bragged about the security of it in his HOPE talk.</p><p>I&#39;m publishing this because it&#39;s important for people who are trusting ICEBlock to know that the developer is careless about computer security, even when people specifically point out security issues and give him time to fix them. Hopefully his server doesn&#39;t have any user data. Hopefully no one will hack his server despite the fact that he&#39;s making it easy for them to. And hopefully this blog post will compel him to finally fix the issue.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: It worked! Hours after I published this, Joshua has updated Apache in his server, fixing the issue.</strong></p><p>Joshua runs two Bluesky accounts: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iceblock.app" rel="noreferrer">@iceblock.app</a>, the account of the ICEBlock app, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joshua.stealingheather.com" rel="noreferrer">@joshua.stealingheather.com‬</a>, Joshua&#39;s personal account. His personal account had DMs closed, but the ICEBlock account had DMs open, so I sent him DMs there.</p><p>On September 1, I wrote:</p><blockquote>Hey Joshua, I&#39;m one of the people who saw your HOPE talk and asked some of the questions. I&#39;m giving you a heads up that I&#39;m preparing to publish a blog post about the app and your talk that isn&#39;t very flattering. But also, I wanted to give you notice that you&#39;re running a vulnerable version of Apache on your linode server. I&#39;m not mentioning this specifically, but you should install updates</blockquote><p>Then, an hour and a half later, I published my blog and sent him my Bluesky post about it:</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:uzucgmkg2y5vbkqnbv2on7g3/app.bsky.feed.post/3lxsp634clk22" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifjox4rk55yqpbjjnp5ahte6ao2t5gfrc5skyofes42pbccmyhhgy"><p lang="en">I wrote about @iceblock.app, the developer&#39;s infuriating HOPE talk, and how it&#39;s unfortunately basically activism theater micahflee.com/unfortunatel...</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:uzucgmkg2y5vbkqnbv2on7g3?ref_src=embed">Micah Lee (@micahflee.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:uzucgmkg2y5vbkqnbv2on7g3/post/3lxsp634clk22?ref_src=embed">2025-09-01T22:56:27.196Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>He didn&#39;t respond from the @iceblock.app account other than blocking me. (Which, honestly, isn&#39;t very fair, since I&#39;m not ICE.)</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.27.47---PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1198" height="1698" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.27.47---PM.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.27.47---PM.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.27.47---PM.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Screenshot from Bluesky of @iceblock.app blocking me after my responsible disclosure</span></figcaption></figure><p>He did, however, send me a DM from his @joshua.stealingheather.com account, saying:</p><blockquote>It would be so great if you could stop lying about me and ICEBlock. You are doing nothing to help. You don’t know me, my history, my knowledge, or anything more than hearing me at Hope.</blockquote><p>To which I replied:</p><blockquote>If I got anything wrong in my blog post, please let me know and I’d be happy to post a correction</blockquote><p>Here&#39;s a screenshot of the exchange.</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.31.22---PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1170" height="868" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.31.22---PM.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.31.22---PM.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.31.22---PM.png 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Screenshot from Bluesky DMs with @joshua.stealingheather.com telling me I&#39;m lying about him and his app</span></figcaption></figure><p>A few days later, on September 3, I decided to check again. His server was <em>still</em> running Apache 2.4.57, which has multiple vulnerabilities. He ignored my report and didn&#39;t fix it.</p><p>And just so you know, fixing this problem is <em>extremely easy</em>. He just needs to SSH in and run something like <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code>, wait for the Apache updated package to install, and his server would no longer be vulnerable.</p><p>Seeing that he wasn&#39;t taking this seriously, I decided to give him a deadline to patch his server before I publicly disclosed the vulnerability. I sent his @joshua.stealingheather.com account these messages:</p><blockquote>Hey Joshua, I noticed that you still haven&#39;t updated Apache on your server. I disclosed that you&#39;re running Apache 2.4.57, which has known critical vulnerabilities, on September 1. I don&#39;t know what data (if any) related to [ICEBlock] and its users that you store on your server. But until you update Apache, it might be trivial for anyone to hack your server and steal all of it. So, please install updates.</blockquote><p>He didn&#39;t get back to me. And an hour and a half later, he blocked me from this account too.</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.41.00---PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1188" height="1710" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.41.00---PM.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.41.00---PM.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-1.41.00---PM.png 1188w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Screenshot from Bluesky DMs with @joshua.stealingheather.com, where I disclose his vulnerability again, and he blocks me</span></figcaption></figure><p>It&#39;s now been a week, and I checked again: Joshua&#39;s &#34;HIGHLY secure&#34; server is <em>still running a version of Apache with multiple known critical vulnerabilities</em>. And even with plenty of time to fix the issue, he still hasn&#39;t.</p><p>I hope he isn&#39;t storing any ICEBlock-related data on there.</p>
