    <h1>InSight&#39;s Final Selfie</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description" data-v-41cbc890=""><div data-v-41cbc890=""><div><div><div><p><a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/PIA25287.gif" target="new"><b>Click here for animation</b></a></p><p>NASA&#39;s InSight Mars lander took this final selfie on April 24, 2022, the 1,211th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. The lander is covered with far more dust than it was <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22876" target="new">in its first selfie</a>, taken in December 2018, not long after landing – or in <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA23203" target="new">its second selfie</a>, composed of images taken in March and April 2019.</p><p>The arm needs to move several times in order to capture a full selfie. Because InSight&#39;s dusty solar panels are producing less power, the team will soon put the lander&#39;s robotic arm in its resting position (called the &#34;retirement pose&#34;) for the last time in May of 2022.</p><p>JPL manages InSight for NASA&#39;s Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA&#39;s Discovery Program, managed by the agency&#39;s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supports spacecraft operations for the mission.</p><p>A number of European partners, including France&#39;s Centre National d&#39;Études Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), are supporting the InSight mission. CNES provided the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (<a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/" target="new">SEIS</a>) instrument to NASA, with the principal investigator at IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris). Significant contributions for SEIS came from IPGP; the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany; the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in Switzerland; Imperial College London and Oxford University in the United Kingdom; and JPL. DLR provided the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/" target="new">HP3</a>) instrument, with significant contributions from the Space Research Center (CBK) of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Astronika in Poland. Spain&#39;s Centro de Astrobiología (CAB) supplied the temperature and wind sensors.</p><p>For more information about the mission, go to <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight" target="new">https://mars.nasa.gov/insight</a>.</p>
