    <h1>Programming Burnout</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>For the past few months I have been pretty burned when trying to do programming. Whenever I have an idea, I jump straight to my computer and start coding. But only a few seconds later, I feel like I don&#39;t have any motivation or purpose to grow the idea, so I abandon the project and move on.</p>
<p>The problem is that it has been like this for months and the only cure to it is to quit programming entirely. It is the most viable solution to escape from feeling useless and self-criticism IMO.</p>
<p>With that being said, I will quit programming for at least a few months, writing for this blog, and come back when I have the energy to do so.</p>
