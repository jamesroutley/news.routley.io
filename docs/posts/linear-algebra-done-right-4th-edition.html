<hr/>

<p>This best-selling textbook for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergraduate math majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.

</p><p>No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner product spaces are then introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences such as the singular value decomposition. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator. Determinants are cleanly introduced via alternating multilinear forms.
