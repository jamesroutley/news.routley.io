    <h1>NASA has reestablished full communications with Voyager 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block-key="v48g2"><b>UPDATE, Aug. 4, 2023:</b> <i>NASA has reestablished full communications with Voyager 2.</i></p><p data-block-key="8vm6r"><i>The agency’s Deep Space Network facility in Canberra, Australia, sent the equivalent of an interstellar “shout” more than 12.3 billion miles (19.9 billion kilometers) to Voyager 2, instructing the spacecraft to reorient itself and turn its antenna back to Earth. With a one-way light time of 18.5 hours for the command to reach Voyager, it took 37 hours for mission controllers to learn whether the command worked. At 12:29 a.m. EDT on Aug. 4, the spacecraft began returning science and telemetry data, indicating it is operating normally and that it remains on its expected trajectory.</i></p><p data-block-key="flcjf"><b>UPDATE, Aug. 1, 2023:</b> <i>Using multiple antennas, NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) was able to detect a carrier signal from Voyager 2. A carrier signal is what the spacecraft uses to send data back to Earth. The signal is too faint for data to be extracted, but the detection confirms that the spacecraft is still operating. The spacecraft also continues on its expected trajectory. Although the mission expects the spacecraft to point its antenna at Earth in mid-October, the team will attempt to command Voyager sooner, while its antenna is still pointed away from Earth. To do this, a DSN antenna will be used to “shout” the command to Voyager to turn its antenna. This intermediary attempt may not work, in which case the team will wait for the spacecraft to automatically reset its orientation in October.</i></p></div><p itemprop="abstract">
      Once the spacecraft’s antenna is realigned with Earth, communications should resume.
