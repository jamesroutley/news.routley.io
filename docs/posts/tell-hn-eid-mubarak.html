    <h1>Tell HN: Eid Mubarak</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>To the Muslims on HN, Eid Mubarak! And to everyone else, Eid Mubarak!</p><p>For those who don&#39;t know. Eid is a day of celebration after the month of Ramadan, in which Muslims fasted for 30 days from sunrise to sunset with no food or water. It&#39;s something 2B people around the world celebrate to today or tomorrow (moon sighting permitted).</p><p>A note on Ramadan. To those interested in intermittent fasting, longevity, and coming back to a more human experience not drowning in technology, food and consumerism I would say check it out! After over 20 years of doing it I&#39;m still learning something new every year, or I should say, unlearning bad habits we&#39;ve created for ourselves as a society through abundance.</p><p>Hope you all have a great day!</p></div></div></div>
