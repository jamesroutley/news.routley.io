<p>The 38th Chaos Communication Congress (38C3) takes place in Hamburg on 27–30 Dec 2024, and is the 2024 edition of the annual four-day conference on technology, society and utopia organized by the <a href="https://www.ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club (CCC)</a> and volunteers.</p>
<p>Congress offers lectures and workshops and various events on a multitude of topics including (but not limited to) information technology and generally a critical-creative attitude towards technology and the discussion about the effects of technological advances on society.</p>
<p>Starting in 1984, Congress has been organized by the community and appreciates all kinds of participation. You are encouraged to contribute by volunteering, setting up and hosting hands-on and self-organized events with the other components of your assembly or presenting your own projects to fellow hackers. </p>
