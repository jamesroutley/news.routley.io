<p>An addendum in the article <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/blogging-together">Looking beyond collective blogging</a>—a conversation between the author V.H.
Belvadi and <a href="https://hamatti.org">Juhis</a>—flipped a switch in my brain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Juhis rightly pointed out that ‘the feeling of connection comes through putting an effort into it rather than through automation.’ In other words most people write and expect engagement without putting effort into participating with others themselves. So, while writing is integral to blogging, we should start treating participation with other blogs as a similarly important activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this quote might be one of the reasons why previous attempts at blogging regularly didn’t stick. I have a tendency to look inwards when creating. The focus is always on “where I could improve my writing” or “how I could make my work reach better”.</p>
<p>Aside from working on my posts this time round, I would like to try being more intentional about engaging with other’s work: reaching out to those who’s posts resonate, either via email/social media or by sharing them there along with a bit of commentary.</p>
<p>The article also talks about about the <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> and specifically <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmentions</a>, that I have been curious about. However, I want to commit to interacting manually first, before I choose to incorporate automation into my interactions.</p>
