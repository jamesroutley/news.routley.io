<p>Once again <a href="https://emacsconf.org/">EmacsConf</a> went to fountainhead of free software and gave
us a chance to hear from and interact with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">rms</a>.</p>
<p>People in the public eye often get on (or get put on) a soapbox repeating
the same lines.   Stallman even chose to open by playing an 8 year old
<a href="https://youtu.be/Ag1AKIl_2GM">TED talk he did extolling software freedom</a>.  Certainly not new, but
once in a while it’s refreshing to return to primary sources rather
than news or other mediated views.  This talk and the Q&amp;A was a view
straight into the heart, soul and source of the Free Software
movement.</p>
<p>I asked two questions on the webpad which Stallman answered.  In both cases
I was trying to get past the repeated soapbox points to what makes the
person underneath tick.</p>
<p>Despite the utter profusion of tools built around the ecosystem he
created over the past 40 years (just look at the <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2022/talks/">program of EmacsConf</a>
and the <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/">contents of the *LPA</a> archives), several of his comments lead
me to believe he still views emacs as “just an editor”, so to clarify
I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What do you use emacs for beyond editing?</p>
<p>A: I use it for reading and writing email; this is what I do most of the day.  (Sings)
“I’ve been answering my email,
all the g****-d********* day / .. / &lt;transcriber lost the thread about here [lyrics available at <a href="https://stallman.org/doggerel.html#IveBeenAnsweringMyEmail">https://stallman.org/doggerel.html#IveBeenAnsweringMyEmail</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which confirmed my suspicion about non-use of the ecosystem…. but a
live performance of his own parody song about email? Score one for touching
the human behind the troupe.</p>
<p>As someone who’s been around computers and Emacs long enough to
have started using the TECO based emacs something like 3 years after
RMS created  it (c.a. 1979 for me), I look back fondly on some of the tech I’ve
used (all of which included versions of emacs): TOPS20, TOPS10 (!),
Multics, VMS, BSD Unix, SunOS, Solaris, etc and thanks to places like
<a href="https://sdf.org/?welcome">SDF</a> and friends I can still log in and tinker in those environments
once in a while.  At EmacsConf 2020 Stallman waxed nostalgic for a
moment about (I think) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_debugging_technique">DDT</a> (Dynamic Debugging Technique) or similar for a
minute and the sense of control it gave, so this year I probed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Do you ever dabble in retro-computing, e.g. logging into TOPS10/20 systems SDF, etc?</p>
<p>A: No, I decided it’s a waste of time. It’s tinkering that would not
develop anything of any importance or use. And I know if I’m going to
enjoy developing something… I could enjoy developing anything… I
decided not to distract my attention from useful computing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s revealing.   It acknowledges the existential pleasure of
creating, in any environment, but only values creations that are
likely to be used by others.</p>
<p>I have a son who’s about to finish a doctorate in piano performance.
Clearly it’s legitimate for him to perform for the enjoyment of
audiences, that is “useful”.  But I think it was also legitimate
for him, a child, to sit down at the harpsichord in the hallway of
George Washington’s Mount Vernon and to knock out baroque pieces for
the sheer joy of it, I don’t think that was a “distraction” or  “waste
of time”.</p>
<p>A lot of what makes Emacs what it is, is the accretion of
scratch-you-own-itch solutions (<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/index.html">Org-mode</a>, for instance) done for
oneself and possibly the pleasure of just writing the code and making
things work, and then shared as an afterthought.  In this context GNU
Emacs itself is now 40 years old and was at the time a re-implementation of a
then 7 or 8 year old system (TECO Emacs) targeted to run on a
re-implementation of a system (Unix) created in 1969.  Today (much to
my amazement) there are STILL people into the Amiga<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, C-64s, and
there are PDP-10’s that run on raspberry-pi’s.  I once had an office-mate who
“wrote” his own version of the Z80 in Verilog, because he could.</p>
<p>I appreciate the desire to have one’s software used widely, but I
think its equally valid for people to do their own thing, possibly in
nitch areas or on obsolete platforms, just because they want to.  I’d
even say these are prime examples of people exercising software
freedom on their own hardware and, at least to them, this is “useful
computing”.</p>
<p>Hat’s off to RMS for Emacs, GCC, Core Utils, the GPL, FSF, Free Software…</p>
<p>Happy Hacking !!!</p>
