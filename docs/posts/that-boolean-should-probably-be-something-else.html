    <h1>That boolean should probably be something else</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the first types we learn about is the boolean.
It&#39;s pretty natural to use, because boolean logic underpins much of modern computing.
And yet, it&#39;s one of the types we should probably be using a lot less of.
In almost every single instance when you use a boolean, it should be something else.</p>
<p>The trick is figuring out <em>what</em> &#34;something else&#34; is.
Doing this is worth the effort.
It tells you a lot about your system, and it will improve your design (even if you end up using a boolean).</p>
<p>There are a few possible types that come up often, hiding as booleans.
Let&#39;s take a look at each of these, as well as the case where using a boolean <em>does</em> make sense.
This isn&#39;t exhaustive—<sup id="fr-em-dash-1"><a href="#fn-em-dash">[1]</a></sup>there are surely other types that can make sense, too.</p>

<p>A lot of boolean data is representing a temporal event having happened.
For example, websites often have you confirm your email.
This may be stored as a boolean column, <code>is_confirmed</code>, in the database.
It makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>But, you&#39;re throwing away data: when the confirmation happened.
You can instead store <em>when</em> the user confirmed their email in a nullable column.
You can still get the same information by checking whether the column is null.
But you also get richer data for other purposes.</p>
<p>Maybe you find out down the road that there was a bug in your confirmation process.
You can use these timestamps to check which users would be affected by that, based on when their confirmation was stored.</p>
<p>This is the one I&#39;ve seen discussed the most of all these.
We run into it with almost every database we design, after all.
You can detect it by asking if an <em>action has to occur</em> for the boolean to change values, and if values can only change one time.
If you have both of these, then it really looks like it is a datetime being transformed into a boolean.
Store the datetime!</p>

<p>Much of the remaining boolean data indicates either what type something is, or its status.
Is a user an admin or not?
Check the <code>is_admin</code> column!
Did that job fail?
Check the <code>failed</code> column!
Is the user allowed to take this action?
Return a boolean for that, yes or no!
These usually make more sense as an enum.</p>
<p>Consider the admin case: this is really a user role, and you should have an enum for it.
If it&#39;s a boolean, you&#39;re going to eventually need more columns, and you&#39;ll keep adding on other statuses.
Oh, we had users and admins, but now we also need guest users and we need super-admins.
With an enum, you can add those easily.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum </span><span>UserRole </span><span>{
</span><span>  User,
</span><span>  Admin,
</span><span>  Guest,
</span><span>  SuperAdmin,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then you can usually use your tooling to make sure that all the new cases are covered in your code.
With a boolean, you have to add <em>more</em> booleans, and then you have to make sure you find <em>all</em> the places where the old booleans were used and make sure they handle these new cases, too.
Enums help you avoid these bugs.</p>
<p>Job status is one that&#39;s pretty clearly an enum as well.
If you use booleans, you&#39;ll have <code>is_failed</code>, <code>is_started</code>, <code>is_queued</code>, and on and on.
Or you could just have one single field, <code>status</code>, which is an enum with the various statuses.
(Note, though, that you probably <em>do</em> want timestamp fields for each of these events—but you&#39;re still best having the status stored explicitly as well.)
This begins to resemble a state machine once you store the status, and it means that you can make much cleaner code and analyze things along state transition lines.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s not just for storing in a database, either.
If you&#39;re checking a user&#39;s permissions, you often return a boolean for that.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn </span><span>check_permissions</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>: User) -&gt; </span><span>bool </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>false </span><span>// no one is allowed to do anything i guess
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>true</code> means the user can do it and <code>false</code> means they can&#39;t.
Usually. I think.
But you can really start to have doubts here, and with any boolean, because the application logic meaning of the value <em>cannot</em> be inferred from the type.</p>
<p>Instead, this can be represented as an enum, even when there are just two choices.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum </span><span>PermissionCheck </span><span>{
</span><span>  Allowed,
</span><span>  NotPermitted(reason: </span><span>String</span><span>),
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>As a bonus, though, if you use an enum?
You can end up with richer information, like returning a reason for a permission check failing.
And you are safe for future expansions of the enum, just like with roles.</p>
<p>You can detect when something should be an enum a proliferation of booleans which are mutually exclusive or depend on one another.
You&#39;ll see multiple columns which are all changed at the same time.
Or you&#39;ll see a boolean which is returned and used for a long time.
It&#39;s important to use enums here to keep your program maintainable and understandable.</p>

<p>But when <em>should</em> we use a boolean?
I&#39;ve mainly run into one case where it makes sense: when you&#39;re (temporarily) storing the result of a conditional expression for evaluation.
This is in some ways an optimization, either for the computer (reuse a variable<sup id="fr-optimization-1"><a href="#fn-optimization">[2]</a></sup>) or for the programmer (make it more comprehensible by giving a name to a big conditional) by storing an intermediate value.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a contrived example where using a boolean as an intermediate value.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn </span><span>calculate_user_data</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>: User, </span><span>records</span><span>: RecordStore) {
</span><span>  </span><span>// this would be some nice long conditional,
</span><span>  </span><span>// but I don&#39;t have one. So variables it is!
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> user_can_do_this: </span><span>bool </span><span>= </span><span>(a </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> b) </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>(c </span><span>|| !</span><span>d);
</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> user_can_do_this </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> records.</span><span>ready</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span>// do the thing
</span><span>  } </span><span>else if</span><span> user_can_do_this </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> records.</span><span>in_progress</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span>// do another thing
</span><span>  } </span><span>else </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>// and something else!
</span><span>  }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>But even here in this contrived example, some enums would make more sense.
I&#39;d keep the boolean, probably, simply to give a <em>name</em> to what we&#39;re calculating.
But the rest of it should be a <code>match</code> on an enum!</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Sure, not every boolean should go away.
There&#39;s probably no single rule in software design that is always true.
But, we should be paying a lot more attention to booleans.</p>
<p>They&#39;re sneaky.
They feel like they make sense for our data, but they make sense for our <em>logic</em>.
The data is usually something different underneath.
By storing a boolean as our data, we&#39;re coupling that data tightly to our application logic.</p>
<p>Instead, we should remain critical and ask what data the boolean depends on, and should we maybe store that instead?
It comes easier with practice.
Really, all good design does.
A little thinking up front saves you a <em>lot</em> of time in the long run.</p>
