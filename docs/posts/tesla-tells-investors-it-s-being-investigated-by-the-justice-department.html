<p>Tesla filed its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017023001409/tsla-20221231.htm">annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> on Monday night, and the document confirms that, among the many open federal investigations into the company, the US Department of Justice is looking into the automaker&#39;s controversial driver assistance features.</p>
<p>In the section detailing &#34;Certain Investigations and Other Matters,&#34; the 10-K briefly describes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/08/report-feds-investigating-whether-musks-buyout-tweet-broke-the-law/">Tesla being subpoenaed by the SEC</a> following CEO Elon Musk&#39;s tweets about taking the company private in 2018. That investigation led to a consent decree with the regulator but did not mark the end of the company&#39;s SEC headache; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/sec-probes-elon-musk-and-brother-for-possible-insider-trading-of-tesla-stock/">in February 2022, we reported</a> that the SEC was investigating both Musk and his brother for potential insider trading.</p>
<p>&#34;Separately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features,&#34; Tesla wrote.</p>
<p>This news shouldn&#39;t be too surprising to Tesla watchers. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/teslas-autopilot-is-the-subject-of-a-federal-criminal-investigation/">In October, we discovered that Justice Department prosecutors</a> in both Washington and San Francisco were investigating whether Tesla had misled investors and customers by making unsupported claims about the capabilities of its driver-assist features, including in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/musk-oversaw-staged-tesla-self-driving-video-emails-show/">a much-viewed video created in 2016 that was staged</a> to make it appear as if Tesla had already succeeded in developing an autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>Tesla is also the subject of multiple other federal investigations beyond the SEC and DoJ matters. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has several open investigations into Tesla; it&#39;s looking into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/tesla-must-tell-nhtsa-how-autopilot-sees-emergency-vehicles/">the propensity of Autopilot to drive Teslas into emergency vehicles</a>, whether or not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/tesla-faces-new-probes-into-motorbike-deaths-false-advertising/">Autopilot can even identify motorcyclists</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/teslas-radar-less-cars-investigated-by-nhtsa-after-complaints-spike/">the preponderance of phantom braking episodes</a> following Tesla&#39;s decision to strip radar sensors from its cars.</p>
