    <h1>Total lunar eclipse over Teide crater, Tenerife – a project with many obstacles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Rarely have I thought so often about abandoning a photography project as during this lunar eclipse on Tenerife. Somehow, everything seemed to conspire against us this time. This is the story of an elaborately planned photo project where almost everything went wrong, but perseverance ultimately paid off. But let’s start from the beginning…</strong></p><p>Germans: <a href="https://gwegner.de/blog/totale-mondfinsternis-teide-krater/" target="_blank" rel="">Hier gibt es eine Deutsche Version</a>.</p><p>We, that is <a href="https://fehrpics.com/" target="_blank" rel="">Uli</a> and I, have made it almost a tradition to meet on Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) once a year. This time, Uli said, hey, on March 14th there’s a total lunar eclipse, and I’ve calculated a location from which we can photograph the fully eclipsed moon setting directly over the crater of Teide at dawn!</p><p>It sounded almost too good to be true—because typical lunar eclipses are rather dull photographically, especially after you’ve seen and photographed a few. Without an interesting foreground, pictures of a red moon look the same anywhere in the world. Technically challenging, perhaps, but not very creative.</p><p><a href="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-5ahEOH2o" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-720x405.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-720x405.jpg 720w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-300x169.jpg 300w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-600x338.jpg 600w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-400x225.jpg 400w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238.jpg 2000w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-720x405@2x.jpg 1440w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-600x338@2x.jpg 1200w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10_115053_GZ8_6238-400x225@2x.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"/></a></p><h3 id="a-unique-project">A Unique Project</h3><p>Now, several exciting factors came together in Uli’s idea:</p><ol><li>We would experience a total eclipse on Tenerife, while in Germany, for example, the moon would only be partially eclipsed.</li><li>We would have a foreground—the impressive crater of Teide, Tenerife’s landmark and Spain’s highest mountain at 3,715 meters.</li><li>The totality would occur during dawn, meaning the sky would already be somewhat blue, and the moon would be low enough for us to use the crater as a foreground. We expected very aesthetic images from the contrast of the red eclipsed moon against the blue sky.</li><li>According to my research, this opportunity to photograph a totally eclipsed moon over Teide wouldn’t occur again within the next 10 years—or possibly even much longer; I didn’t look further. These images would be genuinely unique.</li></ol><h3 id="the-planning">The Planning</h3><p>Uli used the smartphone app <a href="https://www.planitphoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="">Planit</a> for planning. This app not only displays exact eclipse timings but also shows the moon’s position relative to the observer’s location—in three dimensions. The app has quite a learning curve, but roughly speaking:</p><p>You define the summit of Teide as your “target,” jump to the app’s day and time of moonset, and primarily search for a camera position reachable by foot.</p><div id="attachment_74316"><p><a href="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-5ahEOH2o" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-74316" src="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-720x610.png" alt="" width="720" height="610" srcset="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-720x610.png 720w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-300x254.png 300w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-1536x1301.png 1536w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-2048x1735.png 2048w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-472x400.png 472w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-315x267.png 315w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-720x610@2x.png 1440w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-300x254@2x.png 600w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-472x400@2x.png 944w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot_20250315-093421_2-315x267@2x.png 630w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-74316">On the left, I’ve aligned the “scene” with the peak of Teide.

Usually, I don’t photograph much with telephoto lenses here, so my longest focal length was a 70-200mm f/2.8.</p><p>Uli—always hardcore—had traveled to the island with 60 kg of gear, prepared for everything. Besides all his Sony lenses (200-600mm) and his <a href="https://amzn.to/4hwlbEK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nikon Coolpix P1000</a> (24-3000mm!), he even had a 300mm and a Nikon 400mm f/2.8 with him. <em>Crazy</em>.</p><p>“Since you have so many lenses – could you lend me your Nikon?” (The only lens of his that would fit my cameras.) Uli agreed. One less worry, as 200mm was quite short for moon photography.</p><p>Another issue was my tripod situation. I had only one reliable tripod on the island. The second one didn’t deserve the name—I usually just use it as a holder for my tablet.</p><p>Since this was a unique opportunity, I wanted to use two cameras. I had my Nikon Z8 and the Nikon Z50 II with me.</p><p>So I decided to ask a friend—who was planning to visit us a few days later—to bring me a tripod. Unfortunately, he had to cancel the trip last minute, so once again, I was left tripod-less. Ordering stuff here on the island is a bit tricky, and good camera stores are few and far between. So I figured I’d head into the capital to buy one there.

We kept checking the webcams and forecasts over and over.</p><p>Uli wanted to head up the night before the lunar eclipse to set up a few wide-angle cameras for some time-lapse shots, planning to pick them up again the next morning.</p><p>I was hoping to catch a bit of sleep beforehand. The alarm was set for 2 a.m.</p><h3 id="worst-case-scenario-kicks-in">Worst-case scenario kicks in</h3><p>Just as I had packed everything and was about to head to bed, Uli called: “I’ve got good news and bad news. The good—weather’s actually not that bad. Not as windy as we feared.”</p><p>“Sounds promising—and the bad?”</p><p>“While I was out setting up my cameras, someone broke into my car and stole my second backpack—with all my telephoto lenses and other cameras…”</p><p><em>“What??!!”</em></p><p>Uli was surprisingly calm, considering he’d just lost two-thirds of his gear: “It’s insured…” — but still, how were we supposed to shoot the lunar eclipse now, without any long lenses?</p><p>It really felt like the universe was telling us it wasn’t meant to be. I only had the 70–200 mm, and Uli’s longest lens left was a 135 mm. Not exactly ideal for capturing a lunar eclipse.</p><p>If it had happened just a day earlier, we might’ve been able to borrow some lenses. But just hours before? No chance.</p><p>We went back and forth. “So should we just call it off? Weather’s supposed to be unstable anyway…”</p><h3 id="thinking-about-calling-it-off">Thinking about calling it off<b></b></h3><p>That little inner voice—the one that already had zero interest in getting up at 2 a.m. and hiking for hours in the cold—kept chiming in: <i>“This is going to be a bust anyway, it’s way too cold and probably all clouded over. Why don’t you just shoot it from down here in town, at the pier? You could sleep in two extra hours, it’s less windy, and way warmer.”</i><i></i></p><p>Uli said he’d drive back down first and stop by a couple of electronics stores along the way—maybe, just maybe, he could find a telephoto lens there. Luckily, shops stay open pretty late on Tenerife…</p><p>“Alright, let’s talk again once you’re back.”</p><p>I kept refreshing the weather apps and checking webcams. Ran the numbers in Planit to figure out if we could at least capture the event down here on the coast. Sure, it would work… but it just wouldn’t be that <i>once-in-a-lifetime</i> shot.</p><h3 id="…or-maybe-not">…or maybe not?<b></b></h3><p>At some point, Uli called back: <i>“They don’t even carry camera gear at all anymore at places like MediaMarkt—but I just remembered I actually have another 300 mm lens lying around…”</i></p><h3 id="let’s-go—up-the-mountain">Let’s go—up the mountain!<b></b></h3><p>Already in Vilaflor, the last village before the national park, the car beeped at 4°C. A few curves later, the roads were wet, and a little further up, they even started to sparkle with frost. I crawled up into the national park at 20 km/h. As soon as we entered the Caldera, we could see clouds spilling over the rim from the north—yep, exactly the direction we needed to head.</p><h3 id="is-the-weather-about-to-ruin-e">Is the weather about to ruin everything?<b></b></h3><p><i>“What if we just shoot the eclipse here, with the silhouette of the Roques in the foreground?”</i></p><p>We thought about it for a moment. The downside: the moon would dip behind them later, since the rocks aren’t that tall, and the sky would already be getting brighter with dawn. Plus, there’d be a much higher chance of bumping into other people here—people who might wander straight into our timelapses. And honestly, it just wouldn’t be <i>the</i> shot we’d spent so much time planning for.</p><p>So, we kept going. From the Teide cable car station onwards, the road got damp again, and I had to slow way down. These curves are no joke—and there are no winter tires on Tenerife.</p><p>Wisps of clouds started forming above us. Just 4 km to go. The clouds kept thickening. <i>Oh man, this is not looking good…</i><i></i></p><p>Eventually, we reached the parking lot near El Portillo. The clouds were spilling into the caldera from the left and drifting right over us.</p><div id="attachment_74336"><p><a href="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-5ahEOH2o" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-74336" src="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-720x480.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-720x480.jpg 720w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-400x267.jpg 400w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_.jpg 2000w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-720x480@2x.jpg 1440w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-600x400@2x.jpg 1200w, https://lrtimelapse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250314_035852971.NIGHT_-400x267@2x.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-74336">Down there, where the clouds are drifting—that’s where we need to go.

For the 50 mm wide shot, I decided to let the moon blow out <i>just a little</i>—as little as possible, but enough to still keep some detail in the landscape. For the telephoto shot, I was only capturing totality anyway, which made it way easier to expose properly.</p><p>Meanwhile, clouds had drifted in front of Teide and we found ourselves standing in freezing rain. Thankfully, the crater and the moon were still more or less visible. Our camera bags were crusted with ice crystals by now, and during my final camera adjustments, I couldn’t feel my fingers anymore. I couldn’t even manage to turn off the display—the button just wouldn’t press. Oh well, the battery would survive.

I mean, who else would be able to pinpoint this exact location so precisely? Probably only photographers, right?
