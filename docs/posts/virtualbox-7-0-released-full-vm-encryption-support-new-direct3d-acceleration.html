<strong>VirtualBox 7.0.0</strong> (released 2022-10-10)</p>
<ul><li>Virtual machines can be fully encrypted now, including the VM config logs and saved states (CLI only for now)
</li><li>OCI: Cloud virtual machines can be added to Virtual Machine Manager and controlled as local VMs
</li><li>OCI: Cloud networks can now be configured via Network Manager tool same way as it is done for Host-only and NAT networks
</li><li>GUI: Added a new utility similar to &#34;top&#34; or &#34;resource monitor&#34; which lists peformance statistics (CPU usage, RAM usage, disk I/O rate, etc.) of running guests
</li><li>GUI: Reworked the new vm wizard to integrate the unattended guest OS installation and to have a more streamlined work flow
</li><li>GUI: Added a new help viewer widget which enables the user manual to be navigated and searched
</li><li>GUI: Adding new notification center unifying most of running progresses and error reporting around the GUI
</li><li>GUI: Improved theme support on all platforms. Linux and macOS use native engine while for Windows host it is separately implemented.
</li><li>GUI: Large icon update.
</li><li>Audio recording: Now using Vorbis as the default audio format for WebM containers. Opus is no longer being used.
</li><li>Audio: Added &#34;default&#34; host driver type to make it possible to move VMs (appliances) between different platforms without the need of changing the audio driver explicitly. When the &#34;default&#34; driver is selected, the best audio backend option for a platform will be used. This is the default for newly created VMs.
</li><li>Guest Control: Implemented initial support for automatic updating of Guest Additions for Linux guests
</li><li>Guest Control: Implemented ability to wait for and/or reboot the guest when updating Guest Additions via VBoxManage
</li><li>VBoxManage: Added Guest Control &#34;waitrunlevel&#34; sub-command to make it possible to wait for a guest to reach a certain run level
</li><li>Windows hosts: Added experimental support of running autostarted VMs in session 0, to allow running VMS even when a usser is not being logged in (disabled by default, please consult the manual)
</li><li>macOS host: Dropped all kernel extensions. <a href="http://harihareswara.net/wiki/VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> relies fully on the hypervisor and vmnet frameworks provided by Apple now. At the moment the implementation lacks &#34;Internal Networking&#34; functionality. This will be provided at a later date.
</li><li>macOS host: Providing a Developer Preview package for systems with an Apple silicon CPU. This is unsupported work in progress, and is known to have very modest performance.
</li><li>Linux Guest Additions: Reworked guest screen re-size functionality, added basic integration with some of guest Desktop Environments
</li><li>Devices: Implemented new 3D support based on DirectX 11 (and DXVK on non Windows hosts)
</li><li>Devices: Added virtual IOMMU devices (Intel and AMD variant)
</li><li>Devices: Added virtual TPM 1.2 and 2.0 devices
</li><li>Devices: The EHCI and XHCI USB controller devices are now part of the open source base package
</li><li>EFI: Added support for Secure Boot
</li><li>Debugging: Added experimental support for guest debugging through GDB and highly experimental support for guest debugging through KD/WinDbg
</li></ul><p>
In addition, the following items were fixed and/or added:
</p>
<ul><li>OCI: Cloud networking functionality is enhanced for local VMs, now local VMs could be connected to cloud networking
</li><li>GUI: Improved behavior of the virtual machine list and various VM related tools in case multiple items are selected
</li><li>GUI: On available platforms, added a new option to disable the host&#39;s screensaver
</li><li>GUI: Reworked global preferences, machine settings and the wizards to improve stability and usability
</li><li>GUI: Improving mouse handling in multi-monitor case on X11 platform
</li><li>GUI: Medium enumeration engine was reworked to improve permormance
</li><li>GUI: NAT Network stuff was moved from global preferences to global Network Manager tool
</li><li>GUI: Extension Pack Manager was moved from global preferences to global tools
</li><li>GUI: Improved overall accessibility
</li><li>GUI: Migrating to recent Qt versions.
</li></ul></div></div>
