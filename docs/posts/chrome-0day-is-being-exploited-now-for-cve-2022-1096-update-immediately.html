<p>Google has issued an emergency security update for all Chrome users as it confirms that attackers are already exploiting a high severity zero-day vulnerability.</p> 
<p>The emergency update to version 99.0.4844.84 of Chrome is highly unusual in that it addresses just a single security vulnerability. A fact that only goes to emphasize how serious this one is.</p> 
 
<p>In a <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html" target="_blank" title="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html" aria-label="Chrome stable channel update announcement">Chrome stable channel update announcement</a>, published March 25, Google confirms it &#34;is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-1096 exists in the wild.&#34; </p> 
<p>All Chrome users are therefore advised to ensure their browsers are updated as a matter of urgency.</p>

<h2>What is CVE-2022-1096?</h2> 
<p>Not much is known, at least publicly, at this stage about <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1096" target="_blank" title="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1096" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1096" aria-label="CVE-2022-1096">CVE-2022-1096</a> other than it is a &#34;Type Confusion in V8.&#34; This refers to the JavaScript engine employed by Chrome. This holding back of detail is not unusual in such cases where a vulnerability is already being exploited by attackers. Google often will not reveal technical details until such a time as the update has been able to protect most of Chrome&#39;s 3.2 billion users.</p>
