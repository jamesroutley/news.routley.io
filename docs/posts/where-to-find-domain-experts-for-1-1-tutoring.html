    <h1>Ask HN: Where to find domain experts for 1:1 tutoring?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iâ€™m looking to get a crash course on a few topics and am hoping to do that by sitting down with domain experts for intensive 1:1 sessions. Has anyone here approached learning in a similar way, and if so, how did you go about sourcing experts? Currently looking for an AI expert.</p></div></div>
