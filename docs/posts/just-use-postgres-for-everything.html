    <h1>Just use Postgres for everything</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><em>Welcome HN. Technology is about tradeoffs. Using Postgres for everything is a tradeoff. Yes use the right tool for the job. Helping dozens of startups I have seen many more people overcomplicate setups than companies that use tools that are too simple for the job. If you have 1M+ customers, and you need Kafka, go ahead. If you have more systems than developers, just use Postgres. Thanks to Hugo and BunnyCDN for keeping the page fast. PS: Postgres for everything doesn’t mean one server for everything ;-)</em></p>
<p><strong>TLDR; just use Postgres for everything.</strong></p>
<p>We have invited complexity through the door. But it will not leave as easily.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.radicalsimpli.city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radical Simplicity</a> though.</p>
<p>One way to simplify your stack and reduce the moving parts, speed up development, lower the risk and deliver more features in your startup is <strong>“Use Postgres for everything”</strong>. Postgres can replace - up to millions of users - many backend technologies, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Mongo and Redis among them.</p>
<p>Use Postgres for caching instead of Redis with <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/faster-performance-with-unlogged-tables-in-postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNLOGGED tables</a> and TEXT as a JSON data type. <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Use stored procedures</a> to add and enforce an expiry date for the data just like in Redis.</p>
<p>Use Postgres as a message queue with <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/what-skip-locked-postgresql-95" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SKIP LOCKED</a> instead of Kafka (if you only need a message queue).</p>
<p>Use Postgres with <a href="https://www.timescale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TimescaleDB</a> as a data warehouse.</p>
<p>Use Postgres with <a href="https://scalegrid.io/blog/using-jsonb-in-postgresql-how-to-effectively-store-index-json-data-in-postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JSONB</a> to store Json documents in a database, search and index them - instead of Mongo.</p>
<p>Use Postgres for <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-vs-the-rest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fulltext Search</a> instead of Elastic.</p>
<p>Use Postgres to <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/graphql-for-server-development/">generate JSON in the database</a>, write no server side code and directly give it to the API.</p>
<p>Use Postgres with a <a href="https://graphjin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GraphQL adapter</a> to deliver GraphQL if needed.</p>
<p>There I’ve said it, <strong>just use Postgres for everything</strong>.</p>
