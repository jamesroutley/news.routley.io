    <h1>All the remedial classes in one place</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thanks for all that. It is in Philly, &amp; despite there being offerings as high as Discrete Mathematics 1 &amp; 2, Linear Algebra, Calc 3, &amp; Differential Equations, CCP is a 2-year college &amp; students are expected to transfer to a 4-year university when they finish whatever courses they&#39;re advised to by their major selection. The higher classes like Linear Algebra &amp; DiffEq have just one section per semester, whereas the lowest classes like 016, 017, 118, etc have thousands of seats in dozens of sections across all semesters including summer. I believe that some classes, like 151 &amp; 152, have few majors that really require them and mainly serve as for students who need a maths elective and took Intermediate Algebra (118) and don&#39;t want/need precalc 1/2 (161/162). I believe here at CCP, what others call College Algebra is Precalc 1 as it&#39;s all about functions &amp; their graphs. 162, Precalc 2, seems to be some more functions &amp; trig.</p><p><span><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=491174673971804494&amp;postID=5688555434066847530">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></div>
