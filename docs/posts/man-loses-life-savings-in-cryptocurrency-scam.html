I noticed an ad that was endorsed by two well-known celebrities showing you could earn more money than you could earn in a bank,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I started with £250. I didn&#39;t know anything about how cryptocurrency worked, I knew it existed but I didn&#39;t know the ins and outs.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That initial investment gave a good return and the company had its own website and even assigned a personal client manager, with all dealings done over the phone, not online.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Nothing appeared to be strange, there were no red flags flying in my mind,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Every question I asked I got answers to, so there was nothing to alert me that I was going down a very rocky road. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s ironic that from the very start I kept a very detailed spreadsheet of all the transactions and the tradings. I wasn&#39;t frightened at that stage. I was using money but if I lost it I could survive.&#34;</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="They-enticed-you-in"><span role="text">&#39;They enticed you in&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>After a few months of continued investment, by this stage about £5,000, he was invited to join the company&#39;s &#34;retirement section&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;They were quoting unbelievable figures and when I asked about tax they said cryptocurrency is unregulated and I was thinking &#39;I&#39;m not sure&#39;, but they enticed you in,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Then the gentleman - or maybe gentleman isn&#39;t the right word in this case - the man who was my client manager he went off,  supposedly with Covid, and another man was assigned to me.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The man said he had access to an account and a trading platform he could log in to and see his investments and trading. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When I checked the cryptocurrency market websites, that had nothing to do with this company, you could see where the different types of cryptocurrency were trading and that confirmed what was happening on my account,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>By now he had invested a six-figure sum. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He is not prepared to say exactly how much, but it was all of his savings and his pension lump sum. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company had asked him for extra money as an insurance on his investment, but it was not supposed to be traded and he was told he could get it back at any time. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On 15 February he logged on to his account and the extra money had been traded without his permission. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was only then he realised that the whole set-up was a scam. </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="I-wanted-to-crawl-into-a-hole"><span role="text">&#39;I wanted to crawl into a hole&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Luckily there was no borrowing or selling anything or dealing with the house. It was all personal savings and pension, &#34; he said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You would have gone to bed at night before all of this and had plans, thoughts and dreams about what you want to do, but this has killed all of that.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Throughout the interview with BBC News NI, the man was visibly upset, crying and it was clear the scam had a detrimental affect on him. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When I found out in February that it was all gone, I just wanted to crawl into a hole,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Home-wise, it has destroyed home life because I was dealing with all this by myself, my wife didn&#39;t know what was happening.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He contacted the company to complain and they referred him to a client support group, which was also part of this sophisticated and detailed scam. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He also started to contact everyone, from the police to the Financial Conduct Authority to Trading Standards.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Damien Doherty, chief inspector of the Northern Ireland Trading Standards Service, said scams such as this were not uncommon.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We&#39;re very well aware of how these scams operate. They&#39;re very slick,&#34; he said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;As we&#39;ve heard in this case they have account managers, they have complaint managers, they have escalation procedures. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Everything about it would make you believe you&#39;re dealing with a legitimate company.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p> &#34;The sums of money involved and the devastation that this has caused to this man&#39;s life and his family is heartbreaking . </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Damien Doherty from Trading Standards says scams are often sophisticated</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s a real emerging trend and the sums of money huge and they really have the potential to ruin people&#39;s lives and in this case we&#39;re trying to raise awareness and let people know that this is a scam that is prominent, that anyone could fall for it.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Retirement plans for the victim of this scam have had to be shelved and despite the obvious toll it has taken, he really wants to warn others not to fall prey to this scam. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You&#39;re sleeping, waking and thinking about it. It has taken over my whole life,&#34; he said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Trying to get a resolution, to get even some of the money back would be the icing on the cake, but it has been completely devastating. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;You can&#39;t think about plans because you&#39;ve nothing to plan with. It has basically put a stop on my life.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>For more information on scams and how to avoid them, visit <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/scams">https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/scams</a></p></div></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
