<article>





<p>I&#39;m going through one of those <em>moments</em> in life where everything changes at once. As such, I&#39;ve been deliberately trying to branch out into new tools and new ways of thinking. A month-or-so ago, I bought a <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">Remarkable</a> tablet.</p>
<p>At this point in the article, everyone who&#39;s known me for a long time is in shock. I have comically bad handwriting. So bad that it has a diagnosis--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgraphia">dysgraphia</a>.</p>
<p>I love typing notes. Most of my notes, and <em>all</em> of my writing is digital. I refuse to write code by hand unless I&#39;m forced to in an interview. But some things are not easily typed: organic molecules, ERD diagrams, flow-charts, doodles... the list goes on. That&#39;s exactly why pen-and-paper has historically had a place in my toolkit despite its disadvantages.</p>
<p>Paper also has a magical quality that digital tools lack. It captures the &#34;air in the room.&#34; When you review paper notes you can see how an agenda turns into an idea, turns into a meeting, turned into a doodle, turned into a diagram. You see how thoughts and events bleed together.</p>
<p>One of the things that excited me greatly about getting a Remarkable tablet was that it might combine what I love about paper and what I love about computers. Like paper, I thought it would be easy to pick up and use. Like digital products, I it would let me stay organized and hyperlinked.</p>
<h2 id="i-went-for-it" tabindex="-1">I went for it <a href="#i-went-for-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>A few weeks before starting my new job, I decided now was the time to try Remarkable. It took a little while to arrive, but when it did, I was excited. The unboxing was a good experience. You can tell they spent a lot of energy on it (honestly probably too much considering its other deficits). It had an Apple feel, and even <em>smelled</em> like a new mac.</p>
<p>When I turned it on, I had one of my first disappointments. It was <em>really</em> hard to to type my wifi password. I have a fairly long password, and it must have taken me 5 tries to get it right. This speaks to the fact that Remarkable didn&#39;t invest too much in the typing experience. That makes sense... after all, they are building an e-paper company. But this problem exemplified something deeper. <em>The non-writing features that you <em>need</em> in order to use the product are flat-out bad.</em></p>
<p>Remarkable is harder than paper-and-pencil in some really crucial ways. You&#39;d think that it would make up for its weaknesses with digital benefits that paper can&#39;t provide. But it doesn&#39;t. <em>You&#39;d be better off with a paper notebook and a scanner.</em></p>
<h2 id="it&#39;s-too-small.-flipping-the-page-is-way-too-hard." tabindex="-1">It&#39;s too small. Flipping the page is <em>way</em> too hard. <a href="#it&#39;s-too-small.-flipping-the-page-is-way-too-hard." aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://offbyone.us/img/remarkable/page-transitions.png" alt="hard page transitions"/></p>
<p>When I finished onboarding, I decided to start a daily notes folder and make a notebook for each day. I filled up the first page quite quickly just drawing random stuff about the day. I was surprised how quickly the page filled up. It felt closer to writing on a large napkin than a piece of paper. I felt cramped. I looked it up, and Remarkable has the height and width of A5 paper.</p>
<p><img src="https://offbyone.us/img/remarkable/adding-page.png" alt="Hard to add a page"/></p>
<p>I should note that in theory there is a gesture I saw referenced in the onboarding materials to go to the &#34;next&#34; page, but I never could figure out how to make it happen, and I&#39;m not sure if it is supposed to add a page to the end of a notebook or just navigate between existing pages. When I wanted to &#34;turn the page,&#34; I was shocked at how hard it was. I had to give the sidebar menu a colonoscopy to find the UI to list all pages, then create a new one, then navigate to it. This gap in effort between my expectations and my experience was massive.</p>
<h2 id="the-eraser-is-kind-of-annoying" tabindex="-1">The eraser is kind of annoying <a href="#the-eraser-is-kind-of-annoying" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I was relatively happy with the flexibility of the writing settings. You could write with different styles and widths. Writing felt good. Erasing was simple enough, but I did notice a subtle imprecision. The content you erased wasn&#39;t <em>quite</em> where you put your eraser. It wasn&#39;t a deal breaker, but just annoying enough to note.</p>
<h2 id="shitty-file-system" tabindex="-1">Shitty file system <a href="#shitty-file-system" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The filesystem they chose--folders and notebooks--are just not the best choice. Remarkable decided to use UI patterns from other tablets and computers but didn&#39;t mirror the UX quality that I&#39;ve come to expect. As I previously mentioned, their tablet-like UI is hard to use. It just takes too much effort to move things around and get organized.</p>
<h2 id="no-context-or-tie-ins" tabindex="-1">No context or tie-ins <a href="#no-context-or-tie-ins" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>You can&#39;t hook remarkable notes into anything. I wanted to use Remarkable in meetings. I figured there would be a way to automatically create notebooks for meetings and save that association to my calendar. That wasn&#39;t possible. As far as I could see there is no official API support either, so it&#39;s not possible to make a plugin.</p>
<p>I wanted to have drop tags in notebooks--impossible.</p>
<p>I figured that at least there&#39;d be some way to drop a breadcrumb on the page to reference something like the current time. Perhaps I could use that at the end of the day to cross-reference meetings with notes. This was also not possible.</p>
<h2 id="bad-sync" tabindex="-1">Bad sync <a href="#bad-sync" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The sync feature between apps is just buggy. The setup is relatively slick, but notebooks get stuck in a stale state. I often needed to restart my Remarkable, my mac app, or both to get the latest notes to sync. There&#39;s no sync or refresh button.</p>
<h2 id="you-can&#39;t-really-read-books" tabindex="-1">You can&#39;t really read books <a href="#you-can&#39;t-really-read-books" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Remarkable is advertised as an E-Ink reader as well as a writing device. In reality, this only works if you have e-pub books on your hard drive. Where can you get e-pub books? Basically nowhere. There are many public-domain titles, but if someone were to purchase the Remarkable thinking they were also getting a kindle, they&#39;d be very disapointed. It&#39;s true that you can annotate PDFs on the remarkable. But, that wasn&#39;t something I had a particular itch to do. Perhaps if I was already being asked for feedback on PDFs in my regular workflow, that feature would have resonated with me differently.</p>
<h2 id="comically-bad-ocr-no-search" tabindex="-1">Comically bad OCR; No search <a href="#comically-bad-ocr-no-search" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Remarkable advertises that they can convert your handwritten notes into text. This doesn&#39;t really work. Firstly, it doesn&#39;t happen automatically, you have to do trigger the OCR yourself. When you trigger it, it&#39;s done per-page, not per notebook, which is kind of stupid. The text also isn&#39;t saved in any notebook hierarchy, it too is page-by-page.</p>
<p><img src="https://offbyone.us/img/remarkable/ocr.png"/>
</p>
<p>The OCR quality is comically bad. It picks up a few words here and there, but it just isn&#39;t what you wrote. If it did work, there&#39;s no way to search all your notebooks for text and go to the right page.</p>
<h2 id="sum-it-up" tabindex="-1">Sum it up <a href="#sum-it-up" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Let&#39;s take a moment to consider Remarkable vs pen, paper &amp; scanner.</p>

<p>I want to say that I don&#39;t intend to knock the Remarkable team. It&#39;s clear how much thought and energy and love they&#39;ve poured into their work. It just doesn&#39;t work or even make sense to me. What am I missing? Clearly something. I&#39;ve met multiple people who swear by this product. So it&#39;s doing something right! I&#39;d love to understand what makes Remarkable work when it works.</p>
