    <h1>When deployments are easy, code becomes simpler</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>Feature flagging tools like Launch Darkly, PostHog, Flagsmith come with costs. They buy you a ton of capabilities like A/B testing, phased rollouts, and reducing the need for deployments. If you sense a but coming, there is. Well, sort of.</p><p>Much of the time I’m using flags so I can commit unfinished code because I don’t want to create a separate branch and have one source of truth (low WIP baby - can you get more agile than that?). Basically, I want to reap the benefits of trunk-based development. For example, I’m implementing a Gift Card feature for JumpComedy.com and have the customer side working but not the admin side, so I want to hold back.</p><p><span>I could have created another Flagsmith toggle around the admin code, but that seemed to be overkill. Instead, I chose to have a simple hard-coded </span><code>const isGiftCardFeatureEnabled = false</code><span> variable and use that instead. Is this bad because I now have to do a deployment to enable the feature?</span></p><p>I would argue as long as your deployments are easy, this is the better way to do things because it reduces the complexity of integrating with a third-party tool. I did an inventory of my recent feature flags and realized that about 80% of them aren’t there to roll things out to specific populations, or do any sort of A/B testing, but to hide unfinished code.</p><p><span>Yet more evidence that </span><a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2021.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">DORA</a><span> (PDF) isn’t crazy for prioritizing deployment frequency so high when labelling organizations as elite.</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
