    <h1>OpenAUTH: Universal, standards-based auth provider</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">   <div>   <div>  <div>  <main data-pagefind-body="" lang="en" dir="ltr">   <div> <div> <div> <section> <p><img src="https://openauth.js.org/_astro/logo-dark.CYQo1n78_2ryvk3.svg" loading="eager" decoding="async" alt="OpenAuth logo" width="400" height="63"/> <img src="https://openauth.js.org/_astro/logo-light.h_qdQOU__Z1DMlRx.svg" loading="eager" decoding="async" alt="OpenAuth logo" width="400" height="63"/> </p>  </section> <section>    </section> <section> <ul> <li><b>Universal</b>: You can deploy it as a standalone service or embed it into an existing application. It works with any framework or platform.</li> <li><b>Self-hosted</b>: It runs entirely on your infrastructure and can be deployed on Node.js, Bun, AWS Lambda, or Cloudflare Workers.</li> <li><b>Standards-based</b>: It implements the OAuth 2.0 spec and is based on web standards. So any OAuth client can use it.</li> <li><b>Customizable</b>: It comes with prebuilt themeable UI that you can customize or opt out of.</li> </ul> </section> <section> <p>While there are many open source solutions for auth, almost all of them are libraries that are meant to be embedded into a single application. Centralized auth servers typically are delivered as SaaS services - eg Auth0 or Clerk.</p> <p>OpenAuth instead is a centralized auth server that runs on your own infrastructure and has been designed for ease of self hosting. It can be used to authenticate all of your applications - web apps, mobile apps, internal admin tools, etc.</p> <p>It adheres mostly to OAuth 2.0 specifications - which means anything that can speak OAuth can use it to receive access and refresh tokens. When a client initiates an authorization flow, OpenAuth will hand off to one of the configured adapters - this can be third party identity providers like Google, GitHub, etc or built in flows like email/password or pin code.</p> <p>Because it follows these specifications it can even be used to issue credentials for third party applications - allowing you to implement &#34;login with myapp&#34; flows.</p> <p>OpenAuth very intentionally does not attempt to solve user management. We&#39;ve found that this is a very difficult problem given the wide range of databases and drivers that are used in the JS ecosystem. Additionally it&#39;s quite hard to build data abstractions that work for every use case. Instead, once a user has identified themselves OpenAuth will invoke a callback where you can implement your own user lookup/creation logic.</p> <p>While OpenAuth tries to be mostly stateless, it does need to store a minimal amount of data (refresh tokens, password hashes, etc). However this has been reduced to a simple KV store with various implementations for zero overhead systems like Cloudflare KV and DynamoDB. You should never need to directly access any data that is stored in there.</p> <p>There is also a themeable UI that you can use to get going without implementing any designs yourself. This is built on top of a lower level system so you can copy paste the default UI and tweak it or opt out entirely and implement your own.</p> <p>Finally, OpenAuth is created by the maintainers of <a target="_blank" href="https://sst.dev">SST</a> which is a tool to manage all the infrastructure for your app. It contains components for OpenAuth that make deploying it to AWS or Cloudflare as simple as it can get.</p> </section>  </div>    </div> </div>  </main> </div> </div>  </div> </div></div>
