<p><span>03 May 2024</span></p><p>This blog post is part of a series on file formats research. See <a href="https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/blog/2023/08/04/researching-file-formats-library-of-congress-sustainability-of-digital-formats/">this introduction post</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Update: The official format definition is now online here: <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000595.shtml">Silverlight Application Package</a>. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/contact_format.shtml">Comments welcome</a> directly to the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>Okay, this was a fun one! If you remember using Netflix in the early-to-mid 2010s, you might remember having to download this extra thing called Silverlight in order to stream video. For reasons that I would love to have a full-length book on, that same package application, Silverlight, is also the same as the short-lived Windows Phone installation package, or XAP (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/katriend/silverlight-2-structure-of-the-new-xap-file-silverlight-packaged-application">pronounced “zap”</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to the confusion around the two use cases (phones and Silverlight), XAP is also the extension for XACT Audio Projects, which is also now called Microsoft XNA Game Studio.</p>

<p>Both Windows Phones and Silverlight are discontinued products.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows phones ran from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone">October 21, 2010 to June 2, 2015</a></li>
  <li>Silverlight existed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">September 5, 2007 to January 15, 2019</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Like the two previous package formats, XAP files are also essentially just ZIP files structured in a specific way. These have two manifest files and some DLLs (containing the compiled version of the application).</p>

<p>Documentation is sparse, all around.</p>

<p>XAP format was replaced by APPX format, although not for long since Windows Phones had a less-than-5-year lifespan.</p>
