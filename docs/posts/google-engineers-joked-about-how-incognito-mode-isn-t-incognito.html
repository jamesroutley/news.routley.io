    <h1>Google engineers joked about how incognito mode isn&#39;t incognito</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>&#34;We need to stop calling it Incognito and stop using a Spy Guy icon.&#34;</h2><h2>I Spy</h2><p>Google is at the center of an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-private-browsing-mode-not-really-private-texas-lawsuit-says-2022-05-19/">icky lawsuit</a>, filed in May, that alleges the Silicon Valley giant misled the public about how much data it collects from users even when they&#39;re in its Chrome browser&#39;s &#34;Incognito&#34; private browsing mode. And while those allegations are concerning, one of the more eye-brow raising details to emerge from the lawsuit is the Google employees&#39; potentially compromising jokes on the matter.</p><p>But what was also revealed in court was a very serious email from Google marketing chief Lorraine Twohill sent to CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>&#34;Make Incognito Mode truly private,&#34; Twohill wrote in the email last year, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/google-s-incognito-inspires-staff-jokes-and-a-big-lawsuit?sref=YfHlo0rL">quoted by <i>Bloomberg</i></a>. &#34;We are limited in how strongly we can market Incognito because it&#39;s not truly private, thus requiring really fuzzy, hedging language that is almost more damaging.&#34;</p><h2>Jokes Don&#39;t Lie</h2><p>The email, along with plenty of others communications, were revealed in court documents from the pending trial. Many of them show that Google&#39;s engineering grunts thought the company&#39;s outward disposition on Incognito mode was suspect and misleading.</p><p>Sharing a study that demonstrated users misunderstood Incognito mode&#39;s limited privacy, one Chrome engineer wrote in a 2018 group chat to colleagues that &#34;we need to stop calling it Incognito and stop using a Spy Guy icon,&#34; referring to Incognito mode&#39;s dorky icon that depicts the silhouette of a cartoon spy wearing sunglasses and a fedora.</p><p>Another engineer responded by linking to a wiki page of a character on &#34;The Simpsons&#34; called <a href="https://youtu.be/7jaAeTaG_ms">Guy Incognito</a>, who looks exactly like Homer Simpson — if he was dressed in a bad disguise.</p><p>&#34;Regardless of the name,&#34; the employee continued, &#34;the Incognito icon should have always been [Guy Incognito]... which also accurately conveys the level of privacy it provides.&#34;</p><h2>Been Made</h2><p>All told, yikes. That’s a pretty damning — and funny — insight into how much Google&#39;s own employees believed in the browsing mode&#39;s privacy, which is to say not a lot.</p><p>Google, in its defense, argues that it makes it clear to users that Incognito mode isn&#39;t fully private, and that its users have already consented to have their data tracked by the company. The trial doesn&#39;t have a date set yet, but it could potentially unveil what kind of data Google keeps in store from Incognito. It&#39;ll be fascinating to watch play out.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/google-s-incognito-inspires-staff-jokes-and-a-big-lawsuit?sref=YfHlo0rL">Google&#39;s &#39;Incognito&#39; Mode Inspires Staff Jokes — and a Big Lawsuit</a></em></p><p><strong>More on: </strong><em><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/google-ai-imagen-not-releasing">Google Not Releasing New Video-Generating AI Because of Small Issue With Gore, Porn and Racism</a></em></p></div></div>
