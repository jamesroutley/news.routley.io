<p>“We are thrilled to empower early adopters with our latest technology, allowing them to influence the future of RISC-V development,” said <strong>Yuning Liang, CEO of DeepComputing</strong>. “This program reflects our commitment to innovation and collaboration with our customers.”</p>



<p><strong>Framework CEO Nirav Patel</strong> added, “We’re excited to see DeepComputing continuing to enable the RISC-V developer and business community through their new Early Access Program, and we’re glad to have helped power that through our modular, upgradeable hardware platforms.”</p>



<p>The DC-ROMA RISC-V Mainboard will be receiving strong support from teams such as the <strong>upstream kernel community</strong>, <strong>Ubuntu</strong>, and <strong>Fedora </strong>for system optimization and assurance that new kernel releases work properly with it. “As both a representative of the RISC-V International Board of Directors and a member of the Fedora community, I am excited to see DeepComputing and Framework collaborate to advance RISC-V technology. The DC-ROMA RISC-V Mainboard Early Access Program opens the door for early adopters to actively shape the future of open-source computing. This initiative aligns with Fedora’s mission to empower developers with innovative, adaptable technology and drive progress in the RISC-V ecosystem,” said <strong>Jeffrey Osier-Mixon</strong>.</p>



<p>“We’re excited to support the DC-ROMA RISC-V Mainboard with Ubuntu, bringing RISC-V technologies closer to developers. With the DC-ROMA RISC-V Mainboard, developers and enthusiasts can leverage their existing chassis and experience Linux, Ubuntu and open source on the innovative and disruptive RISC-V ISA, all thanks to DeepComputing,” said <strong>Gordan Markuš, Director of Silicon Alliances at Canonical</strong>. “Our collaboration with DeepComputing and their early adopters highlights our shared commitment to openness in computing and robust Linux support for the RISC-V community.</p>



<p>“This Early Access Program gives developers a platform to work directly with a RISC-V system in a common form factor to ensure that Linux runs well on it,” said <strong>Greg Kroah-Hartman, Linux Foundation Fellow</strong>. “Collaborations like these are essential to driving forward both Linux and RISC-V, as they enable early adopters to help shape the future of open-source hardware.”</p>



<p>DeepComputing is committed to working closely with both the software and hardware communities, as well as the open-source community, to drive the continued development of RISC-V + Linux.
