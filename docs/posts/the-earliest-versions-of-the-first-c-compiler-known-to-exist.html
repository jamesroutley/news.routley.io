<p dir="auto">The earliest versions of the very first c compiler known to exist in the wild written by the late legend himself dmr.</p>
<p dir="auto">These are not capable of being compiled today with modern c compilers like gcc. I am only posting these here for the enjoyment and reminiscing of the spark that ignited a soon to be trillion dollar industry. Enjoy. :)</p>
<p dir="auto">You guys might be able to play around building this compilier with Aiju&#39;s pdp-11/unix emulator. I havent tried building this myself so I cant confirm it works, but I posted the link to her emulator for anybody wanting to hack around with it.</p>

<p dir="auto">PDP-11 Emulator: [<a href="http://pdp11.aiju.de/" rel="nofollow">http://pdp11.aiju.de/</a>] (so i&#39;ve been playing around with this to see if it still works, and it clearly has problems right now. if somebody wants to try and create like a VM image of unix running on PDP-7 hardware, id happily link to it here.)</p>
