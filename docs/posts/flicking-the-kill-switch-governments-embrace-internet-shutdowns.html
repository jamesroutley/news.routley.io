The caller said the military had seized power and was arresting opposition politicians, then hung up. Ko Zin Lin Htet remembered what he did next: “I checked my phone and my internet connection. There was nothing there.”</span></p><p>He got on his motorbike and drove to the parliament, where he saw military personnel, not police, guarding the buildings.

It was the first stage of a digital coup designed to exert control over communications by slowing and strategically shutting off the internet.</p><p>Nathan Maung was another Burmese journalist who recalls the confusion and disbelief on the day of the military takeover. “The internet was out.” He looked for his most recent texts – “The last messages from my friends said, ‘Shit happened’. I have no clue what shit happened.”</p><p>The whole country had been plunged into an information black hole.</p><p><span><h2 id="cloak-of-darkness">‘Cloak of darkness’</h2></span></p><p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Ukraine</a> to Myanmar, government-run internet outages are picking up pace around the world. In 2021, there were 182 shutdowns in 34 countries, according to Access Now, a non-government organisation that tracks connectivity around the world. Countries across Africa and Asia have turned to shutdowns in a bid to control behaviour, while India, largely in the conflict-ridden region of Jammu and Kashmir, plunged into digital darkness more times than any other last year. </p><p>The increasing use of the kill switch underlines a deepening global trend towards digital authoritarianism, as governments use access to the internet as a weapon against their own people. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Internet</a> shutdowns have also become a modern canary in the coalmine.</p><p>“The internet going off is well known in many countries to be a sign or a signal that something bad is about to happen,” says Simon Angus, an economist from Monash University whose Monash Internet Observatory tracks global internet connectivity in real time. “That seems to be aligned closely with human rights abuses because it really is a cloak of darkness.”</p><p>The shutdowns disconnect emergency workers and hospitals and paralyse financial systems, yet governments are using them with ever more frequency. Figures from Access Now show outages increased globally 15% in 2021, compared with the year before. Such outages cause immense economic damage – an estimated $5.5bn last year – but go largely unnoticed by the outside world, because information flows in and out of the affected countries have been severed.</p><p>The UN Human Rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, in June condemned internet shutdowns: “Switching off the internet causes incalculable damage, both in material and human rights terms.” </p><p><span><h2 id="theres-no-freedom">‘There’s no freedom’</h2></span></p><p>In Ukraine, that cloak of darkness fell one hour before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-has-invaded-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far" data-link-name="in body link">Russia’s invasion in February</a>, when a massive state-sponsored cyber-attack on a key satellite internet network knocked tens of thousands of Ukrainian modems offline, while Sudan severed the internet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/25/sudan-coup-fears-amid-claims-military-have-arrested-senior-government-officials" data-link-name="in body link">after its military coup</a>.

The raids had a profound psychological toll.</p><figure id="2e15bd49-9914-46c7-953c-df942d007a33" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def58012bc56dbc4cac78d8ff8ee762c7e6686d6/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=32092ddd3212066da9955f2729c7811b" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def58012bc56dbc4cac78d8ff8ee762c7e6686d6/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bba10c636f47134d872220628bde6e33" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def58012bc56dbc4cac78d8ff8ee762c7e6686d6/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=d4fbba2c6adef475ca39dc940397a40e" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def58012bc56dbc4cac78d8ff8ee762c7e6686d6/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=040db160072f8e53971724286727cd2b" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def58012bc56dbc4cac78d8ff8ee762c7e6686d6/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=817d613d3b75fefb76e0287e54bea83b" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def58012bc56dbc4cac78d8ff8ee762c7e6686d6/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=81a7fd24212beeada3e9d93e10c2a001" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Soldiers seen from above as they walk along a Yangon street during a protest against Myanmar’s military coup" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def58012bc56dbc4cac78d8ff8ee762c7e6686d6/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bba10c636f47134d872220628bde6e33" height="2101" width="3500" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Soldiers walk on a street in Yangon during a protest against Myanmar’s military coup in February 2021.</span> Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>“I used to chat with my friends late at night,” says one woman from Yangon. “As 1am approached every night, that feeling of frustration would start building. It felt like they controlled everything. There’s no freedom.”</p><p> The nightly shutdowns became “a form of terror”, according to Angus. “It becomes a psychological rhythm and marker that people have to endure. It sends a signal as well. It says: ‘We’re still in control.’”</p><p>The period of nightly outages was followed by a complete nationwide shutdown for 73 days.</p><p><span><h2 id="impact-of-shutdowns">Impact of shutdowns</h2></span></p><p>Internet shutdowns are not just used by governments facing civil unrest. Every year millions of internet users from Sudan to Syria, Jordan to India also lose internet access during exam season as governments pull the plug in a bid to avoid hi-tech cheating.</p><p>For the past five years, 21-year-old trainee doctor Aya Hich has been forced to sit her medical exams in Algeria without access to the internet. That’s because every year the government severs the internet for five days to ensure that high school students do not cheat on their baccalaureate exams.</p><p>“It is always frustrating year after year that we have to be cut off from the rest of the world,” Hich says. </p><p>The economic costs – and other less obvious impacts – of shutdowns radiate across industries. Sudanese architect Tagreed Ahdin remembers the difficulties of surviving for a month with no online banking when the new military junta shut down the internet in 2021. “We raided the kids’ wallets and pooled everything,” she says. But one of the biggest issues was simply staying cool in the 40-degree heat, when the apps selling electricity no longer functioned.</p><figure id="017d1ad4-800c-41dc-8ef0-9b27f72b17bc" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:28,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/russia-blocks-google-news-after-it-bans-ads-on-proukraine-invasion-content&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Russia blocks Google News after ad ban on content condoning Ukraine invasion&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;017d1ad4-800c-41dc-8ef0-9b27f72b17bc&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:2,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:9}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-28 | 28" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>“Our first panic moment came when we realised we couldn’t buy electricity,” she says. “We were shutting down everything all over the house, while the kids begged for air conditioning. It was so hot.”</p><p>India leads total shutdowns globally. In 2021, the world’s largest democracy shut off its internet 106 times – more than the rest of the world combined. Hardest-hit was the conflict-ridden region of Jammu and Kashmir, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/the-personal-and-economic-cost-of-kashmirs-internet-ban" data-link-name="in body link">subject to 85 shutdowns</a> under the guise of containing separatist violence. The blackouts shut down Zoom classes for students, stopped doctors from communicating with their remote patients and crippled the banking system, causing mortgage holders to default on their loans. Apple crops rotted before they could be sold and businesses were paralysed.</p><figure id="e676d593-ac42-46d9-8cd3-27f1fc3f5361" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7ed34c253212a7e38d092d786cf32d0cbf15aa/0_258_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=2159e3d5f12eb0c7120202304860d8c8" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7ed34c253212a7e38d092d786cf32d0cbf15aa/0_258_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2baf90fd0b017a2e5b0c719c796117cf" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7ed34c253212a7e38d092d786cf32d0cbf15aa/0_258_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=bc68cb145d7eee1c2ef2ba2c72ace319" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7ed34c253212a7e38d092d786cf32d0cbf15aa/0_258_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=ce1d1c45b9431c2589730ed1139b997b" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7ed34c253212a7e38d092d786cf32d0cbf15aa/0_258_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=2d251d497e1385500a7b00f171bc7a0c" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7ed34c253212a7e38d092d786cf32d0cbf15aa/0_258_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a58c13f508c74e0ed14343fe2a80b418" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Protesters take part in a demonstration amid teargas smoke fired by Indian security forces in Srinagar in May 2022" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7ed34c253212a7e38d092d786cf32d0cbf15aa/0_258_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2baf90fd0b017a2e5b0c719c796117cf" height="2318" width="3864" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Teargas is fired at protesters at a protest in Srinagar, in the Kashmir Valley, in May 2022.</span> Photograph: Tauseef Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>“We didn’t have anything to do.
