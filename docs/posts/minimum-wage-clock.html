<p>This began as a quick-and-dirty experiment<sup id="fnref:quick-and-dirty"><a href="#fn:quick-and-dirty">[1]</a></sup> to visualize the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Minimum Wage</a> in real-time, inspired by Blake Fall-Conroy’s <a href="https://www.blakefallconroy.com/minimum-wage-machine.html">Minimum Wage Machine</a>.</p>
<p>Then I added the US <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage">Federal Minimum Wage</a>, since a sizeable proportion of this blog’s readership are US-based. Did you know the US also has a <a href="https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/docs/ymwplink.asp">Youth Minimum Wage</a>? I didn’t.</p>
<p>Then I got curious, and added some CEO salaries for comparison. The vast disparity is nothing new to me, but seeing it like this...</p>
<p>It’s fucking sobering.</p>

<hr/>
<p>The UK and US minimum wage numbers are, to the best of my knowledge, accurate at the time of publishing. Additionally, the code has been written to account for the changes to the UK minimum wage taking effect on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2024. If you’re reading this in the far future, the numbers presented here may no longer reflect reality.<sup id="fnref:us-refusal-to-change"><a href="#fn:us-refusal-to-change">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>CEO <em>annual</em> salaries were taken from the <a href="https://aflcio.org/paywatch/highest-paid-ceos">American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (AFL-CIO). <em>Hourly</em> salary estimates were then derived by assuming 260 weekdays in a year, and 8 hours worked per day.</p>
