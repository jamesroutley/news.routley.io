    <h1>Recovering from a kidney donation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div>  <div> <article> <hgroup>  <span> <time datetime="2024-11-10T07:00:00.000Z"> Sun, Nov 10, 2024 </time>  <span>|</span> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42104568">View comments on Hacker News</a>  </span> </hgroup>  <p>I donated my kidney to a stranger on October 30th. I’m writing this to share my experience and hopefully to encourage others to donate, too. It’s not very exciting which is the point — donating a kidney is something that any (healthy) person can do without major risk or long-term consequence.</p>
<p>Here’s the rough timeline of my donation and recovery:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>October 2023</strong>: Read article, reach out to <a href="https://waitlistzero.org/">Waitlist Zero</a></li>
<li><strong>November 2023</strong>: Video call with Elaine Perlman at Waitlist Zero, reached out to Virginia Mason Medical Center. Went to Quest labs and dropped off blood samples</li>
<li><strong>December 2023</strong>: Phone conversations with a social worker and transplant coordinator</li>
<li><strong>January 2024</strong>: Ultrasound and more blood tests</li>
<li><strong>February 2024</strong>: Full-day workup: CT scan, EKG, 24-hour urine sample, mental health evaluation, more blood tests</li>
<li><em>Gap where I was stressed about school/work</em></li>
<li><strong>June 2024</strong>: Appointment with Endocrinologist to investigate an episode of hypoglycemia. Approved to donate towards the end of the month</li>
<li><strong>September 2024</strong>: Matching</li>
<li><strong>October 2024</strong>: Final cross-match (more blood tests)</li>
<li><strong>October 29th</strong>: Pre-op</li>
<li><strong>October 30th</strong>: Surgery</li>
<li><strong>October 31st</strong>: Discharge from hospital</li>
<li><strong>November 3rd</strong>: Started to feel normal. Able to sleep comfortably on side</li>
<li><strong>November 4th</strong>: Returned to (remote) work. Stopped needing any medications</li>
<li><strong>November 6th</strong>: First time driving. Able to sleep comfortably on stomach</li>
<li><strong>November 7th</strong>: One-week follow up</li>
</ul>
<p>The process leading up to donation was fairly lengthy and involved lots of testing and reading. It does take a fair bit of time, but I thought it was worthwhile considering how much it would help someone else.</p>
<p>I arrived at the hospital around 1:00pm. I went to the pre-op area, undressed, and talked to several medical staff. They told me who they were and informed me about the procedure. I signed a few documents consenting to the procedure.</p>
<p>My surgery occurred on October 30th around 2:30pm. It all went incredibly smoothly. I had no complications and I can’t imagine anything going better than it did. I was awake by around 9pm. My pain levels were around a 5/10 and I was fairly out of it thanks to all of the heavy drugs I was on. The night was a little bit rough. The worst part was my catheter didn’t actually seem to be draining due to an air bubble, so there was ~700ml of urine in my bladder. My nurse was thankfully very attentive after I requested help and she promptly fixed the issue.</p>
<p>I definitely wasn’t too comfortable, but I was able to sleep for about two hours at a time. I did this until around 7am where my nurse ended her shift and a doctor came in to check on me. Around this time my catheter was removed and I was able to stand up and walked around the floor. I was also feeling good enough to have breakfast (all liquid). My pain was still at a 5/10 overall, but I was glad to be walking since that helps with the healing process. Moving from a laying position to standing up is a significant amount of work since I wasn’t really able to use my abdominal muscles, but thankfully the design of the hospital beds made this easier.</p>
<p>By around noon on Friday (a little over 24 hours after arrival) I met all of the criteria for discharge. I left around 3pm with a friend who driving me home.</p>
<p>After getting home I went straight to my living room where I laid down and put something on the TV. Thankfully my pain was under control, so I didn’t need anything stronger than Tylenol after leaving the hospital. I also had to take stool softener (due to the anesthesia and narcotics from the hospital) and anti-nausea medicine. I was sure to drink plenty of water since that helps with recovery, but I wasn’t feeling like eating. Somehow, despite being asleep for the majority of the last 24 hours, I was able to nap some more and went to be around 10pm that night.</p>
<p>Sleeping Friday night was still a bit rough. I slept for two-hour intervals and woke up due to discomfort before falling back asleep. I did briefly regret going home and not staying a second night in the hospital. I live alone and had to manage getting up to the bathroom by myself. As I mentioned previously, going from laying to standing requires a bit of effort which would have been much easier in a hospital.</p>
<p>I spent Saturday lying down, but I was able to eat a few small normal meals. I was still in pain, but it was closer to a 2-3/10.</p>
<p>On Sunday I started to feel normal. My pain was still present but much more in the background than before. I spent most of the day sitting up playing video games. I was also able to eat normal meals.</p>
<p>From Sunday onwards my I got back into my normal routine minus anything related to exercise like walking, running, or lifting. I still feel occasional discomfort, but pain isn’t really present.</p>
<p>Overall, I had three bad days of moderate pain and inconvenience. There’s an additional six-week period where I cannot lift &gt;20 lbs. This seems like an extraordinarily low to me considering the impact it has on another person.</p>
