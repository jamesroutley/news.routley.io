After the code is generated, it&#39;s then checked and reviewed by employees, he added.</p><p>&#34;This helps our engineers do more and move faster,&#34; Pichai said. &#34;I&#39;m energized by our progress and the opportunities ahead, and we continue to be laser-focused on building great products.&#34;</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-goose-ai-model-language-ai-coding-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Business Insider reported in February</a> that the company had launched a new internal AI model named &#34;Goose&#34; to help employees code and build products.</p><p>Goose was trained on &#34;25 years of engineering expertise at Google,&#34; according to internal documents seen by BI.</p><p>The new data from Pichai will surely have some employees wondering whether they&#39;re coding themselves out of a job, while other employees say AI has already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-google-technical-program-manager-uses-ai-gemini-2024-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">transformed their work</a>.
