    <h1>Ask HN: What are you doing now to profit from the current or upcoming recession?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I see comments on HN once in a while about how they did [clever thing X] during a recession years ago and made money. With volatility comes profit potential, and it seems clear to everyone that rough seas are ahead. What are people doing <i>now</i> to potentially profit, or at least insulate themselves, during this?</p><p>I liquidated my discretionary equities portfolio (not much in it anyway) about a year ago already. Still have my retirement in its roboadvisor mix of bonds, equities and don&#39;t plan to touch it. Wondering if it might be worthwhile to invest in short ETFs like SH, SQQQ.</p></div></div></div>
