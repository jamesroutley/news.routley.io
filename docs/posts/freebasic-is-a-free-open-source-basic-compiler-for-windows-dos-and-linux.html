          FreeBASIC is a free/open source (GPL), BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, DOS and Linux.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When used in its &#34;QB&#34; language mode, FreeBASIC provides a high level of support for programs
          written for QuickBASIC. Many programs written for QuickBASIC will compile and run in this mode
          with no changes needed. However, for compilation in the FreeBASIC default language mode,
          most substantial programs will require changes.

          FreeBASIC is a self-hosting compiler which makes use of the GNU binutils programming tools as
          backends and can produce console, graphical/GUI executables, dynamic and static libraries.
          FreeBASIC fully supports the use of C libraries and has partial C++ library support. This lets
          programmers use and create libraries for C and many other languages. It supports a C style
          preprocessor, capable of multiline macros, conditional compiling and file inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          FreeBASIC has been rated close in speed with mainstream tools, such as GCC.

        <h2>More about FreeBASIC</h2>
        <p>
          The FreeBASIC project is a set of cross-platform development tools, consisting of a compiler, 
          GNU-based assembler, linker and archiver, and supporting runtime libraries, including a software-based 
          graphics library. The compiler, fbc, currently supports building for i386-based architectures on the DOS, 
          Linux, Windows and Xbox platforms. The project also contains thin bindings (header files) to some popular 
          3rd party libraries such as the C runtime library, Allegro, SDL, OpenGL, GTK+, the Windows API and many 
          others, as well as example programs for many of these libraries.
        </p>

          FreeBASIC is a high-level programming language supporting procedural, object-orientated and
          meta-programming paradigms, with a syntax compatible to Microsoft QuickBASIC. In fact, the
          FreeBASIC project originally began as an attempt to create a code-compatible, free alternative
          to Microsoft QuickBASIC, but it has since grown into a powerful development tool. FreeBASIC
          can be seen to extend the capabilities of Microsoft QuickBASIC in a number of ways, supporting
          more data types, language constructs, programming styles, and modern platforms and APIs.

        	Any type of program can be written with FreeBASIC, see our <a href="https://freebasic.net/gallery.html">Gallery of Applications</a>
        	for some notable examples.
