                <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) plans to begin construction of four new plants later this year, with the aim to officially launch production of 2-nanometer semiconductor wafers by late 2028, Central Taiwan Science Park Bureau director-general Hsu Maw-shin (許茂新) said.</p><p>Hsu made the announcement at an event on Friday evening celebrating the Central Taiwan Science Park’s 22nd anniversary.</p><p>The second phase of the park’s expansion would commence with the initial construction of water detention ponds and other structures aimed at soil and water conservation, Hsu said.</p><div>

                </div><p>TSMC has officially leased the land, with the Central Taiwan Science Park having handed over the plot last month, he added.</p><p>Hsu said he is optimistic that the park’s annual turnover would surpass NT$1.2 trillion (US$40.81 billion), setting a new historic high.</p>        <!-- /21202031/TT-mobile-sub-P-IR1 -->
        
    <p>At the North America Technology Symposium in California on April 25, TSMC revealed plans to launch its A14 fabrication processes in 2028. </p><p>The four plants in the Central Taiwan Science Park, designated Fab 25, would feature four 1.4-nanometer wafer manufacturing facilities, according to TSMC’s roadmap.</p><p>The first plant is expected to complete a risk assesment of wafer production by 2027 and begin mass production by late 2028, with a target monthly output of 50,000 wafers, according to the company’s roadmap. </p><p>At the TSMC second-quarter earnings conference and conference call on Thursday, TSMC chairman C.C. Wei (魏哲家) said that after the completion of the company’s US$165 billion investment in the US, “about 30 percent of our 2-nanometer and more advanced capacity will be located in Arizona, creating an independent leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing cluster in the US.”</p><p>The Arizona investment includes six advanced wafer manufacturing fabs, two advanced packaging fabs and a major research and development center.</p><p>Wei also said that TSMC is planning “to build 11 wafer manufacturing fabs and four advanced packaging facilities over the next several years.”</p><p>The company is “preparing for multiple phases of 2-nanometer fabs at the Hsinchu and Kaohsiung science parks to support the strong structural demand from our customers,” Wei said.</p>
