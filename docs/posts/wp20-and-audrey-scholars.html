<p>Today is the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/">first release of WordPress</a>. None of us knew what we were getting into when it started, but we had a shared conviction that the <a href="https://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/">four freedoms of the GPL</a> combined with a mission to democratize publishing was something worth spending our time on. There will <a href="https://wp20.wordpress.net/">be celebrations in cities around the world</a>, please join if there’s one happening near you.</p>



<p>Twenty years later, I am proud and humbled by what the community around <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> has created, and jazzed about what we will create in the coming decades.</p>



<p>I’m also excited to mark this milestone by publicly launching the <a href="https://audrey.co/scholars/">Audrey Scholars program</a>. It is, like all things, an experiment, but I’m curious to see how it unfolds and perhaps one day an Audrey Scholar could even take the responsibility of leading WordPress, when my capacity to do so has passed.</p>
