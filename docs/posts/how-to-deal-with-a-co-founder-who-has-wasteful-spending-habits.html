    <h1>Ask HN: How to deal with a co-founder who has wasteful spending habits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>My co-founder partner is the CEO of our company and I am the other co-founder. This is a tech company with size of 30 people.<p>Last month a company retreat event announced and it is scheduled only 5 weeks forward. I learned that with other employees on Slack. It is a 5 day beach vacation to very far away. It cost like 10% of annual revenue of the company and company is barely profitable. It is announced that our business partners also will come so all managers including me must attend (None of our business partners attended). I rejected and didnâ€™t go.</p><p>During this economy, how wasting so much money on beaches, midnight parties at pubs, and yacht tours can be normal?</p><p>How can I deal with this behavior of treating your partner like any other employee?</p><p>How can I fix this communication problem and prevent future abuses?</p></div></div>
