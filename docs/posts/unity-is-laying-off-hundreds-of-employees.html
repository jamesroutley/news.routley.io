Kotaku, citing multiple sources, now says the layoffs number in the hundreds. </p><p>According to Kotaku, Unity CEO John Riccitiello told employees two weeks ago that it was on solid financial footing and would not be resorting to layoffs. The cuts are affecting employees all around the globe, the report says. </p><p>Unity confirmed the layoffs in a statement to Protocol and said slightly more than 200 people were affected. &#34;As part of a continued planning process where we regularly assess our resourcing levels against our company priorities, we decided to realign some of our resources to better drive focus and support our long-term growth. This resulted in some hard decisions that impacted approximately 4% of all Unity workforce. We are grateful for the contributions of those leaving Unity and we are supporting them through this difficult transition.”</p><p>Unity employed 5,245 people as of December 31, 2021, indicating the company had nearly doubled its workforce since the year it went public. However, the company&#39;s stock price has fallen more than 40% since its 2020 debut, and more than 70% this year alone. The company also <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/10/unity-stock-tanks-28-as-outlook-falls-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank">reported</a> a loss of eight cents a share in its most recent quarterly earnings report and lowered its fiscal year guidance. Some employees <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/unity-hiring-freeze-2Coeahh6" target="_blank">have said</a> the firm enacted a hiring freeze earlier this year, though it has not publicly said so. </p><p>Unity mainly competes with Fortnite creator Epic Games, which distributes its Unreal Engine platform for making high-fidelity 3D games. While a number of high-profile developers, including Electronic Arts subsidiary BioWare and The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red, have signed up to use Epic&#39;s new Unreal Engine 5, Unity mostly caters to the mobile and indie game market. </p><p>Despite its strong foothold in those segments, Unity does not develop games of its own and as a result does not have additional revenue streams outside its engine licensing business and other related software products. </p><p><em><strong>Update June 30, 9AM ET: </strong>Added statement of confirmation from Unity. </em></p></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Grayscale is suing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the regulator denied the company&#39;s bid to convert its bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The SEC late Wednesday <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2022/34-95180.pdf" target="_blank">published a notice</a> that it had rejected Grayscale&#39;s request, saying it did not meet legal standards designed to protect investors. Grayscale announced shortly after that it had filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.</p><p>&#34;Through the ETF application review process, we believe American investors overwhelmingly voiced a desire to see GBTC convert to a spot Bitcoin ETF, which would unlock billions of dollars of investor capital while bringing the world’s largest Bitcoin fund further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter,&#34; said Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale’s CEO. &#34;We will continue to leverage the full resources of the firm to advocate for our investors and the equitable regulatory treatment of Bitcoin investment vehicles.”</p><p>The company had been <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/grayscale-bitcoin-gbtc-etf" target="_self">hinting</a> for weeks that it would sue if the SEC denied its application. Earlier this month, Grayscale brought on some major legal firepower by hiring Donald Verrilli, who served as solicitor general during the Obama administration, as a legal strategist. </p><p>&#34;The SEC is failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles, and is therefore acting arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and Securities Exchange Act of 1934,” Verrilli said in the company&#39;s press release. </p><p>The rejection marks the latest piece of bad news for the industry. Bitcoin has seen its market value fall by more than 70% from a peak in November near $70,000. </p><p>Grayscale filed for approval in October to convert its bitcoin trust, GBTC, into a spot ETF, a move it said would broaden access to the cryptocurrency by offering a fund based on holding the asset rather than its futures. Launched in 2013, GBTC holds about <a href="https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin-trust/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$13 billion in assets.</a> </p><p>Grayscale told the SEC in May that converting the trust into an ETF could <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/11/grayscale-tells-sec-that-turning-biggest-bitcoin-fund-into-etf-will-unlock-8-billion-for-investors.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unlock about $8 billion</a> for investors. </p><p>The SEC has previously <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/bitcoin-etf-proshares?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">declined similar attempts</a> from other companies to hold bitcoin directly in an ETF rather than through bitcoin futures contracts. </p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>App developers in South Korea can now use third-party payment systems, Apple announced in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=q0feipe4&amp;1656574242" target="_blank">blog post</a> Thursday.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The change is Apple&#39;s response to legislation in South Korea that prevents app store operators from forcing developers to use their own in-app payment systems. Now, developers can use alternatives and bypass Apple and Google&#39;s 30% commission by accepting money directly from consumers. The law was an amendment to South Korea&#39;s Telecommunications Business Act, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/south-korea-law-apple--google" target="_blank">passed</a> last summer.</p><p>The law frustrated Apple and Google at the time — both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/technology/apple-google-south-korea-app-store.html" target="_blank">lobbied the Biden administration</a> to intervene — and ultimately both companies have since complied, though South Korean lawmakers have <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/06/google_south_korea_app_payments_illegal/" target="_blank">taken issue with Google&#39;s implementation</a> because it still imposes high fees on developers that opt to use an alternative system. Apple initially argued the rule would open the door for fraud, undermine user privacy and make it harder to manage payments. </p><p><span></span>Developers can now use Apple&#39;s so-called &#34;StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement,&#34; which lets apps distributed on the App Store in South Korea offer an alternative payment option, to comply with the new law. &#34;Developers who want to continue using Apple’s in-app purchase system may do so and no further action is needed,&#34; Apple wrote in the blog. <br/></p><p>Apple also said developers who choose to use external payment systems won&#39;t be able to use features like Ask to Buy or Family Sharing because the company can&#39;t validate payments that occur outside the App Store&#39;s &#34;private and secure payment system.&#34; The company also can&#39;t help with refunds, purchase history , subscription management and other issues users may face by using third-party systems. &#34;You will be responsible for addressing such issues,&#34; Apple wrote in the blog. </p><p>In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-kr" target="_blank">separate document</a>, Apple details how, like Google, it still intends to charge a high commission — in this case, 26% — for transactions outside its payment system. Developers are responsible for reporting sales to Apple on a monthly basis in order to pay the requisite fees. &#34;Apps that are granted an entitlement to use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions,&#34; the company explained. &#34;Apple will charge a 26% commission on the price paid by the user, gross of any value-added taxes. This is a reduced rate that excludes value related to payment processing and related activities.&#34;</p><p>Other countries have begun to target Apple&#39;s in-app payment systems. The Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets ordered Apple to allow dating app developers in the Netherlands access to third-party payment systems, which Apple complied with after <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/apple-app-store-regulation-netherlands" target="_blank">several fines</a>. The European Union&#39;s Digital Markets Act includes rules for Apple to let users install apps from external sources, while a U.S. judge <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/apple-appeal-epic" target="_blank">ruled</a> last year that Apple must tell customers about alternative payment methods as a result of Fortnite maker Epic Games&#39; antitrust lawsuit. Apple appealed that decision.<br/></p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>Soltero <a href="https://twitter.com/jsoltero/status/1542306136048644096" target="_blank">confirmed his plans on Twitter</a>, saying, &#34;I am proud of what we&#39;ve accomplished during this time &amp; confident the Workspace team, its leaders, and our strategy.&#34;<br/></p><p>Soltero <a href="https://www.protocol.com/javier-soltero-google-microsoft-interview" target="_self">originally joined Google’s G-Suite team in 2019</a> after leaving Microsoft, where he ran product strategy for Microsoft Office. Soltero became a Microsoft employee when the company acquired his email startup Accompli in 2014. From there he rose through the ranks from general manager of Outlook Mobile, to corporate vice president of the Office product group.</p><p>Google then hired Soltero to try and run the Microsoft playbook with what used to be known as G-Suite, as the company pushed further into the office productivity space. In his role as vice president and general manager, Soltero reported directly to Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and managed the company’s full suite of productivity and collaboration tools, which includes Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Slides, Meet and more. </p><p>In October of 2020, just a year after Soltero joined Google, the company rebranded its suite as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/introducing-google-workspace" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Workspace</a>. Then in February of this year, Google launched a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-workspace-essentials-starter-business" target="_self">free business-version of Workspace</a>, meant to capture small businesses and teams within larger companies. </p><p>Both moves were a part of Google Cloud&#39;s overall strategy to increase adoption of its productivity suite among consumers and enterprises. Under Soltero&#39;s leadership that has happened: monthly active users of Google Workspace have grown more than 50% over the last 3 years, according to Kurian&#39;s email. </p><p>Aparna Pappu, who is currently the vice president leading engineering for Workspace, will assume the role of general manager leading Google Workspace after Soltero&#39;s departure, Kurian said in the email.</p><p>&#34;After such an intense sprint, it&#39;s time for me to take a break before I figure out what is next,&#34; Soltero <a href="https://twitter.com/jsoltero/status/1542306969305743360" target="_blank">said on Twitter</a>. &#34;I am an entrepreneur at heart &amp; want to take time to explore new things to build.&#34;</p><p><em>This story was updated with additional information that became available after it was published.</em><br/></p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>A court in the British Virgin Islands signed an order to liquidate Three Arrows on June 27, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-plunges-into-liquidation-12642402" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sky News</a> first reported early Wednesday. The hedge fund had a reported <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/battered-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-considers-asset-sales-bailout-11655469932" target="_blank">$3 billion</a> in assets under management as of April but has been hit hard by collapsing cryptocurrency values. </p><p>Three Arrows did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Partners from advisory firm Teneo will advise the liquidation process, according to Sky News. </p><p>On Monday, Voyager Digital said <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/three-arrows-default" target="_self">Three Arrows defaulted</a> on a crypto loan worth $666 million. </p><p>The total value of the crypto market has sunk by about $2 trillion since peaking in November, falling below $1 trillion earlier this month for the first time since January 2021, according to CoinMarketCap.</p><p>Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, bet heavily on luna, the token tied to Terraform Labs&#39; <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/terraform-investigation-sec-south-korea" target="_blank">UST stablecoin</a>, helping lead a $1 billion purchase of the cryptocurrency <a href="https://thedefiant.io/luna-sale-ust-bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in February</a>. Three months later, UST <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/terra-luna-ust-stablecoin-crash" target="_blank">lost its peg to the dollar</a> and the value of luna sank, one of the most significant collapses of the current crypto crash. </p><p>Concerns about <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/152092/after-facing-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-in-liquidations-three-arrows-capitals-future-is-uncertain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Three Arrows&#39; solvency</a> have been circulating in the weeks since. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/126d8b02-f06a-4fd9-a57b-9f4ceab3de71" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> reported on June 16 that the firm had failed to meet several margin calls. Kyle Davies, Three Arrows’ co-founder, told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/battered-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-considers-asset-sales-bailout-11655469932?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> earlier this month that the firm is &#34;committed to working things out and finding an equitable solution for all our constituents,” including the possibility of asset sales and a rescue by another firm.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Just months after committing to spend $925 million on <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-removal-stripe-google-meta" target="_blank">carbon dioxide removal</a>, a collection of major tech companies has announced its first purchases. The group, operating under the banner of Frontier, announced it had purchased nearly 2,000 tons of CDR services from five companies. It&#39;s a small ripple in the CDR pond, but one Frontier hopes will turn into a wave to bring down the costs of removing carbon.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The five companies in question — Lithos Carbon, Calcite-Origen, AspiraDAC, RepAir and Travertine Tech — all use a variety of techniques to pull carbon from the sky. The partnership between Calcite-Origen, AspiraDAC and RepAir, for example, uses direct air capture, while Lithos Carbon and Travertine rely on improving rock weathering to pull carbon dioxide from the air. The group also gave Living Carbon, a synthetic biology company, an R&amp;D grant to further work on carbon removal using algae and biopolymers. The five purchases plus the grant reflect Frontier&#39;s approach to let a thousand carbon removal flowers bloom to see what sticks.</p><p>Frontier came online in April. Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, Meta and McKinsey pooled $925 million to form what&#39;s dubbed an advance market commitment. In essence, they&#39;re promising to buy CDR services with the hopes of spurring innovation in the field, which can help bring down the cost. The First Movers Coalition, another collection of companies and governments, has similarly said it will buy <a href="https://www.protocol.com/first-movers-coalition-climate-davos" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of dollars in CDR services</a> with the same intent to kickstart the market and innovation.<br/></p><p>Right now, sucking carbon from the sky is expensive. Among the projects in Frontier&#39;s first purchases, the cost to remove a ton of carbon ranges between $500 and $1,800. That&#39;s well above the holy grail of $100 per ton price point that would make CDR (relatively) affordable given the world will <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-dioxide-removal-needs" target="_blank">potentially need to remove billions of tons</a> of carbon dioxide a year depending on how fast we collectively stop chucking the stuff into the atmosphere. </p><p>&#34;We look for durable carbon removal solutions that have the potential to be low-cost and high-volume in the future, even if they’re not today,&#34; Joanna Klitzke, who leads Strategy and Operations for Frontier, said in an email. She noted that while Calcite and Origen&#39;s technique currently clocks in at $1,800, the duo projects it could dip below $100 per ton as it scales. (Calcite also recently won the first stage of the CDR XPRIZE, sponsored by Elon Musk, so clearly Frontier isn&#39;t the only group that believes in the technology.)</p><p>Frontier is betting on that scaling happening, and the companies have until 2027 to deliver the agreed-upon tons. But Klitzke also said if some of these groups don&#39;t hit their targets, Frontier is &#34;comfortable&#34; with that. &#34;We’re the first customer for all six of these projects because we’re trying to help get as many projects as possible to the starting line,&#34; she said.</p><p>The group plans to make larger, multiyear offtake agreements down the road in addition to smaller purchases, like the first round, to keep the innovation pipeline fresh. While Klitzke said R&amp;D won&#39;t be a major focus, Frontier saw Living Carbon&#39;s technique as &#34;an exciting pathway for carbon removal that we want to see develop,&#34; and other grants may be forthcoming if the team dubs an early-stage carbon removal approach novel enough.</p><p>Frontier&#39;s purchases are important given the almost certain need for some amount of CDR to keep the planet from heating to dangerous levels. But they are not a reason for decision-makers to be lulled into complacency around actually cutting emissions. The roughly 2,000 tons of removal services in Frontier&#39;s first round of purchases is equal to less than two seconds&#39; worth of humanity&#39;s yearly carbon emissions. </p><p>Scaling the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/ipcc-renewable-technology-wind-solar" target="_blank">cheap carbon-cutting solutions</a> we already have today such as renewables, bike lanes and heat pumps has never been more important. Because ultimately, the cheapest ton of carbon to remove from the atmosphere is the ton that doesn&#39;t end up there in the first place.</p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Illinois Federal Court, says that Walmart did not properly train employees or put procedures in place to prevent fraud on transfer services offered within its stores, despite being aware of the risk for fraud. Nearly $200 million in payments subject to fraud complaints was sent or received at Walmart from 2013 to 2018, according to the FTC, citing fraud databases maintained by MoneyGram, Western Union and Ria. Another $1.3 billion in related payment could be tied to fraud, according to the FTC. </p><p>“While scammers used its money transfer services to make off with cash, Walmart looked the other way and pocketed millions in fees,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p><p>The FTC said it found several instances where scammers relied on Walmart&#39;s money transfers as a primary way to receive payments. That includes in telemarketing scams, IRS impersonation schemes, relative-in-need “grandparent” scams and sweepstakes scams, among others. Walmart offers transfers directly and through partnerships with MoneyGram, Ria and Western Union.</p><p>The FTC noted in the release that it has previously pursued cases against money transfer services alleging a failure to protect consumers from fraud, including <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2018/11/moneygram-agrees-pay-125-million-settle-allegations-company-violated-ftcs-2009-order-breached-2012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">against MoneyGram</a> and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/09/second-round-refunds-totaling-147-million-sent-consumers-result-multi-agency-case-against-western" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Union</a>. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220628006156/en/Corporate-Statement-Issued-by-Walmart-Inc.-dated-June-28-2022-in-response-to-a-Complaint-filed-by-the-Federal-Trade-Commission-the-%E2%80%9CFTC%E2%80%9D-against-the-Company-involving-Money-Transfer-Services" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> published shortly after the FTC announced the case, Walmart called the complaint &#34;factually flawed and legally baseless.&#34; </p><p>&#34;Claiming an unprecedented expansion of the FTC’s authority, the agency seeks to blame Walmart for fraud that the agency already attributed to another company while that company was under the federal government’s direct supervision,&#34; Walmart&#39;s statement said. &#34;Walmart will defend the company’s robust anti-fraud efforts that have helped protect countless consumers, all while Walmart has driven down prices and saved consumers an estimated $6 billion in money transfer fees.&#34; </p><p>The FTC said it will ask the court to require that Walmart return money to customers and impose civil penalties against Walmart.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Eric Schmidt described his first five years at Google as &#34;pure, naive techno-optimism,&#34; in that the company believed that applying American values like free speech is good for the world. But Google hit a brick wall when it bought YouTube.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>&#34;We learned the lesson that you cannot go and impose your American values on countries, even if you don&#39;t like it,&#34; Schmidt said at an Aspen Ideas Festival panel Tuesday. &#34;And then we face this question of: Do you stay or leave?&#34;</p><p>Schmidt, former State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter and IBM SVP and director of Research Darío Gil talked about tech&#39;s role on a global stage at a panel moderated by former POLITICO Magazine editor Garrett Graff. They said the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic and other worldwide issues have tested tech&#39;s ability to expand on a global scale. </p><p>Schmidt said a decade ago, tech companies likely would not have taken down false information about COVID-19. But when the pandemic began to spread and platforms began removing false information about the virus, companies set a precedent for taking down content — but without rules to guide it. &#34;Now we&#39;re in this horrific state where we&#39;ve set the precedent that we&#39;re willing to edit or change the textbook, change the content, but we don&#39;t have any rules,&#34; he said.</p><p>He said the U.S. lacks a government playbook for addressing misinformation. He cited the U.K.&#39;s Online Safety Bill, which proposes a <a href="https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/latest-thinking/the-uk-online-safety-bill-harmful-but-legal-content-and-what%E2%80%99s-next" target="_blank">framework</a> for removing harmful (but legal) information. &#34;That&#39;s an example of how Britain, which is certainly a democracy, is going to solve this problem. Who knows what harmful but legal harmful is? How do you decide?&#34; Schmidt said.</p><p>Panelists also talked about tech&#39;s response to the war in Ukraine. Slaughter, currently the CEO of New America, said the implications of tech companies cutting ties with Russia is &#34;enormous.&#34; Slaughter said tech companies are starting to act as &#34;independent foreign policy actors&#34; in their decisions on global issues, citing Airbnb&#39;s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/airbnb-ukraine-response?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_blank">program</a> to house people fleeing Ukraine.</p><p>&#34;Suddenly, you&#39;re seeing corporate and civic actors playing a role alongside government,&#34; she said.<br/></p><p>Gil said that as companies and governments increasingly work together, they&#39;re going to need to make decisions about which governments to work with. <strong>&#34;</strong>You&#39;re going to have to make and operate under the new regime of alliances between countries that have elevated technology as a key source of strategic and competitive advantage,&#34; Gil said. &#34;So I think the rules are going to be sharper.&#34;</p><p>Gil added that companies need to make choices about &#34;what you do with the most advanced technologies&#34; and which technologies are of top concern. For Gil, the top five include semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, cyber and biotech. &#34;There is definitely a marked difference about what you do, where you do it, with whom you do it.&#34;</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>The Biden administration&#39;s hot electric vehicle summer continues to zip along. On Tuesday, the White House announced $700 million in commitments for EV charging from private companies. The cash will up U.S. charging manufacturing capacity to 250,000 chargers a year and increase the number of chargers out in the wild. Not too bad!</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The announcement includes $450 million from Volkswagen and Siemens to backstop the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/electrify-america-ev-charging-stations" target="_self">Electrify America</a> charging network. (Fun fact: It’s an outgrowth of Dieselgate.) Siemens represents the first outside investor to put money into the network, and the investment will spur the, in the White House&#39;s words, &#34;rapid deployment of up to 10,000 ultra-fast chargers at 1,800 charging stations.&#34; Though the deployment doesn&#39;t come with a concrete timeline, getting that many fast chargers in the ground could ease range anxiety, a top concern for would-be EV owners.</p><p>In addition, Siemens committed $250 million to expand its EV charger manufacturing operations in the U.S. All told, the company plans to crank out 1 million chargers over the next four years. The company and the White House didn&#39;t specify how many of those would be fast chargers, but regardless, even slower chargers for home and errands could be key to making sure EV owners can always be on the go without the worry of their cars dying without a charger in sight.</p><p>The timing comes a few weeks after the Biden administration announced <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/biden-ev-charging-standards-funding" target="_blank">EV charging standards</a> that could help make a national, more unified network of chargers a reality as opposed to today&#39;s piecemeal approach. And hot EV summer will continue into August when states submit plans for how they’ll use the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/joe-biden-electric-vehicle-charging" target="_self">$7.5 billion in EV charging cash</a> available through the bipartisan infrastructure law. That money is meant to spur private investments as well, and it seems to be doing just that. Which hey, isn’t it nice when something works as intended?</p><p>The money committed is vital for getting Biden&#39;s vision of a 500,000-charger-strong network off the ground, but it&#39;s also nowhere near enough for ensuring the end of the internal combustion engine for the sake of the climate. A number of think tanks have modeled what a true EV revolution would take finance-wise, and the answer is billions of dollars a year in sustained investment for at least the next decade. </p><p>Beyond charging infrastructure, tax credits and other policy tools are needed to bring down the cost of EVs so they&#39;re accessible to all households. Investing in infrastructure like mass transit and bike lanes as well as improving mixed-use zoning so we don&#39;t need cars to get everywhere in the first place are also strategies <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/climate/ev-climate-change-public-transit" target="_blank">policymakers need to consider</a> in order to help reduce transportation emissions <em>and</em>  not put too much strain on the supply chain for <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/critical-minerals-prices-spike-renewables" target="_blank">critical minerals</a> we&#39;ll need as the world electrifies everything. (Oh, and those moves would also improve public health and quality of life.)</p></template></div>

And the ability to share information online about accessing abortion pills by mail is critical to that work.</p><p>Still, Facebook and other online platforms are now operating in uncharted legal territory, where individual states are seeking to outlaw mailing the abortion pill mifepristone, while Attorney General Merrick Garland has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-court-ruling-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s" target="_blank">said</a> such bans are prohibited.

            <div><template><p>Pave, a fast-growing Option Impact competitor, announced Tuesday that it had bought Advanced-HR from Morgan Stanley. The acquisition came as Pave announced its $100 million Series C funding round led by Index Ventures.</p><p>The tech talent market is still highly competitive, and startup leaders rely on each other’s data to gauge how much they need to pay in order to recruit and retain employees. Pave’s selling point is that rather than surveying companies once a year, it integrates their HR software like BambooHR, Carta and Greenhouse so that customers can access real-time compensation data. </p><p>The purchase followed what Pave founder and CEO Matt Schulman described as a “very competitive bidding process” for Advanced-HR. In addition to the popular tool Option Impact, Advanced-HR&#39;s product suite also includes Option Driver and the Venture Capital Executive Compensation Survey. Pave didn’t announce what it had paid for Advanced-HR.</p><p>“We view this as a kind of a space-race opportunity. It’s a question of who gets the data asset first,” Schulman told Protocol. “We have a strong conviction we’ll win this new content market that has opened up.”</p><p>Pave, which has grown to 150 employees and 2,500 customers since Schulman founded it in 2019, is now valued at $1.6 billion. Post-acquisition, Pave has more customers than any other compensation benchmarking database for private tech companies, Schulman said.</p><p>Those customers will now have access to Option Impact’s data from more than 2,200 startups within Pave, which Schulman said offers a better user interface, better integration and its own set of real-time comp data.</p><p>Pave and Option Impact have both historically served venture-backed companies up through the Series C or Series D phase. Later-stage companies are more likely to use compensation data from Radford, which is owned by the professional services giant Aon.</p><p>But Schulman said he ultimately aims to offer compensation data to more mature companies as well, given “how interconnected the labor market is.” As a Series C company, Pave is no longer just competing for engineers against seed-stage and Series A companies — it’s going up against Meta, DoorDash, Uber, Netflix and Amazon, Schulman said.</p><p>“We have an interest in understanding what people are getting paid in the early-stage market as well as the late-stage, public market,” Schulman said. “It is very valuable to have all that information in one place, instead of needing to go to different datasets with different standards, different frameworks, etc.”</p><p>In addition to Index Ventures, which now has a Pave board seat, Pave’s Series C round included investment from Andreessen Horowitz, the YC Continuity Fund, LocalGlobe, Craft Ventures, Original Capital, Backend Capital, Contrary Capital, former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and former Facebook Vice President of HR Tudor Havriliuc.</p></template></div>

Bankman-Fried also downplayed the report in a statement to Bloomberg saying, “There are no active M&amp;A conversations with Robinhood.&#34; In filings, Bankman-Fried revealed in May that he personally held a 7.6% stake in Robinhood.</p><p>Robinhood had no comment on the report, which sparked a rally in the company&#39;s shares. The stock closed up 14% Monday, helped as well by a Goldman Sachs analyst report upgrading it from sell to neutral.</p><p>Goldman noted that Robinhood’s stock price had plunged about 29% since it was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-downgrade-crypto-wallet" target="_self">downgraded</a> to sell in April and it was reaching “a reasonable fundamental floor for the value of the company.&#34;</p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>Hamilton spoke Sunday on her podcast about the changes, which reduced its staff from 12 to three. Besides Hamilton, the other two who remain are general partners Christie Pitts and Brittany Davis, who are working on a &#34;special project,&#34; Hamilton said.</p><p>In May, Backstage announced that it had stopped making new investments and would only make follow-on investments. But it said it was still seeking to raise a $30 million opportunity fund. </p><p>The firm, which has invested in 200 companies, has raised about $20 million over its six and a half years, Hamilton said on the podcast. Backstage was one of the earliest firms focusing on minority and underrepresented founders, who have traditionally faced challenges raising funding in the venture industry. </p><p>Backstage also raised close to $5 million in a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/vc-crowdfunding-backstage-earnest-capital" target="_blank">crowdfunding</a> campaign through <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/pipeline/republic-crowdfunding-venture-capital?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_blank">Republic</a>. That funding gave investors a stake in the Backstage management company, but not Backstage&#39;s investment funds. The crowdfunding campaign&#39;s disclosures anticipated that 30% of the money raised would go to paying off accumulated debt.</p><p>Hamilton, in the podcast Sunday, described challenges raising funds from entities including Apple, J.P. Morgan and PayPal, while praising Comcast for providing funding. </p><p>The firm&#39;s operating budget was about $3.5 million to $4 million per year, Hamilton said in the podcast, adding that she would put up about a third of the funds herself. Hamilton has <a href="https://arlan.capital/portfolio" target="_blank">invested</a> in 26 emerging managers as an LP, she said on the podcast. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s not that I feel like there&#39;s any sort of failure on the fund side, on the firm side. It&#39;s that this could&#39;ve been avoided if systems we work within were different,&#34; Hamilton said on the podcast. </p></template></div>

Voyager ”intends to pursue recovery from [Three Arrows] and is in discussions with the company&#39;s advisors as to legal remedies available,” the company said in a statement.</p><p>&#34;We are working diligently and expeditiously to strengthen our balance sheet and pursue options so we can continue to meet customer liquidity demands,&#34; Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich said in a statement.<br/></p><p>Voyager stressed that it &#34;continues to operate and fulfill customer orders and withdrawals,&#34; noting that it had roughly <span>$137 million in </span>cash and &#34;owned crypto assets on hand.&#34; </p><p>The company had also obtained a revolving line of credit from Alameda Ventures, an affiliate of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried&#39;s Alameda Research.

The crypto market  has shed $2 trillion in the past seven months as the price of bitcoin has plunged from about $67,000 in November to roughly $20,000 this week. Three Arrows had bet heavily on luna, the token tied to Terraform Labs&#39; UST stablecoin, <a href="https://thedefiant.io/luna-sale-ust-bitcoin/" target="_blank">in February</a>, helping lead a $1 billion purchase of the cryptocurrency in February.

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Los Angeles could become the first major city in the country to ban the construction of new gas stations because of the climate crisis.<br/></p>
            
            <div><template><p>The move was announced by Los Angeles city council member Paul Koretz, who is drafting the policy. If approved, the measure will ensure that there will be <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/3366/3rd-la-project-looks-at-future-gas-stations-pump-to-plug/" target="_blank">no additions to the nearly 600 gas stations</a> already in the county. “We are ending oil drilling in Los Angeles. We are moving to all-electric new construction. And we are building toward fossil fuel-free transportation,” Koretz said in a <a href="https://www.stand.earth/latest/people-vs-big-oil/los-angeles-and-local-governments-across-us-and-canada-form-growing-wave" target="_blank">press release</a>. “Our great and influential city, which grew up around the automobile, is the perfect place to figure out how to move off the gas-powered car.”</p><p>Los Angeles is not the first city to consider this ban. Petaluma, a small city 40 miles north of San Francisco, implemented a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/california-city-becomes-first-in-the-u-s-to-ban-new-ga-1846379438" target="_blank">ban on new gas stations</a> last year. “The actual motivation for this was — and is — our climate emergency resolution and the fact that we’re really trying to shift the needle in our town,” Petaluma Mayor Teresa Barrett <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-04/sixteen-gas-stations-for-60-000-people-thats-enough-petaluma-says" target="_blank">told the LA Times in March 2021</a> when the ban was first announced.</p><p>The new proposal has a degree of added urgency. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/high-gas-prices-faq" target="_blank">Gas prices are soaring</a> to record highs, and the spike in price has actually been a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/economics-gas-station-rcna19516" target="_blank">challenge</a> for gas station owners. According to the <a href="https://www.convenience.org/Topics/Fuels/Why-Gas-Is-Priced-Using-Fractions-of-a-Penny" target="_blank">National Association of Convenience Stores</a>, &#34;the average fuel retailer today makes about 10-15 cents per gallon selling gas.&#34;</p><p>The proposal comes amid a flurry of activity in recent years to bring about more widespread adoption of electric vehicles. Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/09/23/governor-newsom-announces-california-will-phase-out-gasoline-powered-cars-drastically-reduce-demand-for-fossil-fuel-in-californias-fight-against-climate-change/" target="_blank">issued an executive order in 2020</a> that requires all new cars and passenger trucks sold in California to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. More recently, the Biden administration set a national target of having 50% of all new auto sales being EVs by 2030. It has also begun to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/biden-electric-car-infrastructure-investment" target="_self">dole out money</a> and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/biden-ev-charging-standards-funding" target="_self">roll out standards</a> for a 500,000-strong EV charging network across the country.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/ev-adoptions-rosiest-forecast-yet" target="_blank">recent forecast</a> from BCG found that up to 68% of new vehicles could be battery-electric by 2035. Though more bullish than other analyses, the BCG forecast shows why new gas stations aren&#39;t only a risk to the climate. They could be a risk to owners, who could be left holding stranded assets as the EV revolution takes off full steam. It&#39;s also a reminder policymakers will need to figure out what to do for existing gas station owners and workers as their customer base shrinks in the coming decades.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Six of Sony&#39;s internal game development studios have issued public messages of support for abortion rights and condemnations of the U.S. Supreme Court&#39;s overturning of Roe v. Wade on Friday. It&#39;s a notable shift for PlayStation, after Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/sony-playstation-staff-fume-over-ceo-s-abortion-comments" target="_blank">told staff in May</a> to &#34;respect differences of opinion&#34; on reproductive rights following <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank">POLITICO&#39;s disclosure</a> of details from a leaked draft opinion in early May.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog and God of War developer Santa Monica Studio issued public messages via corporate Twitter accounts both supporting abortion rights and pledging to provide assistance to employees to support out-of-state medical needs. Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games, Days Gone developer Bend Studio, Horizon Zero Dawn studio Guerilla Games and Ghost of Tsushima creator Sucker Punch Productions all posted general messages of support for abortion rights as well. </p><p>The game industry has been <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/05/11/roe-v-wade-abortion-bungie-microsoft-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank">largely silent on the issue of abortion rights</a> over the past month and a half, despite countless studios and publishers issuing statements of support and donating to various causes over the past few years, ranging from Black Lives Matter to anti-Asian hate. One of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/bungie-speaks-up-for-fundamental-right-to-reproductive-choice/" target="_blank">first and only developers</a> to speak out for reproductive rights was Destiny developer Bungie, which is in the process of being acquired by Sony. (Bungie also reiterated its support in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/51315" target="_blank">blog post on Friday</a> and said it is now &#34;implementing a travel reimbursement program for any employee to use when they or a dependent cannot get access to the healthcare they need where they live.&#34;)</p><p>No other major studios with the exception of Microsoft-owned Double Fine spoke up in similar fashion. And despite Bungie&#39;s statement, Sony reportedly prohibited its internal studios from making similar statements following Ryan&#39;s email to staff. </p><p>Either that policy has changed given Friday&#39;s news, or the studios have chosen to defy Sony headquarters.</p><p>&#34;We believe that bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom are fundamental human rights,&#34; <a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1540390277038231553" target="_blank">wrote</a> Santa Monica Studios on Twitter earlier Friday. Naughty Dog Co-president Neil Druckmann also <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1540389574739865600" target="_blank">posted</a> a screenshot to his account showing a $10,000 donation to NARAL and thanked Sony for matching his donation, indicating Sony may now have a company-wide policy in place for matching donations to abortion rights groups. </p><p>Insomniac&#39;s public statement may be the most noteworthy, however, because its chief executive explicitly told employees in May that Sony was prohibiting them from speaking out about the issue, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/05/16/sony-insomniac-roe-v-wade-email-ratchet-clank-spider-man/" target="_blank">report from The Washington Post</a>. “[Sony Interactive Entertainment] will not approve ANY statements from any studio on the topic of reproductive rights. We fought hard for this and we did not win,&#34; Insomniac CEO Ted Price told employees in an email last month. </p><p>In a separate response to employees, Price said there would be &#34;material repercussions for us as a wholly owned subsidiary&#34; if Insomniac or its employees tweeted support for abortion rights or disclosed a $50,000 donation Sony permitted the studio to make to the Women’s Reproductive Rights Assistance Project. &#34;Among other things, any progress that we might make in helping change [Sony Interactive Entertainment’s] approach would be stopped dead in its tracks. We’d also probably be severely restricted from doing important public-facing work in the future,&#34; Price wrote at the time. </p><p>Now, Insomniac is speaking up. &#34;We are human beings who make games,&#34; the studio <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1540354494348906497" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a tweeted image. &#34;Reproductive freedom and bodily autonomy are human rights.&#34; </p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Yelp is closing its New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., offices as the company embraces remote work.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>In a Thursday <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/the-future-of-work-is-remote/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said employees were barely using those three offices. Yelp is also trimming its real estate footprint in Phoenix, he said.</p><p>“The most telling signal for us that people strongly prefer remote work has been the under-utilization of our offices,” Stoppelman wrote.</p><p>Only 1% of Yelp’s global employee base goes to the office every day, Stoppelman said, and employees were using less than 2% of the available workspaces in New York, Chicago and D.C. Those three offices will close July 29, he said.</p><p>Stoppelman has previously been a vocal advocate for remote work, going <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/vc-fund-irl-startups" target="_self">toe-to-toe</a> with Founders Fund partner Keith Rabois last month when Rabois tweeted that he wanted to fund “IRL startups.”</p><p>Stoppelman tweeted that wanting to fund in-office startups was “equivalent to ‘looking to fund startups running Windows95,’” encouraging Rabois to “live in the future and fully embrace remote.”</p><p>Yelp downsized its San Francisco headquarters to three floors of a building in <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/an-update-on-yelps-office-reopenings/" target="_blank">September of 2021</a>. Before the pandemic Yelp was squeezed by the tech giants for both real estate and talent in San Francisco, although the picture <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/tech-company-layoffs-2022" target="_blank">looks very different now</a>. </p><p>In the blog post, Stoppelman insisted that remote-first was best for Yelp and that even a hybrid model is a mistake when it requires employees to show up at the office regularly.</p><p>“It requires employees to live near an office, potentially driving up their housing costs, and to endure unpaid time spent commuting,” Stoppelman said. “It also means hiring is artificially constrained by geography, translating to a smaller and less diverse pool of talent.”</p><p>Yelp’s workforce is now distributed across every U.S. state and four countries, Stoppelman said, and has two remote C-level executives who don’t live near a Yelp office. The company has seen a “strong surge” in interest from job applicants, many of whom cited remote work as part of their interest in working at Yelp, he said.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Netflix is laying off hundreds of workers in its second round of layoffs in roughly a month, according to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/23/netflix-lays-off-300-more-employees-as-revenue-growth-continues-to-slow.html" target="_blank">report from CNBC</a> on Thursday. </p>
            
            <div><template><p>The streaming service has been struggling of late with a declining stock price due to slow growth and subscriber cancellations. “Today we sadly let go of around 300 employees,” Netflix said in a statement to CNBC. “While we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth. We are so grateful for everything they have done for Netflix and are working hard to support them through this difficult transition.”</p><p>Netflix has been reducing its workforce since it <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-password-sharing-subscriber-losses" target="_blank">reported disastrous Q1 earnings</a> in April showing the platform had lost 200,000 subscribers globally in the fist quarter of 2022. In May, the company let go of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-lays-off-150-staffers" target="_blank">about 150 employees</a> and additional contractors, with the company citing cost cutting. </p><p>That followed a <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/netflix-marketing-layoffs-1235253487/" target="_blank">marketing restructure in April</a> unrelated to the earnings that nonetheless resulted in nearly two dozen layoffs, including some employees of Netflix&#39;s entertainment website Tudum. As <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/netflix-diverse-layoffs" target="_blank">Protocol reported last month</a>, dozens of these employees came from marginalized backgrounds, representing a substantial step back for Netflix&#39;s diversity efforts. </p><p>Now, Netflix is adding hundreds more employees to the list as it tries to cut costs. The company is also exploring other options to salvage its revenue decline and slowing growth, including an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-confirms-partnership-talks-for-ad-supported-service-11655985113" target="_blank">ad-supported version</a> of the service and a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-password-crackdown-test" target="_blank">crackdown on password sharing</a>. </p><p><em><strong>Update June 23, 3:18PM ET:</strong> Clarified that Netflix&#39;s layoffs in April were part of a marketing restructure unrelated to its Q1 earnings. </em></p></template></div>

	People will be able to verify their age on Instagram by submitting a picture of their ID card, taking a video selfie or by asking mutual followers how old they are. For the video selfies, Meta has partnered with Yoti, which analyzes facial features to verify a person&#39;s age without disclosing their identity. After the selfie is shared between the two companies, it&#39;s deleted, Meta said.
</p><p>&#34;Understanding someone’s age online is a complex, industry-wide challenge,&#34; Erica Finkle, director of Data Governance at Meta, said in the post. &#34;Many people, such as teens, don’t always have access to the forms of ID that make age verification clear and simple.&#34;</p><p><span></span>The company is also expanding its AI tools to ensure that the experience is tailored appropriately. That includes preventing underage users from accessing age-restricted features like Facebook Dating or Mentorship.</p><p>Meta has been facing major public pressure to make its platforms safer and less toxic. Privacy bills, like the one being <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/data-safeguards-bill-for-kids-teens-heads-to-california-senate" target="_blank">proposed</a> in California, and the Children&#39;s Code in the U.K. might be adding to the pressure, too.</p><p><em><strong>Correction: </strong>This story was updated June 23 to clarify that the tools use facial analysis. </em><br/></p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>TikTok made several new commitments to its advertising and consumer practices, promising to better protect children from hidden ads and inappropriate content. The platform&#39;s new pledges come after a complaint filed in February 2021 from the European Consumer Organisation that alleged TikTok broke EU consumer rules.</p>
            
            <div><template><p>The video-sharing app agreed to let users report ads and offers that could &#34;push or trick children into purchasing goods or services&#34;; ban the promotion of inappropriate products or services like &#34;get rich quick&#34; schemes; allow users to switch on a toggle when they publish content with brand-related keywords; review videos from users with more than 10,000 followers to ensure they abide by TikTok&#39;s content and community guidelines; and update policies surrounding purchasing products and receiving gifts.</p><p>Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders said the new commitments will help users understand what ads are being served up to them on the platform and distinguish them from non-paid content. Regulators will continue to monitor TikTok&#39;s practices, Reynders said, &#34;paying particular attention to the effects on young users.&#34;<br/></p><p>&#34;[Consumer Protection Cooperation Network] authorities will, in particular, monitor and assess compliance where concerns remain, such as whether there is sufficient clarity around children&#39;s understanding of the commercial aspects of TikTok&#39;s practices,&#34; the commission wrote in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3823" target="_blank">release</a>. The CPC may also take action on a national level to &#34;ensure that EU standards are respected and to guarantee that all platforms abide by the same rules,&#34; the release states.</p><p>TikTok&#39;s pledges didn&#39;t make the EU completely happy. BEUC Deputy Director-General Ursula Pachl said there are still &#34;significant concerns&#34; about TikTok&#39;s impact on consumers even a year after talking with the platform. &#34;We welcome that TikTok has committed to improve the transparency of marketing on their platform but the impact of such commitments on consumers remains highly uncertain,&#34; Pachl <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/22/tiktok-eu-consumer-protection-commtiments/" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></template></div>

            <div><template><p>The case, which was originally brought under then-HUD secretary Ben Carson in 2018, <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Main/documents/HUD_v_Facebook.pdf" target="_blank">accused Facebook</a> of allowing advertisers to discriminate on the basis of race and other protected characteristics when they were targeting housing ads. It also accused Facebook itself of discriminating through the actual delivery ads. Research has <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095" target="_blank">found</a> that even when housing and employment ads are targeted in a neutral way, Facebook&#39;s algorithms can wind up skewing which demographics actually get to see the ads.</p><p>As part of the settlement, Meta is committing to institute what it&#39;s calling a “variance reduction system” to ensure that the intended target of an ad and the actual audience to which an ad is delivered align. &#34;Today’s announcement reflects more than a year of collaboration with HUD to develop a novel use of machine learning technology that will work to ensure the age, gender and estimated race or ethnicity of a housing ad’s overall audience matches the age, gender, and estimated race or ethnicity mix of the population eligible to see that ad,&#34; Austin wrote in his statement.</p><p>Meta is also agreeing to do away with functionality called Special Ad Audiences that allows advertisers to target lookalike audiences of users for housing, employment and credit related ads. The company has previously removed certain ad targeting categories from housing, employment and credit related ads and added them to its public ad archive.</p><p>“This settlement is historic, marking the first time that Meta has agreed to terminate one of its algorithmic targeting tools and modify its delivery algorithms for housing ads in response to a civil rights lawsuit,&#34; Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-groundbreaking-settlement-agreement-meta-platforms-formerly-known" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>Austin himself is a veteran of the DOJ&#39;s civil rights division. He joined Meta last year after a damning civil rights audit called Facebook out for everything from its failure to police former President Trump&#39;s posts to its history of enabling housing discrimination through ads. </p><p>Under Austin&#39;s leadership, Meta is undertaking a novel study that will analyze its impact on users of different races. &#34;Are Black users treated differently than other users? Being able to measure that and be very transparent and forthright about the fact we are measuring that was incredibly important to me,” Austin <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/roy-austin-meta" target="_blank">told</a> Protocol earlier this year. The techniques Meta has created to analyze users&#39; races as part of that work will be crucial to the company&#39;s ability to vet the existence, or lack thereof, of discrimination in its ads.</p><p>Meta now has until the end of the year to implement the changes, at which point the Department of Justice will have an opportunity to approve the changes. &#34;If Meta fails to demonstrate that it has sufficiently changed its delivery system to guard against algorithmic bias, this office will proceed with the litigation,”  U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York said in a statement.</p></template></div>

    <div><div id="col-center"><div><div><div><p>Crypto lender BlockFi has secured a $250 million revolving credit line from FTX, a deal that comes as a broader market meltdown has forced other lenders to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/investor-protection-celsius" target="_self">freeze withdrawals.</a></p>
            
            <div><template><p>Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder and CEO of FTX, tweeted Tuesday that the exchange is entering the partnership to allow BlockFi to “navigate the market from a position of strength.” BlockFi Founder and CEO Zac Prince said the credit &#34;further bolsters our balance sheet and platform strength.&#34;</p><p>But the agreement comes as crypto lenders <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/crypto-firm-celsius-stops-withdrawals" target="_self">Celsius Network</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-06-17-2022/card/crypto-lender-babel-finance-freezes-all-account-withdrawals-cGRgPdUuSJYISZtj5dhg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Babel Finance</a> have recently suspended customer withdrawals, citing pressures on their liquidity. That has raised questions about BlockFi&#39;s position. Prince <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockFiZac/status/1537499452080115712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acknowledged on Thursday</a> that BlockFi liquidated an unnamed &#34;large client&#34; that failed to meet its obligations but said BlockFi would &#34;continue to actively lend and operate normally across our global suite of products and services.&#34;</p><p>BlockFi also recently <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/blockfi-cutting-20-percent-staff" target="_self">laid off 20% of its staff</a> in response to a &#34;dramatic shift in macroeconomic conditions.&#34; The company has raised about $1 billion from venture capital investors over its five years in business, according to Crunchbase. </p><p>BlockFi&#39;s &#34;customer assets are appropriately managed, with no debt/risk from [<a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/steth-staked-ether-3ac" target="_self">Three Arrows Capital</a>], Celsius, etc,&#34; <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1539268633192714240" target="_blank">Bankman-Fried tweeted</a>. The credit line will be “contractually subordinate to all client balances across all account types,” according to Prince. </p><p>Bankman-Fried recently suggested that large, well-financed crypto companies such as FTX should help contain the losses of the recent crypto sell-off. </p><p>&#34;I do feel like we have a responsibility to seriously consider stepping in, even if it is at a loss to ourselves, to stem contagion,&#34; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/19/1105853170/crypto-billionaire-says-fed-is-driving-current-downturn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he told NPR</a>. &#34;Even if we weren&#39;t the ones who caused it, or weren&#39;t involved in it. I think that&#39;s what&#39;s healthy for the ecosystem, and I want to do what can help it grow and thrive.&#34;</p><p>Alameda Research, a crypto company also run by Bankman-Fried, recently extended two credit lines, one for about $200 million and the other for about 15,000 bitcoin, to crypto broker Voyager Digital. </p></template></div>
