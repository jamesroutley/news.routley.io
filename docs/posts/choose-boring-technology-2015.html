              I work for a company called Mailchimp, or Mailkimp if you listen to podcasts. I was an early employee at Etsy, and that was a formative experience for me, so I’ll refer to my time there a lot. But I’ve worked for a few other places since.

              If you go up to a developer and say, “hey, what would make you happy?” you often get highly specific answers. “I would be happy if I could write Clojure at work,” they’ll say, “so you should let me do my work in Clojure.” I don’t discount that when they do this, developers are genuinely describing some kind of endorphin-rich experience they have had at some point.</td>

              We can look to the case of Siegfried Sassoon and ponder whether this is the case or not for poetry, but I think it&#39;s mostly true in software.

              This applies in technology. This is an example of a known unknown. For a given database, we might not know what happens when a network partition occurs. But we know that a network partition is possible. Since we know that this is possible, we can test for this. Or we can just cross our fingers and hope that it doesn’t happen. Either way, we are informed about the possibility.

              There are also unknown unknowns in technology. This is a random example I saw a while back. This person spent four months trying to figure out why he was getting GC pauses, and it turned out to be because he was writing stats to a file. He had no idea that that was a thing that could happen, but it was.</td>

              Now, it’s important to realize that both categories are present in all software. Software that’s 10 years old generally comes with a JIRA instance full of tickets describing broken stuff that nobody’s ever going to fix. And then there are always bugs that nobody knows about, even in software that’s been around forever.

              Here’s a totally reasonable way to build activity feeds, if that’s all you’re trying to do. You get events from the outside world, then you write them to a database. Then an offline process comes along and aggregates those, sprinkles some machine learning on things, and stuffs a materialized newsfeed into a thing like Redis for serving frontend traffic. This would totally work great.

              <a name="62"></a>
              But when we set out to build activity feeds, we didn’t have Redis. We did have Memcached. They’re sort of similar in the sense that you can shove a blob in them, and get it back out with a similar API. But they have very different guarantees. The most relevant difference to us here is that Redis is persistent, and Memcached is ephemeral.</td>

              <a name="63"></a>
              What that means is that if you want to build an activity feed with Memcached, you have to do a bunch of extra work. You have to cope with the possibility that Memcached has gotten rid of your data at the moment you want it. </td>

              The reason it was possible was because we used the shared stack. There were people around whose job involved noticing that we needed more MySQL’s or cron boxes or whatever. And there were other people who had to go to the datacenter and plug in new machines. But they were doing that horizontal scaling because the site was growing holistically. Nobody doing this had any awareness of our lone feature.</td>
