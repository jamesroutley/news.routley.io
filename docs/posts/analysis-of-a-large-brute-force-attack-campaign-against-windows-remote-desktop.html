    <h1>Analysis of a large brute force attack campaign against Windows Remote Desktop</h1>

<p>
We come from the Linux world and we don&#39;t use Windows very often. However, we have been &#34;forced&#34; to use it more here at Trunc lately
as we work to properly support Windows logs. Because of that, we installed a Windows 11 Pro server on Azure as one of our testing
servers for our Windows logging agent.

<h4>How bad are those attacks against Remote Desktop?</h4>

                        
<p>
Coming from the Linux world, we see and deal with SSHD brute forces all the time. Running my own mail server, I see Dovecot and Postfix
as common targets as well. And if you ever hosted a website, like WordPress, you will see a lot of password guessing attempts against
wp-login.php (or /xmlrpc).
