<p>Upload a song to decompose it into <strong>bass, drums, vocals, other, and karaoke</strong> components by applying <strong>music source separation</strong> (aka <strong>music demixing</strong>), powered by a near-state-of-the-art AI model, <a href="https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch">Open-Unmix</a>, with the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5069601">UMX-L</a> pretrained weights. This site is created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/sevagh">Sevag H</a>.</p>

<h3 id="runs-locally-in-your-browser">Runs locally in your browser!</h3>

<p>Unlike similar products, <strong>it’s free to use and doesn’t store your data.</strong> All processing is done in your browser, and your files are never uploaded anywhere. It runs well on computers and <strong>very slowly</strong> on smartphones; user beware.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

<p>For the demo, I used <a href="https://www.jaxiusmusic.com/file-share/4a94f6cf-a844-4d72-b849-328829fe158f">a free song by Jaxius Music</a>, which you can also download if you don’t have any music files handy.</p>

<p>Here’s a demo of 20 seconds of demixed outputs; press the play button and toggle sources to add or remove them from the mix:</p>


<p>Ready to try it on your own music files?</p>

<h3 id="disclaimers"><strong>Disclaimers!</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can only use the outputs for non-commercial applications as per the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5069601">UMX-L weights license</a></li>
  <li>The task is CPU and memory intensive (up to 4 GB), please be patient!</li>
  <li>Long tracks may crash due to the 4 GB RAM limitation; try to keep them 5 minutes or shorter</li>
  <li>Input files can be almost any audio format, but the outputs are always stereo wav files @ 44100 Hz</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<p>The inference code is written in C++, using Eigen3 for numerical operations. Emscripten is used to compile it to WebAssembly. The model weights are quantized and compressed from 424 MB down to 45 MB with a slight hit to performance. <a href="https://github.com/sevagh/free-music-demixer">View source code on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>This is a web adaptation of <a href="https://github.com/sevagh/umx.cpp">umx.cpp</a>, which is more focused on parity with the original model. This project was inspired by the “AI at the edge” <a href="https://ggml.ai/">GGML project</a> (including <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp">whisper.cpp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>), and WebAssembly is a great demo of client-side AI.</p>
