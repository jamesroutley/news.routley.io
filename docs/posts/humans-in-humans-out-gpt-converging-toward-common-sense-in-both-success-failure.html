      <span>Abstract:</span>  Increase in computational scale and fine-tuning has seen a dramatic
improvement in the quality of outputs of large language models (LLMs) like GPT.
Given that both GPT-3 and GPT-4 were trained on large quantities of
human-generated text, we might ask to what extent their outputs reflect
patterns of human thinking, both for correct and incorrect cases. The Erotetic
Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human
success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and
probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3,
GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a
recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified
data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR,
with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the
ETR61 benchmark). ETR61 includes classics like Wason&#39;s card task, illusory
inferences, the decoy effect, and opportunity-cost neglect, among others. GPT-3
showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59% of these examples, rising to
77% in GPT-3.5 and 75% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like
fallacious judgments increased from 18% in GPT-3 to 33% in GPT-3.5 and 34% in
GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency
toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in
human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns
are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that
the &#34;bad&#34; cases could paradoxically be learned from the &#34;good&#34; cases. We
further present preliminary evidence that ETR-inspired prompt engineering could
reduce instances of these mistakes.
