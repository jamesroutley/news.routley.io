       <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html">Scintilla</a> is a free source code editing component.
       It comes with complete source code and a <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/License.txt">license</a> that
       permits use in any free project or commercial product.
    </p>
    <p>
       As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes features
       especially useful when editing and debugging source code.
       These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and call tips.
       The selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate
       breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open than with many editors,
       allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and background
       colours and multiple fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
       Current development occurs on the default branch as 5.* which requires a recent
       C++ compiler that supports C++17.

    <p>
       <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/Lexilla.html">Lexilla</a> is a library of lexers that can
       be used with Scintilla.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a> is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to
      demonstrate Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities for
      building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple configurations - I use it
      for building test and demonstration programs as well as SciTE and Scintilla, themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
       Development of Scintilla started as an effort to improve the text editor in PythonWin. After
      being frustrated by problems in the Richedit control used by PythonWin, it looked like the
      best way forward was to write a new edit control. The biggest problem with Richedit and other
      similar controls is that they treat styling changes as important persistent changes to the
      document so they are saved into the undo stack and set the document&#39;s dirty flag. For source
      code, styling should not be persisted as it can be mechanically recreated.
    </p>

       Scintilla and SciTE are currently available for Intel Win32, macOS, and Linux compatible operating
      systems with GTK. They have been run on Windows XP, Windows 7, macOS 10.9+, and on Ubuntu 18.04
      with GTK 2.24. <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/SciTEImage.html">Here is a screenshot of
