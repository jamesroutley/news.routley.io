    <h1>EU Open Web Search project kicked off</h1>

<div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Despite being a backbone of our digital economy, web search is dominated by a few big tech gatekeepers. Thus, information as public good, with free, unbiased and transparent access is not under public control anymore. This imbalance of the search engine marketendangers democracy and limits the innovative potential of Europe’s research landscape and economy.</p>
</div></section></div><div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><h3>How?</h3>
<p>Over the next three years the researchers will develop the core of a European Open Web Index (OWI) as a basis for a new Internet Search in Europe. In addition, the project will set the foundation for an open and extensible European open Web Search and Analysis Infrastructure (OWSAI), based on Europe’s values, principles, legislation and standards.</p>
</div></section></div><div><section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><h3>The Benefits?</h3>
<p>The envisioned infrastructure will not only restore an open human-centered search engine market and contribute to Europe’s independence for navigating and searching the web. It will also empower Europe’s researchers, innovators and business to systematically tap into the Web as business and innovation resource.</p>
