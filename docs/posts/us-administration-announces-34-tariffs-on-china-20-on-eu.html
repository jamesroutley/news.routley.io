the past few minutes a string of senior business leaders have walked into No 10

include the bosses of GSK, the pharmaceuticals company, Unilever, which makes
consumer goods, Johnson Matthey, a chemicals company, along with
representatives of Airbus, Shell and the car industry.</p><p>The
cast list displays the wide range of industries which will be affected by these
tariffs. </p><p>The
prime minister will deliver his reaction to Trump’s announcement at the start
of the meeting, and will continue to try to project calm. He will also
reiterate his desire to strike a deal with the US which would, among other
things, reduce the tariffs.</p><p>When
