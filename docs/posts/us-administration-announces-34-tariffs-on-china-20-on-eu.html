     reducing the supply of foreign goods into the US, and US exports also
     reduce, will this not lead to a stagnant world economy as other countries
     attempt to find new markets because the US will deter any trade?&#34;</b></i></p><p>This is a very real risk. </p><p>The tariffs introduced by
President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in
almost a century. </p><p>If they do get put in place – and remain – there is likely to
be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world&#39;s biggest
shoppers, from the rest of the world. </p><p>And those who are prepared to fork out
for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.</p><p>In the event of the retaliation threatened by other
countries, American exporters will suffer – hence the concern that not just the
US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.</p><p>But as you say, the natural inclination is for countries
hardest hit – toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam -
to boost sale in other markets. </p><p>That might appeal to consumers – but obviously,
could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.</p></article></div></div></li><li><div><div><article data-testid="content-post" id="asset:2742609e-7672-48d1-a3ac-9d7a42976f4c"><header><span><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/core/website/assets/static/news/incident-types/bbc-verify.bac8ff232a.svg" alt="BBC Verify" draggable="false"/><h3 type="normal"><span role="text"><span>Does the UK impose 10% tariffs on US imports?</span><span><span data-testid="timestamp"><span data-testid="accessible-timestamp">published at 16:20 British Summer Time</span><p><span aria-hidden="true">16:20 BST</span></p></span></span></span></h3></span></header><figure><p><span><img alt="Howard Lutnick, US commerce secretary, holds a board during a tariff announcement, featuring a list of countries with the tariffs they charge to the USA and the new “USA discounted reciprocal tariffs”.
