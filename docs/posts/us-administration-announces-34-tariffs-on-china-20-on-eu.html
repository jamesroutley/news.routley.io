To do that, American households need to buy more domestically produced goods, which means less money raised from tariffs than hoped for.</p><p>Given not just these tariff levels but also how global trade has expanded, we&#39;re looking at unprecedented upheaval to trade.</p><p>And history tells us such wars don&#39;t end well: the frontline casualties tend to be consumers, due to reduced choice and higher prices, and exporters.
