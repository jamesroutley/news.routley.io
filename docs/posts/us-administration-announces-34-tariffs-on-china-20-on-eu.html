Stellantis plant. </p><p>He says the shutdown announcement was “kind of expected” after
Trump announced the tariffs, but &#34;scary, very scary&#34;. </p><p>If the worst happens and the shutdown becomes permanent, or
he is laid off, Gungle says he has “no idea” what he will do. </p><p>Gungle says Windsor is heavily reliant on
cross-border trade and any threat to that that will have devastating effects. </p><p>He is the second person to mention Flint, Michigan, when speaking about this crisis. Clearly, the fear of deindustrialisation is at the
forefront of peoples’ minds. </p><p>Watching that happen just across the border was “weird, very

rules) which make trade harder.</p><p>But, the White House has now published its official methodology, and it turns out there is a simple equation behind it</p><p>The calculations are based
on a country’s goods trade deficit with the US. In other words, how much more
the US imports than it exports. This number is then divided by the total value
of imports from that country.</p><p>Let&#39;s use China as an example: The US buys
more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of

the US wishes to impose - you simply divide that number by two. </p><p>So in China’s
