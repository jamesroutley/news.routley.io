casualties in this trade war, blighted by higher prices and less choice,
regardless of the president’s rhetoric.</p><p>And that does mean that producers will seek out and take
advantage of new markets. </p><p>We saw that in the president’s first term, when the
likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China
to increase the amount they sold to America.</p><p>Ironically, they consequently are
in the  firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the
UK – good for consumers, less so for competing businesses</p><p>Already, many producers are turning their sights beyond
established customers – think whisky makers looking towards Asia. That is

That might push up import costs for UK firms buying goods, which could then be passed on to UK consumers through higher prices.</p><p>But some economists say prices might actually drop at first. That’s because firms that usually sell to the US might start sending their goods to countries like the UK instead – possibly leading to a surge of cheaper goods here.</p><p><b>Your job could be affected</b></p><p>Higher prices might lead workers to ask for bigger pay rises. If UK companies see their profits squeezed, job cuts could follow. More than 25,000 jobs in the car manufacturing sector could be at risk.</p><p><b>Interest rates could stay high</b></p><p>Rates are currently at 4.5%, and economists had expected two cuts this year. But if inflation rises because of higher prices, rates might stay higher for longer.</p><p>For more detail, BBC business reporter <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czd35l8995eo">Michael Race has the full story</a>.</p></article></div></div></li><li><div><div><article data-testid="content-post" id="asset:d17373f9-b476-490e-89ca-dd0d0acd2b8b"><header><span><h3 type="normal"><span role="text"><span>Thousands of African workers in danger of losing income</span><span><span data-testid="timestamp"><span data-testid="accessible-timestamp">published at 11:29 British Summer Time</span><p><span aria-hidden="true">11:29 BST</span></p></span></span></span></h3></span></header><p><span><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/128/cpsprodpb//vivo/live/images/2016/4/14/2a336204-9e0a-4318-b9e5-aee3d70468da.jpg.webp" width="64" height="64"/></span></span><span><strong>Will Ross</strong></span></p><figure><p><span><img alt="A worker making pairs of jeans in a factory in Lesotho.
