The aim of policy is to reduce the US trade deficit to zero. That is a remarkable rerouting of world trade flows and explains the specific punitive focus on Asia.</p><p>Secondly, it is clearly the case that bilateral negotiations have not made much of a difference, or in fact any difference. Israel for example dropped all tariffs, but the equation demanded a higher level of tariff.</p><p>As regards the UK, the US justification is that where trade is balanced, it now wants to run a surplus or a bigger surplus. By the US logic that deficits are bad, it wants the UK to be “ripped off”.</p><p>Of course deficits and surpluses are a normal part of a functioning trade system where  countries specialise in what they are the best at making.
