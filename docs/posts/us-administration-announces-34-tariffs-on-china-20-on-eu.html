has previously said the island &#34;stole our chip business&#34; and
that &#34;Taiwan should pay us for defence&#34;. </p><p>Recently he pushed for the
Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC - the world&#39;s largest - to invest further in

several years, there has been a growing suspicion in Taiwan that the US is

narrative, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67891869">known as yimeilun or US scepticism</a>, portrays the US as a fickle friend who will abandon Taiwan once it has

Here&#39;s what you need to know:</p><ul><li spacing="rich-text">
      Trump announced a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c1dr7vy39eet?post=asset%3A3bbf550f-286b-491a-888b-384443c725eb#post">baseline of 10% tariffs</a>, with some countries the White House has deemed the &#34;worst offenders&#34; getting hit with higher rates. The new rates affect about 100 countries, with 60 of those facing the higher import taxes.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      The US will impose a 10% tariff on the UK, and 20% on the EU.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Countries that will face higher reciprocal tariffs include China (34%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (36%), Cambodia (49%) and Japan (24%).
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      He also imposed a 25% tariff on all foreign made automobiles, which will take effect at midnight on the US east coast on Thursday.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Trump has argued the tariffs will stop Americans from being &#34;ripped off,&#34; pay down the national debt, and restore US manufacturing.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Olu Sonola, head of US 
economic research at the Fitch Ratings agency, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c1dr7vy39eet?post=asset%3A713e526f-85bc-41d1-b053-22ec417d0a38#post">called the tariffs</a> &#34;a game-changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession.&#34;
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Markets have already started to react. Major markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened lower on Thursday morning.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      US stock market futures have fallen sharply, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c1dr7vy39eet?post=asset%3Adb6a90f2-264f-40b5-8872-88b57a216836#post">BBC&#39;s Peter Hoskins reports</a>, as investors grow concerned about the threat of a global trade war.
    </li><li spacing="rich-text">
      Canada and Mexico were not included in today&#39;s fresh round of tariffs. The White House said they 
would deal with both countries using a framework set out in previous 
executive orders. Trump previously set those tariffs at 25%, before announcing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y03qleevvo">some exemptions and delays</a>.
