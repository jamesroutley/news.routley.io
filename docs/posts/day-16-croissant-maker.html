<h4>What I Did</h4>



<ul>
<li>Meeting:
<ul>
<li>Game Dev Interest Group</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Released my Twine game <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.itch.io/croissant-maker">Croissant Maker</a> on itch.io</li>



<li>Watched <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/4/">CS50P Week 4 lecture</a></li>
</ul>



<h4>Notes</h4>



<ul>
<li>First published game on itch.io! I guess I’m an indie game dev now. This was an exciting thing for me and definitely goes along with my personal theme of the batch, doing things before I feel “ready.” </li>



<li>Here it is! Please feel free to play and share with anyone you know who enjoys interactive (auto)fiction or croissants:</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>The game is far from perfect, but it is reasonably complete, at least enough for me to release and submit to the game jam. I may revisit it in the future and work on an update. Right now in the recipe gameplay passages you can click on any step and it will increment the steps completed counter—even if you have clicked on that step before. This is obviously not how real cooking works. And I wasn’t able to get a strikethrough or checkmark working for completed steps either. I would need to investigate further to see if I can do these things in Twine with JavaScript/TwineScript or if I would need to use a <a href="https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/#code-passage-storyinterface">StoryInterface</a> passage, or something else.</li>



<li>I found <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXuD3kyVEr5JmCL3GbEAd0jPsDVcuge7&amp;si=qQ5JUHevhbQy1qQB">these tutorials</a> really helpful in understanding some concepts from the SugarCube v2 Twine story format. I thought by choosing to do a Twine game for the game jam, I would be OK because I had experimented with Twine a little bit before. But I got stuck on the JavaScript customization I wanted to do. Lesson learned: <a href="https://jamiepalatnik.com/day-15-half-baked-demos/">start sooner</a> and brush up on the tool/documentation in advance if possible.</li>



<li>Finally, happy Lunar New Year! I celebrated the beginning of the year of the snake by diving back into my Python studies.</li>
