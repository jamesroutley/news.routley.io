<p>Gio is a library for writing cross-platform immediate mode GUI-s in Go. Gio
supports all the major platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and WebAssembly.</p>

<p>For a quick demonstration take a look at the WebAssembly demo below.
<em>This requires a browser that supports WebAssembly.</em></p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Gio is designed to work with very few dependencies. It depends only on the
platform libraries for window management, input and GPU drawing.</p>

<p>To install the necessary dependencies, take a look at:</p>



<p>Once you have everything installed head over to <a href="https://gioui.org/doc/learn">Learn</a>, which
contains links to get you started with Gio.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Gio helps Go developers to build efficient, fluid, and portable GUIs across
all major platforms. It combines bleeding-edge 2D graphics technology with the
flexibility of the immediate mode graphics paradigm to create a compelling and
consistent foundation for application development.</p>

<p>Gio includes an efficient vector renderer based on the <a href="https://github.com/servo/pathfinder">Pathfinder project</a> implemented on OpenGL ES and Direct3D 11,
and is migrating towards an even more efficient compute-shader-based renderer
built atop <a href="https://github.com/linebender/piet-gpu">piet-gpu</a>. Text and other
shapes are rendered using only their outlines without baking them into texture
images, to support efficient animations, transformed drawing and pixel
resolution independence.</p>



<p>Development of Gio is funded by sponsorships. If you find Gio useful, please consider sponsoring the
<a href="https://opencollective.com/gioui">project on OpenCollective</a> or one or more of its developers directly.</p>
