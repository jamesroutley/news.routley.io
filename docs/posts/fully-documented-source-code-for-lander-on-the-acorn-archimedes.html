						<h2>Fully documented source code for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes</h2>

						<p><img src="https://lander.bbcelite.com/images/general/Lander.png" alt="Flying over the treetops in Acorn Archimedes Lander"/></p><p>This site contains reconstructed source code for Lander, David Braben&#39;s epic game for the Acorn Archimedes, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained.</p>

						<p>Lander was the very first game to be released for the ARM processor, and it is both a milestone and a masterpiece.</p>

						<p>My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about Lander and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate the second classic game from this legend of 3D coding (the first classic being <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com">Elite</a>, of course).</p>

						<p>Note that the code on this site is not David Braben&#39;s original source code, as that hasn&#39;t been released. Instead, it is a fully buildable source that&#39;s been lovingly reconstructed from a disassembly of the original game binaries, and which produces 100% identical game files. All of the variable and routine names are my own invention, but the code itself matches the original source.</p>

						<h2>Suggestions for your visit</h2>

						<p>To start your journey into the secrets of Lander, you might like to try the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>See the <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com/about_site/quick_start_guide.html">quick start guide</a> to find out how to use this site.</li>

							<li>Read more <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com/about_site/about_this_project.html">about this project</a> and how it came to be.</li>

							<li>Check out the <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/">deep dive articles</a> for lots of details about how Lander works under the hood.</li>

							<li>Dive straight into the <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com/source/articles/map_of_the_source_code.html">source code</a>, though you might want to <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com/about_site/terminology_used_in_this_commentary.html">read these notes</a> first, which explain some of the terminology used in the commentary.</li>

							<li>Jump straight to a <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com/cgi-bin/random.cgi">random routine from the source code</a> - who knows where you might end up? You can also click the âˆž at the top of the page to keep jumping through the source code; it&#39;s a good way to explore.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If you prefer a darker theme for your Lander explorations, you can change the site&#39;s colour scheme by clicking the icons in the top-right corner.</p>

						<h2>If you want to play with the code</h2>

						<p>If you are interested in building a working copy of Lander from the source, then you&#39;ll enjoy exploring the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/archimedes-lander">accompanying GitHub repository</a>, which contains fully commented and buildable source code for Lander.</p>

						<p>This repository can be <a href="https://lander.bbcelite.com/about_site/building_lander.html">assembled on modern computers</a> to produce a working game disc that can be loaded into an Acorn Archimedes or an emulator. If you want to experiment with the code, this is the place to go.</p>
