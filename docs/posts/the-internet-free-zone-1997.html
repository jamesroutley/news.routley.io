            If your site is dedicated to the free exchange of information, programs and
            content, if your site does not sell anything, you are part of the
            <b>
              Internet Free Zone
            </b>
            . If you wish, you may identify your site as a member of the
            <b>
              Internet Free Zone
            </b>
            by displaying one of the logos on this page.
            

            Here are the details: If you do not sell anything on your site and you do not
            engage in spamming
            <sup>
              <a href="#spam_definition">1</a>
            </sup>
            , you qualify for the
            <b>
              Internet Free Zone Level 2
            </b>
            category. If you also do not have any commercial advertising on your site, you
            qualify for the
            <b>
              Internet Free Zone Level 1
            </b>
            category.
            

            If you display one of the
            <b>
              Internet Free Zone
            </b>
            logos, you are not entered in a free drawing, you don&#39;t get to go on a dream
            vacation, and you will not be put on anyone&#39;s mailing list. You will not make
            $50,000 in three days without leaving the house, and Unbelievably Sexy Vicky
            will almost certainly not call you up.
            

            What
            <i>
              will
            </i>
            happen is you will signal your commitment to high quality Web content, and to
            the proposition that the Internet can once again be a communication medium
            suitable for human beings. You will show that your site supports the free
            exchange of ideas, programs, and intellectually enriching content. Of course,
            there are other ways you can do this â€” having an
            <b>
              Internet Free Zone
            </b>
            logo is just one way.
