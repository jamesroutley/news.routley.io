<a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Leadership
Principles</a> are famous, not just within Amazon but also in the tech
world at large.  While they&#39;re frequently mocked — including by
Amazonians — they&#39;re also generally sensible rules by which to run
a company.  I&#39;ve been an Amazon customer for over 25 years and an AWS
customer for almost 20 years, and also an

for 6 years, and while I&#39;ve never worked for Amazon I feel that I&#39;ve seen
behind the curtain enough to offer some commentary on a few of these
principles.
</p><ul><li>
<b>Customer Obsession</b>: <i>Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.
They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay
attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.</i>
</li><li>
<b>Ownership</b>: <i>Leaders are owners. They think long term and don&#39;t sacrifice
long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire
company, beyond just their own team. They never say &#34;that&#39;s not my job.&#34;</i>
</li><li>
<b>Bias for Action</b>: <i>Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions
are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk
taking.</i>
</li></ul><p>
Werner Vogels famously said in his 2024 re:Invent keynote, &#34;Listen to the AWS
Heroes&#34;.  I think he was talking about technical advice, and perhaps speaking
mainly to AWS customers; but I like to think that Amazon might also benefit
listening to some of what I&#39;ve said here.  We criticize because we care.
