Each full dive to the wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly takes around eight hours.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The OceanGate website lists three submersibles it owns, and only the Titan is capable of diving deep enough to reach the Titanic wreckage. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The vessel weighs 23,000 lbs (10,432 kg) and, according to the website, can reach depths of up to 13,100 ft and has 96 hours of life support available for a crew of five.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A vessel called the Polar Prince, which is used to transport submersibles to the wreckage site, was involved in the expedition, its owner told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>David Pogue, a CBS reporter who travelled in the Titan submersible last year, told the BBC about the issues that both the submersible crew and the land crew were likely to be experiencing, saying that there was currently &#34;no way&#34; to communicate with the vessel as neither GPS nor radio &#34;work under water&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;When the support ship is directly over the sub, they can send short text messages back and forth. Clearly those are no longer getting a response,&#34; Mr Pogue said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He added that because the passengers were sealed inside the vessel by bolts applied from the outside, &#34;There&#39;s no way to escape, even if you rise to the surface by yourself. You cannot get out of the sub without a crew on the outside letting you out.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Titanic, which was the largest ship of its time, hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912. Of the 2,200 passengers and crew onboard, more than 1,500 died.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Its wreckage has been extensively explored since it was discovered in 1985.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The wreck lies in two parts, with the bow and the stern separated by about 2,600ft. A huge debris field surrounds the broken vessel.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65602182">the first full-sized digital scan of the wreck was created using deep-sea mapping</a>. The scan shows both the scale of the ship, as well as some minute details, such as the serial number on one of the propellers.</p></div></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Watch: A recently released video shows a 3D view of the Titanic shipwreck,  3,800m (12,500ft) down at the bottom of the Atlantic</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Do you have information about this story?
