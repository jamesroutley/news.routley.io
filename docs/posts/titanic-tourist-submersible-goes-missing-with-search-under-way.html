that he would be aboard the mission to the wreck of the Titanic - but added that due to the &#34;worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He later wrote: &#34;A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>OceanGate said in a statement that its &#34;entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to re-establish contact with the submersible,&#34; it added.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company bills the eight-day trip on its carbon-fibre submersible as a &#34;chance to step outside of everyday life and discover something truly extraordinary&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>According to its website, one expedition is ongoing and two more have been planned for June 2024. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The submersible usually carries a pilot, three paying guests, and what the company calls a &#34;content expert&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The trip sets sail from St John&#39;s in Newfoundland, which is around 370 miles (600km) from the wreckage site. Each full dive to the wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly takes around eight hours.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The OceanGate website lists three submersibles it owns, and only the Titan is capable of diving deep enough to reach the Titanic wreckage. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The vessel weighs 10,432 kg (23,000 lbs) and, according to the website, can reach depths of up to 4,000m and has 96 hours of life support available for a crew of five.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A vessel called the Polar Prince, which is used to transport submersibles to the wreckage site, was involved in the expedition, its owner told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Titanic, which was the largest ship of its time, hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912. Of the 2,200 passengers and crew onboard, more than 1,500 died.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Its wreckage has been extensively explored since it was discovered in 1985.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The wreck lies in two parts, with the bow and the stern separated by about 800m (2,600ft). A huge debris field surrounds the broken vessel.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-65602182">the first full-sized digital scan of the wreck was created using deep-sea mapping</a>. The scan shows both the scale of the ship, as well as some minute details, such as the serial number on one of the propellers.</p></div></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Watch: Video shows 3D view of the Titanic shipwreck</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Do you have information about this story?
