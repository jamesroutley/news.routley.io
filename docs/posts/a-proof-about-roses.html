    <p>A proof about roses? Who would have thought!</p>

<p>In this case, a rose is a shape generated in a polar graph from the equation</p><p>

\[r = m\cos(n \theta + \phi)\]

</p><p>graphed in the domain \([0, 2\pi]\).</p>

<p>However, something peculiar happens when you change the coefficient to \(\theta\) (\(n\)).</p>

<p>When \(n\) is even, \(2n\) petals are produced (after \(\pi\), the petals go back over on themselves). On the other hand, when it is odd, \(n\) petals are produced!</p>

<p>My teacher said that there were proofs, but they involved calculus, so naturally I took it upon myself as a challenge to prove it without calculus!</p>

<p>The Proof Follows:</p>

<p>Assume for the proof that \(n \in \text{the set of all odd numbers}\).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At \(\pi\), \(\cos(n\theta)\) will always be \(-1\), while \(\cos(2n\theta)\) will always be 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proving the above statement will allow us to conclude the proof.</p>

<p>Recall the function for period of a sinusoidal: the period of a function of the form \(\cos(mx)\) is \(\text{period} = \frac{2\pi}{m}\). Rearranging this with some algebra, we get \(m = \frac{2\pi}{\text{period}}\). At \(2\pi\), \(m\) periods will have been completed, so it follows that at \(\pi\), \(m/2\) periods will have been completed. If \(m\) is an odd number, as it is in our case, then the amount of periods completed at \(\pi\) will have a fractional component of \(1/2\). When the amount of periods completed has a fractional component of \(1/2\), in a regular cosine curve, it means that the function output must be \(-1\) because that is the value of cosine at half a cycle.</p>

<p>Conversely, we can prove that where the coefficient is even, in the case of \(\cos(2n\theta)\), the output at \(\pi\) <em>must</em> be \(1\) with the same logic. At \(\pi\), \(2n/2 = n\) periods have been completed, which means that the value must be the same as the start of a cycle in a cose graph which is \(1\).</p>

<p>Okay, we have now established this, but how does it help us? Recall that in a polar graph, negating the radius is the same as adding \(\pi\) to \(\theta\). Adding \(\pi\) to a cosine graph will shift it left by \(\pi\). So for any polar graph, taking the graph from \([\pi, 2\pi]\), multiplying it by -1, and translating it to the domain \([0, \pi]\) will produce the <strong>exact same graph</strong>. Since a graph in the second half of a period, when we multiply \(\theta\) by an odd number, from \([\pi, 2\pi]\), is \(-1\) times the graph in the first half of the period (because the periods are exactly \(1/2\) period out of sync), <strong>when you shift left and multiply the graph by \(-1\), it overlaps perfectly with the graph from \([0, \pi]\)</strong>! This causes there to be no new petals drawn.</p>

<p>And since multiplying \(\theta\) by an even coefficient leaves it at the start of a cycle at \(\pi\), it <strong>does not overlap on itself when multiplied by \(-1\) and shifted by \(\pi\) to the left</strong>. This causes new petals to be drawn where they don’t overlap.</p>

<p>Check out these examples for visual intuition (pay attention to graph label numbers: they are flipped):</p>

<p>QED!!!</p>
