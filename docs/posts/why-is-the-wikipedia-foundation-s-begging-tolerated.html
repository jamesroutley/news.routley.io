    <h1>Ask HN: Why is the Wikipedia Foundation&#39;s begging tolerated?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every time you go to Wikipedia there&#39;s a huge banner asking for money implying it could shut down at any moment due to lack of funding.</p><p>In reality, the Wikipedia Foundation is doing just fine. In fact, they make so much money from donations, they spend (read: waste) massive amounts of it on various social ventures instead of using it on the service that caused people to donate in the first place.</p></div></div></div>
