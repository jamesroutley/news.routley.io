<p>While maintaining and developing the Go cryptography standard library, we often spend significantly more time on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkEH3V3PkS0">testing</a> than on implementation. That’s good and an important part of how we achieve our excellent <a href="https://go.dev/blog/tob-crypto-audit">security track record</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally, this would be especially true for the <em>least safe</em> parts of the library. However, testing assembly cores presents unique challenges, due to their constant-time nature. This has been a long-standing issue.</p>
<p>For Go 1.26, I am working on introducing a mutation testing framework for assembly, which will effectively act as enhanced code coverage. This will not improve tests by itself, but it will let us see what assembly code and data paths are not covered by our test suite, so we can improve it.</p>
<h2 id="20040-my-white-whale">#20040, my white whale</h2>
<p>Cryptographic assembly is sort of my “origin story” as a Go maintainer. Back in 2017, a colleague at Cloudflare found a certificate that failed to validate with Go’s crypto/x509. The bug was <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9294fa2749ffee7edbbb817a0ef9fe633136fa9c#diff-85772c71438acb5fb01065a6aacca9411f81a807b13230d3592bc5fb498fda9a">a mishandled carry in the amd64 assembly implementation of P-256 modular subtraction</a>. It had escaped all testing because that carry flag had a 1 in 2³² chance of being set when operating on random inputs.</p>
<p>Adam Langley commented that exploiting it was unlikely and <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20040#issue-222804725">“would be a cool paper”</a>. Then Sean Devlin and I hid in a Starbucks in Paris for a whole day while the yellow jackets set fire to cop cars outside, and figured out how to turn it into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIFiaCcKfW8">Hollywood-looking key recovery attack</a>. That was fun, but it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPj5tTFDql0">a different story</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward one year, and it was now my job to stop this from happening again. Finding a robust countermeasure to this bug class has been my white whale ever since.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Filippo, normal, well-adjusted people don’t have white whales.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/AssemblyPolicy">Assembly Policy</a> has (hopefully) helped reduce the risk of introducing new manually-written assembly bugs, if anything because it made it harder to introduce new manually written assembly, but a fundamental problem is that we don’t know how well our assembly is tested , because code coverage doesn’t work for cryptographic assembly.</p>
<p>Most cryptographic code has to operate in constant time, meaning it executes the same instructions regardless of the inputs, to avoid leaking secrets through timing side-channels. To achieve that, we often compute both “branches” of an operation (e.g. both <code>a - b</code> and <code>a - b + p</code>, for <code>a - b mod p</code>), and then discard one of the results with constant-time select instructions. The problem is that if you run code coverage, you’ll see all “branches” light up, even if all tests actually discard the result of one of them. We could have other untested paths like #20040 and not know about it.</p>
<p>At some point in 2019 I tried instrumenting binaries at runtime with DynamoRIO to capture the flags before each flag-consuming instruction, to feed a more comprehensive coverage report. It almost worked. “Almost” being dispositive.</p>
<h2 id="mutation-testing">Mutation testing</h2>
<p>Enter mutation testing. Mutation tests modify the program, for example by turning a <code>!=</code> into a <code>==</code>, and check that tests <em>fail</em> for each “mutation.” If they don’t, that line is not—effectively—tested.</p>
<p>This is actually more accurate than regular test coverage because it doesn’t just check that code is executed, but also that the result influences the success of the tests, such that producing a different result would cause the tests to fail.</p>
<p>It’s also a great match for constant time assembly!</p>
<p>For example, if we turn an <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/29806">add-with-carry</a> into a regular add, and tests still pass, we are not actually testing the case in which the carry is set.</p>
<h2 id="mutating-assembly">Mutating assembly</h2>
<p>The next question is how to programmatically mutate assembly. I was going to do it at the source level, but Russ Cox suggested modifying the assembler instead, to avoid having to deal with macros and parsing.</p>
<p>cmd/asm assigns a virtual program counter to instructions right after parsing, before encoding them. <a href="https://go.dev/cl/665375">CL 665375</a><sup id="fnref:pending"><a href="#fn:pending">1</a></sup> adds a <code>-mutlist</code> flag to print the listing at that point to standard error, and a <code>-mut</code> flag that allows replacing any instruction by its program counter with one or more other instructions. Implementing it was fairly easy, reusing the parser and patching the instructions linked list.</p>
<pre><code>$ GOARCH=amd64 go test crypto/ed25519 -asmflags=crypto/internal/fips140/edwards25519/field=-mutlist -c

</code></pre>
<p>These assembler flags can be enabled for a specific package during <code>go test</code> with <code>-asmflags=PACKAGE=&#34;-mut=...&#34;</code>. Thankfully cmd/go already knows to fold the <code>-asmflags</code> argument into the cache key of assembler artifacts, and it even caches the stderr output, so <code>-mutlist</code> output is available even when using a cached result.</p>
<h2 id="the-test-framework">The test framework</h2>
<p>Driving these tests is <a href="https://go.dev/cl/666395">relatively straightforward</a>.</p>
<p>First, we run <code>go test -c -asmflags=PACKAGE=-mutlist</code> to obtain the listing of potential targets.</p>
<p>Then, for each mutation of each target instruction, we run <code>go test -failfast -asmflags=PACKAGE=&#34;-mut=file.s:123=MUTATION&#34;</code>, and make sure it fails. To speed things up, we run first with <code>-short</code> and then without only if short tests pass. Also, we first run with <code>-c</code> to ensure our mutation compiles.</p>
<h2 id="the-mutations">The mutations</h2>
<p>Finally, we need to decide which target instructions we mutate and how. Mutations turn an instruction that behaves differently based on a flag, into an equivalent instruction that behaves as if the flag was always or never set. They need not to change anything else, to avoid accidentally breaking the test run and causing a mutation testing false negative. In particular, we can’t use any register and we need to leave the final flags untouched.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few arm64 examples.</p>
<h4 id="adcs-and-sbcs">ADCS and SBCS</h4>
<p><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/ADCS--Add-with-carry--setting-flags-?lang=en">ADCS</a> adds two registers and the carry, and sets output flags.</p>
<pre><code>// Xd = Xn + Xm + C
ADCS Xn, Xm, Xd
</code></pre>
<p>Mutating it into an instruction that ignores the carry flag is easy, we just turn it into a <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/ADDS--immediate---Add-immediate-value--setting-flags-?lang=en">ADDS</a>.</p>
<pre><code>// Xd = Xn + Xm
ADDS Xn, Xm, Xd
</code></pre>
<p>To mutate in the other direction, we prepend an instruction that sets the C flag. We don’t care about smashing the other flags, because ADCS will reset them anyway.</p>
<pre><code>// C = 1 (i.e. no borrow, yes carry)
SUBS ZR, ZR, ZR
// Xd = Xn + Xm + C
ADCS Xn, Xm, Xd
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/SBCS--Subtract-with-carry--setting-flags-?lang=en">SBCS</a> is the equivalent subtraction instruction, and we mutate it the same way, except that <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/SUBS--immediate---Subtract-immediate-value--setting-flags-?lang=en">SUBS</a> behaves as if the carry (aka “no borrow”) flag was always set, so we need to unset it in the mirror mutation.</p>
<pre><code>// ## Original
// Xd = Xm - Xn - (C - 1)
SBCS Xn, Xm, Xd

// ## Mutation 1
// Xd = Xm - Xn
SUBS Xn, Xm, Xd

// ## Mutation 2
// C = 0 (i.e. yes borrow, no carry)
ADDS ZR, ZR, ZR
// Xd = Xm - Xn - (C - 1)
SBCS Xn, Xm, Xd
</code></pre>
<h4 id="adc-and-sbc">ADC and SBC</h4>
<p><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/ADC--Add-with-carry-?lang=en">ADC</a> and <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/SBC--Subtract-with-carry-?lang=en">SBC</a> are the corresponding instructions that don’t set output flags.</p>
<p>This makes things a little different because we can’t smash the flags with a prepended instruction, but on the other hand we don’t need to worry about setting them accurately.</p>
<p>Instead of setting the carry bit beforehand, we add or subtract one from the destination afterwards.</p>
<pre><code>// ## Original
// Xd = Xn + Xm + C
ADC Xn, Xm, Xd

// ## Mutation 1
// Xd = Xn + Xm
ADD Xn, Xm, Xd

// ## Mutation 2
// Xd = Xn + Xm
ADD Xn, Xm, Xd
// Xd = Xd + 1
ADD $1, Xd, Xd
</code></pre>
<pre><code>// ## Original
// Xd = Xm - Xn - (C - 1)
SBC Xn, Xm, Xd

// ## Mutation 1
// Xd = Xm - Xn
SUB Xn, Xm, Xd

// ## Mutation 2
// Xd = Xm - Xn
SUB Xn, Xm, Xd
// Xd = Xd - 1
SUB $1, Xd, Xd
</code></pre>
<p>There is one more wrinkle: if one of the operands is the zero register ZR, then the equivalent ADD or SUB can’t be encoded, because if you’re not setting flags it makes no sense to add or subtract to/from zero instead of storing. In those cases we mutate into an appropriate MOVD.</p>
<h4 id="csel">CSEL</h4>
<p><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/2025-06/Base-Instructions/CSEL--Conditional-select-?lang=en">CSEL</a> is a constant-time select that stores one value or another based on a flag, usually the equality or carry flag.</p>
<p>Mutating it into MOVDs is trivial.</p>
<pre><code>// ## Original
// Xd = Xn if X else Xm
CSEL X, Xn, Xm, Xd

// ## Mutation 1
// Xd = Xn
MOVD Xn, Xd

// ## Mutation 2
// Xd = Xm
MOVD Xm, Xd
</code></pre>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I initially ran this on the arm64 P-256 assembly, for white whale and hardware availability reasons, and it found <a href="https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/e5ea512feee63a05f18d8c11e16e95e9">a number of untested instructions</a>, including… in <code>p256SubInternal</code>, goddammit.</p>
<p>Writing tests to cover them is tedious and sometimes really hard, because 2^-32 edge cases like a P-256 field overflow deep in a function are hard to hit explicitly. That’s another indication that this assembly core should be <a href="https://go.dev/cl/627943">broken up into smaller, more easily tested operations</a>.</p>

<p>It’s that time of the year again: I just attended the Italian national math team’s training retreat, where my main contributions are playing in the abstract board game tournament, moderating the night-time Werewolf games, bringing snacks, and looking at the pretty lake. This year I also gave an introduction to modern cryptography in Italian, walking the audience through composing primitives to build an IND-CCA2 cipher.</p>
<p><img alt="A wide shot captures a lake scene at dusk, dominated by a pastel-colored sky and the silhouettes of distant mountains. The sky transitions from a soft, light blue at the top, blending into delicate shades of pink and orange closer to the horizon, where clouds catch the last light of the setting sun. The lake&#39;s surface mirrors these sky colors, creating a palette of muted blues, purples, and grays. Several boats, mostly covered, are scattered across the water,. In the foreground, a dark, weathered wooden pier extends into the lake from the left." src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/75103862-c8b0-42a7-b2fb-8ede7406f3ac.jpeg?w=960&amp;fit=max"/></p>
