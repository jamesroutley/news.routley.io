    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello hackers,</p><p>I&#39;ve launched a website specifically for sharing scenes, complete with descriptions and timestamps from various films and TV shows. I&#39;m reaching out to gather your perspectives and recommendations in these domains to improve the site and extend my outreach.</p><p>Link : <a href="https://scenestamps.com" rel="nofollow">https://scenestamps.com</a></p><p>You are not required to register/login to browse the site.</p><p>Scenestamps Features:</p><p>1. Search : You can directly search for a scene or a source.</p><p>2. Upload Posts : 
 You can register with your google account, login and start posting right away. Unlike other sites in this specific domain, users are allowed to upload posts.</p><p>There are two types of posts
  - scene
  - source</p><p>Source is  a movie,tv show, documentary, etc...
 One source can have multiple scenes</p><p>While creating a scene post, source can be selected there.</p><p>Scene post will have the timestamp fields. 
 There are two types of it:
 - single - one input field of timestamp in which the scene happens.
 - from-to - two input fields, from and to within which the scene takes place.</p><p>3. Share posts : Share feature is available on both source and scene posts, with which you can share the post to your favorite social media platforms</p><p>4.
