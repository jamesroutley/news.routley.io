            <p>The work on the scheduler is to support async effect handlers. It won&#39;t do at all, if a network request always blocks the evaluation of the computational graph. So I embarked on it about <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/lab-note-063-vibe-coding-a-scheduler/" rel="noreferrer">two weeks ago</a>. </p><p>Right now, the API looks like this (subject to change). There&#39;s a class to track all the originating state.</p><pre><code>class MyState:
    @track
    def a(self):
        return 2

    @track
    def b(self):
        return 3</code></pre><p>Then we can use that state either directly, or with functions that use that state (derived state).</p><pre><code>@reactive
def triple(self, state):
    return 3 * state.b + 3 * state.c

@reactive
def square_triple(self, state):
    return self.triple(state) ** 2</code></pre><p>Reactive functions can raise effects by yielding a description of the effect. And we handle the effects with a handler.</p><pre><code>@reactive
def log_state(self, state) -&gt; EffectfulGen[Log, int]:
    res = 3 * state.a
    yield Log(f&#34;multiplier result: {res}&#34;)
    return res

with use_handler(MemoryLogging()):
    self.log_state(my_state)</code></pre><p>Effect descriptions and their handlers are mostly predefined, but if you need to write your own, you define an Ability (like an interface), and then a handler that implements the Ability. This is a little verbose for my liking, but it&#39;s good enough for now. I&#39;d been tweaking the type checking on this for a while already.</p><pre><code>@dataclass
class Log(effects.Effect):
    message: str

class Ability(effects.Ability):
    @abstractmethod
    def log(self, effect: Log) -&gt; None: ...

class PrintLogging(Handler, Ability):
    def log(self, effect: Log) -&gt; None:
        print(effect.message)</code></pre><p>I&#39;ve tried to keep the API tight and easy to read, without a lot of boilerplate or fanfare. I mostly like it. However, with async handlers, I hope I don&#39;t have to complicate it too much. The core issue is how to represent eventual values. We have promises (coroutines in python), but they&#39;re not cancel-able and doesn&#39;t support multiple resumption. I&#39;m gearing towards supporting both, which is why all this work going about a use-land scheduler. </p><p>At the end of the day, I think the solution Claude and I fell into was having a placeholder object as a proxy to the value. I&#39;m not thrilled about it since the designers of React eschewed wrapping every reactive value inside a container so that users can do regular operations with them. In order to support that on my end, I&#39;ll have to override all built-ins. I hope I don&#39;t come to regret this choice, but the alternative is to litter <code>awaits</code> everywhere.</p><p>Been getting used to mixing vibe coding into my workflow. I&#39;m still learning exactly where Claude Code is better and where it&#39;s worse. The bones of the scheduler that it wrote is still there. However, I&#39;ve had to rip out a bunch of stuff because on close examination the code it generates is rather confusing. It still need to be simplified further, but after this foray into vibe coding, I think I&#39;ll have to do it more manually. There are certain subsections I can ask it to code up, but not the core call chain and scheduling mechanisms.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;m taking a lot of time with the scheduler, but I guess it can&#39;t be helped. My desire to understand how every part of this core works is because I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to debug it later on. It won&#39;t do to rely on AI to do it, since there are plenty of times where it just gets lost debugging. Every time I&#39;ve blindly relied on AI, I&#39;ve come to regret it. I&#39;ll grind away the rest of the week on this, and see where I&#39;m at by the end of the week and re-evaluate.</p><p>I recently found <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thorstenball.com?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">Thorsten Ball</a>&#39;s newsletter, <a href="https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">Register Spill</a>, in which he has a Joy and Curiosity section where he posts things that he&#39;s found. I think I&#39;ll add that to my lab notes every week as well, to add value to those of you that keep reading.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxGxsGnbyJ4&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com">Implicit Surfaces &amp; Independent Research</a> by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattkeeter.com?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">Matt Keeter</a> is one of the better talks I&#39;ve seen this year so far. He starts with a simple premise: are we inside or outside of a shape? And then it crescendos into a compiler! This has ideas and implications for people working on spreadsheets and front-end frameworks, I think.</li><li>Eric Meijer wants to encourage people to see the possibilities for probabilistic frameworks and differential programming languages in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXHIRyQOC8&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com">Alchemy For the Modern Computer Scientist</a>. But I didn&#39;t even get to all that. I was introduced to <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2014/12/30/dual-numbers-automatic-differentiation/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">dual numbers</a> for the first time. It&#39;s exciting because it&#39;s a way to compute the derivative along with the function in the same &#34;number.&#34; DbSP takes a similar approach. How are they related? Once I finish with the scheduler, I&#39;ll look into this.</li><li>Claude Code was released and <a href="https://github.com/ghuntley/claude-code-source-code-deobfuscation?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">some people</a> are <a href="https://leehanchung.github.io/blogs/2025/03/07/claude-code/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">poking about it to see how it works</a>.</li><li>The Socials are alight with <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">MCP: &#34;Model Context Protocol&#34;</a>. I haven&#39;t looked into heavily yet, but there seems to be <a href="https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">quite a bit of adoption already</a>. It&#39;s a protocol for LLMs to talk and use various tools in a standardized way.</li><li><a href="https://www.patricksparabox.com/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">Patrick&#39;s Parabox</a> is a puzzle game that uses recursive mechanics. In most visual programming, the spatial dimension is flat. I&#39;d want to see how to address composition, or functions within functions. Patrick might have some inspiration for people that way.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/2025/03/patrick_parabox.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="356" height="356"/></figure><ul><li>Orion Reed&#39;s <a href="https://folk.systems/canvas/space/hypertext-zui?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">prototype on zoomable hypertext</a> has got the Patrick vibes. </li></ul><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if hypertext were zoomable?
