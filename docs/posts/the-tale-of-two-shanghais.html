    <h1>The tale of two Shanghais</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>As an adolescent, I used to be obsessed with skyscrapers. I made daily visits to
the <a href="https://www.skyscrapercity.com/">Skyscraper City forums</a>, eagerly waiting
for progress photos as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supertall_skyscrapers">supertall skyscrapers</a>
went up around the world.</p>
<p>I was lucky to visit Shanghai with my family in 2005, just as Shanghai’s skyline
was rapidly changing. <a href="https://arun.is/blog/shanghai-cars/">I previously wrote</a> how the cars on
the road in China have been a visual indicator of economic progress over my
visits in the last two decades. A similar story can be told through the
architecture.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest of the many major cities concentrated around the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_Delta">Yangtze Delta</a>. Unsurprisingly,
water is a major geographical influence on how that area has been populated over
the millennia. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuzhen">Wuzhen</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou">Suzhou</a> and many other towns in the area
are crisscrossed by canals much like Venice. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake#See_also">West Lake</a>, a massive
freshwater lake in Hangzhou, has been a tourist destination for nearly 1500
years.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_River">Huangpu River</a> is
the major geographical feature, dividing the city into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puxi">Puxi</a> on the west and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudong">Pudong</a> on the east. Till recently, the
two sides of the river have had vastly different patterns of development. Take a
river boat on the Huangpu River, and the difference will be obvious.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War">First Opium War</a>
and the signing of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanking">Treaty of Nanking</a> in 1842,
Shanghai was opened up as one of five treaty ports in China. This resulted in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_International_Settlement">settlements</a>
being constructed in Puxi by various western powers. As a result, the Puxi side
of the river is flanked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bund">The Bund</a>, a
historical waterfront almost entirely populated by low-height European-style
buildings clad in stone.</p>
<p>The Pudong side of the river is today entirely defined by modern glass-clad
supertall skyscrapers, but that is a recent development.</p>

<p>Until the late 20th century, Pudong was only accessible by ferry from the more
populated Puxi side. Pudong stayed a rural area used mostly for agriculture and
warehousing. In 1990, Pudong was designated a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zones_of_China">Special Economic Zone (SEZ)</a>,
spurring rapid development.</p>
<p>In our latest trip to Shanghai last year, we had a chance to visit Pudong and
its supertalls yet again.</p>
<h2 id="oriental-pearl-tower">Oriental Pearl Tower</h2>

<p>The first of the many supertall structures constructed in Pudong is the Oriental
Pearl Tower. It was built to support TV broadcast antennas. Construction began
just one year after Pudong’s designation as a SEZ and finished three years later
in 1994. My wife remembers seeing it out of her apartment window as a child
until taller buildings eventually obscured the view.</p>

<p>I visited it in 2005 and distinctly remember the state of Pudong at the time.
Cranes were everywhere as multiple giant developments were all underway.</p>

<p>This building remained the tallest structure in China until 2007’s completion of
the World Financial Center next door.</p>
<h2 id="jin-mao-tower">Jin Mao Tower</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Mao_Tower">The Jin Mao Tower</a>, alongside
Taipei 101, is one of my favorites in Asia. Both are heavily inspired by
traditional Chinese architecture. Designed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOM_(architectural_firm)">SOM</a>, the Jin Mao
tower features a faceted exterior that steps back and increases in complexity as
the floors rise. The proportions are dictated by mathematical formulas that give
it balance.</p>

<p>I still hope to one day stay at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hyatt_Shanghai">Grand Hyatt</a> inside, which
spanning the 53rd to 87th floors of the 88-floor building, was the highest hotel
in the world for a long time.</p>
<h2 id="shanghai-world-financial-center">Shanghai World Financial Center</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_World_Financial_Center">The Shanghai World Financial Center (WFC)</a>
was long in the works. Construction began in 1997, just four years after the Jin
Mao Tower. Yet, because of the 1997
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis">Asian Financial Crisis</a>,
construction was paused.</p>
<p><img src="https://arun.is/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2FL1300697.B9UqBNqy.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/> <span>Leica CL · 18mm · f/5.6 · 1/200 ·
ISO 100</span></p>
<p>When I visited Shanghai in 2005, construction had again resumed. I looked out
from the Jin Mao in awe at the central core under construction. It was just like
a photograph I had seen on the Skyscraper City forums. I also distinctly
remember seeing souvenir statues of the building offered up at the Pearl Tower
gift shop. Those miniatures featured a circular cutout resembling a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_gate">moon gate</a>. Later that year, after
protests by people who claimed the circle looked like the rising sun of Japan,
the cutout was redesigned into a trapezoid.</p>
<p><img src="https://arun.is/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2FL1300695.a8mKumqw.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/> <span>Leica CL · 56mm · f/5.6 · 1/200 ·
ISO 100</span></p>
<p>I believe the trapezoidal cutout is bland. However, the building is still
beautiful overall. There are multiple observation decks, both below and above
the cutout.</p>
<h2 id="shanghai-tower">Shanghai Tower</h2>

<p>In our latest trip, we visited the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Tower">Shanghai Tower</a>. It’s the third
tallest building in the world and the tallest in China. After completion in
2016, it, alongside the Jin Mao and WFC, became the world’s only trio of
supertalls.</p>
<p><img src="https://arun.is/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2FL1300666.g0EUvQhs.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/> <span>The supertall trio · Leica CL ·
18mm · f/2.8 · 1/1250 · ISO 100</span></p>
<p>Designated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEED">LEED</a> Platinum, the building was
constrained by a mix of environmental concerns and strict building codes. For
example, the entirety of the building features two nested glass walls with an
atrium in between. This design allows natural air convection, significantly
reducing thermal stresses and energy use in the building. Architectural firm
Gensler <a href="https://www.gensler.com/projects/shanghai-tower">created a PDF</a> about
the facade design process that is a great read.</p>
<p><img src="https://arun.is/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2FL1300685.BFPpYnIo.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="1800" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/> <span>In the elevator to the top ·

<p>To me, the undulating surface has an organic sense of beauty, but is perhaps not
as memorable as the other three buildings I have mentioned here. Regardless, the
observation deck, with its 360-degree views is a must see. On a clear day, you
can see how far the Shanghai <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity">megacity</a>
goes. You can also look down at the comparatively diminutive WFC and Jin Mao
tower, which being the 12th and 34th tallest buildings in the world, would feel
absolutely enormous anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="two-shanghais">Two Shanghais</h2>
<p>Looking out from top of the Shanghai Tower, I realized that my appreciation for
skyscrapers has changed since that visit nearly two decades prior. I was
initially fascinated by the amount of engineering that goes into extreme
buildings. That fascination shifted as I started to see skyscrapers as cultural
markers, and the results of complex systems of economics and politics.</p>
<p>Standing there on the 121st floor, looking down at the modernity of Pudong and
the historical buildings in The Bund, a word came to mind — duality. The city,
and the country as a whole, are defined by the coexistence of extremes.</p>
<p><img src="https://arun.is/.netlify/images?url=_astro%2FL1300706.BKj1PgW4.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="960" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/> <span>Leica CL · 18mm · f/5.6 · 1/250 ·
ISO 100</span></p>
<p>In Shanghai, the Huangpu River divides old and new. In Puxi, you can find
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Renaissance_architecture">French Renaissance</a>
style buildings in the French Concession. Not too far away, you’ll find
traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikumen">Shikumen</a>. In Pudong,
you’ll find the aforementioned modern skyscrapers.</p>

<p>For breakfast, you can get a steamer full of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao">Xiaolongbao</a> on the cheap the way
locals have for decades, but pay in an instant with the scan of a QR code.</p>
<p>Chinese life is as much defined by strict, top-down totalitarian control, as it
is by the vibrant entrepreneurial Chinese spirit.</p>
<p>In Western media, China is often depicted as a monolith, yet being there on the
streets, I knew it is nothing but. Standing in one of the world’s tallest
structures, I could see a distinctly Chinese flavor of modernity. Yes, the
skyscrapers were often designed and in-part constructed by foreigners. Yet,
unlike the buildings of the Bund, they were heavily shaped by Chinese history
and tastes.</p>
<p>The skyscrapers of Pudong are a must visit, not just for their remarkable scale,
but because they are tangible manifestations of the duality of Shanghai.</p>
