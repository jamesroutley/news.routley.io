There have been no known convictions for sex between consenting adult males for decades and the law does not include sex between women or other genders.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) groups have brought multiple legal challenges attempting to strike down the law, but none has succeeded.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">On Sunday, several LGBTQ rights groups said in a joint statement they were &#34;relieved&#34; by Lee&#39;s announcement.</p><div data-testid="gallery-0" domain="https://www.reuters.com" article_url="/world/asia-pacific/singapore-will-decriminalise-sex-between-men-pm-2022-08-21/"><div><div><p data-testid="Body">A couple attends Pink Dot, an annual event organised in support of the LGBT community at the Speakers&#39; Corner in Hong Lim Park in Singapore, June 29, 2019.

For those that long for a more equal and inclusive Singapore, repeal signifies that change is indeed possible,&#34; they said in the statement.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">But the groups also urged the government not to heed calls from religious conservatives to enshrine the definition of marriage in the constitution, saying this would signal that LGBTQ+ citizens were not equal.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">RESISTANCE</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-12">In February, Singapore&#39;s highest court had ruled that since the law was not being enforced, it did not breach constitutional rights, as the plaintiffs had argued, and it reaffirmed that the law could not be used to prosecute men for having gay sex.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Some religious groups including Muslims, Catholics and some Protestants continued to resist any repeal of the law, Lee said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">An alliance of more than 80 churches expressed strong disappointment on Sunday over the government&#39;s decision.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">&#34;The repeal is an extremely regrettable decision which will have a profound impact on the culture that our children and future generations of Singaporeans will live in,&#34; it said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society of 5.5 million, of whom about 16% are Muslim, with bigger Buddhist and Christian communities. It has a predominantly ethnic Chinese population with sizeable Malay and Indian minorities, according to the 2020 census.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">Stressing his government&#39;s continued support for the traditional definition of marriage, Lee said: &#34;We believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, that children should be raised within such families, that the traditional family should form the basic building block of society.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">Singapore will &#34;protect the definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in the courts&#34;, he said. &#34;This will help us repeal Section 377A in a controlled and carefully considered way.&#34;</p><div><div><h5 data-testid="Heading">Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Chen Lin, editing by Kanupriya Kapoor and Gareth Jones</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
