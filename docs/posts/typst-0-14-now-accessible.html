    <h1>Typst 0.14: Now Accessible</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj=""> <div data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj="">  <p><strong data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj=""> <p data-astro-cid-4eu74nwj="">Typst 0.14 is out now. With accessibility by default, PDFs as images, character-level justification, and more, it has everything you need to move from draft to production.
</p> </strong></p> </div> <p>Typst&#39;s origins lie in academia, but over the past year, we&#39;ve seen it expand to so much more. It&#39;s increasingly being used in the industry: For manually written documents, partially automated reports, and in fully automated batch PDF generation pipelines. Across these use cases, it&#39;s being used in production for critical documents.</p>
<p>In August, we <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2025/future">launched a new website</a> to reflect Typst&#39;s expanding scope, and now, with Typst 0.14, we&#39;re shipping crucial features that make Typst even more widely applicable.</p>
<p>If you need to comply with accessibility-related regulations, Typst 0.14 has your back. Typst now generates accessible documents <em>by default,</em> with opt-in support for stricter checks. For those working with complex illustrations, PDFs are now supported as a native image format. In case you&#39;re typesetting a book, the new character-level justification will give your layout the final touch. And if you&#39;re building a website or blog, many improvements to Typst&#39;s HTML export are waiting for you.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<p>In this blog post, we&#39;ll take a closer look at the highlights of this release:</p>

<p>To get started with Typst 0.14…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>…in the web app:</strong> Just open any of your projects! You&#39;ll get a prompt offering you to upgrade to the latest version.</li>
<li><strong>…in the command line:</strong> Run <code>typst update</code> in your terminal or, if you haven&#39;t installed Typst previously, download the <a href="https://typst.app/open-source/#download">latest version of the CLI</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a comprehensive overview of all changes in the release, visit the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/changelog/0.14.0/">changelog</a>. If you&#39;re looking to upgrade your document to Typst 0.14, you can also skip ahead to the <a href="#migrating">Migration section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>Not everyone reads PDF documents the same. Some people read on large screens or print; others use small phones or screen readers to have documents read aloud. To cater to all these uses, a file must contain <em>tags</em> that allow Assistive Technology (AT) like screen readers to learn about the reading order and semantic meaning of each piece of text. Tags allow AT users to learn which text is <code><span>*strongly emphasized*</span></code>, enable navigation of the document by skipping between headings, and more.</p>
<p>Tagging requires no additional work from you: If you are using the built-in markup and elements, Typst will automatically select the right tags! Unlike many other tools, PDF files created with Typst 0.14 are tagged by default, raising the bar for accessibility.</p>
<p>But tags are not enough to make a file accessible: To reach everyone, you need to design for universal accessibility from the start. The new features in Typst 0.14 can help you with that. Consider diagrams created with shapes or packages like cetz—their visual meaning is invisible to assistive technology. The new <code>alt</code> parameter on figures solves this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>figure</span><span>(</span>
  <span>stack</span><span>(</span>
    dir<span>:</span> ltr<span>,</span>
    spacing<span>:</span> <span>0.5em</span><span>,</span>
    <span>rect</span><span>[</span>Tagged PDF<span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>text</span><span>(</span><span>2em</span><span>,</span> sym<span>.</span>arrow<span>.</span>long<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>rect</span><span>[</span>Accessibility<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span><span>,</span>
  alt<span>:</span> <span>&#34;Diagram with two rectangles. The first is labelled &#39;Tagged PDF&#39;. An arrow points to the second, labelled &#39;Accessibility&#39;&#34;</span><span>,</span>
  caption<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    Tags enable PDF accessibility
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre><p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/docs/pl7jZuMd4U0DyWwVHtHHPwAAAAAAAAAA.png" alt="Preview" width="600" height="123"/></p></div>
<p>With this change, AT users hear the alternative description and can grasp the figure&#39;s purpose just like sighted users—no information is lost. We have put together a new <a href="https://typst.app/docs/guides/accessibility/">Accessibility Guide</a> that contains more tips on how to create accessible documents, including how to write good alternative descriptions, when to use the figure&#39;s vs. the image&#39;s <code>alt</code> parameter, and more.</p>
<p>To make sure you got everything right, you can enable the new PDF/UA-1 export. PDF/UA is an international standard that helps to create universally accessible PDF files. When it is enabled, Typst will run additional checks against your document to find accessibility issues and optimize for accessibility rather than compatibility. It will find issues such as missing document titles, wrong heading hierarchies, and missing alternative descriptions.</p>
<p>PDF/UA-1 helps you comply with existing and upcoming international accessibility regulation like the European Accessibility Act (EAA) in the EU and the new Americans with Disabilities Act&#39;s (ADA) Title II guidance by the DOJ. The former applies to many businesses active in the European Union since 28 June 2025 while the deadline for the latter is set for April 24, 2026. If you are using Typst in your business for customer- or government-facing documents, you should adopt Typst 0.14 as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-standards">PDF standards</h2>
<p>Alongside PDF/UA-1 support, we&#39;ve also generally expanded Typst&#39;s support for PDF standards. Instead of just PDF 1.7, you can now choose between the PDF versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 2.0. And for PDF/A, we&#39;ve expanded support from just two specific substandards to all four parts with all their conformance levels. While Typst&#39;s defaults are perfectly fine for most use cases, choosing a standard can optimize your document specifically for your use case. Consult the expanded <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/pdf/#pdf-standards">PDF documentation in the reference</a> for guidance on which standards you should pick under which circumstances.</p>
<p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/images/blog/pdf-modal-014.webp" alt="A modal with the title &#39;PDF export&#39;. It allows changing page range, PDF version, PDF standard, and whether the file is tagged. In the standards category, PDF/UA-1 is enabled, two checkmarks report that the standard is accessible and allows file attachments. Due to the selection, the Tagged PDF checkbox is selected and cannot be unchecked." width="310" height="271"/></p><h2 id="pd-fs-as-images">PDFs as images</h2>
<p>Staying with the PDF theme, there are exciting news for authors that have a lot of complex illustrations. Typst now supports PDF as a native image format. What I personally find most exciting about it, is that PDF images are supported <em>across all export targets,</em> and for each export target in the most suitable format. In PDF export, PDFs are naturally directly embedded. Meanwhile, in HTML and SVG export, PDFs are converted to an embedded SVG on-the-fly. And, finally, in PNG export and the web app preview, PDFs are rasterized. All of this PDF processing functionality lives right in the Typst compiler, with no system dependencies. This is only possible thanks to the amazing work of community member <a href="https://github.com/LaurenzV">@LaurenzV</a>, who created a new PDF processing library called <a href="https://github.com/LaurenzV/hayro"><code>hayro</code></a> from scratch. The library is 100% written in the programming language Rust (which is also the language we use for the Typst compiler) and is thus highly portable.</p>

<h2 id="character-level-justification">Character-level justification</h2>
<p>Producing a visually balanced paragraph was once a fine art, when professional typesetters still carefully set paragraphs with movable type. Nowadays, you could hope that optimal paragraph typesetting is a solved problem across all our software. But, alas, it is not!</p>
<p>There are different strategies we can employ to produce a well-justified paragraph. Of course, to justify the paragraph, we need to stretch each line to the width of the measure. There are different ways to do this: Most obviously, we can adjust the spacing between words. This is what most software does. But we can also adjust the spacing between characters. This is now implemented in Typst.</p>
<p>Other methods to do this (which we want to explore in the future) include stretching the width of characters (this is best done with <em>variable fonts</em>) or, for some scripts, inserting special textual elements. For example, in Arabic, there are <em>Kashida,</em> which allow spacing out glyphs in words by extending the connectors between individual glyphs.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just part of the recipe. Arguably, the even more crucial part is how this interplays with <em>which linebreaks</em> we chose to insert. Naively, we can choose our break points based on how much text fits and then perform the stretching. But we can do much better by taking into account each line&#39;s potential for stretching with the various mechanisms discussed above! We can then choose the break points that minimize the amount of bad-looking stretching.</p>
<p>I was initially skeptical about supporting character-level justification because I&#39;ve seen it done poorly in some books. But that&#39;s actually not the fault of character-level justification per se; it&#39;s just excessive use of it. Tastefully chosen maxima—together with an algorithm that minimizes displeasing typography—make it bring out the best in justification.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about microtypography when people compare Typst with LaTeX. And even though Typst uses the same fundamental algorithm as LaTeX does to optimize paragraphs, it&#39;s true that LaTeX has some extra tricks up its sleeve. Now we do too though, as character-level justification is a feature that LaTeX does <em>not</em> support.</p>
<p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/images/blog/character-level-justification.webp" alt="Two renderings of a justified paragraph about the 29 BC Yellow River flood from Wikipedia. The first has the caption &#39;Without character-level justification&#39;. It has issues with grayness: For example, the 5th line is set very wide. The second has the caption &#39;With character-level justification&#39;. Compared to the previous example, no line is overly wide or narrow." width="1473" height="800"/></p><h2 id="richer-html-export">Richer HTML Export</h2>
<p>In Typst 0.13, we shipped a first, highly experimental version of HTML export. This very minimal version already introduced the primitives for flexible HTML generation. With these primitives, the mapping of Typst elements to HTML can be expressed through show rules, just like the mapping to visual elements is performed in paged export.</p>
<p>What was lacking though were show rules for many built-in elements, including elements like footnotes, outlines, and citations. Typst 0.14 makes good progress in this regard. Most semantic elements (those from the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/"><em>Model</em> category</a>) are now properly mapped to semantic HTML. We&#39;ve also improved handling of textual content in HTML export. The more visualization- and styling-focused parts of Typst&#39;s standard library remain largely unsupported, but we plan to add support for those (to the extent possible) in the future.</p>
<p>Below, you can see an example of a small, but non-trivial Typst document exported to HTML with Typst 0.14.</p>

</span></pre>
<p>Another exciting addition to HTML export is the new <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/html/typed/">typed HTML</a> interface. Typst&#39;s <code>html</code> module now includes functions for constructing HTML elements with strongly-typed attributes. This means you can now write</p>
<pre><code><span>#</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>video</span><span>(</span>
  autoplay<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  width<span>:</span> <span>1280</span><span>,</span>
  height<span>:</span> <span>720</span><span>,</span>
  src<span>:</span> <span>&#34;sunrise.mp4&#34;</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code><span>#</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>elem</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;video&#34;</span><span>,</span> attrs<span>:</span> <span>(</span>
  autoplay<span>:</span> <span>&#34;&#34;</span><span>,</span>

  src<span>:</span> <span>&#34;sunrise.mp4&#34;</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, attributes are mapped to idiomatic Typst-native types.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we&#39;re happy to announce that HTML export will soon come to the Typst web app. We&#39;re still polishing up the implementation, but plan to ship it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Please note that HTML export remains experimental. To enable it in the CLI, pass <code>--features html</code> or set <code>TYPST_FEATURES=html</code>. In the web app, support for HTML export will also need to be enabled on a per-project basis.</p>
<h2 id="migrating">Migrating to Typst 0.14</h2>
<p>As far as breaking changes and deprecations go, this is a pretty calm release. Most documents should continue to work as before. There are a few minor breaking changes that make certain validations more strict. For instance, labels, link URLs, and font lists may not be empty anymore. To learn about all breaking changes, consult the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/changelog/" title="changelog">changelog</a> and search for &#34;breaking change&#34;.</p>
<p>The release also contains a few <a href="https://typst.app/docs/changelog/0.14.0/#deprecations">deprecations</a>. In particular, you&#39;ll need to replace any use of <code>pdf.embed</code> with <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/pdf/attach/" title="`pdf.attach`"><code>pdf.attach</code></a>. Moreover, two bibliography styles were renamed and the <code>--make-deps</code> CLI flag was deprecated in favor of the new, more flexible <code>--deps</code> flag with <code>--deps-format make</code>. There are also a few deprecated <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/symbols/">symbols</a>. The compiler will warn you about all use of deprecated functionality.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-web-app">In the web app</h3>
<p>With this release, we&#39;re also bringing a better version upgrade experience to the web app. Previously, projects would always use the latest compiler version unless explicitly pinned to a specific version in the settings side panel.</p>
<p>We are now phasing out the &#34;Latest&#34; option. Instead, the web app detects when a new version is available since you&#39;ve last edited a project, and offers you to upgrade. The upgrade assistant includes an automatic compatibility check that compiles your document with both versions, makes a verdict, and lists new errors and warnings.</p>
<p><img src="https://typst.app/assets/images/blog/migration-modal.webp" alt="Modal with the title &#39;Upgrade your project&#39;. It contains this text: &#39;We updated the Typst compiler since you last edited this project. Upgrade this project to benefit from the new features and bug fixes in Typst 0.14.0. You can change the compiler version in the project settings panel at any time.&#39; In a box with a green outline, it says &#39;Your project is ready to upgrade. Your project compiled without errors on Typst 0.14.0. Note that its appearance may have changed.&#39;" width="491" height="320"/></p>
<p>Typst 0.14 is the result of 8 months of hard work by us and the community. We hope you are as excited about it as we are!</p>
