<p>The microcomputer is an incredible, revolutionary invention. Like the electric light, the printing press, and the wheel, it has changed the world. Without microcomputers, the internet, and perhaps even &#34;life as we know it&#34; would not be possible!</p>

<p>Once upon a time, computers were all built by huge corporations, and programmed by the faceless army of a software priesthood. Names like IBM, DEC, and NCR dominated the scene. Computers only did things <b>their</b> way, for <b>their</b> benefit. The only things users could do with them were the same things that a million <u>other</u> users did. What were touted as &#34;breakthroughs&#34; were often minor improvements on the Same Old Things.

</p><p>Then in the 1970&#39;s, the microprocessor was invented. Big companies viewed it as a primitive toy that could lure away customers and thus threaten their computing monopoly. But renegade groups of hackers saw it differently. Yes, it was a toy; but also a playground for unparallelled creativity, and a tool of unprecedented power. They sensed that the microcoprocessor was the next great invention that would change the world. The &#34;lights&#34; came on, the &#34;wheels&#34; started turning, and the &#34;presses&#34; quickly started churning out printed circuit boards that would revolutionize the world of computing.</p>

<p>At last, computer enthusiasts could have their own computer! They could build it, modify it, and even program it themselves! These were truly &#34;personal&#34; computers -- long before IBM co-opted the name for their bureaucratic beige boxes that were anything <i>but</i> personal.</p>

<p>These early microcomputers were pretty crude; like bicycles compared to sports cars. But that&#39;s a good thing! A bicycle is vastly cheaper, and much easier to learn. Yet it can still take you anywhere a car can go, if you&#39;re not in a hurry. And, a bicycle can take you to places that no car can ever go (with better scenery, too)!</p>

<p>The hobbyists that built them were often beginners and outsiders that didn&#39;t know how computing was &#34;supposed&#34; to be done. They made their own rules, invented their own solutions, and came up with entirely new applications that were impossible with traditional computers. In the process, they wound up completely re-inventing the entire computing industry.</p>

<p>This is the story of one such group of visionary hackers, and the computer they made. The story is fictional; but the computer is <b>real</b>! You can buy it, build it, and program it yourself just like the pioneers. And perhaps, invent your own completely new and imaginative uses for these marvelous little machines!</p>

<p>Our story begins in January of 1975. Hardware engineer Chip Hacker has been struggling to get his Mark-8 microcomputer with its 8008 CPU to work. His visionary friend Gil Bates alerts him to the introduction of the MITS Altair 8800 with its 8080 CPU, and says to &#34;Forget the Mark-8. This is going to be BIG!&#34; And off they go, on an adventure to found the Itty Bitty Micro Company and build the world&#39;s first pocket computer. Along the way, they join forces with Wiz Wireman (who can build anything), Richie C. &#34;Crash&#34; Kernigan (codemeister extraordinaire), and Tracy Weaver (who can pack a PCB tighter than a holiday suitcase).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a success! They manage to cram a classic 1980&#39;s microcomputer into an Altoids tin, complete with a Z80 CPU, memory, serial I/O, and an advanced front panel with keypad and LED display.</p>

<p>But disaster struck. Enroute to their big debut at the West Coast Computer Faire, the prototype was lost. It remained lost for 40 years, until it was recently discovered. Now it can be yours! A kit has been found with all the PC boards, parts, and documentation they produced along the way. You can build it yourself, as a &#34;reproduction&#34; of a computer that <b>could</b> have been made in 1980, if only things had worked out differently.</p>

<h2><b>The Z80 Membership Card -- A Vintage Micro in an Altoids tin!</b></h2>

<p>The Membership Card is a complete computer that fits in an Altoids tin. Inspired by classic 8-bit computers like the Altair 8800 and Heathkit H8, it is thoroughly documented and easy to build, with big parts, big pads, and big traces and spaces. It uses only generic parts common in the 1980s (and still available today) -- no custom parts, and no surface mount. It&#39;s fully self-contained: You don&#39;t need PCs, Windows, megabyte compilers, or secret software to use it. Now you can learn about computers right from the ground up, and <u>really</u> understand how they work!</p>

<p>It comes as a two-board set. The <b>Z80 Membership Card</b> itself is a stand-alone single-board computer that can &#34;power up&#34; your projects, like the Parallax BASIC Stamps or Arduino microcomputers. But you need a way to program it, and of course some kind of input and output &#34;shield&#34; to put it to work.</p>

<p>The <b>Z80 Front Panel</b> is the first such card. It plugs onto the Z80 Membership Card to add a hex keypad, 7-digit hex display, piezoelectric beeper, timer, and TTL/RS-232 serial port. The ZMC program in EPROM uses the front panel to provide a sophisticated machine-level monitor that works with either the keypad/LED or a serial terminal (or a PC pretending to be a terminal).</p>

<p>The <b>Z80-SIO Serial/RAM/SD-card</b> is the second I/O board. It plugs onto the Z80 Membership Card to add a real UART, additional memory up to 512K bytes, and a micro SD-card to simulate disk drives. The CP/M-80 operating system is included, so you can have a complete classic CP/M computer in your pocket!</p>
