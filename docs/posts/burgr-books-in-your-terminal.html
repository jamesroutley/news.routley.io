    <h1>Burgr â€“ Books in Your Terminal</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I spend most of my time writing code in a full screen terminal. I like to read
books on my breaks and I&#39;m a big fan of Project Gutenberg, which has over
70,000 books freely available (note, these are legal copyright free books).</p>
<p>I wrote <code>burgr</code>, a program to browse and search a catalog of available
books, download and manage my personal library and read these books - from
within the comfort of the terminal.</p>
<p>I can work away programming, take a break and switch instantly to another
<code>tmux</code> pane where I have <code>burgr</code> waiting to continue reading where I
left off :-)</p>
<p>I wrote this for my own use, so perhaps the UI is a little idiosyncratic, but I like it! (See <a href="https://blubsblog.bearblog.dev/i-am-the-only-user/">I am The Only User</a>).</p>
<p>Books are downloaded from mirrors of the Project Gutenberg site, not the
site itself, so meeting their terms.</p>
<p>The catalog can be downloaded and updated as new books are released by
running <code>burgr</code> with the <code>update</code> command argument.</p>
<p>Here are some screen shots which will give you a flavour of <code>burgr</code>.</p>
