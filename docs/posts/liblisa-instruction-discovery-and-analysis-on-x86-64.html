    <h1>LibLISA â€“ Instruction Discovery and Analysis on x86-64</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page">
        <p>
            libLISA is a tool that can <i>fully automatically</i> scan instruction space, discover instructions and synthesize their semantics.
            It produces machine-readable, CPU-specific x86-64 instruction semantics.
            It relies on as little human specification as possible:
            specifically, it does not rely on a handwritten (dis)assembler to dictate which instructions are executable on a given CPU, or what their operands are.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We will present libLISA at <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-oopsla#event-overview" target="_blank">OOPSLA&#39;24</a>.
        </p>

        

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Even though heavily researched, a full formal model of the x86-64 instruction set is still not available.
            This is caused by the sheer complexity of the x86-64 architecture:
            the informal specification found in <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html" target="_blank">Intel manuals is roughly 4700 pages</a>, and even these are known to be <a href="https://stefanheule.com/publications/pldi16-strata/" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/hardware-design-security/rememberr/" target="_blank">trustworthy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifications of CPU architectures often rely heavily on manual work, which is error-prone and labor-intensive.
            The current <a href="https://github.com/kframework/x86-64-semantics" target="_blank">state-of-the-art formal semantics</a> for x86-64 took 8 man-months to write, and even that specification still contains 34 errors (see Section 5.2 of our paper).
        </p>
        <p>
            This situation becomes even more dire when taking into account that different x86-64 machines will behave differently: not only can they have different instruction sets, but behavior is also allowed to be undefined, in which case the same instruction has different behavior on different machines.
        </p>
        <p>
            libLISA aims to solve this problem by using a CPU as the ground truth, and deriving semantics by observing instruction execution.
        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Approach</h2> -->

        <!-- <h2>Architecture Comparison</h2> -->

        <h2>x86-64 Instruction Semantics</h2>
        <p>
            We analyzed five different architectures: AMD 3900X, AMD 7700X, Intel i9-13900 (p), Intel i9-13900 (e) and Intel Xeon Silver 4110.
            For each architecture, we generated around 120k <i>encodings</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The semantics can be accessed in the following two ways:
            
            </p><ul>
                <li>Use <a target="_blank" href="https://explore.liblisa.nl/">explore.liblisa.nl</a> to browse the semantics manually.</li>
                <li>Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/libLISA/liblisa/tree/main/cli/liblisa-semantics-tool"><tt>liblisa-semantics-tool</tt></a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://crates.io/crates/liblisa">the <tt>liblisa</tt> Rust crate</a> to use the semantics programmatically.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>
            The generated x86-64 semantics are CPU-specific.
            Around 90% of all encodings is identical on all 5 CPU architectures that we analyzed.
            The remaining 10% differs between architectures.
            We can broadly classify these differences into two categories: instruction set extensions and undefined behavior.
            Some x86-64 instruction set extensions, such as the <tt>SHA1</tt> instructions, are not implemented on all CPUs.
            There are also many differences in how undefined behavior is implemented across different x86-64 CPU architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of undefined behavior is the <a target="_blank" href="https://explore.liblisa.nl/instruction/0FAFC3"><tt>IMUL</tt> instruction</a>.
            The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul#flags-affected">reference manual</a> states: <i>&#34;The SF, ZF, AF, and PF flags are undefined.&#34;</i>
            This means that the values of these flags can differ between CPU architectures, even if the instruction is provided with the same inputs.
            As can be seen <a target="_blank" href="https://explore.liblisa.nl/instruction/0FAFC3">in libLISA&#39;s semantics explorer</a>, The AMD 3900X and AMD 7700X do not modify these flags.
            The Intel i9-13900 (p) and Intel Xeon Silver 4110 compute the SF and PF correctly, and set the AF and ZF to 0.
            The Intel i9-13900 (e) additionally also computes the ZF flag correctly, and sets only the AF to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AMD 3900X and AMD 7700X often share the same instruction semantics.
            This is likely because the AMD 7700X is a successor of the AMD 3900X.
            Similarly, the Intel i9-13900 (p) and Intel Xeon Silver 4110 often also share semantics, likely because the Intel i9-13900 (p) is also a successor of the Intel Xeon Silver 4110.
