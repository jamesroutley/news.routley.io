      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;m a junior dev that recently joined a small team which doesn&#39;t seem to have much with regards to tracking requirements and how they&#39;re being tested, and I was wondering if anybody has recommendations.<p>Specifically, I would like to track what the requirements/specifications are, and how we&#39;ll test to make sure they&#39;re met? Which I don&#39;t know if this could be a mix of unit and integration/regression tests? Honestly though if this is maybe even the wrong track to take, I&#39;d appreciate feedback on what we could be doing instead.</p><p>I used IBM Rational DOORS at a previous job and thought it really helped for this, but with a small team I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll spring for it. Are there open source options out there, or something else that&#39;s easy? I thought we could maybe keep track in a spreadsheet (this to match DOORS?) or some other file, but I&#39;m sure there would be issues with that as we added to it. Thanks for any feedback!</p></td></tr>
