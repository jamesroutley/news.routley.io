We want to start by thanking all the founders who participated in the survey—this is quite a rare snapshot of real-world data gathered from over 500 startup founders across the globe. <br/></p><p>This report will give you a sense of what your peers are doing, and what the trends are for companies like yours. We know you’ll enjoy this report and we hope it’s a useful guide in discussing founder compensation with your cofounders and your board.<br/></p></div></div></div><div id="overview"><div><div><h2>Annual Salaries</h2><p>Comparing salary data across all respondents, a few overall trends emerged. Founders often start with a low salary, and more than 5% of our respondents pay themselves zero salary. Nearly half pay themselves less than $100,000 annually.<br/></p></div><div><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/60a5136f2c6c8e4fb3a130d9/62eaf54c5d18e7a579f3b885_fss22-average-salary.svg" loading="lazy" data-w-id="d03f481f-eb5e-890f-bec6-0142820e4718" alt=""/><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/60a5136f2c6c8e4fb3a130d9/62e833f999e140146b8262e0_fss22-overview-median-salary-callout.svg" loading="lazy" data-w-id="5c84d9f1-4f58-6e01-362b-8f40477546dd" alt=""/><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/60a5136f2c6c8e4fb3a130d9/62eaf54ce046e77a7f34cc12_fss22-overview-annual-salaries.svg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><div data-w-id="d1b2b502-4947-8385-2369-65adbd40e1c2"><p>46%</p><p>of founders pay themselves less than $100K annually</p></div></div></div><div><div><h2>Funding</h2><p>Almost 75% of founders reported funding between $100K and $10M, with 27% reporting funding between $1M and $3M.<br/></p></div><div><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/60a5136f2c6c8e4fb3a130d9/62eaf6460396e7f85ae8f3c1_fss22-average-funding.svg" loading="lazy" data-w-id="928c59a1-fa92-f69d-55ab-d80b8aeee162" alt=""/><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/60a5136f2c6c8e4fb3a130d9/62e833ffb978114ff4d5f3e2_fss22-overview-median-funding-callout.svg" loading="lazy" data-w-id="af71f6c3-0a9c-1623-3e86-20eec2a1a697" alt=""/><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/60a5136f2c6c8e4fb3a130d9/62e83408db9017efbec11f44_fss22-overview-funding.svg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><div data-w-id="d1b2b502-4947-8385-2369-65adbd40e1d3"><p>27%</p><p>of founders have reported funding between $1M to $3M</p></div></div></div></div><div id="funding"><div><div><h2>Salaries by Funding Level</h2><p>This section looks at how much founders are paying themselves, relative to the amount of funding that their company has raised.

Market comps of course matter, but ultimately the question is a highly personal one: what salary is needed to allow you to focus your efforts on making the business successful?<br/></p><p>In particular: if your salary is too low, you’ll spend a bunch of time and energy stressing out how to make your rent payment or how to cover your childcare costs—and all that stress distracts you from making your business successful.<br/></p><p>So in short, the correct amount to pay yourself (company funds permitting) is not a specific dollar amount: it’s enough so that you can focus all of your energy on creating a successful company.<br/></p><p>We’re wishing you the best of luck with your business!<br/></p></div></div><div><p>Methodology</p><p>The 2022 Founder Salary Survey was conducted over a five-week period starting in May 2022, during which we reached out to founders through our extended networks and elsewhere online. We received a total of 516 responses. Over 60% of our responses were from either remote Founders or Founders in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><div><ul id="w-node-d1b2b502-4947-8385-2369-65adbd40eb7e-790d6604" role="list"><li>What is your annual salary?
