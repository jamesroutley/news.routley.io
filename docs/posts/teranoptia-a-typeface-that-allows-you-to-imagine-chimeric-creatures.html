    <h1>Teranoptia â€“ a typeface that allows you to imagine chimeric creatures</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Teranoptia is a typeface without letters, a peculiar contraption that allows you to imagine chimeric creatures just by typing letters with your keyboard. Its design has been inspired by the Bayeux Tapestry and by medieval illustrations, as well as by children&#39;s books. You can use it to create border ornaments, to daydream about monsters or just to spice your layouts with marginalia.</p></div></div>
