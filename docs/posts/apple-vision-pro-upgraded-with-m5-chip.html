                 <h2><strong>A Leap Forward in Performance with M5</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>M5 provides an even faster, smoother, and more responsive experience for Apple Vision Pro users, while introducing new opportunities for developers to create more advanced spatial and immersive experiences. Built using third-generation 3-nanometer technology, M5 on Vision Pro features an advanced 10-core CPU that delivers higher multithreaded performance, resulting in faster experiences throughout the system, including faster load times for apps and widgets and more responsive web browsing. The next-generation 10-core GPU architecture brings support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, enabling developers to add remarkable detail to lighting, shadows, and reflections in games like Control.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>With M5, Apple Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on the custom micro-OLED displays compared to the previous generation, resulting in a sharper image with crisper text and more detailed visuals. Vision Pro can also increase the refresh rate up to 120Hz for reduced motion blur when users look at their physical surroundings, and an even smoother experience when using Mac Virtual Display. Vision Pro with M5 works alongside the purpose-built R1 chip, which processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones, and streams new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds to create a real-time view of the world. The high-performance battery now supports up to two and a half hours of general use, and up to three hours of video playback, all on a single charge.<sup>2</sup> And it’s easy to use Vision Pro for longer periods at home, at an office, or while commuting by connecting the battery to power.

                 <div>The 16-core Neural Engine makes AI-powered features run up to 50 percent faster for system experiences — like capturing a Persona or transforming photos into spatial scenes — and up to 2x faster for third-party apps compared to the previous generation.<sup>3</sup> With M5, developers such as JigSpace are pioneering new use cases for enterprises that combine spatial computing with on-device AI. Using Apple’s Foundation Models framework, the new JigSpace app for Vision Pro taps into the on-device model at the core of Apple Intelligence to make complex information easier to understand. Users can parse through complex datasets with natural language and learn about sophisticated objects, like wind turbines, using interactive 3D models.

                 <div><a href="https://www.apple.com/os/visionos/" target="_blank">visionOS 26</a> brings a set of powerful spatial experiences to Apple Vision Pro. Widgets seamlessly integrate into a user’s space and reappear every time they put Vision Pro on, making it easy to check the time or weather, play music or podcasts, decorate their space with photos, or access ChatGPT. Striking enhancements to Persona make communicating in apps like FaceTime feel even more natural and familiar. Spatial scenes, which use generative AI to add lifelike depth to photos, make memories come to life. Users can play back 180-degree, 360-degree, and wide field-of-view video from popular action cameras, so they can enjoy their footage the way it was meant to be seen, and creators can publish videos in these formats to apps like Safari and Vimeo. <span>With iPadOS 26.1, available later this fall, the </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-vision-pro/id6502614761" target="_blank">Apple Vision Pro app</a><span> comes to </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-introduces-the-powerful-new-ipad-pro-with-the-m5-chip/" target="_blank">iPad</a><span>, offering users another great way to discover new content, queue apps and games to download, find tips, and quickly access information about their Vision Pro.</span>

                 <h2><strong>New Apps, Content, and Games to Explore</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>There are over 1 million apps available for Apple Vision Pro, including more than 3,000 apps built for visionOS. Users can design their dream home with HomeByMe and Lowe’s Style Studio, outfit their closet with Balenciaga, and browse stunning artwork with Christie’s Select and Art Authority Museum. They can explore extraordinary locations around the world with Epic Earth and Explore POV, transform their physical space into a planetarium with Space Vision, or travel back in time with D-Day: The Camera Soldier.

                 <div>Apple Vision Pro remains the ultimate entertainment device. With the new Vision Pro, users can experience concerts like never before with Amplium; tune into their favorite teams with apps from major sports leagues; or enjoy a personal theater with apps from popular streaming services on a screen that appears up to 100 feet wide. Apple Immersive continues to redefine what is possible in storytelling, and Vision Pro users can enjoy new series and films on the Apple TV app. Later this season, users in the Lakers’ broadcast territory will be able to watch select live games in Apple Immersive, and <a href="https://nr.apple.com/DE6M6F5Ws2" target="_blank">new titles</a> from the Audi F1 Project, the BBC, HYBE, and Red Bull will launch in Apple Immersive in the coming months.<sup>4</sup> The Apple TV app is also home to one of the largest digital collections of 3D movies available, featuring recent blockbusters like <em>Superman</em>, <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em>, <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, and <em>Wicked</em>.

                 <div>With Apple Vision Pro, users can supercharge their workflows and discover new ways to realize their creative visions. Artists can design new works using apps like Crayon and Da Vinci Eye. Photographers can edit images with color accuracy from any location and in any lighting condition using Pixelmator on <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unveils-new-14-inch-macbook-pro-powered-by-the-m5-chip/" target="_blank">MacBook Pro</a> with Mac Virtual Display. Filmmakers can scout locations from anywhere by viewing spatial media — including panoramas and spatial videos shot on iPhone — on a large wraparound display. And pro users can assemble and rehearse their presentations while in a seat-for-seat replica of the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park using Keynote. With <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HS9U2" target="_blank">Logitech Muse</a> — a digital pencil built for Vision Pro — users can create and collaborate with a new level of precision. Apps like Crayon, doppl by Interaptix, Sketch Pro, and Spatial Analogue are adding support for Muse over the coming weeks.

                 <div>Businesses around the world are harnessing the power of spatial computing on Apple Vision Pro every day to invent new solutions and streamline operations across design, education, healthcare, sales, and more. CAE, the multinational technology company that specializes in simulation and instruction solutions, uses Vision Pro to help pilots complete training activities outside of specialized centers, featuring true-to-life flight deck environments and scenarios. At Porsche, drivers can visualize and personalize new vehicles in select showrooms before taking delivery. And by seamlessly blending digital content with the physical world, Visage provides high-quality, three-dimensional medical imaging, helping hospitals like UC San Diego Health improve patient care.
