<p>What is the rate of return in an economy? It is a simple question, but hard to answer. The rate of return plays a central role in current debates on inequality, secular stagnation, risk premiums, and the decline in the natural rate of interest, to name a few. A main contribution of this article is to introduce a large new data set on the total rates of return for all major asset classes, including housing—the largest but oft-ignored component of household wealth. Our data cover most advanced economies—16 in all—starting in 1870.</p><p>Although housing wealth is on average roughly one-half of national wealth in a typical economy (<span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty 2014), data on total housing returns (price appreciation plus rents) has been lacking (<span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller 2000 provides some historical data on house prices but not on rents). In this article we build on more comprehensive work on house prices (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017) and newly constructed data on rents (<span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll 2017) to enable us to track the total returns of the largest component of the national capital stock.</p><p>We further construct total returns broken down into investment income (yield) and capital gains (price changes) for four major asset classes, two of them typically seen as relatively risky—equities and housing—and two of them typically seen as relatively safe—government bonds and short-term bills. Importantly, we compute actual asset returns taken from market data and therefore construct more detailed series than returns inferred from wealth estimates in discrete benchmark years for a few countries, as in <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014).</p><p>We also follow earlier work in documenting annual equity, bond, and bill returns, but here again we have taken the project further. We recompute all these measures from original sources, improve the links across some important historical market discontinuities (e.g., market closures and other gaps associated with wars and political instability), and in a number of cases we access new and previously unused raw data sources. In all cases, we have also brought in auxiliary sources to validate our data externally, and 100+ pages of online material documents our sources and methods. Our work provides researchers with the first broad noncommercial database of historical equity, bond, and bill returns—and the only database of housing returns—with the most extensive coverage across both countries and years.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn1"></span>1</sup></p><p>This article aims to bridge the gap between two related strands of the academic literature. The first strand is rooted in finance and is concerned with long-run returns on different assets. <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009) probably marked the first comprehensive attempt to document and analyze long-run returns on investment for a broad cross-section of countries. Meanwhile, <span id="jumplink-bib32"></span>Homer and Sylla (2005) pioneered a multidecade project to document the history of interest rates.</p><p>The second related strand of literature is the analysis of comparative national balance sheets over time, as in <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>Goldsmith (1985). More recently, <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) have brought together data from national accounts and other sources tracking the development of national wealth over long time periods. They also calculate rates of return on capital by dividing aggregate capital income in the national accounts by the aggregate value of capital, also from national accounts.</p><p>Our work is both complementary and supplementary to theirs. It is complementary because the asset price perspective and the national accounts approach are ultimately tied together by accounting rules and identities. Using market valuations, we are able to corroborate and improve the estimates of returns on capital that matter for wealth inequality dynamics. Our long-run return data are also supplementary to the work of <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) in the sense that we greatly extend the number of countries for which we can calculate real rates of return back to the late nineteenth century.</p><p>The evidence we gathered can shed light on active research debates reaching from asset pricing to inequality. For example, in one contentious area of research, the accumulation of capital, the expansion of capital’s share in income, and the growth rate of the economy relative to the rate of return on capital all feature centrally in the current debate sparked by <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) on the evolution of wealth, income, and inequality. What do the long-run patterns on the rates of return on different asset classes have to say about these possible drivers of inequality?</p><p>In many financial theories, preferences over current versus future consumption, attitudes toward risk, and covariation with consumption risk all show up in the premiums that the rates of return on risky assets carry over safe assets. Returns on different asset classes and their correlations with consumption sit at the core of the canonical consumption Euler equation that underpins textbook asset pricing theory (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib49"></span>Mehra and Prescott 1985). But tensions remain between theory and data, prompting further explorations of new asset pricing paradigms, including behavioral finance. Our new data add another risky asset class to the mix, housing, and with it come new challenges.</p><p>In another strand of research triggered by the financial crisis, <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers (2014) seeks to revive the secular stagnation hypothesis first advanced in Alvin <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>Hansen’s <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>(1939) AEA presidential address. Demographic trends are pushing the world’s economies into uncharted territory as the relative weight of borrowers and savers is changing, and with it the possibility increases that the interest rate will fall by an insufficient amount to balance saving and investment at full employment. What is the evidence that this is the case?</p><p>Last, in a related problem within the sphere of monetary economics, <span id="jumplink-bib31"></span>Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) show that estimates of the natural rate of interest in several advanced economies have gradually declined over the past four decades and are now near zero. What historical precedents are there for such low real rates that could inform today’s policy makers, investors, and researchers?</p><p>The common thread running through these broad research topics is the notion that the rate of return is central to understanding long-, medium-, and short-run economic fluctuations. But which rate of return? And how do we measure it? For a given scarcity of funding supply, the risky rate is a measure of the profitability of private investment; in contrast, the safe rate plays an important role in benchmarking compensation for risk and is often tied to discussions of monetary policy settings and the notion of the natural rate. Below, we summarize our main findings.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577611" id="137577611" data-legacy-id="sec1-1">I.A. Main Findings</h3>
<p>We present four main findings:</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577613" id="137577613" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-1">1. On Risky Returns, <em>r</em><sup><em>risky</em></sup></h4>
<p>In terms of total returns, residential real estate and equities have shown very similar and high real total gains, on average about 7% a year. Housing outperformed equities before World War II. Since World War II, equities have outperformed housing on average but had much higher volatility and higher synchronicity with the business cycle. The observation that housing returns are similar to equity returns, but much less volatile, is puzzling. Like <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000), we find that long-run capital gains on housing are relatively low, around 1% a year in real terms, and considerably lower than capital gains in the stock market. However, the rental yield component is typically considerably higher and more stable than the dividend yield of equities so that total returns are of comparable magnitude.</p><p>Before World War II, the real returns on housing and equities (and safe assets) followed remarkably similar trajectories. After World War II this was no longer the case, and across countries equities then experienced more frequent and correlated booms and busts. The low covariance of equity and housing returns reveals that there could be significant aggregate diversification gains (i.e., for a representative agent) from holding the two asset classes.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577616" id="137577616" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-2">2. On Safe Returns, <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup></h4>
<p>We find that the real safe asset return (bonds and bills) has been very volatile over the long run, more so than one might expect, and often even more volatile than real risky returns. Each world war was (unsurprisingly) a moment of very low safe rates, well below zero. So was the 1970s stagflation. The peaks in the real safe rate took place at the start of our sample, in the interwar period, and during the mid-1980s fight against inflation. In fact, the long decline observed in the past few decades is reminiscent of the secular decline that took place from 1870 to World War I. Viewed from a long-run perspective, the past decline and current low level of the real safe rate today is not unusual. The puzzle may well be why the safe rate was so high in the mid-1980s rather than why has it declined ever since.</p><p>Safe returns have been low on average in the full sample, falling in the 1%–3% range for most countries and peacetime periods. While this combination of low returns and high volatility has offered a relatively poor risk-return trade-off to investors, the low returns have also eased the pressure on government finances, in particular allowing for a rapid debt reduction in the aftermath of World War II.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577619" id="137577619" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-3">3. On the Risk Premium, <em>r</em><sup><em>risky</em></sup> − <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup></h4>
<p>Over the very long run, the risk premium has been volatile. Our data uncover substantial swings in the risk premium at lower frequencies that sometimes endured for decades and far exceed the amplitudes of business-cycle swings.</p><p>In most peacetime eras, this premium has been stable at about 4%–5%. But risk premiums stayed curiously and persistently high from the 1950s to the 1970s, long after the conclusion of World War II. However, there is no visible long-run trend, and mean reversion appears strong. Interestingly, the bursts of the risk premium in the wartime and interwar years were mostly a phenomenon of collapsing safe returns rather than dramatic spikes in risky returns.</p><p>In fact, the risky return has often been smoother and more stable than the safe return, averaging about 6%–8% across all eras. Recently, with safe returns low and falling, the risk premium has widened due to a parallel but smaller decline in risky returns. But these shifts keep the two rates of return close to their normal historical range. Whether due to shifts in risk aversion or to other phenomena, the fact that safe returns seem to absorb almost all of these adjustments seems like a puzzle in need of further exploration and explanation.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577623" id="137577623" data-legacy-id="sec1-1-4">4. On Returns Minus Growth, <em>r</em><sup><em>wealth</em></sup> − <em>g</em></h4>
<p><span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) argued that if investors’ return to wealth exceeded the rate of economic growth, rentiers would accumulate wealth at a faster rate and thus worsen wealth inequality. Using a measure of portfolio returns to compute “<em>r</em> minus <em>g</em>” in Piketty’s notation, we uncover an important finding. Even calculated from more granular asset price returns data, the same fact reported in <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) holds true for more countries, more years, and more dramatically: namely, <em>r</em> ≫ <em>g</em>.</p><p>In fact, the only exceptions to that rule happen in the years in or around wartime. In peacetime, <em>r</em> has always been much greater than <em>g</em>. In the pre-World War II period, this gap was on average 5% (excluding World War I). As of today, this gap is still quite large, about 3%–4%, though it narrowed to 2% in the 1970s before widening in the years leading up to the global financial crisis.</p><p>One puzzle that emerges from our analysis is that while <em>r</em> minus <em>g</em> fluctuates over time, it does not seem to do so systematically with the growth rate of the economy. This feature of the data poses a conundrum for the battling views of factor income, distribution, and substitution in the ongoing debate (<span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie 2015). The fact that returns to wealth have remained fairly high and stable while aggregate wealth increased rapidly since the 1970s suggests that capital accumulation may have contributed to the decline in the labor share of income over the recent decades (<span id="jumplink-bib39"></span>Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). In thinking about inequality and several other characteristics of modern economies, the new data on the return to capital that we present here should spur further research.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577627" id="137577627" data-legacy-id="sec2">II. A New Historical Global Returns Database</h2>
<p>In this section, we discuss the main sources and definitions for the calculation of long-run returns. A major innovation is the inclusion of housing. Residential real estate is the main asset in most household portfolios, as we shall see, but so far very little has been known about long-run returns on housing. Our data on housing returns cover capital gains and imputed rents to owners and renters, the sum of the two being total returns.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn2"></span>2</sup> Equity return data for publicly traded equities are used, as is standard, as a proxy for aggregate business equity returns.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn3"></span>3</sup></p><p>The data include nominal and real returns on bills, bonds, equities, and residential real estate for Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The sample spans 1870 to 2015. <span id="jumplink-tblI"></span>Table I summarizes the data coverage by country and asset class.</p>                    <div content-id="tblI"><div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

<p>The canonical risk-free rate is taken to be the yield on Treasury bills, that is, short-term, fixed-income government securities. The yield data come from the latest vintage of the long-run macrohistory database (<span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2017).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn8"></span>8</sup> Whenever data on Treasury bill returns were unavailable, we relied on either money market rates or deposit rates of banks from <span id="jumplink-bib72"></span>Zimmermann (2017). Because short-term government debt was rarely used and issued in the earlier historical period, much of our bill rate data before the 1960s actually consist of deposit rates.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn9"></span>9</sup></p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577641" id="137577641" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-2">2. Bond Returns</h4>
<p>These are conventionally the total returns on long-term government bonds. Unlike earlier cross-country studies, we focus on the bonds listed and traded on local exchanges and denominated in local currency. This focus makes bond returns more comparable with the returns of bills, equities, and housing. Moreover, this results in a larger sample of bonds, and on bonds that are more likely to be held by the representative household in the respective country. For some countries and periods we have made use of listings on major global exchanges to fill gaps where domestic markets were thin or local exchange data were not available (for example, Australian bonds listed in New York or London). Throughout the sample we target a maturity of around 10 years. For the second half of the twentieth century, the maturity of government bonds is generally accurately defined. For the pre-World War II period we sometimes had to rely on data for perpetuals, that is, very long-term government securities (such as the British consol). Although as a convention we refer here to government bills and bonds as “safe” assets, both are naturally exposed to inflation and default risk, for example. In fact, real returns on these assets fluctuate substantially over time, as we shall see (specifically, Sections <span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">V</a> and <span id="jumplink-sec6"></span><a href="#sec6">VI</a>).</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577643" id="137577643" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-3">3. Equity Returns</h4>
<p>These returns come from a broad range of sources, including articles in economic and financial history journals, yearbooks of statistical offices and central banks, stock exchange listings, newspapers, and company reports. Throughout most of the sample, we aim to rely on indices weighted by market capitalization of individual stocks and a stock selection that is representative of the entire stock market. For some historical time periods in individual countries, however, we also make use of indices weighted by company book capital, by stock market transactions, or weighted equally due to limited data availability.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577645" id="137577645" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-4">4. Housing Returns</h4>
<p>We combine the long-run house price series introduced by <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) with a novel data set on rents drawn from the PhD thesis of <span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll (2017). For most countries, the rent series rely on the rent components of the cost of living of consumer price indices constructed by national statistical offices. We then combine them with information from other sources to create long-run series reaching back to the late nineteenth century. To proxy the total return on the residential housing stock, our returns include both rented housing and owner-occupied properties.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn10"></span>10</sup> Specifically, wherever possible we use house price and rental indices that include the prices of owner-occupied properties and the imputed rents on these houses. Imputed rents estimate the rent that an owner-occupied house would earn on the rental market, typically by using rents of similar houses that are rented. This means that, in principle, imputed rents are similar to market rents and are simply adjusted for the portfolio composition of owner-occupied as opposed to rented housing. Imputed rents, however, are not directly observed and hence are less precisely measured than market rents, and are typically not taxed.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn11"></span>11</sup> To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to calculate total returns to housing in the literature for as long and as comprehensive a cross section of economies as we report.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577647" id="137577647" data-legacy-id="sec2-2-5">5. Composite Returns</h4>
<p>We compute the rate of return on safe assets, risky assets, and aggregate wealth, as weighted averages of the individual asset returns. To obtain a representative return from the investor’s perspective, we use the outstanding stocks of the respective asset in a given country as weights. To this end, we make use of new data on equity market capitalization (from <span id="jumplink-bib44"></span>Kuvshinov and Zimmermann 2018) and housing wealth for each country and period in our sample and combine them with existing estimates of public debt stocks to obtain the weights for the individual assets.

<div><p>The total annual return on any financial asset can be divided into two components: the capital gain from the change in the asset price <em>P</em>, and a yield component <em>Y</em>, that reflects the cash-flow return on an investment.

We construct estimates for total returns on housing using the rent-price approach. This approach starts from a benchmark rent-price ratio <span>|$(\frac{RI_0}{HPI_0})$|</span> estimated in a baseline year (<em>t</em> = 0). For this ratio we rely on net rental yields from the Investment Property Database (IPD).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn13"></span>13</sup> We can then construct a time series of returns by combining separate information from a country-specific house price index series <span>|$(\frac{HPI_t}{HPI_0})$|</span> and a country-specific rent index series <span>|$(\frac{RI_t}{RI_0})$|⁠</span>. For these indices, we rely on prior work on housing prices (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017) and new data on rents (<span id="jumplink-bib40"></span>Knoll 2017). This method assumes that the indices cover a representative portfolio of houses. Under this assumption, there is no need to correct for changes in the housing stock, and only information about the growth rates in prices and rents is necessary.</p><div><p>Hence, a time series of the rent-price ratio can be derived from forward and back projection as </p><div><div id="equ10" content-id="equ10"><p> \begin{equation}
\frac{RI_{t}}{HPI_{t}} = \left[ \left(\frac{RI_{t}}{RI_0} \right) \left(\frac{HPI_0}{HPI_{t}}\right) \right] \frac{RI_0}{HPI_0} \, .
\end{equation} </p></div><p><span>(10)</span></p></div><p>In a second step, total returns on housing can then be computed as yield plus capital gains: </p><div><div id="equ11" content-id="equ11"><p> \begin{equation}
R^{housing}_{t+1}=\frac{RI_{t+1}}{HPI_t}+\frac{HPI_{t+1}-HPI_{t}}{HPI_t} \, .
\end{equation} </p></div><p><span>(11)</span></p></div></div><div><p>Our rent-price approach is sensitive to the choice of benchmark rent-price ratios and cumulative errors from year-by-year extrapolation. We verify and adjust rent-price approach estimates using a range of alternative sources. The main source for comparison is the balance sheet approach to rental yields, which calculates the rent-price ratio using national accounts data on total rental income and housing wealth. The “balance sheet” rental yield <span>|$RY^{BS}_t$|</span> is calculated as the ratio of total net rental income to total housing wealth: </p><div><div id="equ12" content-id="equ12"><p> \begin{equation}
RY^{BS}_t = \frac{\text{Net rental income}_t}{\text{Housing Wealth}_t}.
\end{equation} </p></div><p><span>(12)</span></p></div><p>This balance sheet rental yield estimate can then be added to the capital gains series to compute the total return on housing from the balance sheet perspective. We also collect additional point-in-time estimates of net rental yields from contemporary sources, such as newspaper advertisements. These measures are less sensitive to the accumulated extrapolation errors in <span id="jumplink-equ10"></span><a href="#equ10">equation (10)</a> but are themselves measured relatively imprecisely.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn14"></span>14</sup> Wherever the rent-price approach estimates diverge from these historical sources, we make adjustments to benchmark the rent-price ratio estimates to these alternative historical measures of the rental yield. We construct two additional housing return series—one benchmarked to all available alternative yield estimates, and another using primarily the balance sheet approach. The results of this exercise are discussed in <span id="jumplink-sec3-3"></span><a href="#sec3-3">Section III.C</a>. Briefly, all the alternative estimates are close to one another, and the differences have little bearing on any of our results.</p></div>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577663" id="137577663" data-legacy-id="sec3">III.

<p>Our headline summary data appear in <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table II and <span id="jumplink-fig2"></span>Figure II. The top panel of <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table II shows the full sample (1870–2015) results, and the bottom panel shows results for the post-1950 sample. Note that here, and throughout the article, rates of return are always annualized. Units are always expressed in percent per year, for raw data and for means and standard deviations. All means are arithmetic means, except when specifically referred to as geometric means.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn15"></span>15</sup> Data are pooled and equally weighted, that is, they are raw rather than portfolio returns. We always include wars so that results are not polluted by bias from omitted disasters. We do, however, exclude hyperinflation years (but only a few) to focus on the underlying trends in returns and to avoid biases from serious measurement errors in hyperinflation years, arising from the impossible retrospective task of matching within-year timing of asset and CPI price level readings, which can create a spurious, massive under- or overstatement of returns in these episodes.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn16"></span>16</sup></p>                    <div data-id="fig2" data-content-id="fig2" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig2.jpeg?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=A-tkdsJV1rhWFkMiqcJynm3qD-qawWc-tlq3dK48l2z345Jd3OUA0lOCzmznvkinKkoOUH6MymMdifRMoI8IIAhC8JqfuLUkCa~m9O~yMiKmLWzxUs37f5GqX~7R5zr-YhsWA0HSKB47dvBGOYPtH53gn7qWwxA1QuilODRu1LKPJW8h~M54AyZSuFh6fludS7x-MMflJdoPz8xxXlQUFvAQobusGmZx9IJU7nDXAI5NQx~JAG~5KzuYitXUfSLXzQnV4dCq74wlx3fxaSfquRz1Z9fgbj6xBzhlmy2mObim-ehrMD2oOBora9NGxRGysS7irF02N5DXw-SCd4YDgA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Global Real Rates of Return" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure II</p><div><p>Global Real Rates of Return</p><p>Color version available online.

Although returns on housing and equities are similar, the volatility of housing returns is substantially lower, as <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table II shows. Returns on the two asset classes are in the same ballpark—around 7%—but the standard deviation of housing returns is substantially smaller than that of equities (10% for housing versus 22% for equities). Predictably, with thinner tails, the compounded return (using the geometric average) is vastly better for housing than for equities—6.6% for housing versus 4.7% for equities. This finding appears to contradict one of the basic tenets of modern valuation models: higher risks should come with higher rewards.</p><p>Differences in asset returns are not driven by unusual events in the early pre-World War II part of the sample. <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table II, Panel B makes this point. Compared to the full sample results in the top panel, the same clear pattern emerges: stocks and real estate dominate in terms of returns. Moreover, average returns post–1950 are similar to those for the full sample even though the postwar subperiod excludes the devastating effects of the two world wars.

Comparison To Existing Literature</h3>
<p>Earlier work on asset returns has mainly focused on equities and the corresponding risk premium over safe assets (bills or bonds), starting with Shiller’s analysis of historical U.S. data (<span id="jumplink-bib64"></span>Shiller 1981), later extended to cover post-1920 Sweden and the United Kingdom (<span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell 1999), and other advanced economies back to 1900 (<span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton 2009) or back to 1870 (<span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa 2008). The general consensus in this literature is that equities earn a large premium over safe assets. The cross-country estimates of this premium vary between 7% in <span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa (2008) and 6% in <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009) using arithmetic means. <span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell (1999) documents a 4.7% geometric mean return premium instead.</p><p>We find a similarly high, though smaller, equity premium using our somewhat larger and more consistent historical data set. Our estimate of the risk premium stands at 5.9% using arithmetic means and 3.8% using geometric means (see <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table II). This is lower than the estimates by <span id="jumplink-bib11"></span>Campbell (1999) and <span id="jumplink-bib6"></span>Barro and Ursúa (2008). The average risk premium is similar to that found by <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2009), but our returns tend to be slightly lower for the overlapping time period.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn17"></span>17</sup> Details aside, our data confirm the central finding of the literature on equity market returns: stocks earn a large premium over safe assets.</p><p>Studies on historical housing returns, starting with the seminal work of Robert Shiller (see <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller 2000 for a summary), have largely focused on capital gains. The rental yield component has received relatively little attention and in many cases is missing entirely. Most of the literature pre-dating our work has therefore lacked the necessary data to calculate, infer, or discuss the total rates of return on housing over the long run. The few studies that take rents into account generally focus on the post-1970s U.S. sample and often on commercial real estate. Most existing evidence either places the real estate risk premium between equities and bonds or finds that it is similar to that for equities (see <span id="jumplink-bib63"></span>Ruff 2007; <span id="jumplink-bib23"></span>Francis and Ibbotson 2009; <span id="jumplink-bib33"></span>Ilmanen 2011; <span id="jumplink-bib20"></span>Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh 2017). Some studies have even found that over the recent period, real estate seems to outperform equities in risk-adjusted terms (<span id="jumplink-bib66"></span>Shilling 2003; <span id="jumplink-bib12"></span>Cheng, Lin, and Liu 2008).</p><p>The stylized fact from the studies on long-run housing capital appreciation is that over long horizons, house prices only grow a little faster than the consumer price index. But again, note that this is only the capital gain component in <span id="jumplink-equ1"></span><a href="#equ1">equation (1)</a>. Low levels of real capital gains to housing was shown by <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000) for the United States, and is also true, although to a lesser extent, in other countries, as documented in <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017). Our long-run average capital appreciation data for the United States largely come from <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000), with two exceptions. For the 1930s, we use the more representative index of <span id="jumplink-bib21"></span>Fishback and Kollmann (2015) that documents a larger fall in prices during the Great Depression. From 1975 onward, we use a Federal Housing Finance Agency index, which has a slightly broader coverage. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> M compares our series with Shiller’s data and finds that switching to Shiller’s index has no effect on our results for the United States.

Prior to our work on historical rental yields, this finding could not be known. Coincidentally, in our long-run data we find that most of the real equity return also comes from the dividend yield rather than from real equity capital gains, which are low, especially before the 1980s. Thus the post-1980 observation of large capital gain components in equity and housing total returns is completely unrepresentative of the normal long-run patterns in the data, another fact underappreciated before now.</p><p>Data on historical returns for all major asset classes allow us to compute the return on aggregate wealth (see <span id="jumplink-equ7"></span><a href="#equ7">equation (7)</a>). In turn, this return can be decomposed into various components by asset class, and into capital gains and yields, to better understand the drivers of aggregate wealth fluctuations. This connects our study to the literature on capital income and the stock of capital (or wealth) from a national accounts perspective. Even though national accounts and national balance sheet estimates have existed for some time (see <span id="jumplink-bib45"></span>Kuznets 1941; <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>Goldsmith 1985), only recently have scholars systematized and compared these data to calculate a series of returns on national wealth.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn18"></span>18</sup></p><p><span id="jumplink-bib57"></span>Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018) compute balance sheet returns on aggregate wealth and for individual asset classes using post-1913 U.S. data.

Part of this difference reflects the fact that balance sheet returns are computed to measure income before corporate taxes, whereas our returns take the household perspective and are therefore net of corporate tax. Another explanation for the difference is likely to come from some measurement error in the national accounts data.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn19"></span>19</sup> When it comes to housing, our rental yield estimates are broadly comparable and similar to those derived using the balance sheet approach, for a broad selection of countries and historical time spans.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn20"></span>20</sup></p><p>Our data set complements the market-based return literature by increasing the coverage in terms of assets, return components, countries, and years; improving data consistency and documentation; and making the data set freely available for future research.

Accuracy of Equity Returns</h3>
<p>The literature on equity returns has highlighted two main sources of bias in the data: weighting and sample selection. Weighting biases arise when the stock portfolio weights for the index do not correspond with those of a representative investor or a representative agent in the economy. Selection biases arise when the selection of stocks does not correspond to the portfolio of the representative investor or agent. This second category also includes issues of survivorship bias and missing data bias arising from stock exchange closures and restrictions.</p><p>We consider how these biases affect our equity return estimates in this section.

Weighting Bias</h4>
<p>The best practice when weighting equity indices is to use market capitalization of individual stocks. This approach most closely mirrors the composition of a hypothetical representative investor’s portfolio. Equally-weighted indices are likely to overweight smaller firms, which tend to carry higher returns and higher volatility.</p><p>The existing evidence from historical returns on the Brussels and Paris stock exchanges suggests that using equally-weighted indices biases returns up by around 0.5 percentage points, and their standard deviation up by 2–3 percentage points (<span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010; <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>Annaert et al. 2011). The size of the bias, however, is likely to vary across markets and time periods. For example, <span id="jumplink-bib29"></span>Grossman (2017) shows that the market-weighted portfolio of UK stocks outperformed its equally-weighted counterpart over the period 1869–1929.</p><p>To minimize this bias, we use market-capitalization-weighted indices for the vast majority of our sample (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table A.29 and <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> X). Where market capitalization weighting was not available, we have generally used alternative weights such as book capital or transaction volumes, rather than equally-weighted averages. For the few equally-weighted indices that remain in our sample, the overall impact on aggregate return estimates ought to be negligible.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577690" id="137577690" data-legacy-id="sec3-2-2">2. Selection and Survivorship Bias</h4>
<p>Relying on an index whose selection does not mirror the representative investor’s portfolio carries two main dangers. First, a small sample may be unrepresentative of overall stock market returns. Second, a sample that is selected ad hoc, and especially ex post, is likely to focus on surviving firms, or successful firms, thus overstating investment returns. This second bias extends not only to stock prices but also to dividend payments, as some historical studies only consider dividend-paying firms.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn21"></span>21</sup> The magnitude of survivorship bias has generally been found to be around 0.5 to 1 percentage point (<span id="jumplink-bib53"></span>Nielsen and Risager 2001; <span id="jumplink-bib3"></span>Annaert, Buelens, and De Ceuster 2012), but in some time periods and markets it could be larger (see <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010 for France).</p><p>As a first best, we always strive to use all-share indices that avoid survivor and selection biases. For some countries and time periods where no such indices were previously available, we have constructed new weighted all-share indices from original historical sources (e.g., early historical data for Norway and Spain). Where an all-share index was not available or newly constructed, we have generally relied on blue-chip stock market indices. These are based on an ex ante value-weighted sample of the largest firms on the market. It is updated each year and tends to capture the lion’s share of total market capitalization. Because the sample is selected ex ante, it avoids ex post selection and survivorship biases. Because historical equity markets have tended to be quite concentrated, blue-chip indices have been shown to be a good proxy for all-share returns (see <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>Annaert et al. 2011). Finally, we include non-dividend-paying firms in the dividend yield calculation.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577693" id="137577693" data-legacy-id="sec3-2-3">3. Stock Market Closures and Trading Restrictions</h4>
<p>A more subtle form of selection bias arises when the stock market is closed and no market price data are available. One way of dealing with closures is to simply exclude them from the baseline return comparisons. But this implicitly assumes that the data are “missing at random”—that is, that stock market closures are unrelated to underlying equity returns. Existing research on rare disasters and equity premiums shows that this is unlikely to be true (<span id="jumplink-bib52"></span>Nakamura et al. 2013). Stock markets tend to be closed precisely when we would expect returns to be low, such as periods of war and civil unrest. Return estimates that exclude such rare disasters from the data will thus overstate stock returns.</p><p>To guard against this bias, we include return estimates for the periods of stock market closure in our sample. Where possible, we rely on alternative data sources to fill the gap, such as listings of other exchanges and over-the-counter transactions—for example, in the case of World War I Germany we use the over-the-counter index from <span id="jumplink-bib62"></span>Ronge (2002) and for World War II France we use the newspaper index from <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur (2010).

(2013) also highlight a more subtle bias arising from asset price controls. This generally involves measures by the government to directly control transaction prices, as in Germany during 1943–47, or to influence the funds invested in the domestic stock market (and hence the prices) via controls on spending and investment, as in France during World War II (<span id="jumplink-bib46"></span>Le Bris 2012). These measures are more likely to affect the timing of returns rather than their long-run average level and should have little impact on our headline estimates. For example, Germany experienced negative nominal and real returns despite the World War II stock price controls; and even though the policies it enacted in occupied France succeeded in generating high nominal stock returns, the real return on French stocks during 1940–44 was close to zero. Both instances were followed by sharp drops in stock prices when the controls were lifted.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn23"></span>23</sup></p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577702" id="137577702" data-legacy-id="sec3-3">III.C. Accuracy of Housing Returns</h3>
<p>The biases that affect equity returns—weighting and selection—can also apply to returns on housing. There are also other biases that are specific to housing return estimates. These include costs of running a housing investment and the benchmarking of rent-price ratios to construct the historical rental yield series. We discuss these problematic issues in this section. Our focus is mainly on rental yield data, as the accuracy and robustness of the house price series has been extensively discussed in <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) in their <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159455&amp;Signature=TzSlNdhKgqBoNIO0PrCITV0wbOIpt3YVfG~DD8WSXzDEa9ePp1ABHhyt8W1rzGcVgD1H-7H1XSGY~MyPibs7JggiC3p6GSYD2hM37L-Ejkrbbikmgmh1abAdnZycrBer1RKSqhugcR-gF5SuijD9he3smc-~TU7RhdGHrke09JT4TIPduYgM2yaCz~ZSMDSSy-EMA7V~Vo6pAPtGQRNrXz5Y7Pu7aaYh9wRrBnY067yfDTe6gaoYsKN0Yesbq2Aral1blEKnzeF2GfzaX7toBdauzszS0TJSA3d2auLB0oSByw5rz8LukDQk6gVE~g0EH6Vb2L5u85RCH9mp2994Mw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">online appendix</a></span>.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577704" id="137577704" data-legacy-id="sec3-3-1">1. Maintenance Costs</h4>
<p>Any homeowner incurs costs for maintenance and repairs, which lower the rental yield and thus the effective return on housing. We deal with this issue by the choice of the benchmark rent-price ratios. Specifically, we anchor to the Investment Property Database (IPD), whose rental yields reflect net income—net of property management costs, ground rent, and other unrecoverable expenditure—as a percentage of the capital employed. The rental yields calculated using the rent-price approach detailed in <span id="jumplink-sec2-4"></span><a href="#sec2-4">Section II.D</a> are therefore net yields. To enable a like-for-like comparison, our historical benchmark yields are calculated net of estimated running costs and depreciation. Running costs are broadly defined as housing-related expenses excluding interest, taxes, and utilities—that is, maintenance costs, management, and insurance fees.</p><p>Applying the rent-price approach to net yield benchmarks assumes that running costs remain stable relative to gross rental income over time within each country. To check this, <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>Figure III presents historical estimates of running costs and depreciation for Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, calculated as the sum of the corresponding housing expenditures and fixed capital consumption items in the national accounts. The left panel presents these as a proportion of total housing value and the right panel as a proportion of gross rent. Relative to housing value, costs have been stable over the past 40 years, but were somewhat higher in the early to mid-twentieth century. This is to be expected because these costs are largely related to structures, not land, and structures constituted a greater share of housing value in the early twentieth century (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017). In addition, structures themselves may have been of poorer quality in past times. When taken as a proportion of gross rent, however, as shown in the right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>Figure III, housing costs have been relatively stable, or at least not higher historically than they are today. This is likely because gross yields and costs are low today, whereas historically yields and costs were higher, with the two effects more or less canceling out. This suggests that the historical rental yields that we have calculated using the rent-price approach are a good proxy for net yields.</p>                    <div data-id="fig3" data-content-id="fig3" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig3.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=2OC-W8qbi8jIaFHvjHqrn6QqiXb0zdeKqgy70WavFwQMQlaGszOOqvJar7UuUxoIzS7KFMeLXcn-byteTE5D53qgDTy4lXpThn-lcysh-nxKVply02myNqDvBVP~02C3AUQ3HqGtnjjnpzKM1~dSLQu4T1GtBZk9LDhhHdG2VObq6UMo4Own0toJabhb9jKewzmat4SFg97SmSt3wPglRq~jpTSaO2PZrmlQ-Y4VvVCFKOWiwZc2fdRpV0p0gHRqK1IFGiTvOUFlro30v6mHuAQB75iRy-4nkJZUTP7z8lDaiOIluTnzDwN-OAQDYdYYKS0BlA07cF0g6QWkfPNOKg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Costs of Running a Housing Investment" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure III</p><div><p>Costs of Running a Housing Investment</p><p>Color version available online.

Rental Yield Benchmarking</h4>
<p>To construct historical rental yield series using the rent-price approach, we start with a benchmark rent-price ratio from the IPD and extend the series back using the historical rent and house price indices (see <span id="jumplink-sec2-4"></span><a href="#sec2-4">Section II.D</a>).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn24"></span>24</sup> This naturally implies that the level of returns is sensitive to the choice of the benchmark ratio. Moreover, past errors in rent and house price indices can potentially accumulate over time and may cause one to substantially over- or understate historical rental yields and housing returns. If the historical capital gains are overstated, the historical rental yields will be overstated, too.</p><p>To try to avert such problems, we corroborate our rental yield estimates using a wide range of alternative historical and current-day sources. The main source of these independent comparisons comes from estimates using the balance sheet approach and national accounts data. As shown in <span id="jumplink-equ12"></span><a href="#equ12">equation (12)</a>, the “balance sheet” rental yield is the ratio of nationwide net rental income to total housing wealth. Net rental income is computed as gross rents paid less depreciation, maintenance, and other housing-related expenses (excluding taxes and interest), with all data taken from the national accounts. The balance sheet approach gives us a rich set of alternative rental yield estimates both for the present day and even going back in time to the beginning of our sample in a number of countries. The second source for historical comparisons comes from advertisements in contemporary newspapers and various other contemporary publications. Third, we also make use of alternative current-day benchmarks based on transaction-level market rent data, and the rental expenditure and house price data from <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo.com</a>.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn25"></span>25</sup> For all these measures, we adjust gross yields down to obtain a proxy for net rental yields.</p><p>Historical sources offer point-in-time estimates that avoid the cumulation of errors but can nevertheless be imprecise. The balance sheet approach relies on housing wealth and rental income data, both of which are subject to potential measurement error. For housing wealth, it is inherently difficult to measure the precise value of all dwellings in the economy. Rental income is largely driven by the imputed rents of homeowners, which have to be estimated from market rents by matching the market rent to owner-occupied properties based on various property characteristics. This procedure can suffer from errors in the survey data on property characteristics and market rents, and the matching algorithm.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn26"></span>26</sup> Newspaper advertisements are tied to a specific location and are often biased toward cities. And transaction-level or survey data sometimes only cover the rental sector, rather than both renters and homeowners.</p><p>Given the potential measurement error in all the series, our final rental yield series uses data from both the rent-price approach and the alternative benchmarks listed above. More precisely, we use the following method to construct our final “best-practice” rental yield series. If the rent-price approach estimates are close to alternative measures, we keep the rent-price approach data. This is the case for most historical periods in our sample. If there is a persistent level difference between the rent-price approach and alternative estimates, we adjust the benchmark yield to better match the historical and current data across the range of sources. This is the case for Australia and Belgium. If the levels are close for recent data but diverge historically, we adjust the historical estimates to match the alternative benchmarks. For most countries, such adjustments are small or only apply to a short time span, but for Finland and Spain they are more substantial. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> U details the alternative sources and rental yield construction, including any such adjustments, for each country.</p><p>How large is the room for error in our final housing return series?

Even under the more stringent checks, housing returns remain within a percentage point of our baseline estimates. The average return is always similar to equities in arithmetic mean terms and always above equities when using the geometric mean.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577723" id="137577723" data-legacy-id="sec3-3-3">3. Geographic Coverage and Selection Biases</h4>
<p>Our data aim to approximate the return on a representative agent’s housing portfolio. Selection bias means that the selection of properties in our data set does not mirror the balance sheet of the representative agent. The main reason for this bias is selective geographical coverage. Housing returns can vary a lot by location, and our data are based on a sample of housing transactions.</p><p>To make our samples as representative as possible, we strive to attain a broad geographic coverage for both house price and rental data. <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) discuss the potential location biases in house price data but find that the house price trends in their, and hence our, data set should be representative of country-level trends. When it comes to rents, the benchmark IPD yields are based on portfolios of institutional investors, which are slightly biased toward cities. This would lead to lower yields than the national average. On the other hand, investors may select higher-yielding properties within any given city. Comparisons with aggregate balance sheet approach data and alternative estimates indicate that, on average, IPD yields tend to be representative at country level. Furthermore, IPD yields are capitalization weighted, which again better captures the yield on a representative portfolio. Finally, we aim for national coverage with the historical rental indices used for extrapolation and historical balance sheet benchmarks.</p><p>Despite this, our house price and rental data are likely somewhat biased toward cities and urban areas, especially for historical periods—simply because urban housing data are more widely available and researched. Even though this would affect the level of capital gain and yield, it should have little influence on total returns, since cities tend to have higher capital gains but lower rental yields.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn33"></span>33</sup> In addition, <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that the rural-urban divide has a relatively small impact on capital gains. Relatedly, we can establish some bounds on how much our rental yields can vary with the choice of location. In 2013, <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo.com</a> data suggest that price-rent ratios in and out of city centers differ by less than three times annual rent. The rental yield is the inverse of these price-rent ratios. This motivates us to construct a lower-bound rent-price ratio as <span>|$RP_{low}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{RP_{actual}}+3}$|</span> and an upper-bound rent-price ratio as <span>|$RP_{high}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{RP_{actual}}-3}$|</span> for each country in 2013 to estimate upper and lower bounds of our housing returns depending on the choice of location. Given the currently high price-rent ratios, these adjustments have a relatively small impact on our data. <span id="jumplink-fig5"></span>Figure V shows that increasing or reducing the price-rent ratio by three changes annual return estimates by about ±1 percentage point a year relative to our preferred baseline.</p>                    <div data-id="fig5" data-content-id="fig5" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig5.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=USEZiaKFFSidl0pCycPu~x7vhK2fR7XR-xWB8CGe49tbTLKnjxfINdHBo5uMRb6jNFliFmB2-Nkflp1q-UVcerXsIOLaNPLP1XJppzRJydYsv9GuWMJqGrtW2pW5~woS1ZpC7FaR~hBf6IrWUMDI6Gx8somgovgkLwBot31xWAfSyCerL9~045wLoU2H3l~Er~5ziDo5xfHUEZXKaNvSGdK4Pmks9aPus4eHlhfhH3xx0G3lL0g011iEGINPIMNlZ1SqKuvnzhiDxn78qxKlhODEJvHjEiA-5inViYYiduJ2baPu7i9R7TtOV4n9JexRUoWCfqYYv8yaG4HxlA6sUQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Sensitivity of Housing Returns to a Rent-Price Location Correction" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure V</p><div><p>Sensitivity of Housing Returns to a Rent-Price Location Correction</p><p>Bars show the arithmetic- and geometric-average housing returns for selected subperiods.

Still, it could be that returns on locations not included in our sample display higher volatility.

The standard deviation of ZIP code–level housing returns is roughly one-third higher than that in the national data. If investors owned one undiversified house whose price tracks the neighborhood index, the risk and return characteristics of this portfolio would be somewhat closer to those of the aggregate equity index, although the gap would still be large.</p><p>Of course, it is much more difficult to invest in a diversified housing portfolio than a well diversified equity portfolio. That being said, <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) show that most equity is also held in an undiversified manner. The data regarding returns on individual housing and private equity returns are, however, very sparse at this point in time. To understand exactly how these risk-return characteristics play out at a disaggregated level, a more detailed study of individual portfolios and returns is necessary. This would be a worthy goal of future research.</p><p>Another selection bias comes about from the fact that rent data largely come from the rental market, whereas the majority of housing stock is held by owner-occupiers. To guard against this, we rely on rental indices that, whenever possible, account for the growth of imputed rents. We also benchmark our series to the balance sheet yield data constructed to cover the total housing stock. Still, imputed rents are measured with error and may not reflect the cost that the homeowner would pay on the rental market. If owning is relatively cheaper than renting—for example, due to tax exemptions or long-run house price appreciation—homeowners would purchase larger or better houses than they would rent, and imputed rents would overstate the value of housing services accruing to homeowners. On the other hand, buying a house is subject to credit constraints, which means that renters can afford better houses than homeowners, all else equal. In this case, imputed rents would understate the flow value of housing services. Overall, the direction of any potential bias is unclear and leaves much scope for future work.</p><p>Finally, the portfolio selection in the price and rent series is subject to survivorship bias. In general, our price and rental yield estimates aim to capture transaction or appraisal values, and rental costs on a broad and impartially selected portfolio of properties. Some survivorship bias may enter the series for the following reasons. First, indices that rely on an ex post selection of cities may inadvertently choose the more “successful” cities over the less successful ones. Second, houses that decline in value are likely to lose liquidity and be sold less frequently, hence carrying a lower weight in the index. Third, chain-linking historical house price and rent indices to compute annual returns will generally ignore the impact of large destructions of the housing stock, particularly those occurring during wartime.</p><p>Several factors suggest that the impact of survivorship bias on housing returns should be limited. First, <span id="jumplink-fig5"></span>Figure V and <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that any location-specific bias in our estimates is likely to be small. Second, if the magnitude of survivorship bias is similar to that in equity markets (<span id="jumplink-sec3-2"></span><a href="#sec3-2">Section III.B</a>), the bias is also unlikely to be large. Third, the low liquidity and weight of houses with declining prices is in some ways similar to the documented negative returns on delisted equities (<span id="jumplink-bib67"></span>Shumway 1997; <span id="jumplink-bib68"></span>Shumway and Warther 1999) which, generally, cannot be incorporated into the stock return series due to the lack of data. Therefore this bias should be less of a concern when comparing housing and equity returns. Finally, similarly to the stock market closures discussed in <span id="jumplink-sec3-2"></span><a href="#sec3-2">Section III.B</a>, even though capital stock destruction during wars can have a substantial impact on returns in specific years, it is unlikely to profoundly affect cross-country long-run returns due to the rarity of such events.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn35"></span>35</sup> As <span id="jumplink-fig9"></span>Figure IX shows later, the main facts in the data are similar for countries that experienced major war destruction on their own territory versus countries that did not (e.g., Australia, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States). <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table A.5 shows that housing offers a similar return relative to equity on average even after wars are excluded.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577750" id="137577750" data-legacy-id="sec3-3-4">4. Returns on Real Estate Investment Trusts</h4>
<p>Another way to check our housing returns is to compare them to the historical returns on housing investment trusts. These trusts offer independent estimates of returns. Real estate investment trusts (REITs), are investment funds that specialize in the purchase and management of residential and commercial real estate. Many of these funds list their shares on the local stock exchange. The return on these shares should closely track total real estate returns. Differences will arise because the REIT portfolio is more geographically concentrated, its assets often contain nonresidential property, and share price fluctuations may reflect expectations of future earnings and sentiment, as well as underlying portfolio returns. Furthermore, the REIT portfolio returns should be net of taxes and transaction costs as well as housing running costs, and may thus be somewhat lower than our housing series. Still, returns on the REIT portfolio should be comparable to housing and can be used to check the general plausibility of our return series.</p><p><span id="jumplink-fig6"></span>Figure VI compares our historical housing returns (dashed line) with those on investments in REITs (solid line) in France and the United States, two countries for which longer-run REIT return data are available. The REIT returns series for France refers to shares of the fund La Fourmi Immobilière (see <span id="jumplink-bib69"></span>Simonnet, Gallais-Hamonno, and Arbulu 1998). The fund acquired a portfolio of 15 properties in Paris between 1900 and 1913, worth around €36 million at 2015 prices, and its shares were listed on the Paris stock exchange between 1904 and 1997. We exclude the period after 1985, when La Fourmi Immobilière was taken over by AGF. For the United States, we use the FTSE NAREIT residential total return index after 1994, and the general FTSE equity NAREIT before. REIT returns have to be unlevered to capture the returns on the REIT housing portfolio. La Fourmi Immobilière had an unlevered balance sheet structure, hence we do not adjust their returns. We assume a REIT leverage of 45% for the United States following <span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>Giacomini, Ling, and Naranjo (2015). Returns for France are presented as decadal moving averages, and for the United States as five-year moving averages, given the shorter span of the U.S. data.</p>                    <div data-id="fig6" data-content-id="fig6" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig6.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=Nf7QbckYLxsaiSVaf~PHHArYoIPwEPoEb4dbMPkDt0kRwfLuI-4FSEBX-FEZRT30WnJjI1ARj6VbO2a4jsR743lDFL49p1EIuGO6-yD2NX8rDwLMD9GkdaPu2ZppISohC~p52iUxdaHwdwEXPPjyxGsmpqaV6RxAVge0Ep1JKkzsPB07ijTyH-Aig8zfSzJ2Wv6g2UAEpQBYAcfPz1jWmePHRA3DfUGe461bANlBDhsYRxG9G2vKeC~fvdrQVERWImTLyfg-riNrIwCTCDvbAL9YlWUkFWKNdrVNF2E8TyTJgTVwT~YDiT0adxDLaox~o1yzbQpv15y8wfTGmRrRfA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Returns on Housing Compared to Real Estate Investment Funds" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure VI</p><div><p>Returns on Housing Compared to Real Estate Investment Funds</p><p>Total real return on housing, and shares of housing investment firms in France and the U.S. Moving averages.

The time trend also follows a similar pattern, especially in France. The REIT returns, however, tend to be somewhat more volatile—most likely because they reflect changes in the market’s valuations of future earnings and the current portfolio performance. The REIT returns also seem to be affected by the general ups and downs of the stock market: for example, the 1987 Black Monday crash and dot-com bust in the United States, as well as the 1930s Great Depression and 1960s stock crises in France. This suggests that the valuations of the funds’ housing portfolios may have been affected by shifts in general stock market sentiment, possibly unrelated to housing market fundamentals.</p><p>Overall, the returns on real estate investment funds serve to confirm the general housing return level in our data set. The comparison also suggests that returns in housing markets tend to be smoother than those in stock markets. The next section examines various factors that can affect the comparability of housing and equity returns more generally.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577761" id="137577761" data-legacy-id="sec3-4">III.D. Comparability of Housing and Equity Returns</h3>
<p>Even if the fundamentals driving housing and equity returns (expected dividend/profit, and rental flows) are similar, investor returns for the two asset classes may differ for a number of reasons including taxes, transaction costs, and the financial structure of the investment claim. In this subsection we consider such comparability issues.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577763" id="137577763" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-1">1. Transaction Costs</h4>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that while bonds and equities can be purchased with low transaction costs and at short notice, the seller of a house typically incurs significant costs. We provide a rough estimate of how transaction costs affect our return estimates for housing. We perform a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation to do this using contemporary data on average holding periods of residential real estate and average transaction costs incurred by the buyer. According to the <span id="jumplink-bib54"></span>OECD (2012), average round-trip transaction costs across 13 of the 16 countries in our sample amount to about 7.7% of the property’s value.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn36"></span>36</sup></p><p>However, these simple cost ratios need to be adjusted for the typical trading frequency of each asset. According to the American Community Survey of 2007, more than 50% of U.S. homeowners had lived in their current home for more than 10 years. Current average holding periods are similar in, for example, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands. Another way to estimate housing turnover is using housing sales data, which for the United States gives us an average holding period of close to 20 years.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn37"></span>37</sup> Either way, accounting for transaction costs would thus lower the average annual return to housing by less than 100 basis points (e.g., 77 basis points a year based on a 7.7% cost incurred every 10 years).</p><p>For equities, the cost of each individual transaction is much smaller, but the number of transactions is much higher. <span id="jumplink-bib34"></span>Jones (2002) estimates that at the New York Stock Exchange over the period 1900–2001, the average transaction cost was around 80 bps (half bid-ask spread of 30 bps plus commission rate of 50 bps), and turnover was roughly 60% a year, resulting in the annual average equity transaction costs of 40 bps. Comparing this number to the back-of-the-envelope housing transaction cost estimates reported above, it seems that even though equity transaction costs are probably somewhat lower, the difference between two asset classes is likely to be small—and no more than 0.5 percentage points a year.</p><p>The fact that housing faces much higher costs per each transaction, however, means that the realized housing transaction costs may understate the “shadow” utility cost, which would include the suboptimal allocation choices from staying in the same house and not moving, for example. It might also reduce the volatility of housing returns, making them react more sluggishly to shocks. This means that the relatively modest short-run volatility of housing returns could mask more pronounced fluctuations at lower frequencies. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> K and Table A.17 compare equity and housing return volatility over longer horizons of up to 20 years.

Leverage</h4>
<p>Household-level returns on real estate and equity will be affected by the structure of the household balance sheet, and how these investments are financed. <span id="jumplink-bib37"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2016) show that advanced economies in the second half of the twentieth century experienced a boom in mortgage lending and borrowing. This surge in household borrowing not only reflected rising house prices, it also reflected substantially higher household debt levels relative to asset values (and relative to household incomes). The majority of households in advanced economies today hold a leveraged portfolio in their local real estate market. As with any leveraged portfolio, this significantly increases both the risk and the return associated with the investment. And today, unlike in the early twentieth century, houses can be levered much more than equities. The benchmark rent-price ratios from the IPD used to construct estimates of the return to housing refer to rent-price ratios of unleveraged real estate. Consequently, the estimates presented so far constitute only unlevered housing returns of a hypothetical long-only investor, which is symmetric to the way we (and the literature) have treated equities.</p><p>However, computing raw returns to housing and equity indices neglects the fact that an equity investment contains embedded leverage. The underlying corporations have balance sheets with both debt and equity liabilities. Thus, reconciliation is needed, and two routes can be taken. For truly comparable raw unlevered returns, equity returns could be delevered. Alternatively, for truly comparable levered returns, housing returns would have to be levered up to factor in the actual leverage (using mortgages) seen on household balance sheets. Is this a big deal in practice? We argue that it does not bias our conclusions significantly based on some elementary calculations.</p><p>Consider, for example, the second reconciliation of levering up housing returns. Let the real long-term mortgage borrowing rate be <em>r</em><sub>0</sub>, and let α be the leverage of the average house proxied by total mortgages divided by the value of the housing stock. Then we can solve for levered real housing returns <em>TR</em>′ as a function of unlevered real housing returns <em>TR</em> using the formula <span>|$\mathit{TR^{\prime }} = \frac{\mathit {TR} - \alpha r_0}{1 - \alpha }$|⁠</span>. In our data, <em>TR</em> ≃ 7.0% and α ≃ 0.2. Using a long bond return as a proxy for <em>r</em><sub>0</sub> of around 2.5% p.a., this would imply <em>TR</em>′ = 8.1%.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn38"></span>38</sup> In other words, for the representative agent the levered housing return is about 110 bps higher than the unlevered housing return (8.1% versus 7%), a small difference. Such adjustments appear to be inconsequential for the main conclusions we present here. In fact, they would bolster one of our central new claims, which is that real housing returns at least match or even exceed real equity returns in the long run when the two are compared on an equal footing.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577772" id="137577772" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-3">3. Taxes</h4>
<p>When computing equity and housing returns we do not account for taxes. From an investor’s perspective, accounting for taxes is clearly important. Typically, equity capital gains—and, for some countries and periods, even dividend income—have been subject to a capital gains tax. When dividends are not taxed as capital gains, they tend to be taxed as income. In some countries, housing capital gains are subject to capital gains taxes, but owner-occupied houses in particular have been granted exemptions in many cases. Imputed rents of homeowners, unlike dividend income, are almost never taxed. In addition, housing tends to be subject to asset-specific levies in the form of property taxes, documented extensively in <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Y.</p><p>For equities and housing, the level and applicability of taxes has varied over time.

Second, the total tax burden on the pre–corporate-tax equity returns is likely to be higher than on housing, since in light of the various homeowner exemptions, the post–corporate-tax burden on the two assets appears to be roughly similar. Third, the returns on the two asset classes are similar before 1920, when the corporate tax rate was close to 0.</p>                    <h4 scrollto-destination="137577776" id="137577776" data-legacy-id="sec3-4-4">4. Temporal Aggregation and Return Averaging</h4>
<p>The way house and equity price indices are constructed is likely to influence the volatility of the return series. The house price indices used for return calculations (e.g., indices from national statistical agencies) tend to be an average of all transactions in a given year or use a sample of transactions or appraisal values throughout the year. But the equity prices used for return calculations, by the usual convention followed here, compare end-of-year prices of shares. The use of end-of-year rather than yearly average prices mechanically makes equity returns more volatile.</p><p>We can assess the magnitude of this effect by constructing an equity return index based on annual averages of daily data, to mimic how housing returns are computed, and then comparing it to a “normal” return using end-of-year index values. For this robustness exercise we use daily MSCI equity returns data for 1970–2015. <span id="jumplink-tblVI"></span>Table VI presents the end-of-year and yearly average real equity returns in the first two columns, and our yearly average housing returns for the same time period in the third column. Comparing the first two columns shows that yearly averaging lowers the standard deviation of returns by around one-fifth, or 5 percentage points. It also lowers the average return by around 1 percentage point, because the return series is a transformation of the raw price data, and lowering the variance reduces the mean of the return. But the standard deviation of the smoothed yearly average equity series is still almost three times that of housing over the same time period.</p>                    <div content-id="tblVI"><div><div id="tblVI" data-id="tblVI"><p><span id="label-89983">Table VI</span></p><p>Impact of Using End-of-Year versus Yearly Average Asset Prices</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Risky returns recovered quickly in the 1920s, before experiencing a drop in the the Great Depression, especially for equities. Strikingly, after World War II the trajectories of returns for the two risky asset classes had similar long-run means but over shorter periods diverged markedly from each other.</p><p>Equity returns have experienced many pronounced global boom-bust cycles, much more so than housing returns, with average real returns as high as +16% and as low as –4% over entire decades. Equity returns fell in World War II, boomed in the postwar reconstruction, and fell off again in the climate of general macroeconomic instability in the 1970s. Equity returns bounced back following a wave of deregulation and privatization in the 1980s. The next major event was the global financial crisis, which exacted its toll on equities and to some extent housing, as we shall see.</p><p>Housing returns, on the other hand, have remained remarkably stable over almost the entire post-World War II period. As a consequence, the correlation between equity and housing returns, depicted in the top left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure VIII, was highly positive before World War II, but has all but disappeared over the past five decades. The low covariance of equity and housing returns over the long run reveals potential attractive gains from diversification across these two asset classes that economists, up to now, have been unable to measure or analyze.</p><p>In terms of relative returns, we see that housing persistently outperformed equity up until World War I, even though both of these asset returns followed a broadly similar temporal pattern. In recent decades, equities have slightly outperformed housing in (arithmetic, not geometric) average but with much higher volatility and cyclicality. Furthermore, upswings in equity prices have generally not coincided with times of low growth or high inflation, when standard asset pricing theory would say high returns would have been particularly valuable.</p><p>The top right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure VIII examines the correlation between risky rates of return and inflation. It shows that equity comoved negatively with inflation in the 1970s, while housing provided a more robust hedge against an unusually rapid surge in consumer prices. In fact, apart from the interwar period, when the world was gripped by a broad deflationary bias, we find that equity returns have comoved negatively with inflation in almost all eras. Moreover, the big downswings in equity returns in the two world wars and the 1970s coincided with periods of generally poor economic performance.</p><p>In the past two decades, equity returns have also become highly correlated across countries, as shown by the sharp rise in the degree of cross-country comovement in the bottom left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure VIII, measured as the average of all country-pair correlations for a given window.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn40"></span>40</sup>A well-diversified global equity portfolio has thus become less of a hedge against country-specific risk (<span id="jumplink-bib59"></span>Quinn and Voth 2008). As is a matter of debate, this may reflect greater freedom to arbitrage and trade across equity markets globally or an increase in the global shocks to which firms, especially those in the typical equity index, are increasingly exposed. In contrast to equities, cross-country housing returns have remained relatively uncorrelated, perhaps because housing assets remain less globally tradable than equities or because they are more exposed to idiosyncratic country-level shocks.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="137577793" id="137577793" data-legacy-id="sec4-2">IV.B. Country Returns</h3>
<p>Next we explore risky returns in individual countries. <span id="jumplink-tblVII"></span>Table VII shows returns on equities and housing by country for the full sample and for the post-1950 and post-1980 subsamples. Long-run risky asset returns for most countries are close to 6%–8% a year, a figure we think represents a robust and strong real return to risky capital. Still, the figures also show an important degree of heterogeneity among countries. Many of the countries that experienced large political shocks show lower equity returns. This is the case for Portugal and Spain, which both underwent prolonged civil strife, and France, which undertook a wave of nationalizations in the aftermath of World War II. French equity returns are also negatively affected by the fallout from the world wars and the fallout from an oil crisis in the 1960s (for more detail, see <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>Le Bris and Hautcoeur 2010; <span id="jumplink-bib8"></span>Blancheton, Bonin, and Le Bris 2014). In contrast, real equity returns in Finland have been as high as 10% on average throughout the sample. Housing returns also show considerable heterogeneity. Returns on housing have been high on average in the Nordic countries, but low in Italy and Spain. U.S. risky asset returns fall roughly in the middle of the country-specific figures, with equity returns slightly above average and housing returns slightly below.

Returns on the two assets were about the same in the remaining five countries.

Decomposition of Returns</h3>
<p>To further look into the underlying drivers of housing and equity returns, we decompose them into the capital gain (price) and yield (dividend or rent) components. To be consistent with the data in <span id="jumplink-sec3"></span><a href="#sec3">Section III</a> and <span id="jumplink-tblII"></span>Table II, we decompose real total return into real capital gain—that is, the price change net of inflation—and dividend or rental yield—that is, the nominal yield as proportion of the previous year’s share or house price.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn43"></span>43</sup> Yet caveats arise. In principle, it is not entirely clear whether inflation should be subtracted from the capital gain or yield component. Moreover, firms may buy back shares to generate low-tax capital gains instead of paying out higher-taxed dividends; thus, the manner of distribution of total returns may not be invariant to circumstances.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table VIII decomposes equity and housing returns into capital gains and dividends or rents, for the full cross-country sample and the period after 1950. Over the full sample, most of the real return is attributable to the yield. Dividends account for roughly 60% of real equity returns, and rents for roughly 80% of real housing returns. In terms of geometric means (<span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table VIII, third row), almost all of both equity and housing returns are attributable to, respectively, dividend and rental income. After 1950, capital gains become more important for both equities and housing. For equities, real capital gains account for the majority of the total return after 1950, and for housing for roughly one-third.</p>                    <div content-id="tblVIII"><div><div id="tblVIII" data-id="tblVIII"><p><span id="label-25864">Table VIII</span></p><p>Total Return Components for Equity and Housing</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Nevertheless, without dividends or rents, the real returns on both assets would be low, especially in geometric mean terms. This is consistent with the existing literature on real house prices: <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>Shiller (2000) documents that house prices in the United States moved in line with inflation before the 2000s bubble, and <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017) show that real house prices in advanced economies were more or less flat before 1950. This is also true in our data: the pre-1950 annual real housing capital gains are just 0.5%. Post-1950 capital gains are somewhat higher at 2.5%, but still only half the magnitude of the rental yields. Adding rents to the equation radically changes the picture and brings the long-run housing total return close to 7%. Interestingly, the broad picture is similar for equities: the real equity capital gain before 1950 is, on average, just 0.4%, compared with 4.7% a year after 1950. However, the contribution of dividend and rental income means that housing and equity returns were high both before and after 1950.</p><p>Although most of the return can be attributed to dividends and rents, almost all of the volatility comes from equity and house prices, that is, the capital gains component. <span id="jumplink-tblVIII"></span>Table VIII, second row shows that both dividends and rents are very stable, with a standard deviation of dividend/rental yields of about 2%. Prices, on the contrary, move around much more, with a standard deviation roughly equal to that of total returns (21.4% for equities and 9.9% for housing). The higher variability of equity returns and the superior risk-adjusted performance of housing can therefore largely be attributed to the lower volatility of house prices compared to those of equities. An additional factor is that capital gains—the more volatile component—account for a relatively larger share of equity returns.</p><p>Because aggregate equity prices are subject to large and prolonged swings, a representative investor would have to hold on to his equity portfolio for longer to ensure a high real return. Aggregate housing returns, on the other hand, are more stable because swings in aggregate house prices are generally less pronounced. National aggregate housing portfolios have had comparable real returns to national aggregate equity portfolios, but with only half the volatility.</p><p><span id="jumplink-tblIX"></span>Table IX examines the relative importance of capital gains versus dividends/rents at the country level (figures are arithmetic means and standard deviations). Additionally we report the share of real total return accounted for by capital gains. The fact that the majority of housing returns come from yields is true across all countries. The lowest real capital gains are observed in Switzerland, and the highest in Finland, but none exceed 3% a year in the full sample. Rents are relatively more important in the United States, accounting for roughly 90% of returns, but this is not unusual: Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland have the same share of capital gains as the United States. For equities, the picture is more mixed. Seven countries, including the United States, have a roughly 50/50 split between real capital gain and dividend yield shares. Other countries record low or negative real capital gains over the full sample, especially in geometric mean terms (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Table A.22).</p>                    <div content-id="tblIX"><div><div id="tblIX" data-id="tblIX"><p><span id="label-61744">Table IX</span></p><p>Total Return Components for Equity and Housing by Country</p> </div><div><table role="table" aria-labelledby="

Decadal moving averages.</p></div></div></div></div><p>Three striking features of <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure X deserve comment. First, low real rates and, in fact, negative real rates have been relatively common in modern financial history. Second, for the most part, returns to long-term and short-term safe assets have tracked each other very closely—with a premium of about 1% that has widened considerably since the well-documented decline of the mid-1980s (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib31"></span>Holston, Laubach, and Williams 2017). Third, a major stylized fact leaps out once we compare the safe rates of return in <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure X to the risky rates of return in <span id="jumplink-fig7"></span>Figure VII. Prior to World War II, real returns on housing, safe assets, and equities followed remarkably similar trajectories. After World War II this was no longer the case.</p><p>Safe rates are far from stable in the medium term. There is enormous time-series, as well as cross-country, variability. In fact, real safe rates appear to be as volatile as real risky rates (sometimes more volatile), a topic we return to in the next section. Considerable variation in the risk premium often comes from sharp changes in safe real returns, not from real returns on risky assets.</p><p>Two four-decade-long declines in real rates stand out: (i) from 1870 to World War I (with a subsequent further collapse during the war), and (ii) the well-documented decline that started in the mid-1980s. We could add to this list the briefer, but more dramatic decline that followed the Great Depression into World War II. Some observers have therefore interpreted the recent downward trend in safe rates as a sign of a new era of “secular stagnation” (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers 2014).</p><p>However, in contrast to 1870–1913 and the 1930s, the more recent decline is characterized by a much higher term premium—a feature with few precedents in our sample.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn44"></span>44</sup> There are other periods in which real rates remained low, such as in the 1960s. They were pushed below zero, particularly for the longer-tenor bonds, during the 1970s inflation spike, although here too term premiums remained relatively tight. Returns also dipped dramatically during both world wars. This is perhaps to be expected: demand for safe assets spikes during disasters, although the dip may also reflect periods of financial repression and high inflation that usually emerge during times of conflict and often persist into peacetime. Thus, from a broad historical perspective, high rates of return on safe assets and high term premiums are more the exception than the rule.</p><p>Summing up, over more than 140 years from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first century, real returns on safe assets have been low—on average 1% for bills and 2.5% for bonds—relative to alternative investments. Although the return volatility—measured as annual standard deviation—is lower than that of housing and equities, these assets offered little protection during high-inflation eras and during the two world wars, both periods of low consumption growth.</p><p>Again moving on to examine correlations, <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure XI explores additional key moments of the data. The top left panel plots the correlation between real bond and real bill returns, again using decadal rolling windows and computed as the cross-sectional average of correlations. In parallel to our discussion of the term premium, real returns on bonds and bills have been highly correlated for most of the sample up until the 1960s. From the 1970s onward, the era of fiat money and higher average inflation, this correlation has become much weaker, and near zero at times, coinciding with a widening term premium.</p>                    <div data-id="fig11" data-content-id="fig11" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig11.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=J4GBeJikKLS2l2n8P23AZJQLMv39elva2D~BQH97tmVSvCwv7cAHRUn2jsRIdDFkyj-a1gpSh518bcdqzCqQrQ67MiDpgGhfGiAAKGDEszLDeZD4CamLBC3xoLVlVtwL9~Z9c~coArWoAZ6ILtQDsOKrFolAlnmGxVqzFL85BfsogJPkWvB-YzZmvO-ygjvDy5fqDR48fIoaMHu7MJ~ezHVGgDrTH57fHRutLRgfHWk7QgraD1kPaA03eeajXam2tLo872GXuF5Igy77Z5c5pjXfcCv7kIiA7ChDgeKTTO90WEhgRnY7~Wv9AQH6WleRWQHR6yixRzgPQalwc9UkLw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Correlations across Safe Asset Returns" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure XI</p><div><p>Correlations across Safe Asset Returns</p><p>Color version available online. Rolling decadal correlations. The global correlation coefficient is the average of individual countries for the rolling window.

Country coverage differs across time periods.</p></div></div></div></div><p>The top right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure XI displays the correlation between nominal safe asset returns and inflation for real bond and real bill returns. The figure shows that safe assets provided more of an inflation hedge starting in the 1970s, around the start of the era of modern central banking. However, as <span id="jumplink-fig10"></span>Figure X showed, bonds and bills have experienced prolonged periods of negative real returns—both during wartime inflations and in the high-inflation period of the late 1970s. Although safe asset rates usually comove positively with inflation, they do not always compensate the investor fully.</p><p>The bottom panel of <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>Figure XI displays the cross-correlation of safe returns over rolling decadal windows, averaged for all country-pair combinations, to examine how much risk can be diversified with debt instruments. Cross-country real safe returns have exhibited positive comovement throughout history. The degree of comovement shows a few marked increases in World War I and in the 1930s. The effect of these major global shocks on individual countries seems to have resulted in a higher correlation of cross-country asset returns.</p><p>Turning to cross-sectional features, <span id="jumplink-tblX"></span>Table X shows country-specific safe asset returns for three samples: all years, post-1950, and post-1980. Here the experiences of a few countries stand out. In France, real bill returns have been negative when averaged over the full sample. In Portugal and Spain, they have been approximately zero. In Norway, the average return on bills has been negative for the post-1950 sample.

What matters for this is not the level of real return per se, but its comparison to real GDP growth, or <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> − <em>g</em>. If the rate of return exceeds real GDP growth, <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> &gt; <em>g</em>, reducing the debt/GDP ratio requires continuous budget surpluses. When <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> is less than <em>g</em>, however, a reduction in debt/GDP is possible even with the government running modest deficits. Existing evidence points to <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> &lt; <em>g</em> being the norm rather than the exception, both in recent years and broader historical data (<span id="jumplink-bib5"></span>Ball, Elmendorf, and Mankiw 1998; <span id="jumplink-bib50"></span>Mehrotra 2017).</p><p><span id="jumplink-fig12"></span>Figure XII plots the representative “safe rate of return” as the arithmetic average of bond and bill returns (dashed line) alongside real GDP growth (solid line), again as decadal moving averages. Starting in the late nineteenth century, safe rates were higher than GDP growth, meaning that any government wishing to reduce debt had to run persistent budget surpluses. Indeed, this was the strategy adopted by Britain to pay off the debt incurred during the Napoleonic War (<span id="jumplink-bib13"></span>Crafts 2016). The two world wars saw low real returns, but nevertheless a large debt accumulation to finance the wartime effort. The aftermath of these two wars, however, offered vastly different experiences for public finances. After World War I, safe returns were high and growth low, requiring significant budgetary efforts to repay the war debts. This was particularly difficult for many countries given the large interlocking reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, and the turbulent macroeconomic environment at the time. After World War II, on the contrary, high growth and inflation helped greatly reduce the value of national debt, creating <em>r</em><sup><em>safe</em></sup> − <em>g</em> gaps as large as –10 percentage points.</p>                    <div data-id="fig12" data-content-id="fig12" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig12.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=LZLY4Eiu2ZLZiyofpCLrtRi8piWOAAqjg5VopiEGMn-Jx8kSu8GgHuBdbCtkU609MapqDREhsXL91fWMzXc0YxWjRetAV~ftbL2g-3x2MWKSK-KusLY0lAv9Lx02y7mSFLIr2RuV48WykXRMJrP9hdIwN-xKAgivfcgOYXmEXjFyYK4fiiOa9C7Pd47B2gHDv50dgqzFlkZEXWo5r~S8edk9xaNjYGrAG2l8P5l3CYHcmzeQp~cyKGvOELUpC5WlZKtBl6L1jZk2Pfqvo9r~RF~lW~Y~HQLZtQ3pAKpXWzmbDEyMwu-Z6wfUJmrVsROJ-BDQwBxgL~h3RGRFMh~MUQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Trends in the Real Return on Safe Assets and GDP Growth" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure XII</p><div><p>Trends in the Real Return on Safe Assets and GDP Growth</p><p>Mean returns and GDP growth for 16 countries, weighted by real GDP.

On average throughout our sample, the real growth rate has been around 1 percentage point higher than the safe rate of return (3% growth versus 2% safe rate), meaning that governments could run small deficits without increasing the public debt burden.</p><p>In sum, real returns on safe assets have been quite low across the advanced countries over the past 150 years. In fact, for some countries, these returns have often been persistently negative. Periods of unexpected inflation, in war and peace, have often diluted returns, and flights to safety may have depressed safe returns even further in the more turbulent periods of global financial history. The low return for investors has, on the flipside, implied a low financing cost for governments, which was particularly important in reducing the debts incurred during World War II.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577827" id="137577827" data-legacy-id="sec6">VI.

The within-country weights correspond to the shares of the respective asset in the country’s wealth portfolio.

The safe return is a simple unweighted average of bonds and bills.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn45"></span>45</sup> The left panel of <span id="jumplink-fig13"></span>Figure XIII shows the risky and safe asset returns, and the right panel depicts the risk premium, calculated as the risky minus safe difference.</p><p>As in <span id="jumplink-sec4"></span><a href="#sec4">Sections IV</a> and <span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">V</a>, the data presented here measure ex post returns and risk premiums, inclusive of capital gains. For some of the debates we touch on, however, a forward-looking expected return measure would have been preferable. Realized returns are likely to fall below ex ante return expectations during periods of large negative shocks, such as the two world wars, and rise above them in times of high capital gains, such as that between 1980 and today. Long-run data on expected returns are, however, difficult to obtain. Our focus on long-run trends, to an extent, allows us to look through some of the unexpected shocks that drive a wedge between ex ante and ex post returns. Nevertheless, the discussion in this section should be treated with a note of caution.</p><p>Both risky and safe returns were high during the nineteenth century but had been gradually declining in the run up to World War I, after which they declined sharply, as is to be expected. After the war, returns were recovering during the 1920s. From 1930 onward, the risky return stayed high and relatively stable, whereas the safe return dropped sharply and remained low until the late 1970s, before increasing and falling back again over the past three decades. These findings have implications for current debates around secular stagnation and the pricing, or mispricing, of risk.</p><p>Secular stagnation is associated with low rates of return, driven by an excess of savings or a general unwillingness to borrow and invest. These in turn reflect a variety of potential factors, including (i) lower rates of productivity growth; (ii) lower fertility and mortality rates; (iii) a decline in the relative price of investment goods; (iv) greater firm-level market power; and (v) higher income inequality (<span id="jumplink-bib60"></span>Rachel and Smith 2015; <span id="jumplink-bib17"></span>Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Robbins 2017; <span id="jumplink-bib71"></span>Thwaites 2015).</p><p>Indeed, we can see that the safe return fell sharply during the 1930s, when <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>Hansen (1939) originally proposed the secular stagnation hypothesis. That time also coincided with a demographic bust and was preceded by a big rise in income inequality in the run-up to the Great Depression. The safe return has been falling again since the mid-1980s, as many have noted.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn46"></span>46</sup> Understandably, this has led some observers to suggest that advanced economies are again in danger of entering secular stagnation, for example, <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>Summers (2014) and <span id="jumplink-bib16"></span>Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014).</p><p>The picture changes radically when we consider the trend in risky returns in addition to safe returns. Unlike safe returns, risky returns have remained high and broadly stable through the best part of the past 100 years, and show little sign of a secular decline. Turning back to the trend for safe assets, even though the safe return has declined recently, much as it did at the start of our sample, it remains close to its historical average. These two observations call into question whether secular stagnation is quite with us. The high and stable risky return coupled with falling safe rates could also be consistent with the notion of a “safety trap” brought about by the relative shortage of safe assets (<span id="jumplink-bib10"></span>Caballero and Farhi 2017). However, with risk premiums still not far off their historical averages, the evidence for a safety trap is thus far also not clear-cut.</p><p>We turn to examine the long-run developments in the ex post risk premium, that is, the spread between safe and risky returns (right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig13"></span>Figure XIII). This spread was low and stable at around 5 percentage points before World War I. It rose slightly after World War I, before falling to an all-time low of near zero by around 1930. The decades following the onset of World War II saw a dramatic widening in the risk premium, with the spread reaching its historical high of around 14 percentage points in the 1950s, before falling back to around its historical average.</p><p>Interestingly, the period of high risk premiums coincided with an era of few systemic banking crises. In fact, not a single such crisis occurred in our advanced-economy sample between 1946 and 1973. By contrast, banking crises appear to have been relatively more frequent when risk premiums were low. This finding speaks to the recent literature on the mispricing of risk around financial crises.

The risky return is largely stable across time, even though it varies somewhat across countries: from just over 5% in Italy and Spain to 11% in Finland. Risk premiums were at or near their highest level in almost every country during the period 1950–1980, largely due to low returns on safe assets. The real safe rate of return was close to zero or negative for the majority of the countries in the sample, with the lowest level of –3.5% observed in Spain and Portugal, and only Belgium, Finland, and Germany experiencing robustly positive real returns. Meanwhile, risky returns were also somewhat above their long-run level in a number of countries, but the differences are relatively smaller than those for safe rates. The post-1980 period saw a recovery in safe returns across the board, with the recent downward trend not yet apparent in these longer-run period averages. Risky returns, meanwhile, were close to their historical levels in most countries, with only Japan experiencing a strong decline following the bursting of its asset price bubble in the 1990s.</p><p>We now turn to examine the correlations between risky and safe returns, which are displayed in <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure XIV. The top left panel of this figure shows the rolling decadal correlation between the risky and safe returns, calculated as the average of rolling correlations in individual countries in a similar fashion to the calculations in <span id="jumplink-fig8"></span>Figure VIII. Throughout most of the historical period under consideration, risky and safe returns had been positively correlated. In other words, safe assets have not generally provided a hedge against risk because safe returns were low when risky returns were low—in particular during both world wars—and vice versa. This positive correlation has weakened over the more recent decades and turned negative from the 1990s onward. This suggests that safe assets have acted as a better hedge for risk during both the Great Moderation and the recent Global Financial Crisis.</p>                    <div data-id="fig14" data-content-id="fig14" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig14.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=WnmuI1UaBuQSpoo7wsfA1PBO8VEEMZnjHTpulD9CwxLIQX4DwAIfj~wC5NnsE477NtFeY5B7orJpq0MwTyfVJKYrInFfcCtmULDKq7STsR4DJMxPLiOJCqofoT8Mwsbuqi1WI0RZWUMGk4kYgRqa1CjGHZNsRjY5qiaQi2w8jUNYmihTE7fjNGA44JCWB6~lZ1UvXuNyg8w0djavX-C8eBPyXl6e0sqSjPDytSsCmPKR3QRh8ozuAMzXpPizg3LMlSDOOYeuN-9158Hn9cOPYtZs7oBkE48pBFPWa7XEHRG6nb9GmijeTEbT2tSMowrf7BC8yh2mvFimaXvGy9ih2w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Correlations across Risky and Safe Asset Returns" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure XIV</p><div><p>Correlations across Risky and Safe Asset Returns</p><p>Rolling decadal correlations.

Mirroring our findings presented in the preceding sections, safe returns have tended to comove more strongly with inflation, particularly during the post-World War II period. Moving to cross-country correlations depicted in the bottom two panels of <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure XIV, historically safe returns in different countries have been more correlated than risky returns. This has reversed over the past decades as cross-country risky returns have become substantially more correlated. This seems to be mainly driven by a remarkable rise in the cross-country correlations in risk premiums, depicted in the bottom right panel of <span id="jumplink-fig14"></span>Figure XIV. This increase in global risk comovement may pose new challenges to the risk-bearing capacity of the global financial system, a trend consistent with other macro indicators of risk-sharing (<span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2017).</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577845" id="137577845" data-legacy-id="sec7">VII. <em>r</em> versus <em>g</em></h2>
<p>Our analysis provides insights into the debate on inequality. <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) and <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman (2014) argue that inequality and wealth-to-income ratios in advanced economies have followed a U-shaped pattern over the past century and a half. They further hypothesize that wealth inequality may continue to rise in the future, along with a predicted decline in the rate of economic growth. The main theoretical argument for this comes about from a simple relation: <em>r</em> &gt; <em>g</em>. In their approach, a higher spread between the real rate of return on wealth, denoted <em>r</em>, and the rate of real GDP growth, <em>g</em>, tends to magnify the steady-state level of wealth inequality. <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) show that in a wide class of models featuring stochastic returns to wealth, a higher gap between <em>r</em> and <em>g</em> increases the Pareto index of the steady-state wealth distribution, making it more unequal.</p><p>Of course, this is not the only channel through which rates of return can impact the wealth distribution. Rate of return differentials between asset classes can affect the wealth distribution if there are systematic differences in the portfolio composition between rich and poor households, as <span id="jumplink-bib43"></span>Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins (2017) show, or if rates of returns vary with portfolio size, as stressed by <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014). Studying administrative Swedish data, <span id="jumplink-bib4"></span>Bach, Calvet, and Sodini (2016) find that wealthy households earn higher returns on their portfolios, and <span id="jumplink-bib19"></span>Fagereng et al. (2016) use Norwegian tax data to document substantial heterogeneity in wealth returns. Rates of return on wealth are beginning to receive attention in the theoretical literature. For instance, <span id="jumplink-bib7"></span>Benhabib and Bisin (2016) point to return differences of assets as a potential channel to explain diverging trends between income and wealth inequality, and <span id="jumplink-bib24"></span>Garbinti, Goupille-Lebret, and Piketty (2017) show that asset price effects played an important role in shaping the French wealth distribution over the past 200 years. Furthermore, wealth inequality may depend not only on the magnitude of <em>r</em> in relation to <em>g</em> but also on return volatility. Higher return volatility can increase the dispersion of wealth outcomes and make the distribution of wealth more unequal.</p><p>To bring our data to bear on these debates, we construct a measure of the world’s real return on wealth as a weighted average of real returns on bonds, equities, and housing—reflecting the typical portfolio of a private household end-investor. We then compare this measure to the rate of real GDP growth of economies over the long run. Importantly, our approach differs from <span id="jumplink-bib56"></span>Piketty (2014) in that we rely on annual returns from observed market prices and yields for each individual asset class, rather than implicit returns derived from aggregate balance sheet data at selected benchmark dates. This, we think, is more robust and provides a vital cross check for the core argument.</p><p>Similarly to the risky returns in <span id="jumplink-sec6"></span><a href="#sec6">Section VI</a>, we weight the individual returns by the size of the respective asset portfolio: stock market capitalization, housing wealth, and public debt (divided equally between bonds and bills).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn47"></span>47</sup><span id="jumplink-fig15"></span>Figure XV displays the long-run trends in the global real rate of return on wealth (dashed line) and the global real GDP growth rate (solid line) since the late nineteenth century, again using decadal moving averages of GDP-weighted data.</p>                    <div data-id="fig15" data-content-id="fig15" swap-content-for-modal="true"><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/m_qjz012fig15.jpeg?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=mJQVq~xJ~kwRFv8OYRLDStQk-lt~g2HdtcNm6fS5ICfuM3v15qJvpEMPgK3bCz46yEz~kAQeL4gswNYtVKLhBRkJC1aq1XD9fLm3jYFPaiczAk133e7iwyQMLUVkJ1hiA5REIfgTwzBq~rG~EKubyTsnAklJfnwrp8x3UDE3lCZ2iR4y3q~TRQ7HPq3LkyJmcf~ewCAHh14pzDd1DNGmBZ9I3KF6CmQid6lxDoIspv8kao5OD0GoBV3f-nZh-ecCZayY5a2fV3l-n7ZrG-j6LGBd9q5F1tz-6G-cIQGu4V2Lkw0isKea1gHNtOl0zOZrubTQZPvTl2IGyPCCmso19Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="The Real Return on Wealth and Real GDP Growth" data-path-from-xml=""/></p><div><p>Figure XV</p><div><p>The Real Return on Wealth and Real GDP Growth</p><p>Mean returns and real GDP growth for 16 countries, weighted by real GDP.

Over the past 150 years, the real return on wealth has substantially exceeded real GDP growth in 13 decades and has only been below GDP growth in the 2 decades corresponding to the two world wars. That is, in peacetime, <em>r</em> has always exceeded <em>g</em>. The gap between <em>r</em> and <em>g</em> has been persistently large. Since 1870, the weighted average return on wealth (<em>r</em>) has been about 6.0%, compared to a weighted average real GDP growth rate (<em>g</em>) of 3.0%, with the average <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap of 3.0 percentage points, which is about the same magnitude as the real GDP growth rate itself.

The high level of housing returns that we have uncovered serves to push up the level of <em>r</em>, and thus, potentially, wealth inequality. But what is the counterfactual? We need to bear in mind that housing wealth is more equally distributed than, for instance, equities (see, e.g., <span id="jumplink-bib43"></span>Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins 2017), and returns on housing are less volatile than those on shares—with both factors serving to flatten the distribution of wealth changes, making the overall impact of housing returns on wealth inequality less clear-cut and offering substantial scope for further research.</p><p><span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie (2015) notes that recent trends in wealth and income could be influenced primarily by what has happened in housing. Real house prices have experienced a dramatic increase in the past 40 years, coinciding with the rapid expansion of mortgage lending (<span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>Knoll, Schularick, and Steger 2017; <span id="jumplink-bib36"></span>Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2015, <span id="jumplink-bib37"></span>2016). This is very much evident from <span id="jumplink-tblIX"></span>Table IX. Measured as a ratio to GDP, rental income has been growing, as <span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie (2015) argues. However, the rental yield has declined slightly—given the substantial increase in house prices—so that total returns on housing have remained pretty stable, as we have discussed. In this sense, recent housing trends have diverged little.</p><p>Our data allow us to more formally examine whether movements in the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap are more closely related to return fluctuations or movements in the real GDP growth rate. <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Q and Table A.26 document the correlations between <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>g</em>, and <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>r</em> across different time horizons, for the full sample and the period after 1950. Overall, the correlation between <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> and <em>g</em> is negative, and somewhat stronger at longer horizons, with the correlation coefficients ranging between –0.2 and –0.6 depending on the historical subperiod and time window. At the same time, the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap is even more robustly related to changes in the return on wealth <em>r</em>, with a positive correlation between the two and a correlation coefficient of around 0.9, both over the short and long run. This suggests that both falling GDP growth and higher returns would tend to increase the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap, although historically much of the changes in <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> have come about from movements in the return on wealth. During peacetime <em>r</em> has been quite stable, and so has been the <em>r</em> − <em>g</em> gap.</p><p>Since the 1970s, the stable and high levels of the rate of return on wealth have coincided with high and rising wealth-to-income ratios (see <span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>Piketty and Zucman 2014 and <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1721159456&amp;Signature=xkGB0UpEE74IGGPQq9OnEsVMktkyYpvUSklfgB6Rm9NZmDt7OgPPDUztXPIGA3yM4U5JT3EMJlwDGTggcH7q2QxylHCKJYVd-q3q0HyhNo8UKMRdfbQB1O-AAVwclcI8CPM7UeS2sNOXY1VO3EYiVyFeOrrGvDQOLyYiQ0Q6Mhbw9J4T3bksCbb0-NdzrowsM7VJiSfTQ1Oby~i9lM9zix2HlzH5Zq3D-E7u66Lo2buQAco8lvzYdDGpB5iMpia39cZi6lS-be~4qdy5R-Sakr--~EdtrSz1MVexzS8AhCvf5vJ5IwRtkWqnD0SKrxdbzYi2WF3TzXXdVU53BSFuow__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Online Appendix</a></span> Figure A.7). Together, these facts have meant that the capital share of GDP has increased across advanced economies (<span id="jumplink-bib39"></span>Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014). A large part of these high returns, and of the increase in wealth ratios, can be attributed to high capital gains on risky assets, namely housing and equity. <span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>Rognlie (2015) argues that house prices have played an important role in the evolution of wealth-to-income ratios in the United States. <span id="jumplink-bib44"></span>Kuvshinov and Zimmermann (2018) show that most of the recent increase in the value of listed firms in our cross-country sample is accounted for by higher equity valuations.</p><p>These high capital gains in recent decades have allowed the stock of measured wealth to rise without running into diminishing returns.

Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article we provide an investigation of the long history of advanced economy asset returns for all the major categories of the investable wealth portfolio. Our work brings new stylized facts to light and rigorously documents many broad patterns that have stimulated so much research in core areas of economics and finance over the past two centuries.</p><p>The returns to risky assets and risk premiums have been high and stable over the past 150 years. Substantial diversification opportunities exist between risky asset classes, and across countries. Arguably the most surprising result of our study is that long-run returns on housing and equity look remarkably similar. Yet while returns are comparable, residential real estate is less volatile on a national level, opening up new and interesting risk premium puzzles.</p><p>Our research speaks directly to the relationship between <em>r</em>, the rate of return on wealth, and <em>g</em>, the growth rate of the economy, that figures prominently in the current debate on inequality. One robust finding in this paper is that <em>r</em> ≫ <em>g</em>: globally, and across most countries, the weighted rate of return on capital was twice as high as the growth rate in the past 150 years.</p><p>These and other discoveries can provide a rich agenda for future research. Many issues remain to be studied, among them determining the particular fundamentals that drive the returns on each of the asset classes in typical economies. For now, we hope our introduction of this new compilation of asset return data can provide the evidentiary basis for new lines of exploration in years to come.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="137577864" id="137577864" data-legacy-id="sec9">Supplementary Material</h2>
