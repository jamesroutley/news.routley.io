    <h1>Linux Software Map</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>The LSM (Linux Software Map) was an early database cataloguing software
developed for Linux (and other systems, such as *BSD).  The term <i>LSM</i>
refers to both the file format itself, and the information with which one
could use it for.</p>

<p>The LSM was a good way to collate a central understanding of the key
software available at the time which could be coordinated between different
distributions.  This was at a time when search engines were of their infancy
and software hub sites did not yet really exist.  Most software being
developed at the time was uploaded to FTP servers, or other self-hosted
sites.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/LSM-TEMPLATE.html">ibiblio</a>
holds the current format of the LSM itself, and at one point in time allowed
for it to be queried.  Alas, it appears (as of 2022) that this is no longer
the case.</p>

<p>This version found here is not queried server-side -- instead, the data is
loaded client-side and processed via the browser&#39;s DOM.  It is itself not a
large dataset, and small enough to be done in this way, but originally, this
would not have been the case.</p>

<p>The data itself was extracted from the most recent copy of the LSM
available (<a href="http://lsm.qqx.org/lsm/LSM">http://lsm.qqx.org/lsm/LSM</a>) and a quick
script written to parse it into something which can be queried via a JSON
interpreter.</p>
