    <h1>Git-PR: patch requests over SSH</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
        We are trying to build the simplest git collaboration tool. The goal is to make
        self-hosting a git server as simple as running an SSH server -- all without
        sacrificing external collaborators time and energy.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>git format-patch</code> isn&#39;t the problem and pull requests aren&#39;t the solution.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We are combining mailing list and pull request workflows. In order to build the
        simplest collaboration tool, we needed something as simple as generating patches
        but the ease-of-use of pull requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is not to create another code forge here. The goal is to create a very
        simple self-hosted git solution with the ability to collaborate with external
        contributors. All the code owner needs to setup a running git server:
      </p>

      <ul><li>A single golang binary</li></ul>

      <p>
        All an external contributor needs is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An SSH keypair</li>
        <li>An SSH client</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>the problem</h2>

      <p>
        Email is great as a decentralized system to send and receive changes (patchsets)
        to a git repo. However, onboarding a new user to a mailing list, properly
        setting up their email client, and then finally submitting the code contribution
        is enough to make many developers give up. Further, because we are leveraging
        the email protocol for collaboration, we are limited by its feature-set. For
        example, it is not possible to make edits to emails, everyone has a different
        client, those clients have different limitations around plain text email and
        downloading patches from it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Github pull requests are easy to use, easy to edit, and easy to manage. The
        downside is it forces the user to be inside their website to perform reviews.
        For quick changes, this is great, but when you start reading code within a web
        browser, there are quite a few downsides. At a certain point, it makes more
        sense to review code inside your local development environment, IDE, etc. There
        are tools and plugins that allow users to review PRs inside their IDE, but it
        requires a herculean effort to make it usable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, self-hosted solutions that mimic a pull request require a lot of
        infrastructure in order to manage it. A database, a web site connected to git,
        admin management, and services to manage it all. Another big point of friction:
        before an external user submits a code change, they first need to create an
        account and then login. This adds quite a bit of friction for a self-hosted
        solution, not only for an external contributor, but also for the code owner who
        has to provision the infra. Often times they also have to fork the repo within
        the code forge before submitting a PR. Then they never make a contribution ever
        again and keep a forked repo around forever. That seems silly.
      </p>

      <h2>introducing patch requests (PR)</h2>

      <p>
        Instead, we want to create a self-hosted git &#34;server&#34; that can handle sending
        and receiving patches without the cumbersome nature of setting up email or the
        limitations imposed by the email protocol. Further, we want the primary workflow
        to surround the local development environment. Github is bringing the IDE to the
        browser in order to support their workflow, we want to flip that idea on its
        head by making code reviews a first-class citizen inside your local development
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        We see this as a hybrid between the github workflow of a pull request and
        sending and receiving patches over email.
      </p>

      <p>
        The basic idea is to leverage an SSH app to handle most of the interaction
        between contributor and owner of a project. Everything can be done completely
        within the terminal, in a way that is ergonomic and fully featured.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notifications would happen with RSS and all state mutations would result in the
        generation of static web assets so it can all be hosted using a simple file web
        server.
      </p>

      <h3>format-patch workflow</h3>

      <p>
        The fundamental collaboration tool here is <code>format-patch</code>. Whether you a
        submitting code changes or you are reviewing code changes, it all happens in
        code. Both contributor and owner are simply creating new commits and generating
        patches on top of each other. This obviates the need to have a web viewer where
        the reviewing can &#34;comment&#34; on a line of code block. There&#39;s no need, apply the
        contributor&#39;s patches, write comments or code changes, generate a new patch,
        send the patch to the git server as a &#34;review.&#34; This flow also works the exact
        same if two users are collaborating on a set of changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This also solves the problem of sending multiple patchsets for the same code
        change. There&#39;s a single, central Patch Request where all changes and
        collaboration happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could figure out a way to leverage <code>git notes</code> for reviews / comments, but
        honestly, that solution feels brutal and outside the comfort level of most git
        users. Just send reviews as code and write comments in the programming language
        you are using. It&#39;s the job of the contributor to &#34;address&#34; those comments and
        then remove them in subsequent patches. This is the forcing function to address
        all comments: the patch won&#39;t be merged if there are comment unaddressed in
        code; they cannot be ignored or else they will be upstreamed erroneously.
