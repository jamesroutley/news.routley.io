			Notice any inconsistencies?
			Why do some emojis get faces?
			Why are there five different chicken emojis?
			Is a dragon an animal?
			Is a spider web a bug?
			<em>Why is there only one amphibian?</em>
			</p>

			<p>
			Let me propose some more sensible categories.

			<!-- emojii 2.0 and 4.0 had no animals. also, after emoji 5.0, they started aligning versions with unicode, ie. 2018 released emoji 11.0 = unicode 11.0 and so forth

			<p>If you're curious about how an emoji animal is born...

			<p>[TODO - concept and proposal and acceptance of emoji]. Emojis update yearly, around every September. The biggest platforms and vendors (eg Google, Apple, Twitter) usually provide support within a few months of an emoji release. [1] (although Google's Noto Emoji Font is a way to keep up and provide drab emojis in the interim). Less popular platforms take longer to update.</p>

			<p>Fun fact, minor releases like 12.1 and 13.1 include only sequences of existing emojis, as opposed to major releases that can include completely new emojis.</p>
			-->

			<p>
			Watch out for animals like the polar bear 🐻‍❄️.
			If your platform is outdated, you will see a bear 🐻 and a snowflake ❄️ next to each other instead of the new polar bear emoji.
			The service dog, black cat, black bird, and phoenix behave similarly.
			</p>

			<p>
			You will also see a placeholder symbol ￿ for emojis that aren&#39;t supported by your platform.
			To see what the latest emojis look like, check out <a href="https://emojipedia.org/emoji-15.1">emojipedia.org</a>.
			</p>

			<h2 id="by-faces-or-not">BY FACES OR NOT
				<span><a href="#by-faces-or-not">a</a></span>
			</h2>

			<p>
			When one platform renders an animal face, another platform may render the whole animal body.
			I checked each emoji:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span>Only face</span>
🐵 🐶 🐺 🐱 🦁 🐯 🐴 🦄 🐮 🐷 🐗 🐭 🐹 🐰 🐻 🐨 🐼 🐔 🐸 🐲 🦊 🐻‍❄️ 🫎
</li>

<li><span>Whole body</span>
🐒 🐕 🐩 🐈 🐅 🐆 🐎 🐂 🐃 🐄 🐖 🐏 🐑 🐐 🐪 🐫 🐘 🐁 🐀 🐇 🐿️ 🦃 🐓 🐣 🐥 🕊️ 🐊 🐢 🐍 🐉 🐳 🐋 🐬 🐟 🐠 🐡 🐙 🐌 🐛 🐜 🐝 🐞 🕷️ 🦂 🦍 🦌 🦇 🦅 🦆 🦉 🦎 🦈 🦋 🦔 🦕 🦖 🦗 🦙 🦛 🦘 🦡 🦢 🦚 🦜 🦟 🦧 🦮 🐕‍🦺 🦥 🦦 🦨 🦩 🐈‍⬛ 🦬 🦣 🦫 🦤 🦭 🪲 🪳 🪰 🪱 🫏 🐦‍⬛ 🪿 🪼 🐦‍🔥
</li>

<li><span>Depends on the platform</span>
🐤 🐦 🐧 🦏 🦓 🦒 🦝
</li>

<li><span>Not an animal / faceless</span>
🐽 🐾 🐚 🕸️ 🦠 🪶 🪸 🪽
</li>

</ul>

			<p>
			I only checked the renderings for Google, Apple, and Windows emojis.
			Other platforms like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Samsung may have slightly different results.
			If you want to compare emoji renderings across all 20+ platforms, check out emojipedia. Example: <a href="https://emojipedia.org/baby-chick#designs">baby chick emoji designs</a>.

			</p><p>
			Here&#39;s a quirk: of the 23 animal face emojis, only 10 are officially named &#34;face&#34;.
			Maybe we can petition for face-naming updates during Unicode&#39;s next <a href="https://cldr.unicode.org/index#h.y759rma353dj">naming cycle</a>? 
			At least they <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json/blob/cfeefb27ac8f0d6020b158c29078f18f0de11b9a/cldr-json/cldr-annotations-full/annotations/en/annotations.json#L8935C7-L8942C10">annotated animal face emojis</a> with extra keywords.
			</p>

				<!--
			common locale data repository
			<p>These are `CLDR shortnames`, short and descriptive names for each emoji character. These names are gathered per locale over time and accumulate votes from users. The top voted name takes the spot every release, which is ~ every 6 months. This means what is now a `hamster` could later be called a `hamster face`, leading the way for a full bodied hamster emoji to claim a new codepoint (assuming that a whole hamster emoji fits the proposal requirements for the unicode Consortium and becomes approved, which is unlikely 🐹💔)</p>
				-->

			<p>
			This list excludes the nine cat faces and three monkey faces in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230104233637/https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#cat-face">Smileys &amp; Emotion</a> category.
			I&#39;ll also be excluding faceless animal emojis from now on.
			Emojis like paw prints and coral don&#39;t fit the aesthetic.
			</p>

			<h2 id="duplicates">DUPLICATES
				<span><a href="#duplicates">a</a></span>
			</h2>

			<p>
			Some animals have multiple emoji representations:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span>Chicken</span>
🐔 🐓 🐣 🐤 🐥 
</li>
<li><span>Dog</span>
🐶 🐕 🦮 🐕‍🦺 🐩 
</li>
<li><span>Cat</span>
🐱 🐈 🐈‍⬛ 
</li>
<li><span>Pig</span>
🐷 🐖 🐽 
</li>
<li><span>Mouse</span>
🐭 🐁 🐀 
</li>
<li><span>Bird</span>
🐦 🐦‍⬛
</li>
<li><span>Sheep</span>
🐏 🐑 
</li>
<li><span>Camel</span>
🐪 🐫 
</li>
<li><span>Rabbit</span>
🐰 🐇 
</li>
<li><span>Monkey</span>
🐵 🐒 
</li>
<li><span>Tiger</span>
🐯 🐅 
</li>
<li><span>Horse</span>
🐴 🐎 
</li>
<li><span>Cow</span>
🐮 🐄 
</li>
<li><span>Dragon</span>
🐲 🐉
</li>
<li><span>Whale</span>
🐳 🐋
</li>

</ul>

			<p>
			Granted, some of these choices are opinionated.
			Is the one-humped dromedary camel really so different than the two-humped Bactrian camel?
			For people riding on camels, yes.
			But when curating my ideal emoji world, no, we only need one camel.
			</p>

			<p>
			I decided to keep the whole body emojis and exclude the duplicate face emojis moving forward.
			</p>

			<h2 id="by-how-they-move">BY HOW THEY MOVE
				<span><a href="#by-how-they-move">a</a></span>
			</h2>

			<p>
			After some pruning and shuffling, we arrive at my favorite grouping:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span>Terrestrial (grounded)</span>
🐒 🐺 🦁 🐅 🐆 🐎 🦄 🐂 🐃 🐄 🐖 🐗 🐑 🐐 🐪 🐘 🐁 🐹 🐇 🐿️ 🐻 🐨 🐼 🐍 🐉 🦍 🦊 🦌 🦏 🦎 🦓 🦒 🦔 🦕 🦖 🦝 🦙 🦛 🦘 🦡 🦧 🦥 🦨 🦬 🦣 🦫 🐻‍❄️ 🫎 🫏
				</li>
				<li><span>Aquatic (wet)</span>
🐸 🐊 🐢 🐋 🐬 🐟 🐠 🐡 🐙 🦈 🦦 🦭 🪼 🦀 🦐 🦑 🦞
				</li>
				<li><span>Buggy (squishable)</span>
🐌 🐛 🐜 🐝 🐞 🕷️ 🦂 🦋 🦗 🦟 🪲 🪳 🪰 🪱
				</li>
				<li><span>Birdy (winged)</span>
🦃 🐓 🐧 🕊️ 🦇 🦅 🦆 🦉 🦢 🦚 🦜 🦩 🦤 🪿 🐦‍🔥
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			It&#39;s a blend of &#34;by habitat&#34;, &#34;by major vertebrates&#34;, and &#34;by aesthetics&#34;.
			This feels like a fair distribution.
			The amphibian is not so lonely!
			</p>

			<p>
			You&#39;ll notice I added four &#34;food&#34; emojis: the crab, shrimp, squid, and lobster.
			I have no idea why they were assigned &#34;food-marine&#34; instead of &#34;animal-marine&#34;.
			They look happy, healthy, and uncooked.
			Why not put chickens and cows and octopus as food?
			Don&#39;t we already have a fried shrimp emoji?
			I have so many questions, and so few answers.
			</p>

			<h2 id="conclusion">IN CONCLUSION
				<span><a href="#conclusion">a</a></span>
			</h2>

			<p>
			I&#39;m still not sure why there is only one amphibian emoji.
			Maybe a Unicode Consortium member lobbied for salamanders, newts, and toads, but they couldn&#39;t get any traction.
			Maybe they were acting on underground rumors that scientists would discover a slew of new amphibian species.
			</p>

			<p>
			Maybe the amphibian category was just a poor decision.
			It&#39;s hard to design for the future, and it&#39;s easy to get locked into mistakes when preserving backwards compatibility.
			Unicode is an ambitious project.
			Computers are difficult, people are difficult, and the world is full of messy data.
			</p>

			<p>
			But I don&#39;t want to make assumptions.
			I&#39;d love to stop speculating and get answers from the emoji people -- artists, linguists, and anyone contributing to the Unicode Consortium.
			I searched for Unicode forums and discussion threads, but to no avail.
			If you have any insight into emoji animal decisionmaking, let me know!

				<span><a href="#by-popularity">a</a></span>
			</h2>

			<p>This ordering comes from the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee, who released emoji frequency data from 2019 (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zs13WJYdZL1pNZP0dCIXkWau_tZOjK3mmJz0KNq4I30/preview">raw spreadsheet</a>). Their ranking "is based on median frequency of use across multiple sources." Newer emojis tend to be ranked low because they didn't have much time to be adopted. (<a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/">source</a>)</p>

			consider also other popualrity measures and sources, like from emojipedia, or google trends, or scrapingtwitter: https://emojipedia.org/stats

			<p>Kudos to unicode for laying out decent specs and taking on the challenge of internationalizing text, even if there are complaints.

			<p>How did this happen? It seems like emoji adoption moved faster than it could be carefully planned. Now backward compatibility leaves awkward artifacts. For example, if the first animal emoji was a cat, and vendors decided for themselves if they should render a cat face or a cat body, there would be less room to set a standard about faces moving forward.</p>

			<p>This is mostly speculation on my part, trying to decode the history and reasons behind the current state of emoji animals 😿. I haven't looked much into forums or discussions for this sort of thing. Not that there's much easily accessible. I almost found the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/forum/">unicode forum</a>, introduced in 2011, but "a funny thing happened on the way to the forum" and it's gone.</p>
