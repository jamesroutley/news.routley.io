    <h1>getting on the CI train</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, February 19, 2024</em></p><p>If I’m going to be shipping apps by the end of the month, I’d better get CI set up. I’ve been looking around at different options and found:</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><ul><li>Argo Workflows. Probably a taste that goes great with Argo CD, but I’d like to source CI steps from the repos and this seems difficult.</li><li>Tekton: similar.</li><li>Woodpecker: an offshoot of Drone, looks nice, seems to do what I want, but I can’t get the Helm chart working.</li><li>Agola: smaller, maybe newer. Does the normal CI stuff, plus you can define your config in jsonnet. Kind of cool. I’d like to be able to pull in editable build steps though.</li></ul><p>Basically I feel these options are either too complex or too simple or I can’t make them run. I bet if I redid how I’m setting up apps in Argo CD, I could get Woodpecker working. May have to shave that yak!</p><p>Right now the plan is to try a little longer (maybe today and Tuesday) to get Woodpecker working, and to bail and use Agola if I can&#39;t.</p></article></div>
