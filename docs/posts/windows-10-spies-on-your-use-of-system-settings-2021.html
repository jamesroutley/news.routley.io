    <h1>Windows 10 spies on your use of System Settings (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
<p>October 23, 2021 </p> 

<p>I am a big fan of Nir Sofer. He creates <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/">great utilities</a> for Windows and his software is both free and portable. Recently, he released a new DNS logging program <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dns_lookup_view.html">DNSLookupView</a>. </p>

<p>He already had a DNS logging program called  <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dns_query_sniffer.html">DNSQuerySniffer</a> but the new program gets its raw data from a different source. 
So, I have been running both of them side by side to see the pros/cons of each.</p> 

<p>And, while logging DNS requests on a Windows 10 machine, I came across some interesting stuff. The computer in question was running Windows 10 Home Edition, service pack 20H2, build 19042.1083, which means it has bug fixes as of July 6, 2021. It was logged on with a local account, not a Microsoft account. It was also locked down as much as possible. Every customization I could find in the Systems Settings was disabled. Many of the  scheduled telemetry tasks were disabled. </p>

<p>With the DNS logging programs running, I happened to look at the System Settings. </p><p>I didn&#39;t <i>change</i> anything, just <i>looked</i> at a couple settings.</p>
