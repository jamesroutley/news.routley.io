<p><strong><em>How cancel culture is impacting the free trade? The risks from Russia extend to globalization.</em></strong></p>



<p>Jeffrey sonnenfeld is having what he calls a Marshall McLuhan moment—“15 minutes of prominence soon to subside back into obscurity”. That is because, not long after <a href="https://legalresearchandanalysis.com/current-affairs/putins-war-in-europe/vladimir-putin-has-failed-in-his-plan-to-capture-kyiv-with-moscow-on-tuesday-pledging-to-withdraw-forces-from-the-ukrainian-capital">Vladimir Putin</a> sent his troops into <a href="https://legalresearchandanalysis.com/current-affairs/war-in-europe/ukraines-government-is-willing-to-make-big-concessions-to-end-the-war-but-it-doubts-that-russia-is-negotiating-in-good-faith">Ukraine</a> on February 24th, the 68-year-old professor at the Yale School of Management drew up a list of firms withdrawing from <a href="https://legalresearchandanalysis.com/current-affairs/putins-war-in-europe/andrei-kozyrev-says-that-there-can-be-no-return-to-normal-business-with-russia-once-the-war-ends">Russia</a>, helping catalyze a stampede out of the country—470 businesses have closed or cut back operations. His campaign has generated positive media reviews. It has also put him under siege from public-relations types trying to ensure that the companies they represent do not fall into his “hall of shame”.</p>



<p>The “Ukraine morality test”, as the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=New+York+Times+called&amp;rlz=1C1UEAD_enIN996IN996&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">New York Times called</a> it, has dramatically raised the profile of a man already dubbed the “CEO whisperer”. Don’t believe it when he talks about returning to obscurity, though. He sees the withdrawal from Russia not just as a virtuous expression of repugnance against Mr. Putin’s murderous regime. It is also a nail in the coffin of globalization. It would be no surprise if he leads a CEO crusade against that next.</p>



<p>Mr. Sonnenfeld is no stranger to the limelight. Indeed, he has become the high priest of a belief system in Western business which he started promoting almost 45 years ago, and which has at last come into fashion. He calls it business ethics. Its critics deride it as “woke” (“as if there is something wrong with the past participle of awakening,” he harrumphs). There is nothing too woke about why Western firms are pulling out of Russia. Some might call it high-minded but in most cases it is inherently pragmatic. It pleases customers and staff who are outraged by the war, and because Russia is a tiny part of most firms’ global revenues, it is immaterial from an investor point of view.</p>



<p><strong><em>Autocrats in the C-suite</em></strong> </p>



<p>But when businesses wrap themselves in the flag, rather than standing up for pragmatism (and profits), things become more complicated. As bosses are no doubt aware, when pulling out of Russia, they are leaving the field open to local competitors with no qualms about supporting Mr Putin’s regime. They are abandoning Russian employees who may oppose their government. And their crowd-pleasing stance in Russia may help distract attention from other harmful externalities they are responsible for, such as the carbon footprints of their businesses. As with all ideological positions, there is a kaleidoscope of ways of looking at them.</p>
