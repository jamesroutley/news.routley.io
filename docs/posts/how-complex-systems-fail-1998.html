        </h2>
        <p>
          All of the interesting systems (e.g. transportation, healthcare, power
          generation) are inherently and unavoidably hazardous by the own
          nature. The frequency of hazard exposure can sometimes be changed but
          the processes involved in the system are themselves intrinsically and
          irreducibly hazardous. It is the presence of these hazards that drives
          the creation of defenses against hazard that characterize these
          systems.

            failure</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The high consequences of failure lead over time to the construction of
          multiple layers of defense against failure. These defenses include
          obvious technical components (e.g. backup systems, ‘safety’ features
          of equipment) and human components (e.g. training, knowledge) but also
          a variety of organizational, institutional, and regulatory defenses
          (e.g. policies and procedures, certification, work rules, team
          training). The effect of these measures is to provide a series of
          shields that normally divert operations away from accidents.

            not enough.</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The array of defenses works. System operations are generally
          successful. Overt catastrophic failure occurs when small, apparently
          innocuous failures join to create opportunity for a systemic accident.
          Each of these small failures is necessary to cause catastrophe but
          only the combination is sufficient to permit failure. Put another way,
          there are many more failure opportunities than overt system accidents.
          Most initial failure trajectories are blocked by designed system
          safety components. Trajectories that reach the operational level are
          mostly blocked, usually by practitioners.

            them.</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The complexity of these systems makes it impossible for them to run
          without multiple flaws being present. Because these are individually
          insufficient to cause failure they are regarded as minor factors
          during operations. Eradication of all latent failures is limited
          primarily by economic cost but also because it is difficult before the
          fact to see how such failures might contribute to an accident. The
          failures change constantly because of changing technology, work
          organization, and efforts to eradicate failures.

          <a href="#5">Complex systems run in degraded mode.</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A corollary to the preceding point is that complex systems run as
          broken systems. The system continues to function because it contains
          so many redundancies and because people can make it function, despite
          the presence of many flaws. After accident reviews nearly always note
          that the system has a history of prior ‘proto-accidents’ that nearly
          generated catastrophe. Arguments that these degraded conditions should
          have been recognized before the overt accident are usually predicated
          on naïve notions of system performance. System operations are dynamic,
          with components (organizational, human, technical) failing and being
          replaced continuously.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Complex systems possess potential for catastrophic failure. Human
          practitioners are nearly always in close physical and temporal
          proximity to these potential failures – disaster can occur at any time
          and in nearly any place. The potential for catastrophic outcome is a
          hallmark of complex systems. It is impossible to eliminate the
          potential for such catastrophic failure; the potential for such
          failure is always present by the system’s own nature.

            wrong.</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because overt failure requires multiple faults, there is no isolated
          ‘cause’ of an accident. There are multiple contributors to accidents.
          Each of these is necessarily insufficient in itself to create an
          accident. Only jointly are these causes sufficient to create an
          accident. Indeed, it is the linking of these causes together that
          creates the circumstances required for the accident. Thus, no
          isolation of the ‘root cause’ of an accident is possible. The
          evaluations based on such reasoning as ‘root cause’ do not reflect a
          technical understanding of the nature of failure but rather the
          social, cultural need to blame specific, localized forces or events
          for outcomes. <a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

        </h2>
        <p>
          Knowledge of the outcome makes it seem that events leading to the
          outcome should have appeared more salient to practitioners at the time
          than was actually the case. This means that
          <em>ex post facto</em> accident analysis of human performance is
          inaccurate. The outcome knowledge poisons the ability of
          after-accident observers to recreate the view of practitioners before
          the accident of those same factors. It seems that practitioners
          “should have known” that the factors would “inevitably” lead to an
          accident. <a href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

        </h2>
        <p>
          The system practitioners operate the system in order to produce its
          desired product and also work to forestall accidents. This dynamic
          quality of system operation, the balancing of demands for production
          against the possibility of incipient failure is unavoidable. Outsiders
          rarely acknowledge the duality of this role. In non-accident filled
          times, the production role is emphasized. After accidents, the defense
          against failure role is emphasized. At either time, the outsider’s
          view misapprehends the operator’s constant, simultaneous engagement
          with both roles.

        </h2>
        <p>
          After accidents, the overt failure often appears to have been
          inevitable and the practitioner’s actions as blunders or deliberate
          willful disregard of certain impending failure. But all practitioner
          actions are actually gambles, that is, acts that take place in the
          face of uncertain outcomes. The degree of uncertainty may change from
          moment to moment. That practitioner actions are gambles appears clear
          after accidents; in general, <em>post hoc</em> analysis regards these
          gambles as poor ones. But the converse: that successful outcomes are
          also the result of gambles; is not widely appreciated.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Organizations are ambiguous, often intentionally, about the
          relationship between production targets, efficient use of resources,
          economy and costs of operations, and acceptable risks of low and high
          consequence accidents. All ambiguity is resolved by actions of
          practitioners at the sharp end of the system. After an accident,
          practitioner actions may be regarded as ‘errors’ or ‘violations’ but
          these evaluations are heavily biased by hindsight and ignore the other
          driving forces, especially production pressure.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to
          maximize production and minimize accidents. These adaptations often
          occur on a moment by moment basis. Some of these adaptations include:
          (1) Restructuring the system in order to reduce exposure of vulnerable
          parts to failure. (2) Concentrating critical resources in areas of
          expected high demand. (3) Providing pathways for retreat or recovery
          from expected and unexpected faults. (4) Establishing means for early
          detection of changed system performance in order to allow graceful
          cutbacks in production or other means of increasing resiliency.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Complex systems require substantial human expertise in their operation
          and management. This expertise changes in character as technology
          changes but it also changes because of the need to replace experts who
          leave. In every case, training and refinement of skill and expertise
          is one part of the function of the system itself. At any moment,
          therefore, a given complex system will contain practitioners and
          trainees with varying degrees of expertise. Critical issues related to
          expertise arise from (1) the need to use scarce expertise as a
          resource for the most difficult or demanding production needs and (2)
          the need to develop expertise for future use.

        </h2>
        <p>
          The low rate of overt accidents in reliable systems may encourage
          changes, especially the use of new technology, to decrease the number
          of low consequence but high frequency failures. These changes maybe
          actually create opportunities for new, low frequency but high
          consequence failures. When new technologies are used to eliminate well
          understood system failures or to gain high precision performance they
          often introduce new pathways to large scale, catastrophic failures.
          Not uncommonly, these new, rare catastrophes have even greater impact
          than those eliminated by the new technology. These new forms of
          failure are difficult to see before the fact; attention is paid mostly
          to the putative beneficial characteristics of the changes. Because
          these new, high consequence accidents occur at a low rate, multiple
          system changes may occur before an accident, making it hard to see the
          contribution of technology to the failure.

        <p>
          Post-accident remedies for “human error” are usually predicated on
          obstructing activities that can “cause” accidents. These
          end-of-the-chain measures do little to reduce the likelihood of
          further accidents. In fact that likelihood of an identical accident is
          already extraordinarily low because the pattern of latent failures
          changes constantly. Instead of increasing safety, post-accident
          remedies usually increase the coupling and complexity of the system.
          This increases the potential number of latent failures and also makes
          the detection and blocking of accident trajectories more difficult.

        <p>
          Safety is an emergent property of systems; it does not reside in a
          person, device or department of an organization or system. Safety
          cannot be purchased or manufactured; it is not a feature that is
          separate from the other components of the system. This means that
          safety cannot be manipulated like a feedstock or raw material. The
          state of safety in any system is always dynamic; continuous systemic
          change insures that hazard and its management are constantly changing.

          Failure free operations are the result of activities of people who
          work to keep the system within the boundaries of tolerable
          performance. These activities are, for the most part, part of normal
          operations and superficially straightforward. But because system
          operations are never trouble free, human practitioner adaptations to
          changing conditions actually create safety from moment to moment.
          These adaptations often amount to just the selection of a
          well-rehearsed routine from a store of available responses; sometimes,
          however, the adaptations are novel combinations or de novo creations
          of new approaches.

        <p>
          Recognizing hazard and successfully manipulating system operations to
          remain inside the tolerable performance boundaries requires intimate
          contact with failure. More robust system performance is likely to
          arise in systems where operators can discern the “edge of the
          envelope”. This is where system performance begins to deteriorate,
          becomes difficult to predict, or cannot be readily recovered. In
          intrinsically hazardous systems, operators are expected to encounter
          and appreciate hazards in ways that lead to overall performance that
          is desirable. Improved safety depends on providing operators with
          calibrated views of the hazards. It also depends on providing
          calibration about how their actions move system performance towards or
          away from the edge of the envelope.
