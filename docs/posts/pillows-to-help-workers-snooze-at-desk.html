    OSAKA -- A new pillow developed by an Osaka firm in pursuit of a comfortable nap at the office is attracting attention. Inspired by a portable massage chair, the product is hooked onto a desk and supports the face and chest as the napping worker leans forward.

<p>
    The &#34;Gogo no Makura,&#34; or afternoon pillow, was developed by Atex Co., a company dealing with health equipment and bedding. Natsuki Sato, 43, who was in charge of development, became interested in her colleagues who were napping with their faces down on their desks. 
</p>
<p>
    Sato personally does not take naps in her office, but she interviewed about 20 people. The talk revealed that many workers purposefully take naps in order to be active in the afternoon. When napping, they said, the importing things for them were to make sure their head didn&#39;t move about, to avoid putting pressure on internal organs, and to avert breathing difficulties.
</p>
<p>
    In many cases, sleeping face down on a desk causes excessive tension in the shoulders and other parts of the body, resulting in numbness in the arms and other areas. Developers of the desk cushion were particularly conscious of maintaining a comfortable sleeping posture on the chair, and drew inspiration from portable massage chairs, in which the user leans forward and presses his or her face against the chair while receiving the treatment.

    The new pillow is 31 centimeters long and 24 cm wide, and is designed to support the head and other parts of the body, with a hole in the center where the face meets the pillow to facilitate breathing and prevent sleep marks. The angle can be adjusted in three levels (10 to 45 degrees), and a timer can be set for up to 60 minutes in one-minute increments, with a vibration gently waking the user when the time is up. It can also be hung on a chair for storage.
</p>
<p>
    The company began accepting reservations in early August on a crowdfunding site aimed at supporting craftsmanship, and approximately 490 people applied, exceeding expectations. The sleeping item will be available at electronics retailers and other stores from Oct. 15.
</p>
<p>
    Sato said, &#34;You can sleep comfortably without putting unnecessary stress on your body. I hope this product will change the image of napping in the office to one that is smart both when sleeping and when waking up.&#34;
</p>
<p>
    The pillow is available in gray only, and the suggested retail price is 8,800 yen (about $58). For inquiries, call the company on weekdays at 0120-486-505 (in Japanese).
