    <h1>SaaS Companies Need to Let Their Customers Vibe Code on Top of Their Tools</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    
      <p>I’ve spent the last few months talking to B2B SaaS vendors and I noticed a common pattern: “Our product is more powerful than ever, but customers aren’t using half of it.”</p>

<p><strong>This is the silent crisis in B2B SaaS right now.</strong> You’re losing deals and renewals not because your product lacks features, but because customers can’t make your rigid platform match their actual processes.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-consolidation-wave-youre-not-ready-for">The Consolidation Wave You’re Not Ready For</h2>

<p>The average enterprise now manages 275 SaaS applications at $49M in annual spend, <a href="https://zylo.com/reports/2025-saas-management-index/">according to Zylo’s data</a>. That’s a 9.3% year-over-year increase in spending while portfolios only grew 2.2%.</p>

<p>Read that again: <strong>vendors raised prices 4x faster than companies added new tools.</strong></p>

<p>CFOs are noticing. CIOs are noticing. And when renewal season comes, they’re asking one question that should terrify every B2B SaaS vendor:</p>

<p><strong>“What’s our actual utilization rate on this platform?”</strong></p>

<p>If the answer is “60% of licenses are active but users only touch 30% of the features because our workflows don’t match theirs,” you’re toast. You’re the first thing cut when consolidation pressure hits.</p>

<h2 id="the-engineering-death-spiral">The Engineering Death Spiral</h2>

<p>Here’s what’s killing you: every customer has slightly different workflows. Your ERP works great if you do approvals <em>exactly</em> the way you designed it. Your CRM is powerful if you follow your opinionated process.</p>

<p>But no two enterprises run the same way. Customer A needs three approval stages. Customer B needs five, with different routing logic. Customer C needs to pull data from systems you’ve never heard of.</p>

<p>So what happens?</p>

<p>Your sales team promises “we can customize that” to close the deal. Then your customer-facing teams discover the customization requires engineering work. Engineering says “we’ll prioritize it for Q3.” Q3 becomes Q1 next year. Meanwhile, the customer is manually working around your rigid workflows, adoption tanks, and at renewal they say “we’re not getting value.”</p>

<p><strong>You’re caught in a death spiral:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Rigid platform → low adoption</li>
  <li>Low adoption → customers request workflow changes</li>
  <li>Changes require engineering → long wait times</li>
  <li>Long wait times → deals stall, adoption suffers, renewals at risk</li>
  <li>Lost revenue → pressure to raise prices on remaining customers</li>
  <li>Higher prices + same adoption problems = more churn</li>
</ol>

<p>And the worst part? <strong>Your competitors who solve this problem will eat your customers during the consolidation wave.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-roi-measurement-problem">The ROI Measurement Problem</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-net-revenue-retention-advantage-driving-success-in-b2b-tech">McKinsey reports</a> that B2B buyers are increasingly demanding performance guarantees and outcome-based pricing. They’re done paying for “powerful platforms” that sit mostly unused.</p>

<p>When a CFO scrutinizes that $49M SaaS portfolio, underutilized platforms get axed. Period.</p>

<p>The problem is that your platform <em>could</em> drive massive ROI—if customers could actually adapt it to their workflows without waiting 8 months for engineering. But they can’t, so adoption stays low, and low adoption reads as “no ROI” when renewal comes.</p>

<p>You’re losing deals not because your product is bad, but because <strong>you can’t prove ROI fast enough in a world where every SaaS dollar is under scrutiny.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-customer-facing-team-bottleneck">The Customer-Facing Team Bottleneck</h2>

<p>Here’s the answer nobody wants to hear: <strong>your customer-facing teams need to deliver workflow customizations directly.</strong></p>

<p>Not engineering. Not after a 6-month roadmap process. <em>Directly.</em></p>

<p>Your Customer Success, Solutions, Implementation, and Sales teams are the ones who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actually understand customer workflows</li>
  <li>Have relationships with customer stakeholders</li>
  <li>Know exactly what’s blocking adoption and expansion</li>
  <li>Are already measured on retention, growth, and deal velocity</li>
  <li>See the same workflow patterns across multiple customers</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, these teams are glorified ticket filers. Customer needs a workflow adjustment? File a feature request. Customer wants custom approval routing? Add it to the backlog. Customer struggling with adoption because your UI doesn’t match their process? Send them “best practices” documentation.</p>

<p>Then they watch the deal stall, the renewal at risk, the expansion conversation die—all because engineering won’t prioritize a workflow change that affects 15 customers when there’s core product work to ship.</p>

<p><strong>This is what’s killing your growth.</strong> The people who can drive adoption, expansion, and retention are blocked from doing their job by engineering capacity constraints.</p>

<p>What if when your Implementation team discovered that 20 customers struggle with the same workflow, they could <em>deliver a solution</em> in days instead of filing a request that dies in the backlog?</p>

<p>This is what <strong>business vibe coding</strong> enables.</p>

<p>While “vibe coding” has become synonymous with amateurs building weekend projects through AI prompts, business vibe coding brings that speed to enterprise—governed, audited, and built by customer-facing professionals who understand business requirements. It’s customer-facing teams delivering custom apps that sit on top of your platform, dramatically improving adoption without touching your engineering roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-unlocks">What This Unlocks</h2>

<p>Let me get specific about the outcomes this enables:</p>

<p><strong>Faster deal velocity:</strong>
Your Sales Engineer discovers a prospect needs custom approval routing to close the deal. Instead of “we can build that in Q3,” they deliver a working solution during the POC. Deal closes.</p>

<p><strong>Higher adoption rates:</strong>
Your Implementation team sees customers struggling with a 12-click process. They build a 2-click shortcut that matches the customer’s actual workflow. Adoption improves, expansion conversations start.</p>

<p><strong>Retention defense:</strong>
Your Customer Success team identifies renewal risk because the platform doesn’t match the customer’s evolved process. They deliver workflow adjustments in days instead of waiting for engineering. Customer renews.</p>

<p><strong>Expansion without headcount:</strong>
Your Solutions team builds workflow patterns once, deploys across 50 similar customers. You scale delivery without linearly scaling professional services headcount.</p>

<p>This isn’t about who builds it. It’s about <strong>unlocking your customer-facing teams to deliver the customizations that drive revenue without engineering dependencies.</strong></p>

<p>For an ERP, that’s custom approval workflows and dashboard views. For a CRM, it’s deal review shortcuts and custom scoring logic. For ITSM, it’s incident playbooks and routing automation.</p>

<p>None of it requires your core engineering team. None of it takes months. But all of it directly impacts adoption, expansion, and retention—the metrics that determine whether you survive consolidation.</p>

<h2 id="the-maintenance-question">The Maintenance Question</h2>

<p>“Won’t this create technical debt?”</p>

<p>Only if you build it wrong.</p>

<p>The system itself should enforce constraints, since most workflow customizations follow predictable patterns. Quote approvals. Deal reviews. Incident routing. The first customer’s custom workflow becomes a template for the next 50. <strong>You’re building a library, not bespoke software for each customer.</strong></p>

<p>And unlike the invisible complexity you have now—spreadsheet workarounds, undocumented processes, one-off feature requests—this is visible, governed, and measurable. You can track what drives adoption, deprecate what doesn’t, and scale what works.</p>

<h2 id="why-now-is-urgent">Why Now Is Urgent</h2>

<p>Two forces are colliding that make this not just possible, but <em>necessary for survival</em>:</p>

<p><strong>1. Market pressure makes slow customization lethal</strong></p>

<p>You’re raising prices 10-20% annually while budgets grow at 2.8%. Every dollar is under scrutiny. Underutilized platforms get cut, and “we’ll add that workflow in Q3” isn’t good enough when competitors can deliver it in a week.</p>

<p>The consolidation wave is here. Vendors who can’t prove ROI quickly will lose customers to those who can.</p>

<p><strong>2. AI makes customer-facing team delivery actually viable</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences">Gartner’s prediction</a> that 70% of new apps would use low-code/no-code by 2025 landed right as AI-assisted development exploded.</p>

<p>Customer-facing teams can now build functional workflow solutions without engineering degrees. The tooling has caught up to the need. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-chair-vibe-coding-not-endgame-bret-taylor-2026-1">Even OpenAI’s chair acknowledges</a> that “vibe coding” is here to stay as a legitimate development approach.</p>

<p>Your customer-facing teams can either keep filing feature requests that die in the backlog, or they can start delivering solutions. The technology barrier is gone.</p>

<h2 id="from-blocker-to-accelerator">From Blocker to Accelerator</h2>

<p>Here’s the business model shift: <a href="https://media.trustradius.com/product-downloadables/ZZ/AH/VWHXTSL23TP3.pdf">customer-facing teams are evolving</a> from order-takers to value delivery engines.</p>

<p>Right now, these teams are bottlenecked. Sales can’t close deals that need workflow customization. Implementation can’t drive adoption when your platform doesn’t match customer processes. CS can’t defend renewals when workflow friction kills utilization.</p>

<p>The workflow that’s killing you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Customer needs workflow adjustment to get value</li>
  <li>Customer-facing team files feature request</li>
  <li>Engineering prioritizes it for “next quarter”</li>
  <li>Deal stalls / adoption tanks / renewal at risk</li>
</ol>

<p>The workflow that wins:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Customer-facing team identifies workflow need</li>
  <li>Team delivers working solution in days</li>
  <li>Customer sees immediate value</li>
  <li>Deal closes / adoption improves / expansion conversation starts</li>
</ol>

<p>One Solutions Engineer can build workflow patterns that unlock revenue across hundreds of customers. One Implementation specialist can solve adoption blockers that would otherwise take quarters to address.</p>

<p>Your competitors with rigid platforms and 6-month engineering cycles can’t compete with that. Their customers get told “we’ll add that to the roadmap.” Your customers get working solutions before the next renewal cycle.</p>

<h2 id="the-vendors-who-survive-consolidation">The Vendors Who Survive Consolidation</h2>

<p>In three years, the B2B SaaS landscape will look very different.</p>

<p>There will be vendors who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prove ROI in weeks instead of quarters</li>
  <li>Scale CS without linearly scaling headcount</li>
  <li>Turn adoption problems into expansion opportunities</li>
  <li>Defend against churn with actual workflow value, not just contracts</li>
</ul>

<p>And there will be vendors who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep telling customers “we’ll add that to the roadmap”</li>
  <li>Watch adoption metrics slowly decline</li>
  <li>See renewal rates erode as CFOs scrutinize utilization</li>
  <li>Get replaced by competitors who adapted faster</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The difference isn’t product features. It’s workflow flexibility.</strong></p>

<p>When SaaS portfolios are under intense budget scrutiny, when prices are rising 4x faster than budgets, when every dollar needs to justify itself—the vendors who win are the ones who make it <em>trivially easy</em> for customers to prove ROI.</p>

<p>And you can’t prove ROI when your platform forces customers to choose between “our rigid workflow” and “don’t use the platform.”</p>

<h2 id="what-this-gets-you">What This Gets You</h2>

<p>Business vibe coding is about <strong>enabling the people who understand customer requirements to deliver custom apps that drive adoption, expansion, and retention without engineering dependencies.</strong></p>

<p>It’s about turning customizations from a blocker into a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>It’s about surviving the consolidation wave that’s coming for every B2B SaaS vendor who can’t prove they’re worth keeping.</p>

<p>The technology exists. The market pressure is real.</p>

<p>The question is: whether you’ll adapt, or will your customers choose a vendor who already did.</p>
