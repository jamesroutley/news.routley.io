    <h1>Most STEM grads don&#39;t work in STEM jobs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="articleBody"><section><p>Republicans and Democrats don’t seem to agree on much these days. But despite the gridlock in Congress, both political parties have for years supported spending billions on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education. Their goals include reducing perceived shortages of STEM workers, boosting American innovation and competitiveness and diversifying this highly paid workforce. The message of lucrative STEM careers appears to have reached students and tuition-paying parents — the number of STEM majors has surged in recent years.</p><figure itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><picture><source type="image/webP" srcset="https://www.tampabay.com/resizer//niQcFZ7CO-yamOCHsX12ZdZXyl8=/200x0/filters:focal(1173x709:1183x699):format(webP)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/2OWNLSESLVFMZEEXT454UJWIDA.jpeg"/><source srcset="https://www.tampabay.com/resizer//sUpOhlioBGLP8X1_Pc9qPMScUls=/200x0/filters:focal(1173x709:1183x699)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/2OWNLSESLVFMZEEXT454UJWIDA.jpeg"/><img alt="John D.

The Census Bureau reported in 2021 that a paltry 28% of STEM grads are working in these supposedly in-demand, highly paid and important STEM jobs. These include diverse sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals and energy, but about half of STEM jobs are in computers, and tech firms typically complain the loudest of STEM shortages.</p><p>What’s causing this disconnect? It’s pretty straightforward: Employers, and the investors who drive their behavior, depress the national returns on STEM education investments.</p><p>One key factor is wages. Many able STEM grads bolt for better-paying careers, especially in business, finance, management and medicine (government programs focused on STEM exclude medical practitioners and are not designed to increase those numbers). Some do find high salaries in STEM jobs, many right out of college, especially in hot fields such as AI. But STEM grads even in the most dynamic sectors, including computer science and engineering, see their salary advantage fade over time, increasing the odds that they’ll leave for greener pastures.</p><p>It is employers, of course, who set wages at their firms, and current wage levels are not keeping most STEM grads in STEM jobs. Some of the wealthiest companies — Apple, Google, Adobe Systems and Intel — settled a class-action lawsuit for $415 million in 2015 after workers alleged employers used illegal means to prevent salary increases. Employers also incentivize moves from technical work to management with higher salaries at their own firms, yet many bemoan a shortage of technical STEM workers, not managers.</p><p>STEM grads may also flee the “burn-and-churn” management common in STEM jobs. We’ve been bombarded by images of young, happy-go-lucky STEM workers playing foosball and skateboarding to free snacks or meditation pods. But the more common experience, especially in tech, is grueling “crunch time” to rush a product out the door while worrying about the next performance review.</p><p>Media accounts of the most famous companies describe workplaces that are aggressive, both for employees and for the “shadow workforce” toiling on short-term contracts. This work stress affects both physical and mental health. Employees at Uber, Facebook and Google have taken their own lives, prompting discussion of the role of workplace culture in their deaths.</p><p>Adding to the stress is the constant threat of layoffs. Even the richest firms regularly shed STEM workers as technologies or markets change or investors demand cost reductions. When Elon Musk took over Twitter and sacked more than half the workforce, other CEOs cheered. Musk was hardly a STEM trailblazer; workers in the high-demand field of IT are more likely to face layoffs than workers in most other industries. Especially vulnerable are expensive older workers and those who didn’t, or couldn’t, self-train to keep their skills relevant — an increasingly important practice because employer-provided training has dwindled over recent decades.</p><div><div><figure itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><picture><source type="image/webP" media="(max-width: 426px)" srcset="https://www.tampabay.com/resizer//6X_kIz1mONL1EX-w9Q4FjSI31Lc=/426x0/smart/filters:format(webP)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/X6J6Q27TTNAGLLLDIFPLNBLL7I.JPG"/><source media="(max-width: 426px)" srcset="https://www.tampabay.com/resizer//vLxg_Y7hmYsL_q1lC8DCE0Y_7rw=/426x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/X6J6Q27TTNAGLLLDIFPLNBLL7I.JPG"/><source type="image/webP" media="(min-width: 427px)" srcset="https://www.tampabay.com/resizer//DYHEX0JFymPRJ06a4rHpitvEB5Y=/620x0/smart/filters:format(webP)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/X6J6Q27TTNAGLLLDIFPLNBLL7I.JPG"/><source media="(min-width: 427px)" srcset="https://www.tampabay.com/resizer//feF70-3EKThTfn_mRsorgRas3BQ=/620x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/X6J6Q27TTNAGLLLDIFPLNBLL7I.JPG"/><img alt="Spend your days with Hayes" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 620 620&#34;/%3E" title="Spend your days with Hayes" itemprop="image" width="620" height="auto"/><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.tampabay.com/resizer//vLxg_Y7hmYsL_q1lC8DCE0Y_7rw=/426x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/X6J6Q27TTNAGLLLDIFPLNBLL7I.JPG"/><meta itemprop="width" content="620"/><meta itemprop="height" content="620"/></picture></div></figure></div><div><div><h2>Spend your days with Hayes</h2><p>Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter</p><div><p>Columnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.</p></div></div><div><svg viewBox="0 0 24 25"><path d="M9.6 18.326L3.6 12.326L5.292 10.622L9.6 14.93L18.708 5.82205L20.4 7.52605L9.6 18.326ZM12 0.32605C10.4241 0.32605 8.86371 0.636439 7.4078 1.2395C5.95189 1.84255 4.62902 2.72647 3.51472 3.84077C1.26428 6.09121 0 9.14345 0 12.326C0 15.5086 1.26428 18.5609 3.51472 20.8113C4.62902 21.9256 5.95189 22.8095 7.4078 23.4126C8.86371 24.0157 10.4241 24.326 12 24.326C15.1826 24.326 18.2348 23.0618 20.4853 20.8113C22.7357 18.5609 24 15.5086 24 12.326C24 10.7502 23.6896 9.18976 23.0866 7.73385C22.4835 6.27794 21.5996 4.95507 20.4853 3.84077C19.371 2.72647 18.0481 1.84255 16.5922 1.2395C15.1363 0.636439 13.5759 0.32605 12 0.32605Z"></path></svg><h2>You’re all signed up!</h2><p>Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox?<!-- --> <strong>Let’s get started.</strong></p><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/newsletters/" data-tbtevent="link" data-tbtcategory="Newsletter Sign Up Form" data-tbtlabel="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;All newsletters link&#34;}">Explore all your options<svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M18.2334 9.32605C18.2334 11.713 17.2852 14.0022 15.5974 15.69C13.9095 17.3778 11.6203 18.326 9.2334 18.326C8.0515 18.326 6.88118 18.0933 5.78925 17.641C4.69732 17.1887 3.70516 16.5257 2.86944 15.69C1.18161 14.0022 0.233398 11.713 0.233398 9.32605C0.233398 6.9391 1.18161 4.64992 2.86944 2.96209C4.55726 1.27426 6.84645 0.32605 9.2334 0.32605C10.4153 0.32605 11.5856 0.558842 12.6775 1.01113C13.7695 1.46343 14.7616 2.12636 15.5974 2.96209C16.4331 3.79782 17.096 4.78997 17.5483 5.8819C18.0006 6.97383 18.2334 8.14415 18.2334 9.32605ZM3.8334 10.226H11.0334L7.8834 13.376L9.1614 14.654L14.4894 9.32605L9.1614 3.99805L7.8834 5.27605L11.0334 8.42605H3.8334V10.226Z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div><p>Employers facing STEM shortages should bend over backward to keep their scarce talent. Instead, research finds that STEM employers maintain unwelcoming environments for older workers as well as women and underrepresented minorities. Sheryl Sandberg, the former COO of Facebook (now Meta), blamed Facebook’s dearth of female software developers on universities and society for not graduating more female computer science and engineering majors. But why would women choose a sector where the numbers indicate they aren’t welcome? Where even blatant sexual harassment can go unpunished?</p><p>Some STEM grads also reject STEM jobs because so many are meaningless or even harmful. Workers have fled social media companies following concerns that they spread misinformation, erode democracy and foster teen depression. Fossil fuel companies struggle for STEM talent due to their damage to the planet. Trillion-dollar tech companies are often accused of unfair trade practices and “surveillance capitalism” that mines users for personal data. STEM grads who want to make the world a better place may struggle to find a fit.</p><p>The poor return on investments in STEM education can improve. Employers facing STEM worker shortages must understand that their wounds are self-inflicted. They can raise wages, utilize worker-friendly management, retrain obsolete workers rather than lay them off, follow best practices on workplace inclusiveness and eschew destructive business models.</p><p>But investors repeatedly reward employers for treating STEM grads like fast fashion — discarded when broken or no longer appealing — or for deploying STEM skills in lucrative yet harmful business models. A better return on STEM education will require corporations to move away from maximizing short-term shareholder value and consider more stakeholders and moral limits on money making. Meanwhile, governments can lure investors to put more money in planet-saving technologies, as Congress did with the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>Without these or similar shifts, STEM majors will continue to be oversold.</p><p><i>John D.
