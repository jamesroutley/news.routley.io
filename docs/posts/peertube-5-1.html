    <h1>PeerTube 5.1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Version 5.1 of PeerTube has been released! On the menu: moderation of account creation, a button to resume live broadcasting, improved management of external authentication plugins... and other useful developments. Let&#39;s take a tour of the new features!</p>
<h4>Moderated account creation requests</h4>
<p>First new feature in this minor release: account creation requests <a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#registration-approval" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can now be validated a priori</a> by administrators.</p>
<p>When this feature is enabled and a person registers on an instance, they will have to fill in a field (such as &#34;<em>Why do I want to create an account on this platform?</em>&#34;) and then wait for their registration to be validated before they can access their account.</p>

<p>The moderators see the different requests and can accept or reject them.</p>

<p>An email is sent directly to the user when the request is processed. The account is automatically created when the request is approved.</p>

<p>In this way, we hope to allow different instances to reopen their registrations without risking potential waves of spam.</p>
<h4>New &#34;Resume Live&#34; button</h4>
<p>A &#34;resume live&#34; button has been added to the player! The button is red when the player is synchronized with the current live stream and grey when it is not. <strong>A single click to resynchronise the live stream</strong> is quite handy!</p>

<h4>Improved management of external authentication plugins</h4>
<p>Developers will be able to take advantage of an <strong>improvement to the API <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#pluginsthemesembed-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for external authentication plugins</a></strong>: define a quota for users, update users or implement an automatic redirect to the external service when a session expires. These improvements were financed by the Department of Public Education (DIP) of the State of Geneva. Thanks!</p>
<h4>And more...</h4>
<p>This version has seen various improvements to the accessibility of the interface, as well as performance improvements (optimized rendering of the home page editor and more efficient comment retrieval).</p>
<p>Another development worth mentioning is the arrival of two new languages: Icelandic and Ukrainian. Thanks to the contributors for these translations!</p>
<p>We have also fixed many bugs reported by the community. We are now up to <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 4000 tickets processed</a> since the beginning of the PeerTube project, and that seems huge! This time spent improving, maintaining and supporting the software is <strong>funded directly by you</strong>, <a href="https://support.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">through your donations</a>. Thank you very much!</p>
<p>We hope you find this new version useful and we thank again all PeerTube contributors!</p>
