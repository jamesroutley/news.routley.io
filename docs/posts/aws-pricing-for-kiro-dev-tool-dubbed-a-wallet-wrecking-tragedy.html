    <h1>AWS pricing for Kiro dev tool dubbed &#39;a wallet-wrecking tragedy&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>AWS has introduced new pricing for Kiro, its AI-driven coding tool, but unlike the pricing originally announced, the latest plans are &#34;a wallet-wrecking tragedy,&#34; according to many of its users.</p>
<p>&#34;Kiro&#39;s spec-driven AI IDE is a gem,&#34; said open source PHP and Laravel engineer Antonio Ribeiro <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/2182">on GitHub</a>, &#34;until I saw your new pricing.&#34;</p>
<p>AWS introduced Kiro last month as a fork of Code OSS (also used by Visual Studio Code) with a distinctive approach to AI coding assistance, based on specifications and tasks.</p>

    

<p>&#34;Coming soon&#34; pricing was shown from the start, and looked reasonable, as we <a target="_blank" href="https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/">reported</a> in our initial hands-on. There were three plans, with free offering 50 interactions per month, Pro at $19.00 per user/month with 1,000 interactions, and Pro+ at $39.00 with 3,000 interactions. Additional interactions were to be $0.04 each.</p>

        


        

<p>Kiro proved immediately popular. A waitlist was introduced and the pricing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/aws_kiro_usage_cap/">disappeared</a>. Last week, new pricing was announced, and to nobody&#39;s surprise it is less generous.</p>
<p>AWS now defines two types of Kiro AI request. Spec requests are those started from tasks, while vibe requests are general chat responses. Executing a sub-task consumes at least one spec request plus a vibe request for &#34;coordination,&#34; according to an <a target="_blank" href="https://kiro.dev/blog/understanding-kiro-pricing-specs-vibes-usage-tracking/">explanatory post</a>. AWS has also given itself scope to consume more requests for a task or chat depending on complexity, whereas at the initial launch AWS developer advocate Nathan Peck reassured developers that a single interaction might be one that &#34;potentially runs for 3-5 minutes of Kiro iterating away on writing code.&#34;</p>

        

<p>The revised pricing has a free tier with 50 vibe requests (yes, no spec requests at all); Pro at $20 with 225 vibe and 125 spec; Pro+ with 450 vibe and 250 spec; and Power at $200 with 2,250 vibe and 1,250 spec. Additional vibe requests are $0.04 each, while spec requests cost five times more, $0.20 each.</p>

</ul>
<p>&#34;Let&#39;s crunch the numbers,&#34; said Ribeiro. For light coding, he uses at least 3,000 spec requests per month, while he hardly uses vibe requests at all. &#34;Vibe requests are useless because the vibe agent constantly nags me to switch to spec requests, claiming my chats are &#39;too complex&#39;,&#34; he reported. He estimated that light coding will cost him around $550 per month and full time coding around $1,950 per month. As an open source developer who builds for the community, &#34;this pricing is a kick in the shins,&#34; he said.</p>
<p>Another GitHub issue on the subject <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/2171">complains</a> that the Pro+ allocated monthly limits &#34;were completely consumed within 15 minutes of usage in a single chat session.&#34;</p>
<p>Likewise, the Kiro Discord community includes many complaints about the opaque pricing and the surprising number of requests consumed, many more than the documentation suggests. &#34;In practice, when I make one request, Kiro has already consumed four to six vibe requests. It never consumes just one,&#34; said one comment.</p>
<p>According to Ribeiro, Kiro&#39;s competitors are cheaper by a wide margin, including Amazon Q, which costs $40 for 3,000 requests, Trae, which has unlimited requests (but can be slow), and Windsurf, which is &#34;way more affordable for experimenting.&#34;</p>

        

<p>We have asked Amazon for comment.</p>
<p>Views vary on the value of AI for developers, but the Kiro pricing issue shows another kind of risk – that costs can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/15/are_you_willing_to_pay/">escalate unexpectedly</a>. ®</p>
