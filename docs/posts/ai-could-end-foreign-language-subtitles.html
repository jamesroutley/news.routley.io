    <h1>AI could end foreign-language subtitles</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AI companies are developing methods to interpret and synthesize voices in ads, movies and TV.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The advances in voice synthesis could help fix bad movie dubbing — and they come as international content is becoming increasingly important to studios and streaming platforms as part of the <a data-vars-link-text="globalization of entertainment" data-vars-click-url="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-0908-3" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-0908-3" target="_blank">globalization of entertainment</a>.</p><ul><li>But they raise concerns about the possibility of deepfaking audio, as well as how a celebrity&#39;s voice might be used after their death.</li></ul><p><strong>What&#39;s happening: </strong>Foreign-language hits like &#34;Squid Game&#34; and &#34;La Casa de Papel&#34; are <a data-vars-link-text="drawing record audiences" data-vars-click-url="https://entertainmentstrategyguy.com/2021/10/13/did-squid-game-steal-money-heists-crown-as-biggest-international-title/" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://entertainmentstrategyguy.com/2021/10/13/did-squid-game-steal-money-heists-crown-as-biggest-international-title/" target="_blank">drawing record audiences</a>, but subtitles are still a stumbling block for studios trying to tap a growing international market.</p><ul><li>More Netflix subscribers watched <a data-vars-link-text="dubbed versions" data-vars-click-url="https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/video/netflix-squid-game-dubbing-strategy-103000319.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/video/netflix-squid-game-dubbing-strategy-103000319.html" target="_blank">dubbed versions</a> of &#34;Squid Game&#34; than subtitled versions.</li><li>With blockbusters sucking up a lot of bandwidth, smaller producers of foreign-language content are <a data-vars-link-text="having a hard time" data-vars-click-url="https://restofworld.org/2021/lost-in-translation-the-global-streaming-boom-is-creating-a-translator-shortage/" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://restofworld.org/2021/lost-in-translation-the-global-streaming-boom-is-creating-a-translator-shortage/" target="_blank">having a hard time</a> finding enough interpreters and voice-over actors to meet demand.</li><li>&#34;We&#39;re still stuck in the mindset of the one-to-many broadcasting model,&#34; says Ryan Steelberg, co-founder and president of AI company Veritone.</li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>Veritone has <a data-vars-link-text="developed a product called MARVEL.ai" data-vars-click-url="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210514005132/en/Veritone-Launches-MARVEL.ai-a-Complete-End-to-End-Voice-as-a-Service-Solution-to-Create-and-Monetize-Hyper-Realistic-Synthetic-Voice-Content-at-Commercial-Scale" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210514005132/en/Veritone-Launches-MARVEL.ai-a-Complete-End-to-End-Voice-as-a-Service-Solution-to-Create-and-Monetize-Hyper-Realistic-Synthetic-Voice-Content-at-Commercial-Scale" target="_blank">developed a product called MARVEL.ai</a> that allows content producers to generate and license what it calls &#34;hyper-realistic&#34; synthetic voices.</p><ul><li>This means, for example, podcast creators could have audio ad copy interpreted into another language and then MARVEL.ai will generate a synthetic version of their voice reading the ad in the new language.</li><li>&#34;It gives you the ability to hyper-personalize audio on a much bigger scale and at less cost,&#34; says Steelberg.</li></ul><p><strong>How it works: </strong>Text-to-speech technology has existed for decades, but Veritone&#39;s product makes use of &#34;speech-to-speech,&#34; what Steelberg calls &#34;voice as a service.&#34;</p><ul><li>Veritone has access to petabytes of data from media libraries and uses that to train its AI product, creating a synthetic version of the original voice that can be tuned for different kinds of sentiment or emotion, or with interpretation, speak a foreign language.</li><li>&#34;It&#39;s no longer going to be another person&#39;s new voice speaking on behalf of, say, Tom Cruise,&#34; says Steelberg. &#34;It&#39;s really going to be Tom Cruise&#39;s voice speaking another language.&#34;</li><li>Nvidia <a data-vars-link-text="has been developing technology" data-vars-click-url="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/breakthrough-ai-technique-could-revolutionize-the-animation-industry/" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/breakthrough-ai-technique-could-revolutionize-the-animation-industry/" target="_blank">has been developing technology</a> that would allow AI to alter video or animation in a way that takes an actor&#39;s lips and facial expression and matches it with the new language — so no more out-of-sync dubbing like <a data-vars-link-text="in 1970s-era kung-fu movies" data-vars-click-url="https://www.talkbass.com/threads/horribly-dubbed-kung-fu-movies.1002382/" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.talkbass.com/threads/horribly-dubbed-kung-fu-movies.1002382/" target="_blank">in 1970s-era kung-fu movies</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>What&#39;s next: </strong>This technology will likely first be used in advertisements, but as it migrates to higher-quality content, it will open up potential opportunities and pitfalls for celebrity talent.</p><ul><li>&#34;In terms of dubbing and post-production, synthetic voices will become mainstream, and you&#39;ll see that built into contracts for talent,&#34; says Steelberg. </li><li>That won&#39;t just be to ensure Hollywood stars (and their agents) get a cut for any use of their synthesized voice, but also to prevent those voices from being hijacked for malign purposes as the technology becomes more accessible.</li></ul><p><strong>What to watch: </strong>How the voices and other creative attributes of deceased celebrities might be harnessed by AI.</p><ul><li>Holograms of dead musicians like Frank Zappa are already being used to front &#34;live&#34; shows that have brought in <a data-vars-link-text="tens of millions in revenue" data-vars-click-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/magazine/hologram-musicians.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/magazine/hologram-musicians.html" target="_blank">tens of millions in revenue</a>, while Kenny G <a data-vars-link-text="recently released" data-vars-click-url="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/should-kenny-g-make-a-record-with" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/should-kenny-g-make-a-record-with" target="_blank">recently released</a> a &#34;duet&#34; with the jazz great Stan Getz, who died 30 years ago. </li><li>Sample notes from Getz&#39;s existing library <a data-vars-link-text="were used" data-vars-click-url="https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/album-kenny-g-new-standards" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/album-kenny-g-new-standards" target="_blank">were used</a> to generate a new, synthetic melody — albeit one that jazz writer Ted Gioia <a data-vars-link-text="called" data-vars-click-url="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/should-kenny-g-make-a-record-with" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/should-kenny-g-make-a-record-with" target="_blank">called</a> a &#34;Frankenstein record.&#34;</li></ul><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>We should get used to hearing celebrities speak in almost any language soon — and those celebrities should get used to going through their wills with a fine-toothed comb.</p></div></div>
