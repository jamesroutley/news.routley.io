    <!-- I'm going to the Recurse Center. I've played 2 shows in a week that I ended up staying up til 4 because of.
    There's weird quality to perceived convenience/difficult of a tool. It took me less than a minute to understand to add to this blog, even though the process 
    is really low tech an clunky. All in all it is a small inconvenience.<br> It took very little time to understand and I have <span style="letter-spacing: 3px; padding: 0 5px;">complete control</span> over styling 
    because it's all html.<br> -->
    I started working on live MIDI visualizations. At first inspired by old General MIDI visualizing software that takes in a .mid file and shows some old cgi band playing the song,
    but later inspired by a new Pobbles release. The first Pobbles video, seems to me like it must have used MIDI to create Pobbles, and finally shaders had a broader appeal to me.
    For a while I found it hard to sync up my visualizer, and I felt like shaders could sometimes be a very cool addition to a performance, but didn&#39;t really feel connected to the music.</p><ol>

            Make a switch statement to filter each MIDI channel to different functions

            Do whatever you want for each channel, possibly use velocity and note values
