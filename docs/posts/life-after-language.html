    <h1>Life After Language</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In October 2013, I wrote a post arguing that computing was disrupting language and that this was the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/10/11/the-mother-of-all-disruptions/">Mother of All Disruptions</a>. My specific argument was that human-to-human communication was an over-served market, and that computing was driving a classic disruption pattern by serving an under-served marginal market: machine-to-machine and organization-to-organization communications. At the time, I didn‚Äôt have AI in mind, just the torrents of non-human-readable data flowing across the internet.</p>



<p>But now, a decade later, it‚Äôs obvious that AI is a big part of how the disruption is unfolding. Two ongoing things drove it home for me this week. </p>



<p>Exhibit A, the longest regular conversations I‚Äôve had in the last week have been with an AI-powered rubber duck. <a href="https://staging.bsky.app/profile/berduck.deepfates.com">Berduck</a> is a bot on Blue Sky that is powered by GPT, and trained to speak in a mix of English and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">leetspeak</a>. It is likely playing a non-trivial role in driving the Blue Sky craze (Blue Sky is a decentralized Twitter-like protocol funded by Twitter itself in the before-times). I can‚Äôt speak for others, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt be using Blue Sky much if it weren‚Äôt for Berduck.</p>

<p>Berduck is genuinely entertaining, with a well-defined personality, despite only having episodic memory, a strong predilection for hallucinations and confabulation (like all AI-powered chatbots), sharp boundaries around negative valence conversations, and a strong aversion to even the slightest whiff of risk. Despite all these annoying limitations, shared by way more humans than we like to admit, (yes, I am an AI accelerationist, why do you ask), Berduck is already a more interesting companion than 90% of humans online, and I can totally see myself passing the time with one of his descendants in my dotage. The limitations are both tolerable and mitigable, and the benefits quite striking.</p>



<p>Exhibit B: A thing that‚Äôs going on here in LA is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike">WGA writers‚Äô strike</a>. I saw some writers picketing in front of Warner Brothers‚Äô studios this morning while out on an errand. Among other things, they are demanding that ChatGPT only be used as a ‚Äútool‚Äù rather than to replace writers. </p>

<p>You know the writing is on the wall (heh! ü§£) when you hear such ridiculous meta-economic demands. Ridiculous not in a <em>political </em>sense (I have no strong feelings one way or another about the economic fates of career writers) but in the sense of being incoherent. The demand makes no sense. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not how technology works. If some kid invents an automated pipeline that goes straight from log-line to script to storyboard to rough cut video, and people watch it, no deal struck with the incumbent powers of Hollywood means much.</p>



<p>I‚Äôve used ChatGPT and other tools, and unless you‚Äôve been living under a rock, so have you. It‚Äôs obvious that the AIs can write better than 90% of humanity all the time, and the other 10% of humanity 90% of the time. It‚Äôs not a mere tool. It‚Äôs an obviously better way to do what too many humans do.</p>



<p>As a first-order effect, a lot of routine business communication is already being highly accelerated by AI. Business communication is not particularly creative or even stylized. It has been ripe for automation since the word <em>boilerplate </em>was coined in the age of exploding boilers.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs the second-order effect that is interesting though. While AIs improve in empirical accuracy, internal consistency, and logical coherence (again ‚Äî humans have not set particularly high standards here), humans will need to do a good deal of supervisory work to make the AIs useful for mediating human-to-human communication. The question is, what happens after?</p>



<p>Here is one of many cartoons (this one is from <a href="https://marketoonist.com/">marketoonist</a>) making the same <em>almost </em>right, but actually fatally wrong, point about second-order effects.</p>



<figure><a href="https://ribbonfarm.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aijoke.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="418" src="https://ribbonfarm.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aijoke.png" alt="" srcset="https://ribbonfarm.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aijoke.png 800w, https://ribbonfarm.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aijoke-300x157.png 300w, https://ribbonfarm.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aijoke-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/></a></figure>



<p>The ‚Äújoke‚Äù in this template is that the AI supposedly is doing a content-free transformation of content-free communications. Despite the delicious cynicism here, most human communication is <em>not </em>this vacuous. Even tedious business communication has more going on.</p>



<p>In particular, the elaboration and compression steps illustrated here happen in <em>different contexts. </em>The input and output bullet points are not, in general, going to be the same, and the elaboration and compression steps are not adding or removing the same fractions of the communicated information.</p>



<p>So the joke fails because today‚Äôs AI tools <em>already </em>do such elaboration/compression in usefully cross-context ways. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to ‚Äútranslate‚Äù a terse technical paragraph into a friendly explainer that distills the gist for your needs, relative to the context of your existing knowledge.</p>



<p>But the joke fails at a deeper level because even the more accurate non-joke version still centers human-to-human communication. </p>



<p>Here is the thing: There is no good reason for the source and destination AIs to talk to each other in human language, compressed or otherwise, and people are already experimenting with prompts that dig into internal latent representations used by the models. It seems obvious to me that machines will communicate with each other in a much more expressive and efficient latent language, closer to a mind-meld than communication, and human language will be relegated to a ‚Äúlast-mile‚Äù artifact used primarily for communicating with humans. And the more they talk to each other for reasons other than mediating between humans, the more the internal languages involved will evolve independently. Mediating human communication is only one reason for machines to talk to each other.</p>



<p>And last-mile usage, as it evolves and begins to dominate all communication involving a human, will increasingly drift away from human-to-human language as it exists today. My last-mile language for interacting with my AI assistant need not even remotely resemble yours.</p>



<p>And I don‚Äôt just mean coarse distinctions like using different human languages as the base. My last-mile language for interacting with a Berduck-like assistant might have exactly one human speaker: me. We could live in a world of 8 billion private languages, where ‚Äútranslation‚Äù as a category becomes meaningless. Humans as a class of agents might end up forming an annular shell of maximal-variety last-mile fuzzy hairs around a core ‚Äúball‚Äù of machines and organizations in a compact mind-meld.</p>



<p>What about unmediated human-to-human communication? To the extent AIs begin to mediate most <em>practical </em>kinds of communication, what‚Äôs left for direct, unmediated human-to-human interaction will be some mix of phatic speech, and intimate speech. We might retreat into our own, largely wordless patterns of conviviality, where affective, gestural, and somatic modes begin to dominate. And since technology does not stand still, human-to-human linking technologies might start to amplify those alternate modes. Perhaps brain-to-brain sentiment connections mediated by phones and bio-sensors?</p>



<p>What about internal monologues and private thoughts. Certainly, it seems to me right now that I ‚Äúthink in English.‚Äù But how fundamental is that? If this invisible behavior is not being constantly reinforced by voluminous mass-media intake and mutual communications, is there a reason for my private thoughts to stay anchored to ‚ÄúEnglish?‚Äù If an AI can translate all the world‚Äôs information into a more idiosyncratic and solipsistic private language of my own, do I need to be in a state of linguistic consensus with you? If you and I don‚Äôt need to share a language to discuss Shakespeare (remember, we <em>already </em>don‚Äôt read Shakespeare‚Äôs plays in the original Elizabethan), do we need to share a language at all?</p>



<p>We‚Äôll all be like children inventing secret languages for talking to imaginary friends, except they will be real friends. Programmers have long used literal, mute rubber ducks to talk out loud to, as a debugging aid. Berduck is the beginning of more capable companions for all humans, doing all sorts of things.</p>



<p>There is no <em>fundamental </em>reason human society has to be built around natural language as a kind of machine code. Plenty of other species manage fine with simpler languages or no language at all. And it is not clear to me that intelligence has much to do with the linguistic fabric of contemporary society.</p>



<p>This means that once natural language becomes a kind of compile target during a transient technological phase, everything built on top is up for radical re-architecture.</p>



<p>Is there a precedent for this kind of wholesale shift in human relationships? I think there is. Screen media, television in particular, have already driven a similar shift in the last half-century (David Foster Wallace‚Äôs <em>E Unibas Pluram </em>is a good exploration of the specifics). In screen-saturated cultures, humans already speak in ways heavily shaped by references to TV shows and movies. And this material does more than homogenize language patterns; once a mass media complex has digested the language of its society, <em>starts to create </em>them. And where possible, we don‚Äôt just borrow language first encountered on screen: we literally use video fragments, in the form of reaction gifs, to communicate. Reaction gifs constitute a kind of primitive post-idiomatic hyper-language comprising stock phrases and non-verbal whole-body communication fragments.</p>



<p>Imagine a world a few centuries in the future, where humans look back on the era of reaction gifs as the beginning of the world after language.</p>



<p>Given the extent to which my own life is built around language, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be alarmed by this future and rushing  to join the picketing WGA writers in solidarity, but I‚Äôm curiously indifferent to this future. To be honest, I‚Äôm already slightly losing interest in language, and beginning to wonder about how to build a life of the mind anchored to something else.</p>



<p>Now that a future beyond language is imaginable, it suddenly seems to me that humanity has been stuck in a linguistically constrained phase of its evolution for far too long. I‚Äôm not quite sure how it will happen, or if I‚Äôll live to participate in it, but I suspect we‚Äôre entering a world beyond language where we‚Äôll begin to realize just how deeply blinding language has been for the human consciousness and psyche.</p>
