    <h1>Detroit&#39;s abandoned tunnel systems open door to another world</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Below Detroit&#39;s streets is a network of tunnel systems almost as elaborate as the bustling metropolis that sits above it.</p><p>Unveiling this underworld opens a cavern of secrets necessary to understanding Detroit&#39;s history. While most of the tunnels are now abandoned and closed off to the public, learning about these labyrinths can contextualize the city&#39;s importance on the national level.</p><p>From the salt mines used to launch the city into economic prosperity at the start of the 20th century to the remnants of hidden caverns used to store liquor during America&#39;s Prohibition, explore what lies below:</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/02/07/PDTF/72499830007-detroit-t-tunnels-013124-es-08.jpg?width=660&amp;height=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/02/07/PDTF/72499830007-detroit-t-tunnels-013124-es-08.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=882&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="The remains of a pedestrian walkway in Highland Park at Second Avenue and Pilgrim on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024."/></figure><h2>Pedestrian walkways</h2><p>Around 100 years ago, the popularity of automobiles resulted in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-10/how-cities-responded-to-traffic-deaths-100-years-ago" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">a historic spike in pedestrian deaths</a>. Detroit’s Highland Park neighborhood, which housed close to 50,000 residents in the early 1920s, reported a <a href="https://www.hourdetroit.com/development-topics/a-closer-look-at-a-historic-highland-park-pedestrian-tunnel/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">historic spike in pedestrian fatalities</a> in 1924.</p><p>The solution was <a href="https://www.hourdetroit.com/development-topics/a-closer-look-at-a-historic-highland-park-pedestrian-tunnel/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">to build an underground tunnel</a> to direct all pedestrian traffic, similar to the style of underground walkways seen in London and Canada. Three more tunnels were built at the Highland Park intersection in 1925, including one in Midtown at Cass Avenue and Peterboro Street, though no physical remnants of the latter site remain today.</p><p>Documented by TikTok user @Colin313 in July 2022, Highland Park’s raised cement <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@colin313/video/7116877368425418030" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">underpass can be seen at the corner of</a> Cortland and Second Avenue.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/02/07/PDTF/72499829007-detroit-t-tunnels-013124-es-02.jpg?width=660&amp;height=436&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/02/07/PDTF/72499829007-detroit-t-tunnels-013124-es-02.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=872&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="The remains of a pedestrian walkway in Highland Park at Second Avenue and Cortland Street on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024."/></figure><h2>Salt mines</h2><p>Rock salt was discovered below the depths of Michigan’s streets in 1895, and almost immediately, the horizontal salt beds were mined for the resource’s rich currency.</p><p>By 1906, Detroit established the Detroit Rock Salt Co. to develop a safe, effective way to mine the salt. It took years of configuration before a 1,060-foot shaft <a href="http://detroitsalt.com/history" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">was dug into the city’s core</a> and by 1914, Detroit was exporting 8,000 tons of rock salt each month. </p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/18/PDTF/72271215007-salt-mine.jpg?width=572&amp;height=438&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="300 feet below street level, a worker supervises the conveyor belt as it carries chunks of rock salt towards the surface from the International Salt Mine, Detroit, Michigan.

Road salt is the only form of salt currently produced by the mines, and tours were provided briefly in the mid-1980s but are now suspended because of ongoing production.</p><p><strong>More:</strong><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2022/12/15/wayne-county-salt-distribution-process-winter/69716872007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:15|${u}">A look inside Wayne County&#39;s salt distribution process each winter</a></p><h2>Tunnels at Detroit&#39;s Fisher Building</h2><p>Detroit’s Fisher Building was constructed in 1927 by the Fisher brothers, whose Fisher Body Co. was responsible for the closed-body chassis of the 1910 Cadillac and introducing the first four-door sedan bodies. </p><p>This immense success in reimagining the automobile industry motivated the brothers to purchase 32 parcels along West Grand Boulevard to <a href="https://historicdetroit.org/buildings/fisher-building" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">“serve as an expressive testimonial of the Fishers’ activity in Detroit.” </a></p><p>The art deco, 441-foot building is flanked by two 11-story, flat-roofed wings and is topped with a glowing green spear. </p><p>Below ground, an elaborate tunnel system connected the Fisher to New Center and General Motors buildings to ease employee commute.</p><p>The tunnels are open today, though all of the once bustling storefronts are now shuttered.</p><p><strong>More:</strong><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/2015/08/31/detroit-fisher-building/71460314/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:24|${u}">10 fascinating facts about Detroit&#39;s Fisher Building</a></p><h2>Detroit Medical Center tunnels</h2><p>Adjacent to Wayne State University’s campus in midtown, the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2490bb2ca53a4e1faed7930bedc6f1fb" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}">Detroit Medical Center holds eight hospitals in a one-block area</a> surrounded by John R, Mack, St. Antoine and East Canfield Street.
