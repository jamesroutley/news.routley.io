    <h1>Josh Hawley introducing his own stock ban bill</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) plans to introduce his own bill to prevent members of Congress from trading stocks, while Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) teams up with fellow Democrat Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Axios has learned.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>This means there will be now be two similar bills to ban stock trades individually championed by two vastly different lawmakers—further complicating the effort to pass a stock trading ban this session. </p><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>This comes after talks between Ossoff and Hawley&#39;s offices fizzled out, and Ossoff had sought a Republican co-sponsor before partnering with Kelly.</p><p>Both bills would prevent sitting lawmakers and their spouses from trading stock, but there are some differences between the two proposals:</p><ul><li>Ossoff&#39;s bill also would apply the ban to any dependent children in addition to the spouses of lawmakers, whereas Hawley&#39;s bill would not.</li><li>Hawley&#39;s bill would have the Government Accountability Office provide oversight, whereas Ossoff would leave that to congressional ethics committees.</li><li>Any violations of Hawley&#39;s measure would require lawmakers or their spouses to disgorge any investment to the U.S. Treasury. Additional penalties also may be leveled by Congressional ethics committees.</li><li>A Democratic aide familiar confirmed to Axios that Ossoff&#39;s bill also includes penalties for violations. </li></ul><p>“Year after year, politicians somehow manage to outperform the market, buying and selling millions in stocks of companies they’re supposed to be regulating,&#34; Hawley said in a statement to Axios. &#34;It’s time to stop turning a blind eye to Washington profiteering.”</p><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>A stock trading ban already faced long odds, despite <a data-vars-link-text="widespread public support" data-vars-click-url="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/588630-76-percent-of-voters-support-banning-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks-poll?amp" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/588630-76-percent-of-voters-support-banning-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks-poll?amp" target="_blank">widespread public support</a>, in part due to House opposition from Speaker Pelosi. Today&#39;s developments make those odds even longer.</p><p><strong>Earlier: </strong><a data-vars-link-text="Momentum builds to ban lawmakers from trading stocks" data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/congress-stock-trading-ban-ossoff-d49f9d30-743d-4247-a3c7-acc1875ec055.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.axios.com/congress-stock-trading-ban-ossoff-d49f9d30-743d-4247-a3c7-acc1875ec055.html" target="_self">Momentum builds to ban lawmakers from trading stocks</a></p></div></div>
