	  <p>Not many people will read your PhD thesis, but if you completed your doctoral research at the Australian National University College of Science, then Tabitha Carvan has probably read one small part of it.</p>
	  <p>What she found is a kind of poetry in the science.</p>
	  <div>
	    <p>This multimedia essay was produced by the ANU College of Science Communications Team:</p>

	  <p>Embarking on a PhD is a treacherous task for even the most bold and brave of this world, and yet here I sit, writing my way through the final hoops of this life-changing experience.</p>
	  
	  <p>The statistics of magnetised interstellar turbulence (2024)</p>
	</div>
  </div>
  <p>For a reason I can no longer remember, I started picking science theses at random from the Australian National University library catalogue and reading only the acknowledgements.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>Once I started, it was very hard to stop.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I found myself reading them at home, on my own time, always thinking, &#39;Just one more.&#39;</p>

	    <p>I don’t think it’s overstating events to say that at the end of my PhD I find myself a rather different person than when I began (and not only because of the ravages of time).</p>

  <p>All the acknowledgements followed the same basic structure; they&#39;re formulaic. But as with many formulaic things, there&#39;s a story behind each one.</p>
  <p>I read hundreds and hundreds of acknowledgements.</p>

	    <p>The production of a dissertation is a formidable, arduous and demoralising task.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <p>I came to see that the acknowledgements of a PhD thesis are their own kind of thing.</p>
  <p>The rest of the thesis contains careful, reasoned findings and figures, but on this one page, the author-scientist can release all the pent-up emotion they couldn’t express elsewhere.</p>
  <p>They’re like an explosion in a lab.</p>

	    <p>When looking at the acknowledgements of others, I have found it is common practice for scholars to reserve their purplest prose and most overblown sentiment for their acknowledgements. If I had the skills, I would do so myself.</p>

	  <p>Acknowledgements have a quality which is hard to describe. </p>
      <p>They feel like they’ve been drafted a hundred times in the head of the author, but then put down on the page in a hurry, the clock ticking on their deadline.</p>
      <p>Like, they’re trying to tell you the most important thing they’ve ever said - at the very moment the ship is pulling away from the dock.</p>

  <p>One of the most-repeated phrases in the acknowledgements is:</p>

  <p>The cost is very real. </p>
