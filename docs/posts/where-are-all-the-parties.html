    <h1>Ask HN: Where are all the parties?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>10 years ago, there were a lot of parties in my life, and now there are none. Where have they gone? Have you seen the same, and have you managed to revive your party life?</p><p>I remember parties at friends places, for housewarmings, birthdays, holidays, sports games, barbecuing, karaoke, whatever. I remember parties at work, for people joining the team, for people leaving, for projects kicking off or finishing.</p><p>Now my kids are older and it seems that only they get to party. I try my best, invited some people for parties, but we never seem to get invites in return.</p><p>Hypotheses I have so far:</p><p>- I&#39;m just getting old (closing in on 50) and people my age don&#39;t party anymore</p><p>- COVID happened and we still haven&#39;t restarted partying the way we used to</p><p>- I&#39;m just unlucky with my set of friends and need to renew my friendships</p><p>Very interested in both macro trends (eg is partying overall just down) as well as things that you&#39;ve done at individual level to restart party life.</p></div></div></div>
