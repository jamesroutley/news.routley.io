                        <h2>Update</h2>

<p>So basically there was a lot of issues I discovered over the past few months that mainly were with the API.  I rewrote the API which resolved all issues with the indexer bots.  I haven&#39;t had one get stuck since the rewrite.</p>

<p>The channel bots needed some updating (ended up being more API updates) and the channel bot is running again.</p>

<h2>Request</h2>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t have the time and energy to manage IRC Driven right now.  Thats why development has been slow.  I can definitely use some help if anyone is good with Bootstrap 4, Python/Django, or Twisted (Event …</p>

                        <p>I&#39;ve been pretty busy with life lately, but I was able to fix the issue with emails not working.  This was mainly due to a change in my email host and a few other settings.</p>

<p>If you still have issues please let me know.</p>

                        <p>We had about a week of downtime because Google Domains decided to try and verify my email the one day I was doing email server maintenance in years, and suspended ALL of my domains including the ones I used for my email.  I transferred my domains to GoDaddy (where I work), but the transfer took 5 days to complete.  Sorry for the downtime.</p>
