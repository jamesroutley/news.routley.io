    <h1>Show HN: I built a tool that blocks social media until you scream &#34;I&#39;m a loser&#34;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi all,</p><p>I kept wasting time on social media, even though I’d promised myself I’d stay focused. Regular site blockers didn’t help.</p><p>I needed something that felt annoying enough to break the habit. That’s how the idea came up: make the blocker ask me to say something embarrassing out loud before it lets me back in. If I actually have to yell “I’m a loser” into my mic. Even better - the louder I screamed, the more time I’d get.</p><p>So I put together Scream to Unlock. It’s silly, but so far it’s done its job. My social feeds stay locked unless I really want them.</p><p>Extension link - <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scream-to-unlock-yell-to/pmmikajpbkehhpomkmelipgiafampkah?authuser=0&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scream-to-unlock-ye...</a></p><p>Its open source and transparent - <a href="https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/scream-to-unlock">https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/scream-to-unlock</a>.
