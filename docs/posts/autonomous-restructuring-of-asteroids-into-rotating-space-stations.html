      <span>Abstract:</span>  Asteroid restructuring uses robotics, self replication, and mechanical
automatons to autonomously restructure an asteroid into a large rotating space
station. The restructuring process makes structures from asteroid oxide
materials; uses productive self-replication to make replicators, helpers, and
products; and creates a multiple floor station to support a large population.
In an example simulation, it takes 12 years to autonomously restructure a large
asteroid into the space station. This is accomplished with a single rocket
launch. The single payload contains a base station, 4 robots (spiders), and a
modest set of supplies. Our simulation creates 3000 spiders and over 23,500
other pieces of equipment. Only the base station and spiders (replicators) have
advanced microprocessors and algorithms. These represent 21st century
technologies created and trans-ported from Earth. The equipment and tools are
built using in-situ materials and represent 18th or 19th century technologies.
The equipment and tools (helpers) have simple mechanical programs to perform
repetitive tasks. The resulting example station would be a rotating framework
almost 5 kilometers in diameter. Once completed, it could support a population
of over 700,000 people. Many researchers identify the high launch costs, the
harsh space environment, and the lack of gravity as the key obstacles hindering
the development of space stations. The single probe addresses the high launch
cost. The autonomous construction eliminates the harsh space environment for
construction crews. The completed rotating station provides radiation
protection and centripetal gravity for the first work crews and colonists.
