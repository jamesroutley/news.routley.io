    <h1>Canonicals Interview Process</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>Context</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://dustri.org/b/leaving-google.html">left Google</a> in April 2024, and have thus
been casually looking for a new job during 2024. A good friend of mine is currently working
at <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, and he told me that it&#39;s quite a nice
company with a great working environment. Unfortunately,
the internet is full of people who had a poor experience:
<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm">Glassdoor</a>
shows that only 15% had a positive interview experience,
famous internet denizens like <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@sara/112117125241735836">sara</a>
rambled on the topic,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/17mmren/canonical_and_their_disrespectful_interviews/">reddit</a>,
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31426558">hacker</a><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37059857">news</a>,
<a href="https://uk.indeed.com/cmp/Canonical">indeed</a>
and
<a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/canonical-interview-process-is-such-bogus-ojbjgana">blind</a>
all say it&#39;s terrible, … but the idea of being decently paid to do security
work on a popular Linux distribution was really appealing to me.</p>
<h2>First application</h2>
<p>I first applied there in October 2023. Canonical&#39;s <a href="https://canonical.com/careers">careers&#39;
website</a> asks a bunch of odd questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How did you perform in mathematics at high school?</li>
<li>How did you perform in your native language at high school?</li>
<li>Please share your rationale or evidence for the high school performance
  selections above. Make reference to provincial, state or nation-wide scoring
  systems, rankings, or recognition awards, or to competitive or selective
  college entrance results such as SAT or ACT scores, JAMB, matriculation
  results, IB results etc. We recognise every system is different but we will
  ask you to justify your selections above.</li>
<li>What was your bachelor&#39;s university degree result, or expected result if you
  have not yet graduated? Please include the grading system to help us
  understand your result e.g. ‘85 out of 100’, ‘2:1 (Grading system: first
  class, 2:1, 2:2, third class)’ or ‘GPA score of 3.8/4.0 (predicted)’. We have
  hired outstanding individuals who did not attend or complete university. If
  this describes you, please continue with your application and enter ‘no
  degree’.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was applying for a <em>senior position</em>, and because there was no such thing as
ranking in my entire scholarship, I didn&#39;t think much about this, and wrote
that I wasn&#39;t bad at school, and that there was no ranking. I got instantly
rejected. I asked around, and some Canonical employees reached out to me on
<a href="https://infosec.exchange/@jvoisin">mastodon</a> to tell me that I should lie on
this step of the hiring process, as people who aren&#39;t in the top 10% in
high-school are automatically rejected. So I made things up, and didn&#39;t get
rejected this time.</p>
<p>I then got an email about the &#34;written interview&#34;, asking me to provide my
answers to <a href="https://dustri.org/b/files/canonical_questions.txt">38 questions</a> in a PDF.
It took me a couple of hours to write it down, boiling down to 21 pages of
text. Once sent, I was asked to do <del>modern
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology</a></del> &#34;psychometric
assessments&#34; from <a href="https://www.thomas.co/">Thomas</a>. The first one is called the
General Intelligence Assessment, and features with questions like those:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Bob isn&#39;t as fast as Carl&#34; → Who is the fastest? Carl or Bob?</li>
<li>&#34;a B f H&#34; vs &#34;k b j z&#34; → how many letters in common? (1)</li>
<li>Given 3 numbers, find the bigger and smaller, which one is the farthest from the middle one?</li>
<li>Given a group of 3 words, which one has nothing to do with the 2 other?</li>
<li>Given a pair of letter &#34;R&#34;, with some rotated and some mirrored, how many are
  only rotated?</li>
</ul>
<p>The second one is the Behavioural Assessment, and is based on <a href="https://www.thomas.co/thomas-candidate-test">picking &#34;the
word that corresponds the most to your personality and the one that corresponds
the least&#34;</a> for 30 minutes. Their
&#34;methodology&#34; is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment">DISC
assessment</a> from 1928 which is
completely made-up pseudo-science. Heck, even their <a href="https://www.thomas.co/sites/default/files/thomas-files/2024-01/Science-behind-Thomas-Behaviour-assessment-Jan-2024.pdf">brochure</a>
only has 5 references with none from after 1957, and the 5 mentioned &#34;studies&#34; don&#39;t
have sources, data, details, … This made me equally amused and worried.</p>
<p>The technical interviews (&#34;Ubuntu Skills Interview&#34;, &#34;Security Skills
Interview&#34;, &#34;General Management Skills Interview&#34;) felt a bit empty
content-wise, and sounded more like some random conversation with open-source
enthusiast people at a bar. The only technical questions I remember were &#34;What&#39;s your
favourite git command&#34; and &#34;Can you tell me about Ubuntu packaging&#34;. Keep in
mind that the position I was applying for was &#34;Ubuntu Engineering Manager&#34;, so
I was expecting a lot of technical questions. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the
conversations were really nice, and I really liked the reflections on
Canonical&#39;s positions and philosophy.</p>
<p>In December, I had an HR interview with a &#34;Talent Science Partner&#34;, which was a
regular bland
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>
questionnaire. Here is some feedback from the interviewer: &#34;In the first 5
minutes of the call, I asked them about their biggest achievement at NBS and
they replied &#34;Apparently you haven&#39;t read my 20-pages written interview&#34;. I
then explained to him that I have to ask the same questions to all candidates
and they offered me a terse answer.&#34; What&#39;s the point of asking for an
extensive written interview with those very same questions,
only for it to be completely ignored? It felt disrespectful to me.
Also, amusingly &#34;During our interview, they will [sic.] be typing away.&#34;, so
candidates aren&#39;t expected to take notes. I was simply writing the questions
down, as well as some of my answers, likely the very same thing that the
interviewer was doing.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, I got a &#34;Follow up - Benefits at Canonical&#34; email,
listing all the benefits, but less than 24h after, I got the <strong>very same</strong>
automated rejection email I got when I first applied in October. I sent an
email to enquire about feedback but never got a reply. During the whole
process, I was not once able to ask questions to a recruiter.</p>
<h2>Second application</h2>
<p>A couple of months later, I decided to reapply, hoping that maybe the previous
rejection was a misunderstanding or whatnot, even though seeing that
Canonical <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/canonical/jobs/">had more than 32 000</a>
job openings <del>smelt like bullshit</del> was worrying.</p>
<p>I applied both for a Manager position and an Individual Contributor one. I got
instantly rejected for the former via an automated email, sent twice; but was
invited to continue the process for the latter, via the &#34;Fast Track - Security.&#34;
I learnt that this didn&#39;t mean that there would be less interviews or that the
process would somehow be faster, but simply that my resume was interesting
enough to warrant interviewing me before picking a team for me to fit in, a bit
like how Google is hiring.</p>
<p>I re-used the written
interview, as the questions didn&#39;t really change. This time, I also had to
spend 2h on <a href="https://devskiller.com">DevSkiller</a> for a bland-at-best &#34;Python
test.&#34; The first part was questions like &#34;Which ones of those words aren&#39;t
python logging levels: URGENT, CRITICAL, INFO, FATAL, TRACE, …&#34; or &#34;What does
this small python snippet output&#34; which is a matter to copy/pasting in into a
python interpreter locally. The second part was LeetCode-like exercises, but
since there were no humans involved, odds are that the only piece of
information that can be extracted from the candidate is &#34;can they successfully
paste the question verbatim into a search engine/LLM.&#34;</p>
<p>Funnily enough, while I could re-use my &#34;psychometric assessments,&#34; I chose to pass
the tests again, so I could compare the results, and of course, they showed some
differences. This was followed by a weird &#34;The security
mission and roles at Canonical&#34; email from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth">Mark
Shuttleworth</a> himself, with a
Message-ID <code>…prod-greenhouse-sidekiq-automation-worker…</code>, meaning it&#39;s
another generic automated email, sigh. Then came the interviews. I
systematically asked the following questions in all but the final one:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about the interview process?<ul>
<li>I often got praise about the written interview part, albeit nobody liked
  the process as a whole. Some high-in-the-chain people told me that they
  didn&#39;t really like spending time reviewing CV and interviewing people for
  a couple of hours every week. Heck, some of them that interviewed me
  weren&#39;t even going to work with me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you like working at Canonical?<ul>
<li>The answers were a resounding <strong>yes</strong>, which kept me motivated to go through the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is the upper-management, especially Mr. Shuttleworth, as I&#39;ll have an
  interview with him and it feels a bit weird, but also because I&#39;ve heard
  things™?<ul>
<li>Those who work/worked with him told me (I took notes) that he was
<em>peculiar</em>, <em>involved</em>, <em>intense</em>, <em>special</em>, <em>opinionated</em>, <em>could come
across as rude/harsh/know-it-all</em>, and <em>sometimes difficult to work with</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I politely tried to gather feedback on the interviews, and was either told
  that they couldn&#39;t answer this question, or that I shouldn&#39;t need to worry as
  &#34;everything looks green on the feedback.&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some interviews were pleasantly technical, and I really enjoyed the &#34;Security
Deep Dive&#34; one about confidential computing. The &#34;Hiring Lead Interviews&#34; felt
a bit useless, generic and similar, but provided some welcome colouring to how
it is to work at Canonical. Hilariously, someone from the team I applied for
told me that the role has been empty for more than 18 months, and offered a
polite smile when asked why she thought that was the case.</p>
<p>The final interview was with Mark Shuttleworth. He didn&#39;t introduce himself,
which I found a bit odd. His first question was whether I was applying for a
managerial or a senior position, which didn&#39;t bode well: he had no idea what
position I was applying for, and thus wouldn&#39;t be asking role-related questions,
but likely only &#34;vibe&#34; ones. I got asked questions about high-school: how I
performed there, why did I pick a particular university, … I was so surprised
that I didn&#39;t think about asking on the spot how was any of this relevant for a
fucking <em>senior</em> position. I did so afterwards, and was told that one of the sole
common point for all Canonical employees is that they all attended high-school,
so it provides a common base. Moreover, it gives some background, personal
history and shows the motivations and goals of the applicants. I don&#39;t know
about you, but when I was in high-school (around 15-20 years ago), my goals and
motivation were really different than my current ones, as they were mainly,
ranked in order of interest and importance: getting laid. </p>
<p>To the question &#34;How was your university?&#34;, I answered that it wasn&#39;t
prestigious, and pretty small and rural, as we could see cows from the windows.
Shuttleworth immediately interrupted me to say &#34;don&#39;t play games, don&#39;t try to
muddle your answers. I&#39;m interviewing you for a senior position, I&#39;m asking you
questions, I&#39;m expecting straight answers.&#34; I was so flabbergasted that instead
of answering properly (&#34;As I&#39;m interviewing for a senior position, I&#39;m
expecting proper senior position related questions.&#34;), I gave a meek &#34;Okay…&#34;
Some parts of the conversation were
equally awkward and filled with an unhealthy amount of salt, especially about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart_(software)">upstart</a> (&#34;They&#39;re a reason
why Chromebooks are using it&#34;, the reasons are mostly technical
debt, not technical excellence.), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)">mir</a> (&#34;Wayland has the
same design flaws as Xorg&#34;), … At some point, someone bought him a plate, and
he started to eat, without excusing himself about doing so. I asked him why he
would spend time interviewing prospective employees in non-executive positions,
let alone individual contributors,
as this is likely eating a lot of his time. He told me that he like to know who
is hired, and that this process allows to root out average candidates. After 40
minutes out of a 60 minutes scheduled interview, Shuttleworth said &#34;Ok, nice
talking to you, have a nice day,&#34; and abruptly ended the interview. I seriously
thought about withdrawing my application, as I really didn&#39;t want to work with
him, but since the position was only senior IC, odds are that I wouldn&#39;t have
to, so I didn&#39;t retract it.</p>
<p>A couple of days after, I got the now familiar automated rejection email. I
asked the hiring lead for feedback about why the rejection happened, but didn&#39;t
get a reply. Not once during all the interviews have I had a conversation about
compensation/salary/benefits/… </p>
<p>So I exercised my 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> rights,
and asked to be communicated everything pertaining to my
interviews. I got a bunch of documents, and the reason I was rejected was
&#34;Culture/behaviour/motivation misalignment.&#34; Overall, would-you-hire-wise I got
three &#34;strong yes&#34;, eight &#34;yes&#34;, and a single &#34;no&#34; from Mark Shuttleworth, with
his feedback as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This interview did not go well at all; the candidate initially gave
startlingly passive-aggressive responses to questions, in a way that I very
rarely see at this late stage of the process. Their application was a duplicate
with the same email address, and previously they had given a similar impression
in Talent Science. I would like to understand why that duplicate, and outcome,
were not noticed during this selection process.</p>
<p>After some difficult exchanges I focused on the candidate&#39;s personal
interests, where they opened up. They are clearly passionate about low-level
technical details, but are only engaged on things that personally interest
them, with little evidence of teamwork or willingness to share load that is
uninteresting to them. They would be a poor fit for a team where balancing work
requires deriving some personal satisfaction from helping colleagues get things
done.</p>
<p>In short, there are character issues here that we cannot address through
coaching and development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, to be fair, everyone who knows me would likely agree that I&#39;m not the most
empathetic person ever, and that communication isn&#39;t my strongest point,
despite me investing a lot of care and effort there, as it&#39;s an important topic
for me: I&#39;m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">Asperger</a>,
meaning that a lot of social interactions, especially non-verbal and
implicit ones are often non-trivial for me, and that I tend to be (sometimes
overly) frank; but it&#39;s the very first time this came up as an issue, let
alone a prohibitive one, in a professional setting. The two other Hiring Lead
who <em>assessed</em> my &#34;Personality Traits&#34; didn&#39;t find anything proscriptive there,
nor in any other categories for that matter. Interestingly, Shuttleworth&#39;s
feedback is the only one without any supporting notes nor direct quotes, and
reads more like an opinion piece than a proper artefact-supported assessment
like the rest.</p>
<p>So now I&#39;m really curious about the decision process here, as it seems that every
interviewer&#39;s opinion is ignored if Shuttleworth puts some red marks. Would the
outcome have been the same if it were someone else who had put them instead?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was really looking forward to work at Canonical, being paid to work on
improving a popular Linux distribution security sounded really cool. I now
see that I should have, for once, listened to the collective hive-mind of the
internet, and not pour so much of my time and energy into this. I&#39;m of course a
bit salty about the process, but not about the outcome, as it felt like I
dodged some kind of massive bullet.</p>
<p>A friend suggested that I add some actionable advice hiring-wise to this
blogpost so that it doesn&#39;t read too much like an angry rant about not being
hired, but it felt pretentious to me. Moreover, as it seems that hiring at
Canonical is Shuttleworth&#39;s pet project, I don&#39;t think my opinion on the
topic will be useful in any way. Heck, I bet all the senior people spending
some of their expensive work time doing interviews are frustrated when
candidates they deem promising are rejected at the very of end on
Shuttleworth&#39;s whim; yet as this has apparently been going for a while now,
so I doubt a ranty article on my small corner on the internet would hold any sway.
So if I didn&#39;t write this article to complain, nor to make things change, why
bother? I wrote it because I would have loved to have read a post like this 
one while considering applying at Canonical, as it would have saved everyone
involved a tremendous amount of time.</p>
<p>As a side note, it&#39;s completely ludicrous that I had to use the GDPR to get
some feedback on what went wrong on a job interview: the hiring lead could
simply have replied to my email with some high-level explanation, which would
have saved them from being GDPR&#39;ed almost 300 pages of unredacted PDF.</p>
