    <h1>Visualizing Bayes Theorem (2009)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>One of the easiest ways to understand probabilities is to think of
them in terms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_Diagram">Venn
Diagrams</a>. You basically have a <em>Universe</em> with all the possible
outcomes (of an experiment for instance), and you are interested in
some subset of them, namely some <em>event</em>. Say we are studying cancer,
so we observe people and see whether they have cancer or not. If we
take as our Universe all people participating in our study, then there
are two possible outcomes for any particular individual, either he has
cancer or not. We can then split our universe in two events: the event
“people with cancer” (designated as \(A\)), and “people with no
cancer” (or \(\neg A\)). We could build a diagram like this:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://oscarbonilla.com/assets/img/bayes/venn-a.png" alt="venn a"/>
</p>
</div>
<p>So what is the probability that a randomly chosen person has cancer?
It is just the number of elements in \(A\) divided by the number of
elements of \(U\) (the Universe). We denote the number of elements
of \(A\) as \(|A|\), and read it the <em>cardinality of
\(A\)</em>. And define the probability of \(A\), \(P(A)\), as</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|U|}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>Since \(A\) can have at most the same number of elements as
\(U\), the probability \(P(A)\) can be at most one.</p>
<p>Good so far? Okay, let’s add another event. Let’s say there is a new
screening test that is supposed to measure something. That test will
be “positive” for some people, and “negative” for some other
people. If we take the event B to mean “people for which the test is
positive”. We can create another diagram:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://oscarbonilla.com/assets/img/bayes/venn-b.png" alt="venn b"/>
</p>
</div>
<p>So what is the probability that the test will be “positive” for a
randomly selected person? It would be the number of elements of
\(B\) (cardinality of \(B\), or \(|B|\)) divided by the
number of elements of \(U\), we call this \(P(B)\), the
probability of event \(B\) occurring.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(B) = \frac{|B|}{|U|}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>Note that so far, we have treated the two events in isolation. What
happens if we put them together?</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://oscarbonilla.com/assets/img/bayes/venn-last.png" alt="venn last"/>
</p>
</div>
<p>We can compute the probability of both events occurring (\(AB\) is
a shorthand for \(A∩B\)) in the same way.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(AB) = \frac{|AB|}{|U|}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>But this is where it starts to get interesting. What can we read from
the diagram above?</p>
<p>We are dealing with an entire Universe (all people), the event
\(A\) (people with cancer), and the event \(B\) (people for whom
the test is positive). There is also an overlap now, namely the event
\(AB\) which we can read as “people with cancer and with a
positive test result”. There is also the event \(B - AB\) or
“people without cancer and with a positive test result”, and the
event \(A - AB\) or “people with cancer and with a negative test
result”.</p>
<p>Now, the question we’d like answered is “given that the test is
positive for a randomly selected individual, what is the probability
that said individual has cancer?”. In terms of our Venn diagram, that
translates to “given that we are in region \(B\), what is the
probability that we are in region \(AB\)?” or stated another way
“if we make region \(B\) our new Universe, what is the probability
of \(A\)?”. The notation for this is \(P(A|B)\) and it is read
“the probability of A given B”.</p>
<p>So what is it? Well, it should be</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(A|B) = \frac{|AB|}{|B|}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>And if we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(|U|\)</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{|AB|}{|U|}}{\frac{|B|}{|U|}}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>we can rewrite it using the previously derived equations as</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>What we’ve effectively done is change the Universe from \(U\) (all
people), to \(B\) (people for whom the test is positive), but we
are still dealing with probabilities defined in \(U\).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://oscarbonilla.com/assets/img/bayes/venn-justb.png" alt="venn justb"/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Now let’s ask the converse question “given that a randomly selected
individual has cancer (event \(A\)), what is the probability that
the test is positive for that individual (event \(AB\))?”. It’s
easy to see that it is</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(B|A) = \frac{P(AB)}{P(A)}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>Now we have everything we need to derive Bayes&#39; theorem, putting
those two equations together we get</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)\]
</p>
</div>
<p>which is to say \(P(AB)\) is the same whether you’re looking at it
from the point of view of \(A\) or \(B\), and finally</p>
<div>
<p>
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>Which is Bayes&#39; theorem. I have found that this Venn diagram method
lets me re-derive Bayes&#39; theorem at any time without needing to
memorize it. It also makes it easier to apply it.</p>
