<h3>SSD vs HDD Data Storage</h3>



<p>While both SSD’s and Hard Drives store data as binary data, how they do this is quite different.</p>



<h3>Testing the Theory</h3>



<p>Where this is all leading to is a stupid little test I decided to run. I nabbed some extremely cheap Leven JS600 128GB TLC 2.5″ SATA SSD’s from Amazon at about $13 each and subjected them to two states, a set of two SSD’s “fresh” and a set of two SSD’s “worn”.</p>







<p>Each disk was formatted ExFAT and filled with the exact same set of random data. MD5 hashes were taken to ensure they all matched the source data. This was completed on 2022 Sep 02. These SSD’s will be stored in a drawer in regular climate controlled environment that I live in and will only be accessed with the following intervals:</p>
