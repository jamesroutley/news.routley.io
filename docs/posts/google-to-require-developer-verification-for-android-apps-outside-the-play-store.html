<p id="speakable-summary">Google is tightening security measures around Android app distribution, the company announced on Monday. Starting next year, Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store. The changes will affect all <a href="https://www.android.com/certified/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certified Android devices</a> once live, though the global rollout will be more gradual.</p>

<p>The tech giant stresses that this does not mean developers can’t distribute outside of the Play Store through other app stores or via sideloading — Android will remain open in that regard. However, developers who appreciated the anonymity of alternative distribution methods will no longer have that option. Google says this will help to cut down on bad actors who hide their identity to distribute malware, commit financial fraud, or steal users’ personal data. </p>







<p>According to its own survey, Google says that more than 50 times more malware came through internet-sideloaded sources compared with Google Play, where it has required developer verification since 2023.</p>

<p>Initially, Google will allow interested developers to sign up for early access starting in October 2025 to test the system and provide feedback. In March 2026, verification will go live for all developers. By September 2026, any app installed on an Android device in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand will have to meet the new requirements. Starting in 2027, the requirements will begin rolling out globally.</p>

<p>Developers will have to provide their legal name, address, email, and phone number, which could push independent developers to register as a business for their own privacy’s sake. Apple implemented a similar change for the EU App Store earlier this year to comply with the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA), a regulation that now requires app developers to provide their “trader status” to submit new apps or app updates for distribution.</p>

<p>Google notes that student and hobbyist developers will be able to use a separate type of Android Developer Console account when this system rolls out, as their needs differ from commercial developers.</p>

<p>The changes could have a significant impact on the Android app ecosystem and app distribution, as Google works to cut down on the security issues and malware that have typically plagued its platform. </p>
