<p>In order to put pressure on the policy makers we need to come together and contact all of our European friends and our national members of the European Parliament to convince them that the chat control contradicts our fundamental rights. </p>

<p>Ursula von der Leyen and the European Commission 🇪🇺 launch an <strong>attack on our civil rights</strong> with chat control.🚩🚩🚩 </p>



<p>With the chat control, the European Commission wants to prevent the spread of child abuse depictions and grooming. You can find out <strong>why chat control</strong> is unfortunately <strong>the wrong tool</strong> here:</p>



<p>If the chat control detects suspicious content 🚨 – it will be forwarded to an authority. The two problems here:</p>



<p>1️⃣ Completely normal photos, such as holiday pictures 🏞️ are considered suspicious. The chat control therefore produces too <strong>many false results and overloads the authorities</strong>. This will lead to fewer investigation successes.</p>



<p>2️⃣ So our <strong>private family photos or the chats </strong>and pictures from your sexting yesterday 🍑🍆 also end up on an official table. So we can throw privacy in the bin 🚮</p>



<hr/>



<div>
<p>The chat control is not in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights⛔️ The digital secrecy of letters is thus going into the digital wastebasket 🚮 The chat control would read and screen all our WhatsApp messages, emails, photos and videos on our cell phone in real time 🔦</p>



<p>Minors are <strong>prohibited from accessing apps</strong> where there is a risk that adults could write to children illegally. So basically all common social media apps. Look for a leisure activity without an app 🙃</p>
</div>



<hr/>



<div>
<p>WhatsApp, Snapchat etc. are forced to <strong>check the age</strong> of their users with chat control. The apps will have to do this with a photo and proof of <strong>passport</strong>. So you can forget about being anonymous on a dating app 🙅🙅‍♂️</p>



<div>
<p>The EU Data Protection Board, the European Parliament’s Research Service and the EU Council’s Legal Service say they are warning of chat controls. Ursula von der Leyen is not interested in these opinions </p>



<p>🤡 🚩</p>
</div>



<div>
<div>
<p>The <strong>chat control destroys the encryption infrastructure</strong> 🔐 Because it must always be possible to read the encrypted messages unencrypted. That’s the only way to check what’s inside. This means full monitoring of all news, including journalists, lawyers and political opponents in exile.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<hr/>



<div>
<p>Child protection can also be improved without chat control. Instead, investments must be made in equipping and training the judiciary, the police, Europol and in cooperation between the authorities 💶⚖️</p>



<p>EU member states already have sufficient powers to monitor criminal suspects on a case-by-case basis and to secure evidence 🚔</p>



<p>A general surveillance of our digital communication is more reminiscent of China than European values 👁️</p>

<p>“Commission President Von der Leyen’s planned chat control is a Big Brother agency that would monitor EU citizens’ private communications. We must prevent this massive state surveillance.”</p>

<p>“Chat control is dangerous for us as it threatens our privacy and freedom of expression. Through the monitoring and censorship of our online communication, we are restricted in our freedom to form opinions. It also opens the door to abuse and manipulation by governments and authoritarian organizations. It is important that we defend our rights to privacy and freedom of expression in order to maintain an open and democratic society.”</p>
