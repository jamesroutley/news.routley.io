    <h1>First human injected with cancer-killing virus in clinical trial</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
            This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 is an oncolytic virus. This is a virus that is designed to infect tumor cells and break them down.

                          <p>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:</p><p>I. To determine the safety and tolerability of a novel chimeric oncolytic orthopoxvirus, oncolytic virus CF33-expressing hNIS/Anti-PD-L1 antibody (CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1), by the evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, reversibility and duration according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 criteria.</p><p>SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:</p><p>I. To determine the optimal biologic dose (OBD) (defined as a safe dose that induces an immune response in tumors [increase checkpoint target PD-L1 by at least 5% and/or increase T cell infiltration by at least 10%]) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for future expansion trial.</p><p>II. To determine tumor response rates by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 (primary) and immune-modified (i)RECIST (secondary).</p><p>III. To document possible therapeutic efficacy and evaluate progression-free survival, overall survival and response.</p><p>EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:</p><p>I. To determine the immune and genomic profiles of tumors before and after CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 therapy.</p><p>OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.</p><p>Patients receive CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 intratumorally (IT) on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</p><p>After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months for 1 year.</p>
