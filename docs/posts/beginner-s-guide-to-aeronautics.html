<p> The <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/index.html">Beginner&#39;s Guide to Aeronautics</a> (BGA) was created
  as a Web-based &#34;textbook.&#34; The creation of the BGA is a research project
  to explore the use of the personal computer and the Internet to present educational
  materials to students, teachers, and lifelong learners in a more interactive
  way than a printed, bound textbook.</p>
<p> As a general rule, the Web consists of many individual <b>pages</b> that are
  connected, or related, to one another through <b>hyperlinks</b>. The Web is,
  therefore, much less structured than a bound book, in which one page follows
  another in a definite, numbered sequence. We have intentionally organized the
  BGA to mirror this unstructured approach. Users can <b>navigate </b>the pages
  of the BGA through hyperlinks based on their own interest and inquiry. </p>
<p> For those who prefer more structure to the information available at the BGA,
  we have organized an alternative to the unstructured approach--a number of <b>guided
  tours</b> through the site. Each tour is organized around a single topic, and
  users move from page to page through the tour by using special buttons at the
  bottom of each page. </p>
<p>
  Click<img src="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/butpre.gif" alt="Picture of button used to display previous page" width="100" height="20"/> to move back to the previous page.</p>
<p>(<i>Some pages will be &#34;crossed&#34; by more than one tour, so it is important
  to remember which tour you are on. If you click on a hyperlink you will leave
  the tour; you can rejoin the tour by using the browser&#39;s &#34;<b>Back</b>&#34; command.
  If you wish to abort a tour and return here, just click on the &#34;Guided Tours&#34; label
  located above the buttons.
