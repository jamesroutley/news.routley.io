Some experts say the term drought is inadequate because it suggests conditions will return to normal.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">&#34;We are never going to see these reservoirs filled again in our lifetime,&#34; said Denielle Perry, a professor at Northern Arizona University&#39;s School of Earth and Sustainability.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">The new measures will put more stress on Lake Mead, the country&#39;s largest reservoir, which is downstream from Lake Powell and also at a record low. Lake Mead, formed by Hoover Dam in the 1930s and crucial to the water supply of 25 million people, has fallen so low that a barrel containing human remains, believed to date to the 1980s, was found in the receding shoreline on Sunday. <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/body-barrel-found-near-las-vegas-mud-drought-shrunken-lake-mead-2022-05-03/"> read more </a></p><div><div><h5 data-testid="Heading">Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Donna Bryson and Sandra Maler</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
