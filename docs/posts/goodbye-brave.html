<p>I have been using the <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser</a> for almost 2 years I think. <a href="https://twitter.com/logic">@logic</a> introduced it to me at some point and it has been my primary browser both in Desktop and Mobile, home and office computers since then.</p>



<p>I got my first heads up when I came across <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29061436">a post on HackerNews</a> about Brave misbehaving due to the “Brave backend servers” being unreachable. It struck me as strange when <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/19125#issuecomment-955806829">a comment on the </a>Github ticket mentioned that Brave servers need to be up for Brave to function.</p>



<p>This is a big design NO-NO for something as essential as a web browser. But then, the inertia of it being a daily driver, its amazing ad-blocking and tracker protection, Chrome extension compatibility, and the fact I haven’t faced any such issues prevented me from doing any changes.</p>



<p>Today I was looking to install an extension to manage the browser tabs and I ran into this</p>

<p>I thought maybe the extension was buggy and tried a couple more and the same result for everything. And searching for the error led me to <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/16611#issuecomment-868203630">this Github Ticket</a>, which again describes that it is a “server-side” issue and it was fixed.</p>



<p>Well, it is not fixed for me. But that’s beside the point. This amount of dependency for a browser to have on “backend servers” is ridiculous. For software, as important as a browser, through which I have come to access almost everything digital for me is unacceptable. So with this post being the last thing I will do on Brave, I will bid goodbye.</p>

<ol><li>An interesting alternate is <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a> – It is trying to do what Opera was doing pre-Chrome. It rolls email, calendar, RSS reader, browser all into one and also provides built-in ad-blocking.</li><li>Open source Chrome aka <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> – This used to be my primary dirver before. So I am thinking of going back to it with the usual extensions like Ghostery, AdBlock+..etc., Not sure how much things have changed there.</li></ol>
