    <h1>An unordered list of things I miss in Go</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I like Go. I think it is a <a href="https://kokada.capivaras.dev/blog/go-a-reasonable-good-language">reasonable good
language</a>, and has some good
qualities that makes up for its flaws. However, this doesn&#39;t mean I think the
language couldn&#39;t be better, far from it.</p>
<p>This blog post is a list of things that I miss from Go from other languages.
Some of the things here could probably be implemented soon, some other would
probably need a major revision of the language. The list is unordered, because
this makes it easier for me to update in the future if I found something else,
but also because I don&#39;t want to think too hard about giving each point here a
rank.</p>
<p>With all above, let&#39;s start.</p>
<h2>Ordered maps in standard library</h2>
<p>When I first learned about
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping">dictionaries</a> in
Python it quickly became one of my favorite data structures ever. They&#39;re
extremely versatile, and most modern programming languages have something
similar in its standard library. Go isn&#39;t different, it has
<a href="https://go.dev/blog/maps"><code>map</code></a>, that is Go implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash
table</a>. However <code>map</code> in Go are
quirky, for example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>package</span><span> </span><span>main</span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>	</span><span>m</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>bool</span><span>{</span><span>&#34;foo&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&#34;bar&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&#34;baz&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&#34;qux&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&#34;quux&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>}</span>

<span>	</span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>k</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>m</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>		</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>)</span>
<span>	</span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ </span>go<span> </span>run<span> </span>./test.go
<span>bar</span>
<span>baz</span>
<span>qux</span>
<span>quux</span>
<span>foo</span>

<span>$ </span>go<span> </span>run<span> </span>./test.go
<span>foo</span>
<span>bar</span>
<span>baz</span>
<span>qux</span>
<span>quux</span>

<span>$ </span>go<span> </span>run<span> </span>./test.go
<span>qux</span>
<span>quux</span>
<span>foo</span>
<span>bar</span>
<span>baz</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, I don&#39;t expect any hash table implementation to keep the order of the
elements, but Go actually <a href="https://victoriametrics.com/blog/go-map/">randomise each map
instance</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But hereâ€™s the deal, while the hash function used for maps in Go is
consistent across all maps with <strong>the same key type</strong>, the <code>seed</code> used by
that hash function is different for each map instance. So, when you create a
new map, Go generates a random seed just for that map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I understand the reason for this (i.e.: to avoid developers relying in a
specific iteration order), I still find it weird, and I think this is something
unique for Go. This decision means that even if you don&#39;t care about a specific
order, you will still need to sort the map before doing something else if you
want reproducibility, something that I care a lot.</p>
<p>The fix for this? Go could offer an ordered map implementation inside the
standard library. An ordered map ensure that the iteration order of the map is
the same as the insertion order (that is, by the way, a powerful property that
allow maps to be used in other contexts, not just my pet peeve above).</p>
<p>Python actually does this for any dictionaries since <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39980744">Python
3.6</a>, but it offered an
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict">OrderedDict</a>
before it (and <code>OrderedDict</code> still has some methods that normal <code>dict</code> doesn&#39;t,
that maybe useful in specific cases).</p>
<p>Before generics it would be impossible to have a type-safe API for such data
structure without introducing a new data type in the language (like <code>slices</code>),
but now Go has generics so it is not an issue anymore. The other issue is that
you would be forced to iterate manually in this new data structure, but thanks
to the new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.23#language"><code>range-over-func</code></a> in
Go 1.23, it means we can iterate in an ordered map as a library almost exactly
like we can do as a <code>map</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>&#34;orderedmap&#34;</span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>m</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>orderedmap</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>bool</span><span>]()</span>
<span>    </span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;foo&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;bar&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;baz&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>    </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>k</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Iterator</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// Order always will be: foo, bar, baz</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, of course the lack of Ordered Map in the standard library can be filled
with third party implementations, e.g.: I am using this
<a href="https://github.com/elliotchance/orderedmap">one</a> in one of my projects. But
being in standard library reduces the friction: if there was some
implementation in standard library, I would generally prefer it unless I have
some specific needs. However when the standard library doesn&#39;t offer what I
need, I need to find it myself a suitable library, and this ends up taking time
since generally there are lots of alternatives.</p>
<h2>Keyword and default arguments for functions</h2>
<p>Something that comes straight from Python that I miss sometimes in Go is that
you can do things like this when declaring a function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;World&#34;</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>&#34;Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>&#34;</span><span>)</span>

<span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Foo&#34;</span><span>)</span> <span># &#34;normal&#34; function call</span>
<span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;Bar&#34;</span><span>)</span> <span># calling with keyword arguments</span>
<span>hello</span><span>()</span> <span># calling with default arguments</span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ </span>python<span> </span>hello.py
<span>Hello, Foo</span>
<span>Hello, Bar</span>
<span>Hello, World</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The lack of default arguments especially affects even some of the API decisions
for Go standard library, for example, <code>string.Replace</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>func Replace(s, old, new string, n int) string</code>
Replace returns a copy of the string s with the first n non-overlapping
instances of old replaced by new. If old is empty, it matches at the
beginning of the string and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1
replacements for a k-rune string. If n &lt; 0, there is no limit on the number
of replacements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Go had default arguments, <code>Replace</code> could have e.g.: <code>func Replace(s, old, new string, n int = -1)</code> signature, that would mean by default it would always
replace every instance of the <code>s</code> string, something that is generally expected
by default.</p>
<h2>Nullability (or nillability)</h2>
<p>I talked I little about this in <a href="https://kokada.capivaras.dev/blog/go-a-reasonable-good-language">my previous post about
Go</a>, but I want to expand
here.</p>
<p>First, I don&#39;t think the language needs to support the generic solution for
nullability, that would be either having proper Union or Sum types. Kotlin
AFAIK doesn&#39;t support neither, but my 2 years experience with Kotlin showed
that just having nullable types already helped a lot in ensuring type safety.</p>
<p>Second, I do feel that Go has less issues with <code>nil</code> values, than say, Java,
because its decision of using zero values instead of <code>nil</code> in many cases. So
for example, a string can never be <code>nil</code>, however a string pointer can be. This
means that this is fine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>// do something with s</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>However:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>// s maybe nil here, better check first</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Still, I get more <code>panic</code> for <code>nil</code> pointer deference than I get in other
languages that offer nullables (heck, even Python with
<a href="https://www.mypy-lang.org/"><code>mypy</code></a> is safer).</p>
<p>Sadly this is the change in this post that is more likely to need a completely
new revision of the language.
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49202">nillability</a> was proposed before,
but it is really unlikely it can be done without breaking backwards
compatibility.</p>
<p>It could be done the Java way by adding a <code>nullable</code> type to the standard
library (<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305">JSR305</a>), but the fact that
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2289694/what-is-the-status-of-jsr-305">JSR305 is considerd
dead</a>
by many shows how difficult it is to do something like this without a major
change in the language. Dart is the only language that I know that <a href="https://dart.dev/null-safety/understanding-null-safety">did this
successfully</a>, but
definitely it was not without its pains. And the fact that most people that
program in Dart probably does because of Flutter (that eventually required
newer versions with null-safety) is not a good sign.</p>
<h2>Lambdas</h2>
<p><em>Added in 2024-08-18</em></p>
<p>Go is a surprising good language for some functional code, thanks to having
first class functions and closures. Sadly the syntax doesn&#39;t help, since the
only way you can use anonymous functions in Go is using <code>func</code>. Especially if
the types are complex, this can result in some convoluted code. Take the
example from the <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/RangefuncExperiment"><code>range-over-func</code>
experiment</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>package</span><span> </span><span>slices</span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>Backward</span><span>[</span><span>E</span><span> </span><span>any</span><span>](</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>bool</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>yield</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>bool</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&gt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>--</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>!</span><span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>                </span><span>return</span>
<span>            </span><span>}</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If Go had a syntax for lambdas, especially if we could elide the types, this
could be simplified a lot:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>package</span><span> </span><span>slices</span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>Backward</span><span>[</span><span>E</span><span> </span><span>any</span><span>](</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>bool</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>yield</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&gt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>--</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>!</span><span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>                </span><span>return</span>
<span>            </span><span>}</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Or even something like this would already help, no special syntax but allowing
the types to be elided in an unnamed function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>package</span><span> </span><span>slices</span>

<span>func</span><span> </span><span>Backward</span><span>[</span><span>E</span><span> </span><span>any</span><span>](</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>bool</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>yield</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>&gt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>--</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>!</span><span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>                </span><span>return</span>
<span>            </span><span>}</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This feature I am still somewhat hopeful that may become a reality in some
future version of the language, since they didn&#39;t close the
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21498">issue</a> yet, and the discussion
about the possibility of this feature is still ongoing.</p>
