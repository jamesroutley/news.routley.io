    <h1>Making Videos With MediaRecorder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This story started on a Sunday, at the <a href="https://sundai.club/">SundAI Club</a>. Which reminds me, I should post about the fun AI hacks I have been part of at this club since the end of December 2024. Another day!</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>
<p>I wanted to create <a href="https://fireship.io">Fireship</a>-styled videos of my friend Andrew’s <a href="https://velab.dev/news">AI newsletter</a>. I quickly found out that AI video generation was slighly expensive, and I didn’t want to lose much money on this one-day hack.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
<p>Since audio and image generation are relatively inexpensive, I simplified the plan to fit my budget.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate audio using <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a></li>
<li>Generate images using <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e/">DALL-E</a></li>
<li>Use the images to create a slideshow</li>
<li>Combine the audio and the slideshow to make a video inside the browser</li>
<li>Allow the user to download the video</li>
</ul>
<p>I knew that making videos inside a web browser was possible, because that’s how I think <a href="https://vizzy.io">vizzy.io</a> works. I just needed to do it.</p>
<h2 id="the-hack">The hack</h2>
<p>Getting the audio was the easiest step, ElevenLabs has a great library of voices. Creating the slideshow was also quick, thanks to AI being well-versed in using the HTML Canvas API.
The fun started when I combined the slideshow and the audio. This is where <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder">MediaRecorder</a> came into the picture.
I did manage to combine the audio and the slideshow, and make the video playable in the browser.
However, I couldn’t figure out how to make it downloadable. Whatever I had made was good enough for a quick and entertaining demo, and that’s all I did on the day of the hack.</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-part">The hard part</h2>
<p>Creating the downloadable file turned out to be the hard part. I asked AI and the internet for troubleshooting tips, but nothing helped. The video was playing fine inside the browser, but the downloaded file was getting truncated to 6 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-problem">The first problem</h3>
<p>I found out the reason - I had created the audio file by concatenating two mp3 files. The internet recommended against doing this. But I had been splitting and joining mp3 files back in 2002 when I was in college. Because we didn’t have CD writers and had to share music over multiple floppy disks. I knew it was fine to concatenate mp3 files, it just worked. Even if it was technically not the best way.</p>
<p>What was happening is that the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement">AudioElement</a> node which was playing the audio track took the duration from the header of the mp3 file, which belonged to the first part of the concatenated file. And I was stopping the MediaRecorder whenever the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/ended">ended</a> event was triggered. Hence the video recording was only as long as the first part of the audio file.</p>
<p>I decided it might be too much work trying to figure out the correct length of the audio file. So I put in a fixed duration of 25 seconds for the recording. I also put in a limit of 300 characters for the script, in order to fit in the 25 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="the-second-problem">The second problem</h3>
<p>This change got me past the 6 second limit, but my video was still much shorter than it should have been. I kept on debugging this and every time I was generating new images and audio files. Which meant more and more LLM API calls. I had to make my debugging affordable!</p>
<p>So I created a new mini-project to focus on the problem using two mp3 files which were already present. This mini-project was creating a video file from the audio of the concatenated mp3 files. I could see the same problem still happening. But I did notice another possible reason - the audio was starting to play a little after I called the play() method of the AudioElement node.</p>
<p>It turned out that this is intentional. Audio tracks may not be pre-loaded before play() is called. I found out a load() method on AudioElement, I called it before calling play(), and that seemed to eliminate this problem.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-problem">The last problem</h3>
<p>The final video was still getting truncated. I left my debugging attempts for a few days, until I was at another edition of the SundAI Club. I looked at how MediaRecorder works. It keeps  capturing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob">Blob</a> objects and sending them to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder/ondataavailable">ondataavailable</a> event handler. For some reason I was getting an incomplete Blob object.</p>
<p>While I was researching about this, I found that someone on the internet claimed to have solved a similar problem by passing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder/start#timeslice">timeslice</a> argument to MediaRecorder’s start(). This argument is the number of milliseconds to wait before firing a dataavailable event. I passed 1000 as the argument, and I started getting multiple dataavailable events. And I got all the Blob objects for the entire video!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I conclude that it is entirely within my ability to create videos using MediaRecorder. Most modern browsers seem to support it. While ffmpeg is a more powerful tool, it will probably cost more money to do it on the cloud.</p>
