    <h1>Ask HN: Why isn&#39;t JSON-RPC more widely adopted?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>JSON-RPC / OpenRPC seems like a great option for APIs. Why isn&#39;t it adopted more widely?</p><p>Many of the APIs of projects I&#39;ve worked with look like essentially like RPC style calls. The URLs are structured as action/method names to do specific things. I like many of the benefits to an RPC approach compared to REST, GraphQL, or gRPC-Web. Unfortunately, the client code generation with popular options feels clunky when you want to use them in an RPC style. It seems like JSON-RPC would be better.</p><p><a href="https://open-rpc.org" rel="nofollow">https://open-rpc.org</a></p><p><a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org" rel="nofollow">https://www.jsonrpc.org</a></p></div></div></div>
