    <h1>Chuck E. Cheese&#39;s animatronics band bows out</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Chuck E. Cheese’s Animatronics Band Bows Out"><div><p>
	When I was eight years old, I won a coloring contest that earned me a free birthday party at my hometown Chuck E. Cheese. We don’t have any photos from the event because, as my mother recalls, it was absolute mayhem. Kids were running from room to room playing video games and Skee-Ball. The adults couldn’t corral anyone for pizza and cake. And then there was the show: The animatronic rat Charles “Entertainment” Cheese and the Pizza Time Players entertained—or terrified—attendees with their songs and corny banter.
</p><p>
	That may have been the last time I entered a Chuck E. Cheese pizzeria. And yet, when I heard that the company was phasing out the animatronic bands from all but five locations by the end of this year, I felt a twinge of nostalgia. Much to my surprise, I was truly sad that the moving dolls are being replaced by video screens, dance floors, and trampolines. Consider this my ode to the era of animatronics.
</p><h2>How Chuck E. Cheese Got Its Start</h2><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nolan-bushnell" target="_self">Nolan Bushnell</a>, a founder of Atari, opened the first Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, Calif., in 1977. His goal was simple: He wanted to vertically integrate the arcade market. Bushnell was familiar with the economics of coin-operated games; his company had hit it big with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pong" target="_self"><em><em>Pong</em></em></a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/atari-breakout" target="_self"><em><em>Breakout</em></em></a>, and other games. At the time, Atari was selling its arcade games for US $1,500 to $2,000 each, but the real money was in the $50,000 in coins that a game would take in over its lifetime. Bushnell didn’t just want to produce the machines; he wanted to collect the quarters, too.

	According to <a href="https://www.si.edu/media/NMAH/NMAH-AC1498_Transcript_NolanBushnell.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bushnell’s 2017 oral history</a> with the Archives Center of the National Museum of American History, he was inspired by a popular pizza joint called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/remembering-the-dining-fad-of-pizza-and-pipes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pizza and Pipes</a>, which had a Wurlitzer theater organ that lit up as it played. His kids loved the music and light show, but the organist often didn’t work on weekdays. Bushnell decided to take this idea one step further by adding video games. He figured that while patrons waited the 20 or so minutes for their pizza, they could play arcade games and watch a show. He just needed to figure out what the show would be.
</p><p>
	Further inspiration hit when he visited Disneyland and saw its many animatronic creations. Animatronics often include electronic, mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic parts. The character’s head and arms generally move freely, but it can’t walk from one place to another. Walt Disney’s Imagineers had pioneered <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050153624A1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">audio-animatronics</a>, which they described in one of their patents as a “robotic figure, puppet, or other movable object that is animated via one or more electromechanical devices.” (Unlike today’s robot designs, none of the animatronics of the ’60s and ’70s were truly interactive; all of the songs and conversation were prerecorded and synched with movements through computer programming.)
</p><p>
	Bushnell had an “aha” moment when he entered Disneyland’s <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/enchanted-tiki-room/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enchanted Tiki Room</a>, which featured four talking macaws as emcees and a cast of over 150 singing birds, drumming Tikis, rhyming Polynesian gods, and crooning flowers. A large control room with banks of floor-to-ceiling computers, relays, and pneumatic pumps was required to coordinate the figures’ sounds and movements, as shown in this vintage video clip:
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="9c4a4dc9f8bc3d569bc383fa3cc9fa3b"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HE-RFILrDzA?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE-RFILrDzA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.youtube.com</a></small></p><p>
	Now all Bushnell needed was a mascot. At a trade show for amusement parks (yes, of course, there’s such a thing), he bought a full-body costume of what he thought was a coyote—Coyote Pizza had a good ring to it—and gave it to his engineers with the task: “Make this guy talk.”
</p><p>
	The engineers did as instructed, but the costume turned out to be a rat, not a coyote. Bushnell rolled with it, and suggested changing the name of the pizzeria to Rick Rat’s Pizza. But the marketing team balked, saying no one would want to eat food associated with rats. They took a week to brainstorm new names and came back with Chuck E. Cheese. It was a “three-smile name,” they said, because you smiled three times when you said it. With the name change and a bit of a character makeover, they launched the new business.
</p><p>
	The restaurant opened with the eponymous rat and several other animatronic characters, which they termed cyberamics in later iterations of the show. In the original installation, the characters were showcased in faux picture frames on the walls surrounding the main dining area, mimicking a theater in the round, as shown in this clip:

Jowls</a> played the banjo. <a href="https://chucke.fandom.com/wiki/Crusty_the_Cat?so=search" target="_blank">Crusty the Cat</a> shared a wall with Chuck. And a curtain would rise to reveal the soulful magpies, <a href="https://chucke.fandom.com/wiki/The_Warblettes" target="_blank">the Warblettes</a>. A rotating roster of special guests, including the singing hippo <a href="https://chucke.fandom.com/wiki/Dolli_Dimples" target="_blank">Dolli Dimples</a>, filled out the show.</p><p>
	The characters performed six two-minute shows per hour. Banks of pneumatic valves caused the players to wave their arms, blink their eyes, and move their heads. At times, there could be more than 200 movements happening at once. Two-track synchronized audio tapes, one for the sound and one for the data signals, controlled the characters. Programming was done on a Digital Equipment Corp. minicomputer, and it took approximately three hours of programming for every minute of animation.
</p><h2>Chuck E. Cheese Gets a Rival: ShowBiz Pizza</h2><p>
	The restaurant was a success, bringing in $500,000 in its first year (about $2.5 million today). Even so, other pizza purveyors were skeptical of the concept. In the 25 December 1978 issue of <em><em>Business Week, </em></em>Donald Smith, executive vice-president of <a href="https://www.shakeys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shakey’s</a>, noted that his pizza parlor chain, which had pioneered live bands that patrons could sing along to, was shifting away from such entertainment. In the same article, John Hollingsworth, president of the company that owned <a href="https://www.strawhatpizza.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Straw Hat Pizza</a>, said the jury was still out on whether Chuck E. Cheese would succeed. After all, he speculated, they would have to compete with the growing sophistication of home video games.
</p><p>
	Bushnell wanted to grow the business, but he wasn’t fully in charge of Atari any more. The previous year the company had been sold to Warner Communications, and although the original restaurant was part of the deal, Warner didn’t want to be in the food business. So Bushnell bought Chuck E. Cheese and developed it on his own.
</p><p>
	To expand beyond California, Bushnell decided to franchise the business. That’s where things got messy. In 1979 he <a href="https://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/joint/joint_82fortune.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed an agreement</a> with businessman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Brock" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert Brock</a> to build 200 restaurants in 16 midwest and southern states. At the time, Brock owned the largest franchise of Holiday Inn hotels in the country and had the capital and lines of credit to invest in Chuck E. Cheese; Bushnell was financing his share of the enterprise with his own money from the sale of Atari.
</p><p>
	But before Brock even opened his first restaurant, he wanted out of the contract. Brock had discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Fechter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aaron Fechter</a> and his company, <a href="https://engineeringcreative.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Creative Engineering Inc.</a>, which manufactured high-end animatronics for amusement parks. In Brock’s view, CEI’s characters were vastly superior to Chuck E. Cheese and the gang. Lawsuits (breach of contract) and countersuits (misrepresentation) ensued.
</p><p>
	In 1980, Brock started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShowBiz_Pizza_Place" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ShowBiz Pizza</a> as a direct competitor to Chuck E. Cheese with more or less the same format: a pizza place with an animatronic show and video-arcade games. CEI provided the show, called Rock-afire Explosion. The band featured <a href="https://showbizpizza.com/rae/characters/fatz.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fatz Geronimo</a>, a gorilla, on keyboard; <a href="https://showbizpizza.com/rae/characters/mitzi.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mitzi Mozzarella</a>, a cheerleading mouse, on vocals; <a href="https://showbizpizza.com/rae/characters/beachbear.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beach Bear</a> on guitar; and <a href="https://showbizpizza.com/rae/characters/dook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dook LaRue</a>, a dog in a spacesuit, on drums. <a href="https://showbizpizza.com/rae/characters/billybob.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Billy Bob Brockali</a>, a brown bear in red and yellow overalls, served as ShowBiz Pizza’s mascot. Here, the band gives its version of “The Twelve Days of Christmas”:
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="490ca10dc01fdb0314c8f58e2acc82ef"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q18-FMkBeDI?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q18-FMkBeDI" target="_blank">www.youtube.com</a></small></p><p>I’m not sure I ever visited a ShowBiz Pizza, but I did see Rock-afire Explosion’s predecessor band, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=lvMtt4EQJnc" target="_blank">Wolf Pack 5</a>, at Livingston’s, a restaurant at the <a href="https://www.kingsdominion.com/" target="_blank">Kings Dominion</a> amusement park in Doswell, Va. My family always ate at that pavilion, not because of the animatronics, but because it was one of the few air-conditioned oases at the park. Although we were only trying to find relief from the summer heat, it turned out that air conditioning played a vital part in animatronic shows. The Enchanted Tiki Room was also the first air-conditioned pavilion at Disneyland due to the heat that the mechanics and electronics gave off.</p><h2>The evolution of Chuck E. Cheese </h2><p>
	By the mid-1980s, Chuck E. Cheese was operating in the red. As it turns out, manufacturing and operating animatronics is very expensive, and the great <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/videogame-history" target="_self">video-game crash of 1983</a> didn’t help. Chuck E. Cheese filed for bankruptcy, and Brock purchased it and merged the two restaurant chains into ShowBiz Pizza Time. The different animatronic shows continued to operate through the end of the decade, but in 1990, when Fechter refused to sell the rights for the Rock-afire characters to ShowBiz, Brock’s company launched what it called “concept unification.” It rebranded the Rock-afire characters as Munch’s Make Believe Band and merged them into Chuck E. Cheese’s ensemble so that all 262 restaurants had the same thematic animatronics. Over the next few years, the ShowBiz Pizza locations were rebranded as Chuck E. Cheese locations.
</p><p>
	Not everyone took the rebranding well. The 2008 documentary <em><em>The Rock-afire Explosion </em></em>follows several dedicated fans who rescued and renovated complete stage sets. It includes extended interviews with Aaron Fechter, who offers his own perspective on the rise and fall of animatronic restaurants. As Fechter walks the viewer through his once-bustling factory and warehouse, you can see how much love he had for the development of the characters and the employees who brought them to life. You also appreciate the complexity of the manufacturing process, including mold making, painting, and costume design; it’s clear that animatronics are expensive to produce even before any programming takes place.
</p><p>
	As the children who encountered either Chuck E. Cheese or Rock-afire Explosion aged into adulthood, the animatronics of their youth began to pop up in other popular culture forms. The video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em></em></a>, launched in 2014, featured security guards at a pizza restaurant who have to fend off animatronic characters gone rogue. In 2023, in season 16 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></em></a><em><em>, </em></em>the gang heads to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8KvgQyhFqc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Risk E. Rat’s Pizza and Amusement Center</a>—clearly a play on Bushnell’s discarded name—only to find the riskiness replaced by safety. Chuck E. Cheese is referenced directly in several episodes of <em><em>The Simpsons, </em></em>but Bart also celebrates his birthday at Wall E. Weasel’s, where the animatronic Señor Beaverotti breaks down and catches fire.
