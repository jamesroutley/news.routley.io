    <h1>Twitter suspends account tracking Maxwell trial</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div><p>I woke up this morning and the @<a href="https://twitter.com/TrackerTrial" rel="">TrackerTrial</a> account on Twitter was suspended. All the other accounts that I have made in the past were also suspended.

I am not sure what I was “amplifying” and how I was doing that.</p><p>The account got insane engagement, which by the way, was all organic. There was not outside amplification. The people wanted to hear the <strong>truth</strong> about the Ghislaine Maxwell, and Jeffrey Epstein trial and the engagement numbers showed that. There were hundreds of millions in impressions and an account that went from zero to over 525,000 followers in a couple of weeks. All we did was report information from the trial that the mainstream media was failing to do.</p><p>Going forward we will continue to report on the trial and all forms of big government and corporate corruption. This is just the beginning. We have appealed to Twitter for a possible lift of the suspension, but it is likely we will never hear from them. </p><p>Big tech has gotten too powerful, and they can silence us anytime they want. As we wrote earlier in the week in an article titled, <em><a href="https://patriotone.substack.com/p/the-global-media-industrial-complex" rel="">The Global Media Industrial Complex</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>Local blogs and websites are suppressed by big tech algorithms. If you write one thing out of line Google can institute a site wide ban, making sure you never show up in search algorithms again. Facebook restricts what is posted on their website. Twitter suppresses any outside links, to keep users on their own site. <strong>The year is 2021 and big brother is watching</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The only thing I am asking is for everyone to share this article to get the word out. All information pertaining to this trial will be exclusively written here. I also have a <a href="https://gab.com/NancyTracker" rel="">Gab account</a> if anyone is interested in a more informal route of communication. Finally, if you want to support the freedom of speech and press, consider becoming a paid member of <em>The Free Press Report. </em></p><p>The only way for us to stay <strong>independent</strong> and provide coverage of corruption indefinitely is to be a reader supported publication. We need to go back to the old school days where the <strong>PEOPLE</strong> supported and funded the free press. The Founding Fathers believed in the freedom of press. The right to report on news and circulate opinion without censorship from the government. Today this censorship is from big tech, another powerful arm of a tyrannical government.</p><p>You can help support the freedom of the press by becoming a paid subscriber to <em>The Free Press Report</em>. For the cost of only one coffee per month, you can help liberate knowledge and support the right to a free press. You can help keep <em>The Free Press Report</em> internally funded by the people, for the people.</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
