Share your experiences with us.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other campaigners agree internet access is now a vital utility essential for day-to-day life. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>People who cannot afford data can experience problems such as managing benefits, applying for jobs online or benefiting from cheaper online prices which exacerbate their difficult financial situation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government said its job centre staff &#34;regularly signpost claimants to relevant information on social tariffs, and claimants can access computers for their work search at their local job centre&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Citizens Advice cited the case of Rob, 63, who since about 2012 had been unable to afford broadband: &#34;Not having access at home means if I am applying for a job I need to give myself more time because the library is not open all day. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I can&#39;t just think at 22:00, &#39;let me go back to that application and finish filling it in&#39;. It also limits me from accessing services like my GP, online help and shopping.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The government points to a number of steps it has taken to help those who find broadband hard to afford. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In June, following negotiations with the government, leaders from major broadband and mobile operators agreed a set of public commitments to support customers struggling to pay their bills. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But campaigners the Digital Poverty Alliance echoed the concerns of Citizen Advice and said while social tariff uptake was &#34;slowly improving&#34;, it was still far below the levels needed to ensure all households were digitally included. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;For households in severe poverty, even an affordable social tariff may mean that essential connectivity is still out of reach,&#34; the organisation said.</p></div></article></div></div>
