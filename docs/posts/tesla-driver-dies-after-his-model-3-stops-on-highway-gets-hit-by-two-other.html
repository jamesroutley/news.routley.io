                        <p>A man was killed on Sunday night after the Tesla he was driving stopped in the middle of I-70 in Independence, Missouri, causing two vehicles to crash into it, police said. Police still are not certain what caused the vehicle to come to a stop in the center lane. </p><p>The Independence Police Department identified the driver of the 2019 Tesla Model 3 as 74-year-old Terry L. Siegel. In a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IndepMoPolice/posts/334694528704539" data-analytics-module="body_link">post</a>, the department said Siegel&#39;s passenger was transported to a local hospital for treatment, while the occupants of the other two vehicles were not injured. </p><p>At first, the Independence Police Department speculated that a mechanical issue caused the Tesla to lose power, but officials are now saying they are unsure what made the vehicle stop unexpectedly, Jack Taylor, a spokesperson for the department, told Insider. Taylor said investigators plan to extract data from the Tesla&#39;s computers in the coming days to better piece together what happened.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates transportation incidents, has contacted the Independence Police Department to gather more information about the incident but has not opened an investigation, a spokesperson told Insider. In a statement to <a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/deadly-crash-after-tesla-stops-on-i-70-prompts-investigation/" data-analytics-module="body_link">Kansas City&#39;s Fox4</a>, the agency called the crash &#34;unusual and unique.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a preliminary investigation into Tesla after hundreds of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/02/tesla-phantom-braking/" data-analytics-module="body_link">owners reported</a> that their vehicles would sometimes unexpectedly slam on the brakes for no apparent reason. According to the agency, these incidents, known as &#34;phantom braking,&#34; sometimes happened at highway speeds.</p><p>Sudden braking occurred when owners had switched on cruise control or Autopilot, a system that automatically brakes, steers, and accelerates to aid with highway driving. NHTSA is investigating the phenomenon in Model Y and Model 3 vehicles from the 2021 and 2022 model years. Owners of <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/AWD" data-analytics-module="body_link">2019</a> and <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2020/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y/SUV/AWD" data-analytics-module="body_link">2020</a> vehicles have also complained to NHTSA about phantom braking. </p><p>The problem appears to stem from an issue with Tesla&#39;s automatic emergency braking system, a feature in most new vehicles that hits the brakes when sensors indicate that a crash is imminent. According to owner reports, Teslas are sometimes interpreting oncoming vehicles, shadows, and passing cars as dangerous obstacles to be avoided. </p><p>Representatives from Tesla and NHTSA did not immediately return requests for comment. </p>
