    <h2><a id="50">2021-02-25 - pgAdmin 4 v5.0 Released</a><a></a></h2><a>
    </a><p><a>The pgAdmin Development Team are pleased to announce pgAdmin 4 version 5.0. This release of pgAdmin 4 includes 31 bug fixes and new features. For more details please see the </a><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/5.0/release_notes_5_0.html">release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Notable changes in this release include:</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>New Desktop Runtime (Using NWjs):</strong></li>
<p>The Desktop Runtime is now based on NWjs which integrates a browser and the Python server creating a standalone application. By implementing it using NWjs we get rid of the separate server application and the independent browser. We also get rid of QT and C++ runtime logic.</p>
<p>There are two minor known issues with this feature (<a href="https://redmine.postgresql.org/issues/6255">6255</a> and <a href="https://redmine.postgresql.org/issues/6258">6258</a>), both of which are due to bugs in NWjs itself; Users on macOS should use the application menu to exit pgAdmin, rather than quitting from the Dock icon to avoid the first issue. The second issue may cause Windows users to see a red square instead of the normal application icon in some circumstances.</p>
<li><strong>Logical Replication support:</strong></li>
<p>Logical replication uses a publish and subscribe model with one or more subscribers subscribing to one or more publications on a publisher node. We have added support for logical replication by introducing new treeview nodes and dialogues with which users can easily create/alter/delete publications and subscriptions. Support is also included in the Schema Diff tool.</p>
<li><strong>Quick Search functionality:</strong></li>
<p>Added a quick search option in the Help menu to search menu items and help articles. Type at least three characters to display all the matching possibilities under Menu items and the relevant documents under Help articles.</p>
<li>Make Statistics, Dependencies, Dependants tabs closable. Users can add them back using the &#39;Add panel&#39; option on the context menu for the tab strip.</li>
<li>When running in Docker/Kubernetes, ensure logs are not stored in the container, and only sent to the console.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs/Housekeeping:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Use cheroot as the default production server for pgAdmin4.</li>
<li>Updated Javascript dependencies to the latest versions.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the focus is not properly set on the filter text editor after closing the error dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the dependencies tab shows multiple owners for the objects having shared dependencies.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Zoom to fit button in the ERD Tool only works if the diagram is larger than the canvas.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the user was unable to change the background color for a server.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where external utility jobs (backup, maintenance etc.) are failing when the log level is set to DEBUG.</li>
<li>Ensure DEB/RPM packages depend on the same version of each other.</li>
<li>Fixed an autocomplete issue where it is not showing any suggestions if the schema name contains escape characters.</li>

    <h2><a id="49">2021-01-28 - pgAdmin 4 v4.30 Released</a><a></a></h2><a>
    </a><p><a>The pgAdmin Development Team are pleased to announce pgAdmin 4 version 4.30. This release of pgAdmin 4 includes 38 bug fixes and new features. For more details please see the </a><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/4.30/release_notes_4_30.html">release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Notable changes in this release include:</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>ERD Tool (Beta):</strong></li>
<p>The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool is a database design tool that provides a graphical representation of database tables, columns, and inter-relationships. You can use the ERD tool to design a new schema and generate the SQL required to create it, or to reverse engineer and diagram an existing database schema.</p>
<li><strong>Kerberos Support:</strong></li>
<p>Kerberos support is added in pgAdmin 4 using SPNEGO for logging into pgAdmin, similar to the existing LDAP and &#34;internal&#34; options. Note that support for logging into database servers using Kerberos is not included in this release, but will be added in a future version.</p>
<li><strong>Add a container option (PGADMIN_DISABLE_POSTFIX) to disable the Postfix server:</strong></li>
<p>Postfix (like other MTAs) must start as user &#39;root&#39;, and the pgAdmin container achieves this using &#39;sudo&#39;. Whilst that works well in most environments, it can cause problems in some. This option allows you to completely disable Postfix to avoid these issues, though you will need to configure an external mail server to be used to send password reset emails.
</p>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs/Housekeeping:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Improve the explain plan details by showing a popup instead of a tooltip when clicking on plan nodes.</li>
<li>Ensure that verbose logs are visible for Utility (Backup, Maintenance etc.) jobs.</li>
<li>Added support for expressions in exclusion constraints.</li>
<li>Ensure that the &#39;template1&#39; database is not visible after pg_upgrade.</li>
<li>Added appropriate help message and a placeholder for letting users know about the account password expiry for Login/Group Role.</li>
<li>Updated Flask-BabelEx to the latest version.</li>
<li>Fixed extra parentheses issue around joins for Views.</li>
<li>Ensure that the current value of sequences is ignored while comparing using Schema Diff.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when the user tries to delete multiple records in the data grid.</li>
<li>Fixed TypeError exception in schema diff when selecting two identical objects.</li>
<li>Include PostgreSQL 13 utilities in the container distribution.</li>

    </a><p><a>After over 10,000 hours of development work, pgAdmin 4 v1.0 is finally available for download!

<p>pgAdmin 4 is a complete rewrite of pgAdmin, built using Python and Javascript/jQuery. A desktop runtime written in C++ with Qt allows it to run standalone for individual users, or the web application code may be deployed directly on a webserver for use by one or more users through their web browser. The software has the look and feel of a desktop application whatever the runtime environment is, and vastly improves on pgAdmin III with updated user interface elements, multi-user/web deployment options, dashboards and a more modern design.</p>
