    <h1>Instagram data breach reportedly exposed the personal info of 17.5M users</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-article-body="true"><p>If you received a bunch of password reset requests from Instagram recently, you&#39;re not alone. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://bsky.app/profile/malwarebytes.com/post/3mbywfybiil26" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Malwarebytes;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Malwarebytes</a>, an antivirus software company, initially reported that there was a data breach revealing the &#34;sensitive information&#34; of 17.5 million Instagram users. Malwarebytes added that the leak included Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and more. However, <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/instagram/status/2010202301886238822?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram said;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Instagram said</a> there was no breach and that user accounts were &#34;secure.&#34;</p><div><blockquote><div><p>We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people.

In response, Instagram posted on X that users can ignore the recent emails requesting password resets.</p><p>&#34;We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people,&#34; Instagram&#39;s post on X read. &#34;There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure.&#34;</p><p>While Instagram said this isn&#39;t a data breach, its parent company has been in hot water for <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-gdpr-data-breach-eu-fine-173528015.html" data-ylk="slk:data breaches;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">data breaches</a> in the past. If you haven&#39;t already, it&#39;s always a good idea to turn on two-factor authentication and change your password.
