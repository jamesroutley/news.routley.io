Nessel called it the biggest data center for the state of Michigan and one of the biggest for America.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re talking about 1.4 gigawatts, which is, of course, enough to provide energy to a city of a million people,&#34; Nessel said. &#34;I think we should be taking this extremely seriously, don&#39;t you? Do you guys trust DTE? Do you trust Open AI? Do we trust Oracle to look out for our best interests here in Michigan?&#34;</p><p>To each question, members of the crowd shouted, &#34;No!&#34;</p><p>A Facebook group, &#34;Michiganders Against Data Centers,&#34; organized the rally that drew residents from as far as Detroit to the east and Lowell and Kalamazoo to the west.</p><p>Data center plans that would provide the infrastructure for today&#39;s digital world and are touted as a key component for artificial intelligence already have found approval in Lyon Township and <a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/money/business/michigan/2025/12/16/southfield-city-council-approves-data-centermetrobloks/87774464007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u">Southfield</a>.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/16/PLSJ/87796790007-data-center-rally-0805.jpg?width=660&amp;height=437&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/16/PLSJ/87796790007-data-center-rally-0805.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=874&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Demonstrators, including Seth Bernard, of Lake City, rally Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, during the Michiganders Against Data Centers protest at the state Capitol in Lansing."/></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2025/12/15/lansing-downtown-deep-green-data-centers/87708221007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u">Lansing City Council is expected to vote early in the new year</a> on United Kingdom-based Deep Green&#39;s conditional rezoning request and a sale of city-owned parcels mainly functioning as parking lots to build a two-story, 25,000-square-foot, 24-megawatt data center along Kalamazoo Street, between Cedar and Larch streets.</p><p>Patrick and Pam Lind of the Mason area were in the crowd, holding a sign that protested data centers being potentially placed in Mason and Vevay Township.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re trying to get in front of this to stop it,&#34; Patrick Lind said.</p><p>He had hoped to see more people at the rally, but his wife was thankful to see the diverse crowd, which included people from various backgrounds.</p><p>&#34;They are reflecting what the Michigan citizens are feeling about our natural resources,&#34; Pam Lind said, emphasizing Michigan&#39;s Great Lakes and fresh water. &#34;We don&#39;t like to see it sold out. We don&#39;t want to see it polluted. We don&#39;t want to see the water levels dropping. We care about our people. We care about their health and their mental well-being. We care about our rural and our farmlands. That&#39;s Pure Michigan.&#34;</p><p>Among the legislators in attendance, state Rep. Reggie Miller, D-Van Buren Township, spoke out against a &#34;gold rush mentality&#34; of the data center developers and Rep. James DeSana, R-Carleton, spoke out against tax breaks for data centers and their push to move into Michigan.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/16/PLSJ/87796432007-data-center-rally-07909.jpg?width=660&amp;height=440&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/16/PLSJ/87796432007-data-center-rally-07909.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=880&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Demonstrators protest Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, during the Michiganders Against Data Centers rally at the state Capitol in Lansing."/></figure><p>&#34;We need the entire state to stand up,&#34; DeSana said. &#34;These could come to your area. You think you&#39;re safe today because you don&#39;t have a data center next to you. Just wait. They&#39;re coming.&#34;</p><p>East Lansing resident Nichole Keway Biber also attended the rally.</p><p>She said data center developers don&#39;t want people to ask questions about artificial intelligence&#39;s repercussions on the environment, jobs, mental health and children&#39;s cognitive development.</p><p>&#34;They&#39;re trying to push it on us as something we need rather than the reality that we need our lands for food,&#34; she said. &#34;We need our water to get cleaner, not be filled with even more chemicals.&#34;</p><p>Tim Bruneau of Saline Township lives less than two miles from the proposed data center site.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s no demonstrated need for a data center in Saline Township or one of the other 23 or 24 that we know of at this time affecting communities,&#34; Bruneau said. &#34;It&#39;s exploitation dressed up as innovation. This is not just a development proposal. It is, by every meaningful definition, a war on our way of life.&#34;</p><p><em>Contact editor Susan Vela at svela@lsj.com or 248-873-7044.
