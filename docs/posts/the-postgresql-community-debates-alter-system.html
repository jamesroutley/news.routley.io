Sometimes the smallest patches create the biggest discussions.  A case in
point would be the process by which the PostgreSQL community — not a group
normally prone to extended, strongly worded megathreads — resolved the question of
whether to merge a brief patch adding a new configuration parameter. 
Sometimes, a proposal that looks like a security patch is not, in
fact, intended to be a security patch, but getting that point across can be
difficult. 
</p><p>
The PostgreSQL server is a complex beast that can be extensively configured
and tuned for the environment in which it runs.  There are, naturally, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html">many
configuration parameters</a> available for administrators to work with.
There are also two ways to set those parameters.  In most deployments,
perhaps, administrators will edit the <tt>postgresql.conf</tt> file to
configure the system as needed.  It is, however, also possible to adjust
parameters within a running database with the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altersystem.html"><tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt>
command</a>.  Any changes made that way will be saved to a separate
<tt>postgresql.auto.conf</tt> file, which is also read by the server at
startup; these changes are thus persistent.
</p><h4>Disabling <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt></h4>
<p>
In early September 2023, Gabriele Bartolini <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+VUV5rEKt2+CdC_KUaPoihMu+i5ChT4WVNTr4CD5-xXZUfuQw@mail.gmail.com/">raised
the idea</a> of allowing administrators to disable <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt>,
either via a command-line parameter or a configuration option in its own
right (which, using PostgreSQL jargon, he calls a &#34;GUC&#34;, standing for
&#34;grand unified configuration&#34; parameter).
</p><blockquote>
	The main reason is that this would help improve the &#34;security by
	default&#34; posture of Postgres in a Kubernetes/Cloud Native
	environment - and, in general, in any environment on VMs/bare metal
	behind a configuration management system in which changes should
	only be made in a declarative way and versioned like Ansible Tower,
	to cite one.
</blockquote>
<p>
PostgreSQL core contributor Tom Lane quickly <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/1756006.1694118434@sss.pgh.pa.us/">expressed his
disagreement</a> with this proposal: &#34;<q>I don&#39;t think we need random
kluges added to the permissions system.  I especially don&#39;t believe in
kluges to the effect of &#39;superuser doesn&#39;t have all permissions
anymore&#39;.</q>&#34;  He suggested using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-triggers.html">event
triggers</a> to implement such a restriction locally if it is really
wanted.
</p><p>
Alvaro Herrera <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/202309091514.fdjfxlr5kjrw@alvherre.pgsql/">pointed
out</a> that <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt>, as a system-wide command, does not
invoke event triggers.  He also <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/202309081455.mjyy7fyeb7xb@alvherre.pgsql/">more
thoroughly explained the use case</a> that was driving this request:
</p><blockquote>
	I&#39;ve read that containers people consider services in a different
	light than how we&#39;ve historically seen them; they say &#34;cattle, not
	pets&#34;.  This affects the way you think about these services.
	postgresql.conf (all the PG configuration, really) is just a
	derived file from an overall system description that lives outside
	the database server.  You no longer feed your PG servers one by
	one, but rather they behave as a herd, and the herder is some
	container supervisor (whatever it&#39;s called).
<p>
	Ensuring that the configuration state cannot change from within is
	important to maintain the integrity of the service.  If the user
	wants to change things, the tools to do that are operated from
	outside.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Lane, though, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/1882832.1694187082@sss.pgh.pa.us/">described</a>
the feature as &#34;<q>false security</q>&#34;, and the discussion wound down for a
while.  But the fundamental disconnect had already become apparent: the
opposition to restricting <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt> was based on the idea that
it was intended as a security feature.  As such, it would be a failure,
since there are many other ways for a PostgreSQL user with the ability to
run <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt> to take control of the server.  But, as Bartolini
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+VUV5pK4N8FaGa0y47ZFVk9qWOwWMYOAUtX0J-o4A7hHfJRYA@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>,
this restriction is meant as a <i>usability</i> feature, closing off a
configuration mechanism that is not meant to be used in systems where
declarative configuration systems are in charge.
</p><h4>The new year</h4>
<p>
Robert Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+TgmoaJxzx+EqmfVQxtJMKor7WSminuHjfCaO1N2z=cNoHG6Q@mail.gmail.com/">restarted
the conversation</a> in January, acknowledging that the proposal is not
meant as a security feature, but worrying that it would be seen that way
anyway:
</p><blockquote>
	I have to admit that I&#39;m a little afraid that people will mistake
	this for an actual security feature and file bug reports or CVEs
	about the superuser being able to circumvent these restrictions. If
	we add this, we had better make sure that the documentation is
	extremely clear about what we are guaranteeing, or more to the
	point about what we are not guaranteeing.
</blockquote>
<p>
Even then, he worried, about &#34;<q>security researchers threatening to
publish our evilness in the Register</q>&#34;.  Lane then <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/2256675.1706642404@sss.pgh.pa.us/">declared</a>
that the project &#34;<q>should reject not only this proposal, but any future
ones that intend to prevent superusers from doing things that superusers
normally could do</q>&#34;.  Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+TgmoYNBs68DQifceGb4SNS8iaLt_wQCKuVJ8rNqeSvU4LiKA@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>,
though, that the original proposal might have merit, and should be taken
seriously.
</p><p>
The conversation continued inconclusively; two months later, Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+TgmoaCwtTn7QEuRYFUWypXUv6La5_-oYiiMJgw4LeC-ZujBw@mail.gmail.com/">complained</a>
that not much progress was being made.  That notwithstanding, he
said: &#34;<q>As far as I can see from reading the thread, most people agree
that it&#39;s reasonable to have some way to disable ALTER SYSTEM</q>&#34;.  There
were, though, six competing ways in which that objective could be
accomplished.  These included the command-line option and configuration
parameter originally proposed, along with an event trigger, pushing it into
an extension module, recognizing a sentinel file created by the
administrator, or just changing the permissions on
<tt>postgresql.auto.conf</tt>.  He suggested that the configuration option
and the sentinel file were the most viable options.
</p><p>
Lane <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/2366852.1710443616@sss.pgh.pa.us/">answered</a>
that any such restriction, implemented by any of the above mechanisms,
could still be bypassed by a hostile administrator.  Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+TgmobRx215ussbQgjM4dgds8xAcMwKeKmHN4UQoSV5jP4uzQ@mail.gmail.com/">replied</a>
that the proposal was not a security feature, but Lane <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/2372973.1710446903@sss.pgh.pa.us/">dismissed</a> it
as &#34;<q>a loaded foot-gun painted in kid-friendly colors</q>&#34; that would
lead to more bogus CVE numbers being filed against the project.
</p><h4>A new patch</h4>
<p>
On March 15, Jelte Fennema-Nio posted <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CAGECzQRrLpLzoOHmmUzo4g_Ed0CchJrez90s1tzZNoH00v-eFA@mail.gmail.com/">a
patch</a> implementing the restriction as a configuration parameter.  It
was, in the end, just an updated version of the patch posted by Bartolini
in September with some documentation tweaks.  Various comments resulted in
a number of newer versions; <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CAGECzQQttoyf5EtjZvG6Biyx=cTKON4zgo2Ok27HgmvkayCb_A@mail.gmail.com/">the
sixth of which</a> came out a few days later.  At this point, the patch
consisted mostly of documentation, including this admonition:
</p><blockquote>
	Note that this setting cannot be regarded as a security feature. It
        only disables the <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt> command. It does
        not prevent a superuser from changing the configuration remotely
        using other means.
</blockquote>
<p>
Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+TgmoZ26YPK0to4Ac-oTz56Ae_uU2zearWDwPLHAFeVtcjqsA@mail.gmail.com/">welcomed
this version</a> and asked whether there was a consensus on proceeding with
it.  Lane seemingly had <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/2517206.1711388833@sss.pgh.pa.us/">changed his view
somewhat</a> at this point, saying: &#34;<q>I never objected to the idea of
being able to disable ALTER SYSTEM</q>&#34;.  Bruce Momjian, instead, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/ZgHNeR2qlxofPH_W@momjian.us/">worried</a> that an
administrator could enter an <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt> command disabling
<tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt>, at which point recovery could be difficult.  In
fact, as Fennema-Nio <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CAGECzQQ5CaNo=JnL5_sxFCmyV8_76A9L7X-hRQYzhGLpJYzt4Q@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>,
that parameter cannot be set that way, so that particular trap does not
exist.
</p><p>
Momjian also <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/ZgHm36UALPgfD5GB@momjian.us/">took
issue</a> with the name of the parameter (which was
<tt>externally_managed_configuration</tt>), saying that it didn&#39;t really
describe what was being restricted.  He suggested
<tt>sql_alter_system_vars</tt> as an alternative.  Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+TgmoaX_XJMORzkTvG0D6+KZP4mYUSq1Paa8YOSmZUy0=tJSQ@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>
with the complaint, but thought  that <tt>allow_alter_system</tt> made more
sense.  That is, in the end, the name that was chosen for this option.
</p><p>
The discussion was not over yet, though.  Lane <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/3868891.1710859910@sss.pgh.pa.us/">wanted</a> the
server to ensure that <tt>postgresql.conf</tt> and
<tt>postgresql.auto.conf</tt> were not writable by the
<tt>postgres</tt> user if
<tt>allow_alter_system</tt> is disabled.  Otherwise, the database
administrator would still be able to modify the configuration simply by
editing one of the files.  Fennema-Nio <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CAGECzQQhvV1K-pDgrd8NVqXP0PUY9bCDs+CvE31KXX6hKqNB-Q@mail.gmail.com/">disagreed</a>,
saying that disabling <tt>ALTER SYSTEM</tt> was sufficient for the intended
use case, but Lane <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/3879337.1710864320@sss.pgh.pa.us/">said</a> that
the configuration parameter on its own is &#34;<q>a fig leaf that might fool
incompetent auditors but no more</q>&#34;.  Fennema-Nio <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CAGECzQQoZC0tG1xpi_+-O7uc3ESA7vJ+-Gsnb18WF0e1X78JKA@mail.gmail.com/">reminded</a>
Lane that the point of <tt>allow_alter_system</tt> is not security.  Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+TgmoYsyrCNmg+Yh6rgP7K8r-bYPjCeF1tPxENRFwD4VZAZvw@mail.gmail.com/">complained</a>
that: &#34;<q>I don&#39;t understand why people who hate the feature and hope it
dies in a fire get to decide how it has to work.</q>&#34; The file-permission check
was, in the end, not added.
</p><p>
Even then, the discussion was not quite done; Momjian <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/ZgSceowq_HL3VI_l@momjian.us/">questioned</a>
merging this change so late in the PostgreSQL development cycle.  &#34;<q>My
point is that we are designing the user API in the last weeks of the
commitfest, which usually ends badly for us</q>&#34;.  Fennema-Nio <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CAGECzQSZ9Z1cs_Ld0YcMrF6HyPVvzvtKmq9RGuRVcwmnSH_9BQ@mail.gmail.com/">pointed
out</a> that the API was essentially unchanged from its initial, September
form, and that months had been spent discussing alternatives.  Haas <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/CA+Tgmob3G5AL_fL0LGK8xBe1-TA6GhUCsJ5ohpaY348TLSv_-Q@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
that such a small patch would not improve by being held up for another
release cycle: &#34;<q>I think it has to be right to get this done while we&#39;re
all thinking about it and the issue is fresh in everybody&#39;s mind.</q>&#34;
</p><p>
On March 28, Momjian <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/pgsql-hackers/ZgXF7CEVb61aDRzY@momjian.us/">agreed</a> that
the patch could be merged.  One day later, Haas <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=d3ae2a24f265a028f4b9e8df79ea7b075c6cf016;hp=0075d78947e3800c5a807f48fd901f16db91101b">did
exactly that</a>.  And, with that, one of the longest-running development
discussions in recent PostgreSQL history came to an end.  The success of
this effort is a testament to the persistence of a small number of
developers who saw it through months of opposition and &#34;helpful&#34;
implementation suggestions.  Having decided
that difficult issue, the project can turn its attention to the <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/">small list of simple
topics</a> to be resolved during the upcoming July commitfest.<br clear="all"/></p><hr/><p>
