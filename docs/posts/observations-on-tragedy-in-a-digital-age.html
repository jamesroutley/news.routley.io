The digital age, with its technocratic and plutocratic optimism, is incapable of grasping this view of human frailty.</p><p><span>In other words, the notion of tragedy is almost meaningless in a world where Elon Musk aspires to be a starship commander and Bill Gates acts as medicine man to cure the planet. And it’s not just billionaires. A defining quality of our time is that everyone believes they have all the answers. That’s why the most popular career goal for youngsters right now is to be an </span><em>influencer</em><span>. Such a mindset can’t even begin to grasp the self-creating and self-perpetuating nature of tragedy.</span></p><p>(2)</p><p><span>Yet </span><em>influencing</em><span> itself is the foundation for tragedy. Hamlet and Oedipus would probably try to be influencers if they were alive today. Viewed in the proper light, influencer is a career path of tragic dimensions.  </span></p><p>(3)</p><p><span>In such a culture, the word</span><em> tragedy</em><span> must be misused, because we prefer not to confront its true meaning. Even I’m guilty of this. When Person A hurts Person B, we call it a tragedy. But the profound insight of tragedy only arrives when we grasp that Person A (yesterday) is the greatest obstacle facing Person A (tomorrow). That’s why the word</span><em> tragedy</em><span> is often spoken aloud, but the concept of an individual’s </span><em>tragic flaw</em><span> is rarely whispered even in private</span></p><p>(4)</p><p><span>The greatest tragic narratives of my lifetime have been </span><em>The Godfather</em><span> films and </span><em>Breaking Bad</em><span>. In these sagas, the protagonists destroy themselves in measured steps, and the audience is shaken by both the process and the consequences. The distinctive flavor of our times is that audiences want to view these individuals as heroes (or anti-heroes, to use the fashionable term), and will thus cheer these characters on to their final destruction.</span></p><p><span>This suggests that the audience is culpable to some degree. They knew that Tony Soprano is a broken person, but they applauded his every narcissistic and violent move. Are you surprised that they argue endlessly over the fairness of his death? Or even over </span><em>whether</em><span> he died?</span></p><p>What I find remarkable is how rarely movies and TV shows imitate this device. It’s extraordinarily powerful when shown on the screen, but there’s something in our contemporary mindset that resists it. Hollywood execs probably have stacks of market research showing that audiences prefer the happy ending—as is inevitable in a tragic age that lacks a sense of tragedy.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg" width="900" height="600" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:600,&#34;width&#34;:900,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:84556,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c18502c-96e3-40d6-b97f-f43795515602_900x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>(5)</p><p><span>For the same reason, we live in an age of hubris, but the word </span><em>hubris</em><span> is almost never spoken. The dictionary definition: hubris is excessive self-confidence and pride that (according to the ancients) will stir up the wrath of the gods. You will be punished for your hubris.</span></p><p>Maybe the ancient gods aren’t quite a threat anymore. And that excessive self-confidence looks good on your business plan and in your job interview. Hubris also get retweets and followers. </p><p><span>And that perhaps sums up a key difference between STEM subjects and the humanities. The STEM student is taught that hubris is a useful vocational skill—you get the grant, you get the job, you get a raise. Humanities students, forced to read all those </span><em>boring tragedies</em><span>, ought to know better.</span></p><p>(6)</p><p><span>The great tragedies (</span><em>Macbeth</em><span>, </span><em>Oedipus</em><span>, </span><em>King Lear</em><span>, etc.) aren’t much different from the leading news stories today—we simply haven’t been taught to see the connections. The most striking fact here is that the tragic protagonists of our own time would never view themselves as such, believing instead that they are heroes—straight out of a Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise mold. Their fans and followers believe this too. This might be the most pervasive and poorly understood psychological parameter of the digital age.</span></p><p>(7)</p><p><span>One of my great regrets is that I never signed up for the class </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Steiner" rel="">George Steiner</a><span> taught as guest lecturer at my college—his topic was “Greek Tragedy in the Modern World.” In the first few weeks of the course, he required his students to read </span><em>all</em><span> of the surviving ancient Greek tragedies—then they studied modern extensions or evocations of the same tales by Joyce, Sartre, and others. </span></p><p>If I had to teach a class like this, I’d add a different twist. The students would read 20-30 old tragedies, and then apply them to current-day celebrities, influencers, and power brokers of various stripes.</p><p>Homework might look like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png" width="1444" height="896" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:896,&#34;width&#34;:1444,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:108992,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecab5774-c2ad-4a4f-8cdd-5459bc12648b_1444x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>(8)</p><p>The leading digital age entertainments are almost immune to tragedy.
