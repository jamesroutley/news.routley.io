    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are the rules that I try to live by. I often fail, because I am only human, but I will keep trying.</p><p><strong>Bea Respectful</strong>: Treat everyone you interact with as you would like to be treated. Listen to others, validate their feelings, and consider their perspective.</p><p><strong>Bea Considerate</strong>: Be mindful of the feelings of others. Be aware of how your actions and words might impact them.</p><p><strong>Bea Helpful</strong>: Offer your assistance whenever you’re able. Small acts of service can make a big difference in someone’s day.</p><p><strong>Bea Patient</strong>: Understand that everyone has their own struggles and pace. Don’t rush people or pressure them.</p><p><strong>Bea Forgiving</strong>: Everyone makes mistakes. Try to forgive and forget, rather than holding onto anger or resentment.</p><p><strong>Bea Generous</strong>: Share what you can, whether it’s material things or intangible qualities like time, advice, or empathy.</p><p><strong>Bea Honest</strong>: Honesty builds trust and strengthens relationships. Be truthful, but remember to do so with kindness.</p><p><strong>Bea Positive</strong>: Strive to maintain a positive attitude, even when facing challenges. Positivity can be contagious and uplift others around you.</p></div></div>
