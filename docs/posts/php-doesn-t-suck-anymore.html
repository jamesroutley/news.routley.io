                <div>
                    <p>Good question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level developer now exceeds $100,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one available).</p>
<p>Aside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all times, so you&#39;re stuck paying for time you aren&#39;t able to utilize.</p>
<p>With the monthly plan, you can pause and resume your subscription as often as you need to ensure you&#39;re only paying your developer when you have work available for them.</p>

            <div id="accordion-collapse-body-1" aria-labelledby="accordion-collapse-heading-1">
                <p>No, once subscribed you&#39;re able to request as many things as you&#39;d like, and they will be delivered one by one.</p>

                    <p>Delivery will always be fast without compromising quality. Very complex requests will be divided into smaller products for continuous delivery.</p>
<p>Always, before starting to work, we can make a planning so that you know, before starting, when each change will be delivered.</p>

                    <p>We understand you may not have enough work to fill up entire month. Perhaps you only have one or two requests at the moment. That&#39;s where pausing your subscription comes in handy.</p>
<p>Billing cycles are based on 31 day period. Let&#39;s say you sign up and use the service for 21 days, and then decide to pause your subscription. This means that the billing cycle will be paused and you&#39;ll have 10 days of service remaining to be used anytime in the future</p>

                <p>That&#39;s fine. You can pause your subscription when finished and return when you have additional requests needs. There&#39;s no need to let the remainder of your subscription go to waste.</p>
