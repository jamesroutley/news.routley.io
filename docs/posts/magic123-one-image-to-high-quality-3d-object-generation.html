                    We present &#34;Magic123&#34;, a two-stage coarse-to-fine solution for high-quality, textured 3D meshes
                    generation from a single unposed image in the wild using both 2D and 3D priors. In the first stage,
                    we optimize a neural radiance field to produce a coarse geometry. In the second stage, we adopt a
                    memory-efficient differentiable mesh representation to yield a high-resolution mesh with a visually
                    appealing texture. In both stages, the 3D content is learned through reference view supervision and
                    novel views guided by both 2D and 3D diffusion priors. We introduce a single tradeoff parameter
                    between the 2D and 3D priors to control exploration (more imaginative) and exploitation (more
                    precise) of the generated geometry. Additionally, We employ textual inversion and monocular depth
                    regularization to encourage consistent appearances across views and to prevent degenerate solutions,
                    respectively.
                    Magic123 demonstrates a significant improvement over previous image-to-3D techniques, as validated
                    through extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse real-world images.
