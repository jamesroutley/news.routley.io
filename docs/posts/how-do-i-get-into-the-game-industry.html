<div><div><div b-yrzs0ob67i=""><p>Every now and then someone tells me that their child loves video games and wants to get into the game industry, then asks me how they do it. So here&#39;s a blog that I can paste a link to.</p><h2>I don&#39;t know</h2><div><p>I&#39;ve got to say first of all that I don&#39;t know if I ever got into the game industry. It&#39;s my main job but I don&#39;t know how a real game studio works. I&#39;ve never worked in a proper game studio.</p></div><h2>Not Programming</h2><div><p>I&#39;m going to focus on the idea that you want to be a programmer.Â </p></div><h2>The 1990s</h2><div><p>When I was trying to learn how to program games it was the 1990s. There wasn&#39;t any internet. I had to get books from the library and read magazines. I had no-one to ask questions to. It was hard.</p></div><h2>The Modern World</h2><div><p>Nowadays, it&#39;s a mixed blessing. I&#39;ve got to believe it&#39;s much much easier to learn anything. You have the internet, you have discord, you have youtube, and you have ChatGPT.</p></div><h2>Expectations</h2><div><p>A lot of people, when they start programming, will be printing Hello World in a command line and be frustrated. When do they start coding the car physics in GTA?Â </p></div><h2>Going Indie</h2><div><p>You hear about Notch making 2 billion from Minecraft and you think, yeah, that sounds better than the sausage roll factory. But how likely is it that you make Minecraft?</p></div><h2>New Opportunities</h2><div><p>You can make your own game engine, or use Unity to make your own game and release it on Steam, there are other emerging economies. These usually involve making a game in a bigger platform. The deal here is generally that they&#39;ll bring the players and you make the content. This is generally always a bigger win for the platform, since they get free content and free money, but if you can swallow your pride there, there&#39;s money in it.</p></div><h2>Getting Hired</h2><div><p>I can&#39;t speak from other companies, but I can tell you what I look at when we get an application.</p></div><h2>Recruiters</h2><div><p>I fucking hate recruiters.</p></div><h2>Your Plan</h2><div><p>So here&#39;s your career plan.</p></div></div></div>
