    <h1>Managing People</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Feb 6, 2022<!-- --> · <!-- -->11 min read<!-- --> · <!-- -->0<!-- --> views</p><p>I believe almost all first-time founders burn out their first employees as they learn how to manage groups of people. If this advice helps avoid a few cases, it&#39;s worth writing it down.</p>
<p>I wrote this article for managers of small teams/startups. I&#39;d assume that most might not apply to management in larger enterprises. Btw <a href="https://klinger.io/posts/joining-hypergrowth-startups-%F0%9F%98%AC">here</a> are my recommendations on joining hypergrowth companies in general.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I managed several small and midsized engineering teams <!-- -->
<ul>
<li>CTO at <a href="https://beondeck.com">On Deck</a></li>
<li>prev VPE at CoinList<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Head of Remote at AngelList </li>
<li>and CTO at Product Hunt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Let&#39;s get started.</h3>
<h4>As a manager, everything is your fault</h4>
<p>I know… very positive start 👀</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no point being angry at your team – ever</li>
<li>You are in charge of processes and people<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>And you got more information than they do, always</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You either created the processes where this outcome happened<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>or you hired (or did not fire) the wrong people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately everything is your fault</li>
</ul>
<h4>You manage processes; you lead people</h4>
<ul>
<li>For some reason, &#34;managing people&#34; means for many that they need to control people&#39;s work.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>They end up micro-managing not only what when but also how people do their work.</li>
<li>If you got the time to micro-manage people, you can most likely hire cheaper, less talented people for your work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think it roots in a misunderstanding of what the role of a manager is:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>your job is <em>not to manage people</em></li>
<li>but to <em>manage processes</em> and <em>lead people</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You manage processes on how you expect work to be done, where each person&#39;s authority starts and ends, how their careers are made, and how all this can be discussed, and/or changed</li>
<li>Additionally, you are leading people by example and through empathy.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>They have goals, fears and motivations. Frequently also problems outside of work.</li>
<li>Act how you would want them to act if the role would be reversed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Processes are expectations made explicit</h4>
<ul>
<li>A lot of people make huge disclaimers around &#34;processes.&#34;<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>&#34;We don&#39;t want too many processes&#34; etc<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>again, imho a misunderstanding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Processes are not complex chains of people doing things that are burdened by horrible overheads<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><em>Processes are expectations made explicit</em>
<ul>
<li>They can be as simple as &#34;every morning we all do X to ensure everyone else is unblocked.&#34;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have few but very explicit processes and expect them to be followed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Decisions vs Opinions</h4>
<ul>
<li>In every discussion/project/problem/situation, it needs to be clear who makes decisions<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>…everyone else only adds opinions.</li>
<li>Ideally, the person who will afterward do (or lead) the follow-up work makes the decisions.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Everyone else just adds opinions.</li>
<li>This includes people of higher &#34;rank&#34; or pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Their manager have a <em>handbrake</em> they can use to hard-stop decisions.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Treat this as a literal handbrake.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Imagine a car driving, and you need to pull the handbrake because the car needs to stop, but the driver doesn&#39;t react. Damage will follow.</li>
<li>Pull the handbrake if absolutely needed and then discuss how to fix the situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire based on good decision-making skills<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Fire based on poor decision-making skills<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Good decision-making skills include listening to other people&#39;s opinions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In case of doubt, see if you can trust the decision-maker by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ownership</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s hard to get people to own a problem space fully<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>But this is the goal<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If they are the wrong person, you can still fire them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feedback them, help them<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Trust them and let them make mistakes (within damage barriers)</li>
<li>Consider mistakes them leveling up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The worst thing that can happen is that you frequently step in, and people disassociate from their work<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>They become drones who do what&#39;s told instead of taking ownership.</li>
<li>If this is your goal, you can hire cheaper, less talented people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Avoid back and forth</h4>
<ul>
<li>When defining processes, avoid back and forth<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Eg. if you give feedback on something assume that they will either do it or get back to you with reasons why not</li>
<li>Don&#39;t expect them to get your approval<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><em>Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trust</h4>
<ul>
<li>Always reflect if your nervousness is due to other people&#39;s work or your insecurity<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Should other people have to handle your emotions for you?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, it&#39;s easy to trust when things go well<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The real challenge is when things go wrong</li>
<li>Always differ between your frustration about a situation and your frustration about a peson</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am not saying &#34;stay out of it&#34;<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Stay in the loop, set expectations, voice opinions, but let them handle it. Use your handbrake if needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trust through transparency</h4>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to have people trust your work is by transparently sharing it without request.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Have everything accessible where people would look for it</li>
<li>Don&#39;t make them ask for it, because most won&#39;t</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trust is not binary</h4>
<ul>
<li>We tend to think of trust as binary<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I either trust someone, or i don&#39;t</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But this isn&#39;t true<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>You trust different people with different things differently over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Think of trust as something that you systemize<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Eg what kind of trust do you give a new team member?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>What are they expected to do in the first weeks? first month?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Don&#39;t confuse autonomy and abandonment</h4>
<ul>
<li>I frequently meet founders who hire people &#34;and get out of their way&#34;</li>
<li>While this is principle correct it doesn&#39;t absolve you from enabling them to succeed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Decision Layering</h4>
<ul>
<li>Different people in the company on various levels rely on each other on doing their work.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A product manager can&#39;t do their job if the CEO doesn&#39;t know what their current priorities are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#39;t load your work onto others in the company. <!-- -->
<ul>
<li>And also avoid stepping into their work just because looks more fun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Avoid drive-by management</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t start throwing your opinion or ideas around in meetings<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>You most likely lack context, and most likely, you won&#39;t be the person needing to follow through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make it clear that it&#39;s just opinions and not decisions.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>But know the power that the &#34;opinion of the founder (or manager)&#34; has towards most employees</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://klinger.io/posts/fyi-how-founders-can-avoid-drive-by-management">fyi tags</a> in async communication that usually lacks the &#34;nuance&#34; of voice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Btw, I call it drive-by management because the manager comes by a group of people having a discussion. They throw requests, change mandates, and ideas around like bullets, create confusion, panic, chaos, and when they leave, they leave a bloody mess behind.</p>
<h4>Feedbacking people</h4>
<ul>
<li>people x context = output</li>
<li>I had great people in bad setups that had lousy output<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I had very ordinary people in great setups that churned out more work than a whole team</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you feedback work, it&#39;s usually easier to discuss the context objectively than the person themselves<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>What is the situation that led to current problems?</li>
<li>What changed? What is currently required? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A junior engineer not keeping up with the work?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Is it their fault? Or is your team right now not able to support a junior learning the game?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This is ok, but should be either fixed or acknowledged (by discontinuing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A huge production incident happened?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>How was this possible in the first place?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Where was the focus of the engineering team?</li>
<li>Was there a process in place to avoid it?</li>
<li>Should there be one?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The person breaking production isn&#39;t at fault here.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A whole team focused on other priorities</li>
<li>Was this for the right reasons? (eg release pressure?)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Or the wrong ones? (lacking sophistication?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always assume people you hired are motivated, and have the best intentions in mind<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>And fire the ones that don&#39;t</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Firing should never be a surprise</h4>
<ul>
<li>People should never be surprised that they are fired<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Context changed, new requirements should have been communicated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you discontinue someone, you do it usually because of context<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The company changed</li>
<li>The expectations of the role changed</li>
<li>You realized you looked for the wrong hiring criteria</li>
<li>It&#39;s most likely more your fault than theirs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They might have hoped that their new efforts were enough<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>But they will still understand when you fire them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Never delay firing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once you decide to fire someone, do it.</li>
<li>Frequently people keep employees around in a zombie-like state<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>&#34;We should discontinue them.&#34;</li>
<li>But you don&#39;t<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s not for them</li>
<li>They are most likely unhappy in their setup<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Not appreciated</li>
<li>Not able to do good work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are most likely doing it for yourself<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Because you are not feeling good about firing someone</li>
<li>They deserve better than you caring more about your feelings and future than theirs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up a call and discontinue them<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Avoid any chitchat in the beginning</li>
<li>Start directly with the topic and have explicit clarity on the next steps<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Make sure to communicate it as fact and truth</li>
<li>Remember that in this moment it&#39;s not about your feelings or problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then help them finding new roles</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explicit &gt; Implicit</h4>
<ul>
<li>Clear decisions after meetings<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>No clear decision? Make that explicit too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clear owners<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>No clear owner? Make that explicit too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hear everyone&#39;s opinions <!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Make explicit who makes the decision</li>
<li>And what the decision is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<h4>Best practices: Start by making true what&#39;s real</h4>
<ul>
<li>When looking for best practices or changes in the team/processes, always look at first what already naturally emerged<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If you hire good people they usually start looking for solutions naturally</li>
<li>Is this good? If yes make it explicit<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>&#34;Make true what is real&#34;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If not discuss changing it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Expect to refactor your company every few months</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fast-growing startups have to refactor how they operate internally every 3-6 months<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>So just go with the minimum changes you currently need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There will never be a final endstate<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>You will always be unhappy with processes in your company</li>
<li>You will have growing pains until you stagnate </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the same principles you&#39;d use in refactoring code<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Consider to <!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Test in small isolation first</li>
<li>Peer review</li>
<li>Not to change everything at once</li>
<li>Avoid over-engineering</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Burnout</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s a common misconception that burnouts come from hard work. </li>
<li>Burnout comes from a felt loss of control and/or impact.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Remember that you can burn out employees (or yourself) with little to no work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can you give people control over their impact?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>How can you define boundaries around chaos around them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Chaos is felt less by the people creating it</h4>
<ul>
<li>A common frustration of founders is that their team can&#39;t keep up with pivots.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>As a founder, you most likely got more context on changes, you know earlier of them, and most importantly, you have control over them.</li>
<li>Employees don&#39;t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Expect more from managers that report from you</h4>
<ul>
<li>By default, mistakes are not their team&#39;s fault but theirs<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Share your honest opinions on things with them privately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, always give them the trust needed to make decisions</li>
<li>They are accountable for the outcomes<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Responsible for all failures</li>
<li>But not responsible for the success<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Success is the team&#39;s achievement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They should also, whenever possible, give spotlights to their team instead of taking it for themselves<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The deal is simple: They get more authority, the team more ways to shine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What a cheerful ending 😬</p>
