</span><i>Content warning: risk to children</i></p><p>

Julia and I <a href="https://juliawise.net/what-are-the-results-of-more-parental-supervision-and-less-outdoor-play/">know</a>
drowning is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/data-research/facts/index.html">biggest
risk to US kids 1-4</a>, and we try to take this seriously.
But yesterday our 4yo came very close to drowning in a
fountain. (She&#39;s fine now.)

</p>
<p>

This week we were on vacation with my extended family: nine kids,
eight parents, and ten grandparents/uncles/aunts.  For the last few
years we&#39;ve been in a series of rental houses, and this time on
arrival we found a fountain in the backyard:

<p>

I immediately checked the depth with a stick and found that it would
be just below the elbows on our 4yo.  I think it was likely 24&#34; deep;
any deeper and PA <a href="https://poolguardusa.com/pennsylvania-pool-fence-code/">would
require a fence</a>.  I talked with Julia and other parents, and
reasoned that since it was within standing depth it was safe.

</p>
<p>

We discussed boundaries with the kids (no going through the gate or
out the driveway, stay within the fence, stay out of the pond) and
then let them play on their own.  They were in and out of the house
all week and, while with this many people around they were rarely
alone, we also weren&#39;t ensuring they were accompanied.

</p>
<p>

Yesterday evening my aunt noticed our 4yo was walking on the fountain
rim, and called me over to say this looked dangerous.  Checking, I
initially didn&#39;t see her at all.  Then, in an image burned into my
mind, I saw the top of her head moving in the water.  I sprinted over,
jumped in, and despite the shallow depth immediately fell full in:
very slippery on the bottom.  Still, I got her out quickly, and to my
relief she was breathing, normal-colored, and immediately started
crying.

</p>
<p>

With the timing of my aunt&#39;s warning and how long it took me to get
there, I think she was likely in for about fifteen seconds.  It seems
she held her breath and didn&#39;t take in any water.

</p>
<p>

After she recovered she told me she was trying to push her legs down
and stand up, but they wouldn&#39;t go down.  I don&#39;t know if the problem
was that she was wearing a very poofy dress (pictured below), or
that she doesn&#39;t have enough practice maneuvering in water to
manipulate the natural buoyancy of her body, but either way she was
stuck in an L-position with her legs sticking straight out in front.

</p>
<p>

In addition to being physically fine she also seems not to have been
affected emotionally.  We were near more water today, wading in a
stream, and she didn&#39;t seem fearful:

<p>

I&#39;m feeling very lucky that my aunt happened to see her in a risky
location and that I was able to get there in time, and I&#39;m kicking
myself for conflating &#34;shallow enough to stand&#34; with &#34;shallow enough
that a surprised and disoriented kid coming in at an awkward angle
will reliably be able to stand.&#34;
