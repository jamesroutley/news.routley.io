    <h4>Einstein Foundation to present the inaugural €500,000 Award for Promoting Quality in Research</h4> 
    
    <ul></ul>
    <p><em>
    The Einstein Foundation Berlin is honoring the American physicist Paul Ginsparg and the Center for Open Science with the inaugural Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research. Paul Ginsparg is the founder of the preprint server arXiv.org, the first platform to exchange scientific discoveries among scientists immediately, openly and globally without review- and paywall restrictions.
    </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    In developing arXiv.org, Ginsparg has laid the foundations for a revolution in scientific publishing as preprint servers are now commonly used in many scientific fields. They have been instrumental in supporting the rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Center for Open Science has permanently transformed global research culture in recent years by providing scholars with the necessary tools and digital infrastructure to make open science the default. In the Early Career category, the award is presented to Jessica Kosie and Martin Zettersten to carry out their project ManyBabies5, a cross-cultural study on influential models in infant attention research.</p>
