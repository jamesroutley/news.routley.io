    <h1>Replit permanently moves to paid hosting after 7 years of free service</h1>

<hr/>
<p id="desc"> Over the past few months, Replit.com has changed their pricing drastically to the point where it is
simply not
viable.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<section id="whatHappened">
<div>
<h3>Nerfing Hacker Plan</h3>
<p>
The cutback of &#34;Always On&#34; instances from five to one hit Hacker Plan users hard. This shift took many projects
offline, with users unable to pay the extra $292.20/year for 4 more always on repls.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, reducing the number of Boosts included in the Hacker Plan from five to one, and reducing base repl
specs to the same level as the free plan, unless you were actively inside the Replit workspace, left users
wondering how Replit Hacker plan could anymore be a justified expense.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Outrageous AI</h3>
<p>
Replit&#39;s enduring focus on AI and LLMs have put them in a state of throwing money at a losing battle.
Ghostwriter is $10/month, yet it uses the same technology one can get for extraordinarily less from OpenAI.
</p>
<p>
Trending Repls have been heavily focused on AI, as well as the company&#39;s social media accounts &amp; most heavily,
their CEO.
</p>
<p>
However, it must be said, integrating AI has always been one of the main goals of Replit, right from day 1. It
just feels overemphasised currently. AI is undoubtedly a very interesting space in computer science right now,
however it&#39;s not the only one. A balance should be made such that AI exists within the product and community,
but is not such an overwhelming majority of the focus as it is now.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>10x Hike in Power-ups</h3>
<p>
Replit&#39;s price hike for power-ups like Boosts and the Always On feature greatly affected its large student and
budding coder user base. The increased costs, from 2 to 70 cycles/day, for a Boost, and 2 to 20 cycles/day, for
the Always On feature, made these features less accessible, impacting the budget community.
</p>
<p>
Replit has previously been very focused on their platform being used for new coders, with their motto
&#34;Bringing the next billion software creators online&#34;. However, this target audience has changed recently, with
low budget beginner, student, and hobby developers being pushed away by the increased pricing.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Reserved VM Pricing &amp; customisability</h3>
<p>
The first offender of their Deployments is Reserved VMs. For the lowest tier, <b>you get a CPU with 2.199GHz clock speed, 1GiB of RAM,
and 10GiB of outbound data transfer.</b></p>
<p>On platforms such as DigitalOcean and AWS, they can be way
cheaper.</p>
<p>Replit deployments also don&#39;t have live SSH, reserved IPs, choice of OS, UDP, firewall rules, and has an overall lack of customisation.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Uncompetitive Static</h3>
<p>Replit&#39;s static deployments is just that - static site hosting. Just one small issue, and pay attention - all
of these sites below are free.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Egress Limits</h3>
<p>
On April 7, 2023, Replit set egress limits across all plans. Aimed at controlling outbound data transfer, this
move faced backlash, especially from the Free tier users.
</p>
<p>
With limits set at 10 GiB for Free, 50 GiB for Hacker, and 100 GiB for Pro tiers, many found them restrictive.
Particularly those on the free plan, hosting popular projects.
</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Replit.dev</h3>
<p>
The final blow came when Replit announced that your repls could only stay online when you are actively within
the workspace, now Replit Deployments stand as Replit&#39;s only hosting option.
</p>
<p>
This decision seemed to counter Replit&#39;s user-friendly ethos, sparking widespread confusion and shock within the
community. Especially as they promised to <a href="https://blog.replit.com/glitch#~text=But%20we%20will%20never%20ban%20pinging%20to%20force%20people%20to%20upgrade%20by%20taking%20away%20features.:~:text=But%20we%20will%20never%20ban%20pinging%20to%20force%20people%20to%20upgrade%20by%20taking%20away%20features.">
never force users to move away from pingers to a paid product</a>, which is exactly was just been done. Users
can no longer ping their hosted repl&#39;s repl.co url, and instead must move to the paid deployments product to
continue hosting on Replit.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Misleading Bounties</h3>
<p>
Replit proudly shows over $40,000 open in bounties, but when analysing further over 175 &#34;open&#34; bounties are over 4 months old, leaving an estimated $15k in bounties that aren&#39;t stale. 64.5% of open bounties are over 4 months old, last updated 11 Oct.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Terrible community management</h3>
<p>
The 16k+ member Replit Discord community fell to bits after the moderation team wasn&#39;t paid any more than their
Hacker plan, all nerfed and shiny at $7/month. Understandably, moderators striked, causing Replit to abandon
control of the community server altogether.
</p>
<p>
The Replit Reps program was abandoned too, with it disbanding after only 1 and a half cohort cycles.
</p><p>
Jams were reduced from events like <b>Kajam</b> and <b>#madewithreplit</b> to AI hackathons that a 14 year old
won with school &amp; no prior experience. Prize pools have dropped from over $10k to around $2k per event, lowering
the incentive.
