					<p>A GitHub repository was public-viewable</p><p>We’ve recently become aware of an inadvertent private-to-public viewable GitHub repository that could have enabled unauthorized access to information about certain user accounts on or before 2019.</p><p>The inadvertent disclosure involved an auditing data set used for employee training becoming public, on a GitHub repository associated with an inactive former employee’s account who was learning data analysis. The repository contained some names, email addresses, shipping/billing addresses and/or whether orders were placed successfully via credit card processor and/or PayPal, as well as details for some orders. There were no user passwords or financial information such as credit cards in the data analysis set.</p><p>Within 15 minutes of being notified about the inadvertent disclosure, Adafruit worked with the former employee, deleted the relevant GitHub repository and the Adafruit team began the forensic process to determine what and if there was any access and what type of data was involved. Although we are unaware of any actual misuse of the information, we are providing this notice to you for transparency and accountability. We are additionally putting in place more protocols and access controls to avoid any possible future data exposure and limiting access for employee training use.</p><p>As a reminder, for your security, we will never send you a link to reset your password as part of a security alert, our customer support team will never contact you asking for your password. If you receive an email of this nature, or otherwise suspect that someone is attempting to gain access to your account or solicit your personal information, or have any other questions about this process, please contact us at security@adafruit.com </p><p>We would also like to thank all individuals who have and continue to contribute to the security of our users by disclosing vulnerabilities to us responsibly <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/reportingsecurityissues">https://www.adafruit.com/reportingsecurityissues</a>   </p><p>Why aren’t we sending an email to every user?</p><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/reportingsecurityissues">https://www.adafruit.com/reportingsecurityissues</a></p><p>Previous disclosure post(s):</p><p>Phillip Torrone, Managing Director &amp; Limor “Ladyada” Fried, founder and the Adafruit team – Adafruit, 150 Varick Street, NY, NY 10013</p>
