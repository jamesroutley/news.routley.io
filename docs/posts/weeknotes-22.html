<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qzOOg4pxw8">giving up on love</a>, or rather, giving up on tying weeknotes to week numbers. their tyranny has gone on too long, and I am terrible at releasing these in a fully timely manner.</li>
<li>walked a friend through <a href="https://capacities.io">capacities</a> and really struck by how many apps are kind of swiss army knives of complexity. they also mostly seem to have few ways to engage with them without getting into complex ground. i think i&#39;m more used to capacities it works rather than necessarily finding it wildly easy to use... though also notion is harder to use for me even than capacities lol.</li>
<li>in the chat with the same friend i brought up my old criticism of <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/overview/">zettelkasten</a>, that the guy who came up with it wasn&#39;t a particularly good writer (though he was prolific!). my friend said it helped them think more expansively in general and i want to get to a point with non-planning notes where it feels like it&#39;s helping me think, rather than having to drag the thoughts out of the ether kicking and screaming to note them down. welcoming any suggestions that don&#39;t tell me to set up a zettelkasten ðŸ˜Œ</li>
<li>I&#39;ve given up on time tracking, i no longer care to objectively know how long i spend on activities. i&#39;m just going to tweak things based on vibes, my planning notes and feelings like god intended.</li>
<li>working on <a href="https://2024.ffconf.org/">my talk</a>. nervous and excited!</li>
<li>looking forward to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen">lebkuchen</a> season being in full swing, and halloween! ðŸŽƒ</li>
