This depth or exploration can be seeing additional content and/or project-based learning that explores these other areas.</p><p>Okay, but what areas of math can we look into for this “other math”?</p><p>For now, I’m only going to list the topics as I’ll later include many examples of problems, websites, books, classes for each one as this is just an introductory post to enrichment.</p><p>Potential topics for your math kid:</p><ul><li><p>Number Theory</p></li><li><p>Logic in Philosophy</p></li><li><p>Mathematical Logic</p></li><li><p>Combinatorics</p></li><li><p>Statistics</p></li><li><p>Probability</p></li><li><p>Graph Theory</p></li><li><p>Game Theory</p></li><li><p>Boolean Algebra</p></li><li><p>Information Theory</p></li><li><p>Naive Set Theory</p></li><li><p>Relational Algebra</p></li><li><p>Algorithms</p></li><li><p>Modular Arithmetic</p></li><li><p>Mathematical Finance</p></li><li><p>Discrete Mathematics (note that many of the above are parts of “Discrete Mathematics” classes)</p></li></ul><p>There are probably a few that I missed (and if you think of you, please let me know in the comments so that other people can look into it :) ).</p><p><span>An example of a resource on a specific topic from the list above: </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Information-Small-Bits-Theory-Kids/dp/1979902976" rel="">“Information In Small Bits: Information Theory for Kids”</a><span>, a book by Christina Fragouli, Anna Scaglione, and Dawn Faelnar.</span></p><p>The key here is to look for problems that a kid can do without having to understand too much mathematical machinery.</p><p>If you know some of the math topics above, then you’re set.</p><p>However, there are many of us who haven’t seen the topics above or feel inadequate about trying to guide a student through them.</p><p>There’s a few ways to help the student:</p><ol><li><p>You learn it ahead of them. This is fun and it can show the child that you too are learning math.</p></li><li><p>You find a tutor. This can help the student with having an older child or adult show interest in math and someone outside of the family who loves math.</p></li><li><p>You find a math circle where they focus on these types of topics. For now whether the math circle focuses on competitions or non-competition math, it doesn’t matter as you’re just getting started in the “enrichment” area of math.</p></li><li><p>Find “edu-tainment” videos in the related areas that can work on sparking interest in your child.</p></li></ol><p>The next small step for you to explore with your child is looking through the list above and seeing if there are any topics on Wikipedia </p><p>You just might find a new topic for your math kid to explore!</p><p>Try it soon and let me know how it goes!</p><p><span>Until next time,</span></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
