        <h3>Integration</h3>
        <p>
            Nobody writes in a vacuum: We are all embedded in various workflows.
            Our colleagues and employers use many different tools and they have differing approaches to how they want to collaborate with you.
            Do you work at a university where all your colleagues use Word?
            Do you use LanguageTool for grammar checking?
            Zettlr makes it easy to integrate into whatever work environment you are in.

        <h3>Submit to Journals and Conferences with One Click</h3>
        <p>
            If you work in <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</abbr>, most conferences require you to submit PDFs using a template.
            If you work in the social sciences or humanities, many journals have templates, too.
            Whatever your situation is: With its powerful profile system, powered by Pandoc, you can export any paper with a template in just one click.
            Simply create a new profile, add your template, and click export.
        </p>
        <p>
            And if you need a quick presentation for the conference, Zettlr got you covered, too.
            Be it Beamer, reveal.js, or Powerpoint: With a few settings, you can create profiles for many types of presentations.

        <h3>Automate the Boring Stuff</h3>
        <p>
          Not all aspects of writing are inspiring: Sometimes, we just have to use a standardized format for our notes, or we need some boilerplate code.
          Zettlr includes a powerful snippets system that allows you to define blueprints for files that you can quickly insert anywhere.
          It includes variable support, tabstopps, and many more features.
