</div><p>Inside an old oak barrel, Ecuadoran bioengineer Javier Carvajal found the fungus of fortune: a 400-year-old yeast specimen that he has since managed to resurrect and use to reproduce what is believed to be Latin America&#39;s oldest beer.

                                                                                    <p>That single-cell microorganism, taken from just a splinter of wood, was the key to recovering the formula for an elixir first brewed in Quito in 1566 by friar Jodoco Ricke, a Franciscan of Flemish origin who historians believe introduced wheat and barley to what is now the Ecuadoran capital.</p>
<p>&#34;Not only have we recovered a biological treasure but also the 400-year-old work of silent domestication of a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/yeast/" rel="tag">yeast</a> that probably came from a chicha and that had been collected from the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/local+environment/" rel="tag">local environment</a>,&#34; Carvajal told AFP.</p>
<p>Chicha is a fermented corn drink brewed by the Indigenous people of the Americas before Spanish colonization.</p>
<p>Carvajal, who already had experience recovering other yeasts, found out about the ancient Franciscan brewery in Quito while reading specialist beer magazines.</p>
<p>It took him a year to do so, but he finally managed to find a barrel from the old brewery in 2008.</p>
<p>It was stored in Quito&#39;s San Francisco Convent, an imposing three-hectare complex built between 1537 and 1680, which is now a museum.</p>
<p>After extracting a splinter, Carvajal used a microscope to find a tiny yeast specimen, which after a long period of cultivation he was able to resurrect.</p>
<p>In his laboratory at the Catholic University of Ecuador, Carvajal takes a small vial containing a variety of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaerescatada yeast.</p>
<p>&#34;It lives here in a little container. It&#39;s very humble, but it is the star&#34; of the laboratory, said the 59-year-old. </p>
<p><b>Filling the holes</b></p>
<p>Carvajal, who comes from a brewing family, found an article in an industry magazine that vaguely described the formula for the Franciscans&#39; 16th century drink.</p>
<p>Little by little, he pieced together bits of information to revive the brew with cinnamon, fig, clove and sugarcane flavors.</p>
<p>&#34;There were a massive number of holes in the recipe and my job was to fill those holes,&#34; said Carvajal.</p>
<p>&#34;It is a work of beer archeology within the microbial archeology&#34; he had to carry out to rescue the yeast, which generates the majority of the drink&#39;s flavor.</p>
<p>After a decade of investigation and testing, Carvajal in 2018 began producing the beer at his home—but the pandemic frustrated his attempts to commercialize it.</p>
<p>He still has not come up with a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/launch+date/" rel="tag">launch date</a> for his product, nor a price.</p>
<p>Carvajal compares his work, centuries after the Franciscans domesticated the yeast, to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/intensive+care/" rel="tag">intensive care</a> on a molecular scale.</p>
<p>&#34;It is as if they were dormant, like dried seeds but having deteriorated over the years. So you have to reconstruct them, fluidize them, hydrate them and see if their vital signs return.&#34;</p>
<p>Historian Javier Gomezjurado, who wrote a book on Quito beverages, told AFP that the brewery in the San Francisco Convent was the first brewery in hispanic America.</p>
<p>It began operations in 1566, but there were just eight friars in the convent at that time and production was minimal, said Gomezjurado.</p>
<p>With the introduction of machinery into the brewing industry, ancient formulas began to disappear. The brewery closed in 1970.</p>
<p>For Carvajal, resurrecting the yeast and the age-old methods used to make the ancient recipe was simply a labor of love for &#34;the value of the intangible.&#34;
