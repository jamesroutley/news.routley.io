    <h1>Free Book: Linux IP Stacks Commentary</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><img src="https://www.satchell.net/ipstacks/NewCover.png" width="601" height="451" alt=""/></p><p>In 2000, the authors wrote the book <i>Linux IP Stacks
    Commentary</i>, published in soft cover by CoriolisOpen Press,
    in which we annotated the Linux kernel source code for TCP/IP
    as it appeared in release 2.0.36. The publisher is gone, alas,
    but the subject matter cries out to be updated to the most
    modern Linux kernel release.</p>
    <p>This Web book is that update.</p>
    <h3>Written for:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Experienced Linux enthusiasts who want a peek inside the
      kernel</li>
      <li>Students of TCP/IP who need working examples that they
      can examine</li>
      <li>Practitioners who need (or want) a complete list of the
      RFCs that apply to each protocol</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What you will find in this Web book:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An overview of the IPv4, ICMP, UDP, and TCP protocols,
      and more</li>
      <li>Code fragments of the protocols, and comments describing
      the details</li>
      <li>Links to the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
      Requests for Comments (RFCs) for each protocol</li>
      <li>An introduction to packet routing theory</li>
      <li>A brief overview of the firewall capabilities of the
      Linux kernel</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a href="https://www.satchell.net/ipstacks/about.html">About this web publication</a></h3>
    <p>This is a living publication, not a textbook whose
    publication on paper is frozen in time. It is an online handbook that provides
    detailed descriptions of the Linux TCP/IP stack code, using
    code taken directly from the Git repository of the Linux kernel
    â€” source code in the raw, not interpreted or simplified. It
    builds on the ultimate documentation (namely, the kernel source
    code itself), and is designed to be updated as the Linux kernel
    is updated.</p>
    <h3>Article Sections: <a href="https://www.satchell.net/ipstacks/toc.html">Table of
    Contents</a></h3>
    <p>Each article section (which is equivalent to a chapter in a
    book written on paper) opens with a list of all the IETF
    Requests For Comments (RFCs) that apply to the subject of each
    section. The RFCs are the Standards upon which the Internet
    was, is, and will be, built. The article sections are not
    intended to be a be-all and end-all description of the topic,
    but to provide enough background so that the code and
    the associated explanations can be understood.</p>
    <h3>Commentary Sections: <a href="https://www.satchell.net/ipstacks/toc-commentary.html">Table of
    Contents</a></h3>
    <p>Each commentary section contains a series of code/discussion pairs, excepts of
    the source code from the kernel followed by the detailed
    discussion about that excerpt. There are no cross-references to
    other pages, or other documents, that must be read for an
    understanding of the explanations. Although these 
    sections are loaded as static Web pages, the contents of each page are
    actively constructed by marrying
    code excerpts taken from the Git repository and the associated explanatory text.
    The commentary Web pages are rebuilt whenever the text is updated or
    whenever a new kernel is released.</p>
    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p>Unlike the original printed edition, the Web
    edition is an online book that updates the text to incorporate
    the most recent version of the Linux kernel. The book will be
    updated from time to time as new kernels are released, to
    reflect the changes in the new release. Substantive errors can be corrected
    quickly; remedying omissions will take a little longer. Simple
    mistakes can be fixed right away, with no need to wait for a
    new press run.</p>
    <p>The original edition was a huge undertaking, and the
    Web edition is an even larger effort, because the
    Linux networking code has expanded to include the latest
    additions and improvements that have been developed by the
    IETF. Instead of waiting until all the work is complete (and
    already outdated, frankly), this book will be released in
    increments, as each section is finished.</p>
