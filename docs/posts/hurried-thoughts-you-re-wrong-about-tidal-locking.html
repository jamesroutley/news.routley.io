<p><span>I&#39;ve already talked about tidal-locked planets at length

    it&#39;d be nice to have a single <i>relatively</i> short place to address the
    most common myths about tidal-locked planets, and particularly their
    climate, for easy reference.</span>
</p>

<p><span>The very short version is that the popular perception of tidal-locked
    planets</span><span>—</span><span>hostile worlds split between a burning desert on the lit hemisphere, ice on
    the dark side, and, at best, a thin &#34;twilight strip&#34; of habitable
    temperatures in between, wracked by gale-force winds</span><span>—</span><span>is not a strictly impossible scenario in all its particulars, but our
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac135c/meta">current best climate models</a></span><span><span><sup>1</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    predict (and
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103597957936">have</a></span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    for quite some time now) that tidal-locked planets in the habitable zone
    with Earth-like atmospheres and quantities of surface water can more
    typically expect
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa9f1f/meta">far more hospitable conditions</a></span><span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span></span><span>, with comfortable temperatures and moderate prevailing winds across the
    lit hemisphere; that the hottest part of the planet
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08463.pdf">will usually actually be the wettest</a></span><span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span></span><span>; and that this habitable climate state may actually be
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0515">more stable</a></span><span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span> in some ways than
    that of a planet more like our own.</span>
</p>

<p><span>For a more detailed explanation, let&#39;s back up a bit and set the scene.
    <b>Tidal-locking</b> describes a phenomenon whereby the tidal influence of a
    star on a planet (or between a planet and moon) causes the planet&#39;s rotation
    to slow until one side of the planet faces permanently towards the star, and
    the opposite side faces away. Because the planet still orbits in a loop
    around the star, this requires that it also rotates around once on its axis
    to keep that star-side face pointed to the star, so this is also sometimes
    called a <b>1:1 spin-orbit resonance</b>; for every 1 orbit, the planet
    spins around exactly once. The tidal influence of the star helps ensure this
    exact timing, hence the &#34;locking&#34; aspect. There are other spin-orbit
    resonances that tidal forces might lock a planet into, like the
    <b>3:2 spin-orbit resonance</b> of Mercury (the planet spins 3 times for
    every 2 orbits), but whether these planets should also be called
    &#34;tidal-locked&#34; varies between sources; in colloquial usage, &#34;tidal-locking&#34;
    is used almost exclusively to refer to the 1:1 resonance.</span>
</p>


<p><span>The strength of tidal forces is strongly dependent on the distance between
    the planet and star. Smaller <b>red dwarf stars</b> that are substantially
    dimmer than our sun have habitable zones that are correspondingly much
    closer to the star, so any habitable-zone planets of these stars are much
    more likely to be tidal-locked. These are by far the most common type of
    star in the universe, accounting for over 3/4 of the total number, so the
    habitability of tidal-locked planets is a major factor in the prevalence in
    habitability in the cosmos generally.<br/></span>
</p>

<p><span>Unsurprisingly, keeping one side of the planet pointed at the star has a
    profound effect on how light from the star</span><span>—and thus heat</span><span>—is spread over the planet&#39;s surface. On Earth, a flat surface directly
    facing the sun (with no obstructions and ignoring filtering by the
    atmosphere) receives about 1360 Watts per square meter (W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>) of light. But Earth&#39;s rotation and axial tilt spread out this light, such
    that the average light any single part of the surface receives across the
    whole year (averaging together summer, winter, day, and night) varies
    between a bit over 400 </span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    near the equator and under 180 </span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    at the poles (subtracting out the light reflected away by the surface and
    atmosphere leaves about 2/3 of that light on average being actually absorbed
    as heat).</span>
</p>

<p><span>On a tidal-locked world in the same orbit, the <b>substellar point</b> in
    the middle of the daylight side, which faces most directly towards the star,
    would get that full 1360 </span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    of light continuously.</span><span>
    The heating would decline towards the edge of the dayside, falling to
    0 </span><span>W/</span><span>m</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    at the <b>terminator</b>, the line dividing the day and night hemispheres;
    over 2/3 of the dayside hemisphere&#39;s area would receive more light than the
    average for Earth&#39;s equator. The entire nightside receives no light from the
    star at all, save perhaps some meager twilight at the edges refracting
    through the atmosphere.</span>

<p><span>It&#39;s understandable, then, that when the prospect of tidal-locked planets
    was
    <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/commercial_books/2007/RAND_CB179-1.pdf">first being considered</a></span><span><span><sup>6</sup></span></span><span></span><span>, such extreme contrasts in lighting and heating were expected to be
    accompanied by an extreme climate, split between a scorching hot dayside and
    bitter cold nightside. </span><span>Perhaps somewhere in between, near the terminator, there should be at least
    a thin strip of more hospitable temperatures, but that didn&#39;t guarantee
    habitability either. </span><span>

    was that any water on the planet&#39;s surface and perhaps even </span><span>C</span><span>O</span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span>
    would become trapped as ice on the nightside, leaving the dayside bone dry
    and even hotter for lack of the moderating influence of water. In the worst
    scenario, sequestration of ices on the nightside and heat-driven escape of
    atmospheric gasses to space on the dayside might remove such a planet&#39;s
    atmosphere entirely.</span>

<p><span>This picture of tidal-locked planets as marginally habitable at best but
    more likely prone to complete collapse into dry, sterile, perhaps even
    airless worlds prevailed
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00644211">well into the 1990s</a></span><span><span><sup>9</sup></span></span><span></span><span>, but as computing technology improved and we finally gained some
    capability to simulate the climates of such worlds in detail, which painted
    a
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103597957936">far different picture</a></span><span><span><sup>2</sup></span></span><span></span><span>.</span>
</p>

<p><span>As it turns out, even an atmosphere substantially thinner than Earth&#39;s
    could distribute enough heat to the nightside to prevent atmospheric
    freeze-out, and a more Earth-like atmosphere could keep temperatures
    globally within
    <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3894/JAMES.2010.2.13">about the same range</a></span><span><span><sup>10</sup></span></span><span>
    we experience on Earth. Water, too, can
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/796/2/L22/meta">easily avoid</a></span><span><span><sup>11</sup></span></span><span>
    becoming completely trapped on the nightside, and global oceans could then
    help distribute heat
    <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1315215111">even more evenly</a></span><span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span>
    across the surface.</span>
</p>

<p><span>In fact, in some circumstances, tidal-locking might even make a habitable
    climate more stable. Near the inner edge of the habitable zone, where the
    sun&#39;s light is more intense, the slow rotation and global convection may
    allow for warm planets to develop a permanent cloud formation that reflects
    away much of the star&#39;s light, keeping temperatures moderate
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0515">even in orbits</a></span><span><span><sup>5</sup></span></span><span> where a planet
    with Earth-like rotation would boil from runaway greenhouse warming. At the
    habitable zone&#39;s outer edge, this cooling effect would be weaker, and the
    sharp gradient in heating from the star on the dayside
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab487d">would help prevent</a></span><span><span><sup>13</sup></span></span><span>
    runaway cooling and ice formation of the sort that may have caused Earth to
    freeze over completely in the past.</span>
</p>

<p><span>So, let&#39;s take a quick look at what modern modelling predicts the actual
    climate of a tidal-locked planet with otherwise Earth-like properties should
    look like.
    <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa9f1f/meta">Temperatures across the dayside</a></span><span><span><sup>3</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    could easily vary by less than 30 </span><span>°C</span><span>, and the nightside would tend to be even more uniform. Ice could still
    cover much of the nightside, but it needn&#39;t stop exactly at the terminator;
    it could extend well into the dayside while still leaving a substantial warm
    region, it could be restricted only to some nightside pockets,
    or </span><span>the nightside could even </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1315215111">thaw out completely</a><span><span><sup>12</sup></span></span><span></span><span>. Ice cover on Earth has varied considerably over its history through
    warmer and cooler climates, and much the same would be true here.</span>

<p><span>Conversely to the image of a dayside desert, the warmest part of the
    dayside, near the center, will actually
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08463.pdf">tend to be the wettest</a></span><span><span><sup>4</sup></span></span><span></span><span>.
    Those converging winds would pull in moisture from across the planet, and
    the rising convection would encourage frequent widespread rain. Though some
    climate models briefly predicted a single permanent cyclone in the center of
    the dayside, it
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03007.pdf">now seems more likely</a></span><span><span><sup>14</sup></span></span><span></span><span> to
    be a less organized mass of stormy and rainy weather, with frequent cloud
    cover but some prospect for occasional breaks. Farther from the center of
    the dayside, rain would taper off, but the unusual atmospheric structure
    (cool winds towards the dayside near the surface, hot winds towards the
    nightside at high altitude) would encourage frequent fog.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Ocean currents could shift around heat considerably: on a planet with no
    continents, they&#39;d tend to carry heat east, north and south of the center of
    the dayside, such that rather than the typically expected &#34;eyeball&#34; pattern
    of a circular region of open ocean surrounded by ice,
    <a href="https://ostd.pku.edu.cn/research_highlights/21455.htm">you might expect</a></span><span><span><sup>15</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
    more of a lobster shape extending onto the nightside. This tendency may vary
    depending on orbital period, though, and the presence of landmasses blocking
    free flow of currents could weaken their overall influence.</span>

    now, but a more hospitable world with vast regions of tropical climate under
    eternal sunshine have their own potential as well. </span>
</p>

<p><span>But if you do like the concept of a habitable twilight strip between

    trapping of water in nightside ice, potentially allowing for drying out of
    the dayside. A dryer dayside and optionally a thinner atmosphere will weaken
    distribution of heat, allowing the center of the dayside to become hotter
    while still allowing the nightside glaciers to spread to the terminator
    (though they might not reach it evenly on all sides; expect them to more
    reliably appear to the dayside&#39;s western edge). Meltwater from these
    glaciers
    <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2013/06/aa21042-13/aa21042-13.html">could feed into</a></span><span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span></span><span> a fairly broad habitable strip; evaporated water would be carried by
    winds into the dayside, but so long as the overall supply isn&#39;t too high,
    too little would accumulate there to cause rain and would instead return
    with high-atmosphere winds to snow down on the nightside glaciers</span><span>—and the habitable region might see some sporadic rainfall or fog as well
    (there could also be slightly wetter climates where only a small region in
    the center of the dayside receives rain, separated from the glacial
    meltwater region by vast deserts). Winds over this habitable strip would
    probably be stiffer than for the more moderate climate state, but still not
    relentless gales.<br/></span>

<p><span>That about covers the main issues I wanted to cover today, but while I&#39;m
    here, I might as well go over a few other common myths and misunderstandings
    regarding tidal-locked planets (and other bodies) as well.</span>
</p>
<div>
  <h3>
    <span>Tidal-Locked Moons<br/></span>
  </h3>
  <p><span>Just as a planet can tidal-lock to its star, a moon can tidal-lock to its
      planet. Indeed, because tidal forces scale strongly with distance and
      moon-planet distances are generally far smaller than planet-star
      distances, almost all moons in the solar system are tidal-locked (the few
      known exceptions, like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(moon)">Hyperion</a></span><span>, are
      due to the influence of a much larger neighboring moon causing chaotic
      rotation), and we can probably expect this to be the norm for other star
      systems as well.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>But tidal-locking of a moon to its planet means that it points one face
      to that planet and so rotates once for each orbit of the planet. Relative
      to the star, the moon thus spins around about once per orbit of the
      planet, and so should experience a regular day and night cycle in about
      that time (because the planet is moving around the star as the moon orbits
      the planet, the moon needs to complete either slightly more or slightly
      less</span><span>—depending on the orientation of the orbits</span><span>—</span><span>than one full orbit to rotate back around to face the star again; our
      moon, for example, completes an orbit every 27.3 Earth days, but requires
      29.5 Earth days for one of its days). Tidal-locking to the planet can have
      interesting implications for the day-night cycle of the planet-facing side
      of the moon due to potential eclipses by day and reflected light from the
      planet by night, but in general the climate should resemble that of a
      planet with equivalently long days rather than that of a tidal-locked
      planet (because many moons have quite long orbital periods, these climates
      might still be quite different from Earth&#39;s).<br/></span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Tidal-locking of a moon to the planet&#39;s star rather than the planet is,
      so far as I can tell, not possible. The physics governing whether a moon
      can be kept in orbit of a planet at all (i.e., the <b>Hill radius</b>) and
      those governing the strength of tidal forces are fundamentally related
      such that any moon in any stable orbit of a planet must necessarily
      experience stronger tidal forces from the planet than from the star. The
      star might still have some influence on the moon&#39;s motion, but the balance
      of forces should always drive the moon&#39;s rotation towards locking with its
      motion around the planet and not the star.</span><span>
      such that no moon can have an orbital period longer than about 58% the
      length of the planet&#39;s year, and realistically we&#39;d expect most to have
      orbits limited to about 1/5 the length of the year. There is a point
      directly between the planet and star (the <b>L1 Lagrange point</b>) where
      their gravitational influence balances out such that a body can remain
      temporarily locked between the two, following the planet&#39;s orbit, but it&#39;s
      unstable, like a pencil balanced on its tip; any small perturbation will
      nudge the body away, such that it eventually moves off into another orbit,
      either of the planet or star.<br/></span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Incidentally, a planet can also be tidal-locked to its moon, facing one
      side towards it as it orbits around the planet. Whether or not the balance
      of tidal forces favors this is more variable, depending on the particulars
      of the relative masses and distances of the objects involved (and in
      <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/754/1/51">some cases</a></span><span><span><sup>18</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
      it may change over the planet&#39;s lifetime). If it does happen, much of what
      is true for the surface climate and conditions of a tidal-locked moon are
      true of this sort of planet as well. We can also generally expect that the
      moon is already tidal-locked to the planet at this point, such that
      they&#39;re <b>mutually tidal-locked</b>, permanently facing each other, as is
      the case for Pluto and Charon.<br/></span>
  </p>
  
  
</div>
<h3>
  <span>Polar Orientation<br/></span>
</h3>
<p><span>A common exchange I see online is one person</span><span>
    asking what might happen if a planet had one of its poles pointed towards
    its star, and another person responding that this is equivalent to
    tidal-locking. In a very abstract and conceptual sense this is a reasonable
    response, in that tidal-locking is a realistic case for the idea of having a
    part of a planet permanently facing the star, but in the strictest sense
    it&#39;s not true; a tidal-locked planet still rotates, and so still has poles,
    which should usually be somewhere along the terminator, facing at right
    angles to the star rather than towards it.</span>
</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p><span>Fair enough, but I sometimes also hear it proposed that perhaps a planet
    could actually keep one of its poles pointed towards the star if there was
    some secondary rotation turning the planet in addition to its main rotation
    around its poles. In isolation, this simply isn&#39;t geometrically possible;
    objects in 3-dimensional space can only ever rotate around one axis at a
    time. There would need to be some outside force continuously acting on the
    planet to alter its rotation to allow this to happen. Earth does experience
    some <b>precession</b></span><span>—continuous alteration of its rotational axis</span><span>—due to the influence of the other planets, and this is partially
    responsible for our cycle of cooler glacial periods and warmer interglacials
    (as shifts in axial tilt alter the amount of heating the polar regions get).
    But this is a minor shift over thousands of years. To have one of the poles
    kept pointed directly at the star at all times would, in terms of momentum
    change and energy required, be the equivalent of of stopping Earth&#39;s
    rotation completely, starting it at the same rate in the opposite direction,
    stopping the rotation again, and restarting the initial rotation every
    single orbit.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Earth has a total of 2.14 * 10</span><span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span>
    J of energy bound up in its rotation; for a planet with similar properties
    and rotation, this twice-over stopping and starting would require 4 times
    this amount of energy, 8.56 * 10</span><span><span><sup>29</sup></span></span><span>
    J, every orbit. Assuming a year as long as Earth&#39;s, that&#39;s a continuous
    power input of 2.71 * 10</span><span><span><sup>22</sup></span></span><span>
    W. The total power of sunlight striking Earth (before even accounting for
    what&#39;s promptly reflected away) is only 1.74 * 10</span><span><span><sup>17</sup></span></span><span>
    W. Thus, even assuming there was some outside influence capable of providing
    that much power in that specific way, if even a tiny portion of that energy
    was ultimately released as heat (and really we wouldn&#39;t expect it to be an
    efficient process at all), it would be plenty sufficient to push the climate
    far past the bounds of habitability and roast the surface, perhaps even
    melting the planet entirely.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Setting that scenario aside, a planet that has one of its poles facing
    towards the sun at one point of the year and then continues on its orbit
    with a constant rotational axis</span><span>—</span><span>pointing each pole towards the sun in turn at opposite seasons</span><span>—</span><span>is a possibility (Uranus is close to this orientation) and has
    <a href="https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2022/08/climate-explorations-obliquity.html">its own intriguing implications</a></span><span>
    for the surface climate.</span>
</p>

<p><span>A tidal-locked planet also doesn&#39;t need to have its poles pointed at exact
    right angles from the star at all times. Usually we would expect that,
    because the same tidal forces that cause tidal-locking also reduce axial
    tilt, a tidal-locked planet should have no tilt, but the influence of
    multiple other planets or stars
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17908">might lock one</a></span><span><span><sup>19</sup></span></span><span></span><span> into a
    &#34;Cassini state&#34; with some constant effective tilt relative to its orbit. In
    this case, the star would seem to shift north and then back south in the sky
    over the course of an orbit, and the terminator would shift as well,
    allowing for parts of the planet to have periods of day and night. Orbital
    eccentricity
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01405">can similarly</a></span><span><span><sup>20</sup></span></span><span></span><span> shift the
    terminator around over the course of the planet&#39;s orbit, with the combined
    effect of shifting orientation relative to the sun called
    <b>libration</b>.</span>
</p>
<div>
  <h3>
    <span>Tidal-Locking Limits<br/></span>
  </h3>
  <p><span>As mentioned, tidal-locking is expected to be more common in the
      habitable zones of smaller stars, because of how much stronger tidal
      forces should be in the closer habitable zones of these stars. Because of
      doubts about the habitability of tidal-locked planets</span><span>—</span><span>which, even with better and more encouraging climate modelling, still
      cannot be entirely dismissed without empirical evidence</span><span>—researchers investigating the limits of habitability around other stars
      have often found it prudent to indicate which stars are likely to have
      mostly tidal-locked planets. This is why you&#39;ll often see charts of the
      habitable zone marked with a line indicated as a &#34;tidal-locking limit&#34; or
      something similar.</span>
  </p>
  
  
  <p><span>This is a convenient way to make the implications of these charts
      readable both for those skeptical and optimistic about the prospects for
      habitable tidal-locked planets, but I think non-researchers sometimes
      misunderstand that line as an absolute limit; all planets on one side of
      the line <i>must</i> be tidal-locked and all those on the other side can
      <i>never</i> be tidal-locked.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>In reality, whether or not a particular planet becomes tidal-locked
      depends on a number of factors beyond just distance from the star. First
      off, tidal-locking takes time; usually these charts assume an age of 4.5
      billion years, presuming that we&#39;re interested in habitable worlds with
      intelligent life and that might take about as long as it did on Earth. But
      depending on why you&#39;re interested in tidal-locking, you might be
      considering much younger or older planets.</span>

  </p>
  <p><span>The time tidal-locking takes also depends strongly on the initial
      rotation rate of the planet after it has formed; usually something like
      12-13 hour days are assumed for the purpose of drawing these limits in
      habitable zone diagrams (I&#39;m not totally sure why, presumably based on
      some model of Earth&#39;s rotational evolution), but in reality it could vary
      greatly depending on random factors like the last few large impacts during
      formation. A planet might just happen to form with very slow rotation
      close to the synchronous rate, so in principle there&#39;s no strict outer
      limit where tidal-locking becomes impossible (though the further from the
      star, the more precisely the initial rotation has to happen to match the
      synchronous rate, so the chances of this happening drop pretty
      precipitously past a couple AU from a sun-mass star, for example). At the
      other extreme, a planet can only start out spinning so fast before it
      would tear itself apart with the centrifugal forces (in Earth&#39;s case the
      limit is about 2-hour days), so that gives us a more definitive inner
      limit where tidal-locking may be unavoidable (in this simple model,
      anyway).</span>

  <p><span>Finally, the planet&#39;s size and the nature of its response to tidal forces
      also have a small influence on the tidal-locking rate. The latter is a bit
      hard to pin down in a model so often represented as a single &#34;dissipation
      factor&#34;; it&#39;s generally taken to be about 12 for modern earth, but based
      on some models of the Earth&#39;s orbital evolution, may have been as high as

        cases it could act against the influence of the gravitational tides to
        prevent full tidal-locking, instead settling a planet into rotation
        slightly faster or slower than 1:1 resonance. The implications have
        seemingly been a bit garbled in interpretation; I&#39;ve heard it claimed
        that the paper implies that any planet with an atmosphere will avoid
        tidal-locking around stars more than 1/4 the sun&#39;s mass, but the paper
        itself claims that an atmosphere 10 times denser than Earth&#39;s could
        prevent tidal locking for planets in the outer edge of the habitable
        zone of stars about 28% the sun&#39;s mass, but a more Earthlike atmosphere
        likely wouldn&#39;t stop tidal-locking near the inner HZ edge even for stars
        almost 70% the sun&#39;s mass.</span></span>

              Limits at which thermal tides prevent tidal-locking for different
              atmospheric pressures (10 bar, 1 bar, and a Venus-like atmosphere
              of ~100 bar); you can see there&#39;s a nonlinear relationship between
              atmosphere and tidal-locking tendency. Dots are known exoplanets.

  <p><span>Finer complexities like the planet&#39;s climate (affecting the thermal
      tides) and ocean geometry (affecting the gravitational tides) likely have
      an influence as well, and could perhaps allow for a planet to resist
      tidal-locking for a period of its history only to fall into it later
      on.</span>

      has examined the tidal influence of multiple planets on each other in
      tightly-packed systems such as TRAPPIST-1. In these cases it seems that,
      though a planet may tidal-lock initially, the competing influences may
      cause chaotic shifts between synchronous and non-synchronous rotation, and
      substantial drift of the planet&#39;s orientation even when close to
      synchronous. Because such tightly-packed systems are expected to be common
      for small stars, this might indicate that such irregular rotation is the
      norm, rather than perfect tidal-locking. But the TRAPPIST-1 system is an
      extreme case, being near the minimum size for a main sequence star and so
      having its planets in very close orbits, with quite a few planets packed
      closely together even for a star of its type</span><span>—</span><span>the closest approach between the two innermost planets is less than twice
      the distance from the Earth to the Moon. For a more moderate case, say, a
      planet pair orbiting a star half the sun&#39;s mass, these chaotic
      interactions
      <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/472/3/3217/4082845">can still occur</a></span><span><span><sup>26</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
      but it seems to take a substantially larger neighboring planet orbiting
      quite close in something near to an orbital resonance. Planets in more
      loosely packed systems (or completely alone) could still experience tidal
      locking around any of these stars.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Still, because this mechanism is strongest for the smallest stars, it
      neatly fills the gaps left by the other mechanisms that could prevent
      tidal-locking; there is, it seems no range of stellar masses for which
      perfect 1:1 synchronous rotation is the only guaranteed outcome for
      habitable-zone planets, nor is there a specific range beyond which
      tidal-locking is forbidden, though the overall trends definitely still
      favor more frequent tidal-locking for smaller stars.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>Besides these new proposals, it&#39;s been known for some time that planets
      with some initial orbital eccentricity
      <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103507003077">could end up</a></span><span><span><sup>30</sup></span></span><span></span><span>
      locked into various other types of spin-orbit resonances, giving them a
      more regular day and night cycle</span><span>—though a quite slow one. Such resonances aren&#39;t necessarily as stable,
      though; in the habitable zones of the smallest stars, they could be
      accompanied by
      <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab845">intense tidal heating</a></span><span><span><sup>31</sup></span></span><span></span><span>, enough to partially melt their interiors and alter their tidal dynamics
      enough to break the resonance and settle into the more typical 1:1
      resonance.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p><span>As mentioned, a large, close-orbiting moon could also outcompete a star&#39;s
      influence and force the planet to tidal-lock to it rather than the star,
      giving the planet more regular days and nights. However, in any such case
      the overall interactions between star, planet, and moon will cause the
      moon&#39;s orbit to migrate towards or away from the planet (more likely the
      latter for the mutually tidal-locked state), and the moon can only migrate
      so far before escaping the planet&#39;s orbit or falling below its Roche limit
      and breaking apart. The closer the planet to the star and the stronger the
      tidal forces involved, the quicker this will happen, so Earthlike
      habitable-zone planets orbiting stars less than about half the sun&#39;s mass
