<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Tomoya Ikeda (池田友也) might not be a name you’re familiar with, but if you used a classic <em>Macintosh</em> computer at any time during in the 1990s you’re likely already familiar with some of his work.</p>

<h2 id="berkeley-systems">Berkeley Systems</h2>

<p>Tomoya Ikeda played a key part in the evolution of <em>After Dark</em>’s world famous Flying Toasters. The original prototype artwork was done by Jack Eastman, at which time Ikeda-san was brought in as a contractor to draw the final 1-bit artwork. Later versions of the toasters were drawn in colour by <em>Igor Gasowski</em> and eventually rendered and animated in 3D by <em>Jarir Maani</em>.</p>

<p>Tomoya Ikeda also did the artwork for the Fish! screensaver module in <em>Macintosh</em> <em>After Dark</em> 2.0, once again <a href="https://archive.org/details/artofdarkness00fent/page/21/mode/2up">replacing existing artwork</a> from its life as Mac Fish! by Tom &amp; Ed’s Bogus Software.</p>

<h2 id="enzan-hoshigumi">Enzan-Hoshigumi</h2>

<p>We need to travel back in time a bit, to the days before Ikeda-san was living in California. When he was in Japan he worked for a company called <em>Enzan-Hoshigumi</em>. The company name is best translated as “Computer Gangsters”.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/images/posts/tomoya-ikeda-eh-logo.png" alt="PNG" title=" "/></p>

<p>They became well known on the early <em>Macintosh</em> scene by providing collections of extremely high quality Clipart in a traditional Japanese style, Dennou Emaki (電脳絵巻 or Cyber Picture Scroll), mostly drawn by Ikeda-san. And also their MacCalligraphy package that allowed drawing of traditional Japanese calligraphy using only the <em>Macintosh</em> mouse, with the thickness and subtleties of each stroke being controlled only by the speed and movement of the mouse.</p>

<h2 id="macworld-expo">MacWorld EXPO</h2>

<p>The 1988 MacWorld EXPO held in San Francisco was attended by over 45,000 people and hosted over 400 exhibits, one of which was <em>Enzan-Hoshigumi</em>. The hot topic of the time was <a href="http://www.cornica.org/mac-reports/macworld-expo-1988/">the new, colour and expandable <em>Macintosh</em> II</a>.

<p>The Boston MacWorld EXPO event later that year also had an <em>Enzan-Hoshigumi</em> stand, accompanied by a 7x12 feet multi-panel Japanese folding screen comprised of a sheet-by-sheet assembly of thermal prints from an enlarged Tomoya Ikeda PixelPaint illustration. The screen was later <a href="https://archive.org/details/verbum203unse/page/2/mode/2up">shown at the “imagine” event</a> organised at Boston Computer Museum by Verbum Magazine.</p>

<h2 id="selected-works">Selected Works</h2>

<p>Below are some of my personal favourites.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/images/posts/tomoya-ikeda-hyperlib.jpg" alt="PNG" title="Graphic for a feature article on サイバースペースデッキ in HyperLib issue 1, Jan/Feb 1989."/></p>

<p>“The Golden Dragon” drawn in 1987 by Tomoya Ikeda (Enzan-Hoshigumi Co., Ltd.) using PixelPaint, the first full-color paint application for the <em>Macintosh</em>.</p>

<h2 id="mandala">Mandala</h2>

<p>From 1988 Ikeda-san became fascinated with mandala — the circular figures representing the universe in Hindu and Buddhist symbolism — and would go on to draw many of them. A handful have survived in print, scattered across <em>Macintosh</em> graphics books published at the time. I’ve scanned those that I’ve found so far.</p>
