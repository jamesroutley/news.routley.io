            <p>On Sunday, Andre Cronje, best known for building Yearn Finance and being a founding member of Fantom, announced he is stepping away from cryptocurrencies. The “father of DeFI” will be handing off or shutting down all of his projects. This announcement triggered a large sell off in the Fantom ecosystem and other projects associated with Cronje. The average drawdown range was 15%-20% within a few moments of the news.</p><p>The news was broken on Twitter by Cronje’s business partner, Anton Nell, who is also a storied developer in the crypto and DeFi space, and a Senior Solutions Engineer at Fantom. In the announcement, Nell said they will be shutting down around 25 apps and services on April 3rd.</p><figure><img src="https://www.thismorningonchain.com/content/images/2022/03/Cronje-Quits-Crypto--along-with-Nell-1.png" alt="Cronje Quits Crypto, along with Nell" loading="lazy" width="1468" height="838" srcset="https://www.thismorningonchain.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Cronje-Quits-Crypto--along-with-Nell-1.png 600w, https://www.thismorningonchain.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Cronje-Quits-Crypto--along-with-Nell-1.png 1000w, https://www.thismorningonchain.com/content/images/2022/03/Cronje-Quits-Crypto--along-with-Nell-1.png 1468w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Tweet From Anton Nell Announcing He and Cronje Quit Crypto</figcaption></figure><p>The pair have dealt with chronic toxic behavior from the community and have been very outspoken about the problems. In a response to the TIME Wonderland scandals, an exasperated Cronje tweeted that he “just wants to code.”</p><p>There have been scares that the pair may quit before, but this time appears to be different. In a short thread about the resignations, Nell made sure to point out:</p><blockquote>Unlike previous &#34;building in defi sucks&#34; rage quits, this is not a knee jerk reaction to the hate received from releasing a project, but a decision that has been coming for a while now.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone that supported us over the past few years.</blockquote><p>Nell listed some of the most notable projects that will be closing in April; here’s some of the list:</p><ul><li>Yearn Finance</li><li>Keep3r Network</li><li>MultiChain</li><li>ChainList</li><li>Solidly</li><li>Curve Bribe</li></ul>
