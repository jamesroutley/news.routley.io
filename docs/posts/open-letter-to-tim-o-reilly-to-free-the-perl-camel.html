    <h1>Open Letter to Tim Oâ€™Reilly to Free the Perl Camel</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Dear Tim,</p><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this letter for a while now.</p><p>There was a time (an eternity in IT age) where you did a lot for Perl and I thank you so much for this</p><p>But time passed and Perl has lost its value to your eyes.</p><p>Thanks to you  Perl inherited a logo: the camel 
But because of you, Perl actually never had a logo at all</p><p>Over the years, you never ever made the Perl camel open enough for us (Perl community) to freely use or modify.
Consequently, we are in a very uncomfortable position.</p><p>Let&#39;s just use a new logo, what&#39;s the point?</p><p>No, it&#39;s not that simple and we were never able to achieve this.</p><p>As of today, we are torn between:</p><p>- Your camel  that we are not allowed to use</p><p>- A shadowed camel  derived from your camel, still problematic even if it&#39;s de facto used everywhere</p><p>- An onion  that is not Perl but foundation logo (and not even free to use/modify)</p><p>- A raptor  that some people don&#39;t like or don&#39;t recognize well the association</p><p>- Various other attempts</p><p>It&#39;s a long standing problem with numerous discussions, attempts and continuous frustrations for us.</p><p>Now, the thing is, only YOU can fix this</p><p>And it&#39;s time.</p><p>So I&#39;m asking solemnly, free the Perl camel! 
And do it with a nice and clear license.</p><p>#FreeThePerlCamel</p><p>Please.</p><p>Thibault</p><p>Notes: it was sent to permissions@oreilly.com, I don&#39;t have an answer yet</p></div></div></div>
