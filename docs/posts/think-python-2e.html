<h2>Description</h2>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1WmXPCx"><img src="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/think_python2_medium.jpg" alt=""/></a></p>
<p><em>Think Python</em> is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming; it is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming, are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new in the second edition?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve upgraded to Python 3: All examples in the book are now Python 3, and the supporting code has been updated to run in both Python 2 and 3.</li>
<li>We’ve removed the roadblocks: Based on reader feedback, we know where people had problems, so we’ve fixed or removed the pain points.</li>
<li>Python in the browser: For beginners, one of the challenges of getting started is installing Python. For readers who don’t want to install Python right away, we provide instructions for running Python in a browser using PythonAnywhere, a free online programming environment.</li>
<li>More Python goodies: We’ve added a chapter to cover some powerful Python features that didn’t make it into the first edition, including list comprehensions and additional data structures.</li>
</ul>
